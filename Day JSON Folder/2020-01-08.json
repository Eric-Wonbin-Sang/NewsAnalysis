      "body": "<p>In early November, as the Matildas were preparing to host Chile in a two-game friendly series, head coach Ante Milicic specified what players should do in order to be part of the national team conversation. \u201cCan you play as many minutes as possible at the highest possible level?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good to say, \u2018I want to go to this league\u2019, but are you getting the minutes? Are you playing? What\u2019s better for you?\u201d</p> <p>His comments were made in reference to Sam Kerr\u2019s then-unannounced move to Chelsea FC, but another player who took the suggestion to heart \u2013 and who was conspicuously absent from November\u2019s friendlies \u2013 was Lisa De Vanna. Her move to Italian giants Fiorentina last August signalled her intent to meet Milicic\u2019s demands: to get minutes at the highest possible level.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/chelsea-reading-womens-super-league-match-report\">Chelsea complete comeback win over Reading in Sam Kerr\u2019s promising debut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The veteran striker has, so far, been vindicated by her move: she has already improved upon her goal and assist tally from her 2018-19 W-League season with Sydney FC and is rapidly approaching the same number of minutes she played all of last year, with Serie A Women only halfway completed. Her recent run has also included two appearances in the Women\u2019s Champions League against Arsenal in the round of 32, and with Fiorentina currently sitting second on Italy\u2019s ladder, the likelihood of further Champions League football is strong.</p> <p>And yet, when the Matildas squad was announced this week for February\u2019s Olympic qualifiers, De Vanna\u2019s name was omitted once again.

      "bodyText": "In early November, as the Matildas were preparing to host Chile in a two-game friendly series, head coach Ante Milicic specified what players should do in order to be part of the national team conversation. \u201cCan you play as many minutes as possible at the highest possible level?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good to say, \u2018I want to go to this league\u2019, but are you getting the minutes? Are you playing? What\u2019s better for you?\u201d His comments were made in reference to Sam Kerr\u2019s then-unannounced move to Chelsea FC, but another player who took the suggestion to heart \u2013 and who was conspicuously absent from November\u2019s friendlies \u2013 was Lisa De Vanna. Her move to Italian giants Fiorentina last August signalled her intent to meet Milicic\u2019s demands: to get minutes at the highest possible level. The veteran striker has, so far, been vindicated by her move: she has already improved upon her goal and assist tally from her 2018-19 W-League season with Sydney FC and is rapidly approaching the same number of minutes she played all of last year, with Serie A Women only halfway completed. Her recent run has also included two appearances in the Women\u2019s Champions League against Arsenal in the round of 32, and with Fiorentina currently sitting second on Italy\u2019s ladder, the likelihood of further Champions League football is strong. And yet, when the Matildas squad was announced this week for February\u2019s Olympic qualifiers, De Vanna\u2019s name was omitted once again. As Australia\u2019s all-time leading goal-scorer, De Vanna is the most significant and questionable of absences, particularly given her game-changing abilities and vast big-tournament experience. It is also an omission that squares oddly with the consistency of the rest of the squad.

But one wonders whether consistency \u2013 or incumbency \u2013 ought to outweigh form, particularly when selected players have been under-performing or out of action altogether in the past six months. Elise Kellond-Knight\u2019s return to Brisbane Roar, for example, has been hampered by a serious hamstring injury that has kept her sidelined for almost half this W-League season, making just two appearances off the bench so far.

      "bodyText": "The overt phase of the conflict between Iran and the US is probably over, British sources believe, because Tehran appeared to have chosen to miss when it failed to inflict any casualties with the missiles and rockets it fired at two military bases in Iraq. The judgment is that the attack on bases housing US troops in the early hours of Wednesday was demonstrative, given that the Iranian missiles used were believed to be accurate to a range of 50 metres and could have caused more serious damage if Tehran had wanted to. A warning from Iran also meant that coalition forces knew in time that the missiles were incoming and that steps could be taken to avoid casualties as the al-Asad and Erbil bases. \u201cPeople had enough time to take cover,\u201d a defence source said. However, the concern remains that Iran will order a more deadly covert response in the future, reflecting that a belief that despite the US killing of the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the regime in Tehran remains in the control of hardliners. For now there remains considerable relief in British circles that an extended conflict appears to have been averted after Donald Trump signalled on Wednesday that no military action would be taken in response to the overnight rocket attack. Defence sources said Trump had briefed Boris Johnson on the contents of his statement in a phone call earlier on Wednesday afternoon, to reassure the UK that immediate military action was off the table. There were a handful of British troops based in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of Iraq, alongside American forces. UK personnel moved out of the al-Asad base last year, the Ministry of Defence said earlier on Wednesday. Earlier, Johnson strongly backed the US\u2019s decision to kill Suleimani in a missile strike, telling prime minister\u2019s questions that while he could not comment on the legality of the act, \u201cmost reasonable people\u201d would think the operation was justified. Making his first parliamentary appearance of the year, the prime minister condemned the Iranian response, and called for calm. Jeremy Corbyn told PMQs that the US attack had greatly destabilised the region, accusing Johnson of being \u201cunable to stand up to President Trump\u201d because of his need for a swift post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Johnson began by condemning the Iranian strikes, which did not kill or injure any coalition forces. \u201cIran should not repeat these reckless and dangerous attacks but must instead pursue urgent de-escalation,\u201d he said. Asked by Corbyn whether he would oppose \u201cany further retaliation or escalation in violence\u201d, the PM confirmed he would, pointing to joint European calls for calm and saying he was \u201cworking solidly\u201d with allies over this. Johnson\u2019s remarks followed foreign secretary Dominic Raab describing the Iranian retaliatory strikes as \u201creckless and dangerous\u201d and calling on Tehran \u201cto pursue urgent de-escalation\u201d. At PMQs, Corbyn asked Johnson if he believed that the US operation to kill Suleimani was permitted under international law. Johnson replied: \u201cClearly the strict issue of legality is not for the UK to determine, since it was not our operation. But I think most reasonable people would accept that the United States has a right to protect its bases and its personnel.\u201d The PM further defended the operation, saying Suleimani had been a long-time instigator of violence in the region and had \u201cthe blood of British troops on his hands\u201d. Corbyn said he was not convinced by this argument: \u201cIf we stand by international law, as I\u2019m sure the government does and would want to, then surely killing somebody in a foreign territory is an illegal act and should be condemned as such. If we believe in international law, that should be the solution to the problems in the world.\u201d The Labour leader went on to condemn the US killing, and to say that Johnson was unable to challenge Trump on his actions. \u201cThis government\u2019s response is not putting the interests of this country first, but instead seems more interested in prioritising the prime minister\u2019s relationship with President Trump over the security of the region and of this country. \u201cIsn\u2019t the truth that this prime minister is unable to stand up to President Trump because he has hitched his wagon to a trade deal with the United States?\u201d Johnson responded by calling this \u201cabsolute fiction\u201d. He added: \u201cBut what I will say is that the UK will continue to work for de-escalation in the region.\u201d",

First half a little bit passive. We had enough of the ball but it was too slow, we weren\u2019t running in behind, breaking enough lines in the game. Then I felt that went into our defending. We didn\u2019t press the game in transition well enough, and that allowed them a couple of moments to break out. The goal, we\u2019ve got to defend stronger and be better in that moment. But we were still calm. Second half we were very good, they had some great blocks and the keeper made some great saves. You have to give credit to Aston Villa, they made it very difficult, their defending, they made great blocks in the box. It\u2019s set up perfectly. In a couple of weeks\u2019 time, we\u2019ll look forward to the second leg.</p> <p>I was debating before the game whether to start him [Choudhury] or not and probably my fault that I didn\u2019t. I went for a bit more football, but during the first half we could see that we weren\u2019t playing with our identity, which is aggressive and pressing. So I thought he came into the game and gave us that impetus. Second half we were much better, not just our pressing but our running off the ball was better. Over the two ties it was always going to be tough. To get to a final you\u2019re going to have to suffer. We did a little bit tonight, but we showed a great reaction in the game. Still all to play for.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e16547b8f087e8308e6b019\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T22:18:50.734Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Dean Smith has a word.</strong> He\u2019s not entirely chuffed, particularly at Ezi Konsa \u201cgetting a bit brain-dazzled\u201d before Leicester\u2019s equaliser:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It wasn\u2019t the performance I wanted to be honest. I thought Leicester were the better side. We defended brilliantly at times, scored a good goal on the counter-attack, but we have to be honest, they\u2019ve created some chances as well. I just felt we were very loose on the ball tonight. We\u2019ve got to be better on the ball against a team like Leicester. I\u2019m certainly content with the draw, it\u2019s just the performance. There were patches where we showed real good composure on the ball and moved it quickly, but we\u2019ve given away a farcical goal and that probably blots the copybook. I think Ezri [Konsa] has probably got a bit brain-dazzled at getting a yellow card. Disappointing goal and probably sums up our performance on the night in the end.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m gone. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! Brendan Rodgers is kind of happy, but also a bit unhappy: I thought we dominated the game. First half a little bit passive. We had enough of the ball but it was too slow, we weren\u2019t running in behind, breaking enough lines in the game. Then I felt that went into our defending. We didn\u2019t press the game in transition well enough, and that allowed them a couple of moments to break out. The goal, we\u2019ve got to defend stronger and be better in that moment. But we were still calm. Second half we were very good, they had some great blocks and the keeper made some great saves. You have to give credit to Aston Villa, they made it very difficult, their defending, they made great blocks in the box. It\u2019s set up perfectly. In a couple of weeks\u2019 time, we\u2019ll look forward to the second leg. I was debating before the game whether to start him [Choudhury] or not and probably my fault that I didn\u2019t. I went for a bit more football, but during the first half we could see that we weren\u2019t playing with our identity, which is aggressive and pressing. So I thought he came into the game and gave us that impetus. Second half we were much better, not just our pressing but our running off the ball was better. Over the two ties it was always going to be tough. To get to a final you\u2019re going to have to suffer. We did a little bit tonight, but we showed a great reaction in the game. Still all to play for. Dean Smith has a word. He\u2019s not entirely chuffed, particularly at Ezi Konsa \u201cgetting a bit brain-dazzled\u201d before Leicester\u2019s equaliser: It wasn\u2019t the performance I wanted to be honest. I thought Leicester were the better side. We defended brilliantly at times, scored a good goal on the counter-attack, but we have to be honest, they\u2019ve created some chances as well. I just felt we were very loose on the ball tonight. We\u2019ve got to be better on the ball against a team like Leicester. I\u2019m certainly content with the draw, it\u2019s just the performance. There were patches where we showed real good composure on the ball and moved it quickly, but we\u2019ve given away a farcical goal and that probably blots the copybook. I think Ezri [Konsa] has probably got a bit brain-dazzled at getting a yellow card. Disappointing goal and probably sums up our performance on the night in the end. I thought our defenders were excellent, got a lot of good tackles in and blocks. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from the King Power Stadium: Brendan Rodgers warned that his evolving side would not get anywhere without learning how to suffer. Aston Villa put them to the test here, as they defied the form book and a spate of injuries to inflict serious hardship on their hosts. For a long time it even looked like Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert\u2019s goal would give Villa a lead to take into the second leg in three weeks. But Kelechi Iheanacho came off the bench to plunder the goal that leaves this semi-final intriguingly poised. Much more here: Orjan Nyland is quite pleased: We fought hard, we did what we had to do, they had their chances but we did well. We\u2019ll take this result back to Villa Park and hopefully do a good performance there to take us to the final. Tyrone Mings is also quite pleased, and also the official man of the match: They scored four against us at Villa Park so to come here and put in a good defensive performance was important for our confidence and for the team. We have to start laying the foundations of being good defensively, then we\u2019ll always have goals in us. A good day in the office I think. Leicester end with 70% of possession, a 21-3 lead on shots, a 6-1 advantage in shots on target, an 11-0 supremacy on corner count, and a draw. Even that was only courtesy of a few seconds of idiocy from Aston Villa, who defended excellently with occasional moments of madness. The visitors will be happy with the result, if not the seconds of idiocy. 90+5 mins: And that\u2019s it! The two teams head to Villa Park on level terms (away goals not being a thing in the Carabao Cup) for the second leg on the 28th. 90+4 mins: Save! From the throw Soyuncu manages a header on target, which Nyland catches. 90+4 mins: Maddison looks a bit dazed as he gets to his feet, having been pushed by one defender into another. Leicester prepare a long throw. 90+3 mins: Maddison goes down just outside the Villa penalty area. The referee ignores him, as do his own teammates, who pass it around his prone form for a while before Albrighton finally has a shot, which is cleared. 90+1 mins: There\u2019ll be about three minutes of stoppage time. Can either side find a winner? Can Villa win their first corner? Will anyone else be booked for timewasting? These are our key questions. 89 mins: The game is petering out a bit. \u201cGoing down!\u201d chant the home fans, now making their own fun. 87 mins: A good spell for Villa, but they can\u2019t turn it into a shot. They have had only three of those, to Leicester\u2019s 20. 86 mins: The evening\u2019s final substitution involves Marvelous Nakamba leaving and Henri Lansbury arriving. 83 mins: Maddison dances around the left side of the area before eventually passing infield to the onrushing Albrighton, who dives, realises his dive is completely imbecilic, gets up and still manages to get a shot away. Mings once again is on hand to block. 82 mins: Villa have another free-kick, and 20 seconds later Leicester have another chance. This time they break from their own half, Vardy is played in and his low shot flies close enough to the near post for a section of the home fans to cheer as it ripples the side netting. 81 mins: Handbags! Soyuncu gets in a lather over nothing very much, and tries to encourage Hause to do likewise. Hause doesn\u2019t. 80 mins: Vardy tees up Maddison, who skews his 20-yarder into the crowd. 79 mins: Leicester\u2019s final change sees Tielemans go off, and Marc Albrighton come on. 76 mins: That really was the most ludicrous goal to concede. Konsa was booked for delaying a free-kick, and then when he finally got around to it he takes a rubbish one, playing a teammate straight into trouble, Luiz isn\u2019t aware of Choudhury\u2019s approach from behind him, and from there everything falls apart in a hurry. Konsa eventually takes his much-delayed free-kick, passing it short to Luiz. Choudhury instantly closes him down and steals the ball, Vardy passes it on to Iheanacho, and he cuts infield, past Hause and Mings, and slams past Nyland! 74 mins: Villa are bringing Indiana Vassilev on for El Ghazi, and the referee is booking Konsa for timewasting. 73 mins: Another save! Ricardo\u2019s pass into the area finds Maddison running through, and from a ludicrously unpromising angle he blasts a shot goalwards, which Nyland repels. 71 mins: Grealish gets the ball in midfield, and Evans goes to close him down. For about 30 seconds, as Grealish protects the ball, it is obvious that this will end with Grealish throwing himself to the floor, and so indeed it does. The referee very generously awards the free kick. 69 mins: And in further substitutional news, Kelechi Iheanacho is coming on for Ayoze Perez. 67 mins: Villa bring on Conor Hourihane, taking off Trezeguet. 66 mins: Leicester get into double figures for corners. This time Tielemans takes it, Nyland claims the ball and Evans heads Nyland. Free-kick. 63 mins: Save! Maddison plays a one-two with Ricardo and blasts a shot towards the near post from out on the right, but Nyland stops it! 61 mins: Maddison\u2019s right-wing free-kick is collected by Perez beyond the far post and passed back to Choudhury, who tries to gently pass the ball into the net from 18 yards and through a thicket of legs. It doesn\u2019t make it. 59 mins: Another Leicester corner. Another Hause clearing header. 58 mins: It says something about how infrequently Villa have attacked this half that having participated in their last attack El Ghazi now has a nosebleed. 57 mins: An excellent cross from Maddison, but Mings is in the right place again. Leicester have their seventh corner of the evening (Villa remain in search of their first), which is cleared. 55 mins: Villa cross the halfway line, for the first time in a long time. The move ends with Trezeguet passing to Douglas Luiz when he was probably better placed to have a shot himself, and Luiz shoots into a defender\u2019s legs. 52 mins: Tielemans blasts a shot over. El Ghazi is up front on his own for Villa, and even he is often within 15 yards of his own penalty area. 49 mins: Another Leicester corner, which is taken short, eventually crossed and headed behind for another Leicester corner, which is cleared to Trezeguet, who takes on a few Leicester players and then, when it becomes obvious he can\u2019t keep the ball, does a completely ludicrous centre-circle swallow-dive. The referee ignores him. 47 mins: Leicester win a corner. It seems to flick off Chilwell, into one Villa defender, off another and then out of play. But maybe it didn\u2019t, because the referee says it\u2019s a goal kick. 46 mins: Maddison passes to Perez and then tries to burst past him to provide an option, but he accidentally clips his team-mates ankle and they both fall over. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! Leicester get the second half started. A half-time substitution for Leicester: Hamza Choudhury is on, Dennis Praet is off. Even Leicester\u2019s best chance was created by Villa. So far it\u2019s been an impeccable away-performance-by-injury-ravaged-side, while Leicester haven\u2019t been quite good enough at the vital moments. Still, it\u2019s only quarter-time. More football imminent. 45+2 mins: The corner comes to nought, and the half is over! Leicester have hogged possession, Villa have hogged decent goalscoring chances - and taken one of them! 45+1 mins: Maddison\u2019s left-footed curler from the edge of the area looks destined for the top corner, until Mings gets his head to it. Corner. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be a minute or so. 42 mins: Villa hit the bar! It\u2019s a fabulous delivery from Grealish on the left, Schmeichel comes for it but is beaten to the ball by Konsa, who should have headed it into an empty net but can\u2019t quite keep it low enough! 41 mins: Ricardo fouls El Ghazi on Villa\u2019s left, and to make matters worse appears to be bleeding from his left cheek. The player seems furious, though whether it\u2019s about the award of that free-kick, whatever it is that caused the bleeding or having to leave the field while it\u2019s dealt with is unknown. \u201cAston Villa\u2019s choice of starting goalkeeper flies in the face of the dictum that no man is a Nyland,\u201d puns Peter Oh. 39 mins: Vardy gets the second booking of the night, for arriving to close down Konsa after the ball has gone, and thus allowing himself to get kicked by the defender in his follow-through. 37 mins: Ricardo gets away on the right, but not for the first time this evening Mings is perfectly placed at the near post to deal with the pull-back. 36 mins: El Ghazi gets the night\u2019s first booking, for wiping out Tielemans with a supremely ill-advised tackle from behind. 32 mins: That really is a spectacularly undeserved goal. Since it went in Leicester have settled straight back in to their previous rhythm, of completely dominating without quite nailing their delivery into the penalty area. And at the end of their period of dominance, Leicester concede! El Ghazi curls in an excellent cross from the left, and Guilbert gets ahead of Chilwell to poke it in at the far post! 28 mins: Ricardo Pereira plays a one-two with Vardy, but Hause stops him running onto the return ball. The last 10 minutes have been entirely one-sided. 26 mins: Space on the left of the penalty area for Chilwell, after the ball is worked well from right to left, but Mings gets to the near post to cut out the pull-back. 24 mins: Another Maddison free-kick from the left. I think he must have been shooting towards the far post, which was extremely ambitious, and the ball flies straight into touch. 22 mins: And another save! This is just too easy for Leicester, who play one pass from the back four to Perez, who turns and feeds Vardy, who runs into the area before having another low shot saved by Nyland! 19 mins: Save! The goal kick goes straight to a blue shirt. Still, it\u2019s headed back to Nakamba so it\u2019s all good, at least until he turns, lets it bounce and then nods it through to Vardy, whose low shot is saved by Nyland! 18 mins: Maddison takes another free-kick from the left, and this time Evans wins the header, but flicks it over the bar! 16 mins: It\u2019s all a bit muddled at the minute, full of people accidentally tackling teammates and hoisting balls straight to opponents. Maddison has a shot, that bounces off a defender to Nyland. 13 mins: A shot! Pereira cuts inside but his pass further infield is straight to Douglas Luiz, whose clearance is rubbish and returned with interest, leading to Perez having a shot that takes a slight deflection and zips not much beyond the far post. 10 mins: Villa\u2019s first significant attack features a cross from the left that\u2019s too high, clearing the penalty area, and a cross from the right that\u2019s too low, allowed Schmeichel to collect. 8 mins: All of Leicester\u2019s attacking, such as there has been, has been down their left. It has largely consisted over overhitting/running the ball into touch for goal kicks. 5 mins: Leicester have the ball on the halfway line, and over a minute or so are forced all the way back to Schmeichel by Villa\u2019s constant harrying. 3 mins: Maddison\u2019s free-kick from the left is won in the air by Hause, and Nyland collects. More notable was the splash of surface water that Maddison kicked up off the pitch. The King Power\u2019s drainage systems are going to get a proper workout tonight. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! They\u2019re out, and they\u2019re ready. Villa will be kicking off, any moment now. \u201cIt does seem a tad harsh to interpret Dean Smith\u2019s words - \u2018we\u2019re going to play like Man City last night\u2019 - as a bus parking exercise,\u201d writes Richard Morris as the players gather in the tunnel. \u201cThey were 3-0 up away in 38 minutes...\u201d It was more the bits about \u201cwanting to be cautious\u201d and \u201cgoing back to Villa Park\u201d, coupled with the absence of striker, which suggested he would consider a goalless draw to be absolutely grand. And here\u2019s Brendan Rodgers, who has spoken to a broadcaster who is much taller than him: We\u2019ve got two very tough games to get to the final, starting tonight. But the boys have been amazing all season in terms of the quality of their football and how they\u2019ve played, and when they have suffered a setback they\u2019ve got up and gone again. Our objective from the beginning of the season was, could we reach the final of this competition? And we\u2019ve got the opportunity to do that. [On Villa\u2019s formation] You\u2019re just looking at what they may do. It\u2019s unfortunate for Dean, he\u2019s obviously had an injury to the only striker he\u2019s had, but they\u2019ve got players who have played there before who can go into that system they probably want to play, a 5-4-1, and they\u2019ve got the talent to be a really good team and we\u2019ll have to be our best to get a result. It\u2019s the first semi-final of a cup competition for 20 years and as you can imagine everyone\u2019s excited and looking forward to the game. It\u2019s up to us to put in a performance and get the crowd going, and in the main we\u2019ve done that at home. Hopefully we can get a good performance and a victory to take into the second leg. Dean Smith has a chat. It sounds like a bus-parking exercise is in store: We haven\u2019t got any centre-forwards at the moment. Kod came off the training field ill yesterday. We\u2019ve got our forward-thinking players on the pitch and hopefully they can be as good as Manchester City were last night. We\u2019ve got no choice [but to play a false nine], as I say we haven\u2019t got any centre-forwards. That\u2019s where we are in the forward ranks at the moment. It\u2019s a balance of wanting to try and win the game and also to be cautious. We\u2019re aware it\u2019s a two-legged affair and we want to go back to Villa Park with our own fans behind us. So the headline news is that Jamie Vardy is back after a three-game absence for fatherhood and calf injury. Meanwhile it is raining, and the forecast suggests that it isn\u2019t going to stop any time soon. The team sheets have been handed in, and these were the names upon them: Leicester: Schmeichel, Soyuncu, Evans, Fuchs, Ricardo Pereira, Tielemans, Praet, Maddison, Chilwell, Vardy, Perez. Subs: Justin, Albrighton, Ward, Iheanacho, Barnes, Benkovic, Choudhury. Aston Villa: Nyland, Konsa, Mings, Hause, Guilbert, Douglas Luiz, Nakamba, Taylor, El Ghazi, Trezeguet, Grealish. Subs: Chester, Lansbury, Hourihane, Jota, Elmohamady, Kalinic, Vassilev. Referee: Chris Kavanagh. Hello world! There was a time, not all that long ago, when Leicester and Aston Villa were two, um, colossi of the League Cup. Villa won it twice in three years between 1994 and 1996, whereupon the Foxes took over and reached three finals in four seasons from 1997 to 2000, winning the first and last.

But during our research, there was a conversation a reporter had with authorities, who obtained clear evidence of things that are sort of similar to the Chicago trial evidence [In 2008, Kelly was tried and acquitted by a Chicago court on charges related to child abuse images.] Essentially, the charges were dropped and the reporter wanted to know why and the answer that they got was, \u201cWell, they\u2019re not our girls.\u201d What does that mean, exactly?

He did say yesterday that I\u2019m in the very early stages of it, which is good. The average lifespan is three years, but that\u2019s usually in older people. Rather than three years it\u2019ll hopefully be nearer 10 and hopefully I\u2019ll be on the drug trials too. He did confirm MND, but said some of the tests we did were borderline. He reckoned I could be alive for a few years yet.\u201d</p> <p>Burrow said while news of his diagnosis came as a shock, he is now determined to show the same spirit in his fight against MND as the one which made him one of rugby league\u2019s most respected players. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll win the battle, but I want to be here for a long time. I want to watch my kids grow up, and my headspace is really positive.\u201d</p> <p>Burrow hopes to meet Sam Burgess \u2013 whose father had MND before his death in 2007 \u2013 and Stephen Darby, the former Liverpool and Bradford footballer who was diagnosed with the condition in 2018, in the coming weeks. \u201cBut the amount of people who\u2019ve been in touch, famous or not, is amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to know that I\u2019ve read all their messages. For Wayne Rooney to get in touch was humbling. I messaged him back thanking him for his support, and he said he\u2019d followed my career for years. That\u2019s very overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>Burrow retired in 2017, but will return to the field on Sunday alongside former teammates Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock, Danny McGuire and Kylie Leuluai in the final minutes of the game against Bradford. \u201cMy little son is one now, so he gets to walk out on the pitch with me like my girls have before,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the guys like Kevin and Jamie have been there for me in the last few weeks.

      "bodyText": "Rob Burrow has revealed he has been told he has \u201cvery early stage\u201d motor neurone disease but is hopeful he can live for another decade. The former Leeds Rhinos and Great Britain half-back was diagnosed with the condition, for which there is no known cure, last month. Leeds host Bradford on Sunday in a sold-out pre-season game that will now be shown live on Sky Sports where the proceeds will be added to a fund that has raised more than \u00a3250,000. Burrow has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from people such as Wayne Rooney, before revealing he has been given a positive outlook following a visit to an MND research centre in Sheffield this week. \u201cI saw a professor there on Tuesday, who was great,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cThere\u2019s trials going on over here and hopefully I can get on them. He did say yesterday that I\u2019m in the very early stages of it, which is good. The average lifespan is three years, but that\u2019s usually in older people. Rather than three years it\u2019ll hopefully be nearer 10 and hopefully I\u2019ll be on the drug trials too. He did confirm MND, but said some of the tests we did were borderline. He reckoned I could be alive for a few years yet.\u201d Burrow said while news of his diagnosis came as a shock, he is now determined to show the same spirit in his fight against MND as the one which made him one of rugby league\u2019s most respected players. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll win the battle, but I want to be here for a long time. I want to watch my kids grow up, and my headspace is really positive.\u201d Burrow hopes to meet Sam Burgess \u2013 whose father had MND before his death in 2007 \u2013 and Stephen Darby, the former Liverpool and Bradford footballer who was diagnosed with the condition in 2018, in the coming weeks. \u201cBut the amount of people who\u2019ve been in touch, famous or not, is amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to know that I\u2019ve read all their messages. For Wayne Rooney to get in touch was humbling. I messaged him back thanking him for his support, and he said he\u2019d followed my career for years. That\u2019s very overwhelming.\u201d Burrow retired in 2017, but will return to the field on Sunday alongside former teammates Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock, Danny McGuire and Kylie Leuluai in the final minutes of the game against Bradford. \u201cMy little son is one now, so he gets to walk out on the pitch with me like my girls have before,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the guys like Kevin and Jamie have been there for me in the last few weeks. It\u2019ll be an emotional day. I can\u2019t thank people enough for what they\u2019ve done for me. I hope they know I\u2019d do it for them too.\u201d",

It opens with Bamber (Freddie Fox) calling the police, claiming that his father had just rung him to say that his sister Sheila, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was \u201cgoing crazy with a gun\u201d, before the call was cut off. (Sheila, incidentally, is played very well by Cressida Bonas, putting paid to the rumours of stunt casting that arose when it was announced that a woman who was once Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend had got the role).

Technically possible, the experts say, and that\u2019s good enough for the villainous DCI. But not for Stan and not for viewers, to whom it looks simply bonkers. Possibly it was slightly more complex in real life, but in that case every last detail of any complication needed to be up there on screen if we weren\u2019t just to boggle in detached disbelief thereafter, as bodies were moved, and bloodstained carpets torn up and burned alongside tainted furniture at Bamber\u2019s behest before the crime scene was fully investigated.</p> <p>There are five parts still to go, but so far it\u2019s all a little paint-by-numbers.

Meanwhile, Colin Caffell (Sheila\u2019s ex-husband and father of the murdered boys) sifts through sensationalist newspaper articles that revel in her apparent guilt.

There is no deepening of the issue of how willing the powers that be are to blame a woman, or to believe that any hint of female instability means the sufferer must be capable of multiple murder. And, as the murders themselves have little wider significance, the question of what purpose such a show can serve arises.

Some of the publicity for White House Farm says the series is designed to explore the emotional impact of the killings, but thus far it has done little of that.

The president cannot start a war without congressional authorization, and with the erratic Trump in office, Congress must make that clear by cutting off the use of funds for war with Iran. This is not just about how to de-escalate \u2013 it\u2019s about recognizing that America fundamentally needs to change its disastrous course. Even if de-escalation of the acute tensions is possible, the risks will remain as long as the United States pursues a reckless policy. America is far worse off today towards Iran and in the Middle East than it was when Trump took office \u2013 even worse off than we were on 1 January 2020. Today, Iran is advancing its nuclear program, America has suspended its anti-Isis campaign, Iraq\u2019s parliament has voted to evict US troops from the country, and we are in a dangerous military standoff with Iran. Digging out of this hole will be difficult and this administration is not capable of it. Over the long run, future administrations will need to reorient America\u2019s goals and policies. America needs to re-enter the nuclear deal and begin negotiations to strengthen it; work with partners like Iraq \u2013 without a large US troop presence \u2013 in countering potential threats like a resurgence of Isis; and adopt a broader regional policy that focuses on protecting US interests and standing up for human rights and democracy rather than picking sides in a regional civil war between dictatorships like Iran and Saudi Arabia. Achieving US goals in the region will not be possible with a mere de-escalation of tensions \u2013 we need to find a new path towards Iran and the Middle East.",

Neville said all Victorians should be alert, as dry lightning could set off \u201cfast-moving fires in other parts of Victoria\u201d. Authorities are concerned that fires in the alpine region and East Gippsland could merge during the change. Tom Delamotte from the Bureau of Meteorology said there was a strong chance of high winds bringing the cool change. \u201cWe will potentially see some gusts as high as 70km/h to 80km/h move through with the west to south-westerly change.\u201d . A spokeswoman for the SA Country Fire Service said its focus on Thursday would be on Kangaroo Island, where fires have burned through 160,000 hectares. \u201cWe\u2019re getting extra crews in today in preparation for tomorrow,\u201d the CFS said. \u201cTomorrow in terms of weather is a concern for us, with high temperatures and variable winds.\u201d Concern will be focused on the western side of the island, where fires continue to burn, and the CFS said it was seeing \u201csome breakout fires across there at the moment\u201d.

In Victoria a Country Fire Authority spokesman said Friday was \u201cthe main day of concern\u201d, with 40C temperatures forecast in the north of the state. Corryong will hit a maximum of 39C and Rutherglen 41C. The Corryong fire, which is near the border of Victoria and NSW, is a major concern for both states. In NSW a Rural Fire Service spokesman told Guardian Australia that Friday would see \u201cthe return of strong north-westerly winds and high temperatures\u201d. A late southerly change will also bring unpredictable conditions to the firegrounds at the end of Friday. Albury is forecast for a maximum of 41C on Friday, and Tumut is set for 42C.

In Sydney on Wednesday, large parts of the city registered over 200 on NSW Health\u2019s air quality index, while Wollongong reached 458, Goulburn reached 435 and Albury reached 456.

Here are some of the ways that the betting industry has become inextricably linked to football. Sponsorship Half of the Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs have a gambling sponsor on their shirt and the proportion rises to 17 out of 24 among clubs in the Championship, which is itself sponsored by Sky Bet. Labour has said it would ban gambling shirt sponsorship if elected. As well as shirts, companies frequently sponsor entire stands or stadiums. Stoke City are owned by the Coates family, who also own Bet365, hence the Bet365 stadium. Combined with pitchside hoardings, this means gambling logos are visible throughout televised football matches, even when there are no adverts. In a study of three episodes of the BBC\u2019s flagship football highlights programme Match of the Day, researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London found that gambling logos or branding appeared on screen for between 71% and 89% of the show\u2019s running time. Advertising The industry recently volunteered to stop advertising during games, the so-called \u201cwhistle-to-whistle\u201d ban, amid mounting concern that young fans were being bombarded with gambling ads. However, the voluntary ban has not always been respected and betting firms are still advertising heavily on television before and after matches. Last year, Sky Bet withdrew adverts that featured the former Arsenal and England player Paul Merson, who has spoken of his struggles with gambling addiction. Some firms are still testing the limits of advertising regulations, though.

Supran said obtaining corporate documents is \u201cone of the most important actions Congress could take to address the climate crisis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that as much as we know about fossil fuel interests\u2019 denial and delay, we\u2019ve really found those skeletons in the closet just by looking through a tiny keyhole \u2013 everything we know is based on just a few hundred documents scrounged from various sources,\u201d Supran said. \u201cFrom my perspective every indication of this evidence is once that closet door gets blown open, the skeletons are going to come tumbling out.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Walking through Washington\u2019s national airport this holiday season, travelers saw a type of advertisement that is becoming more mainstream \u2013 it pops up on social media, in commercial breaks for streaming video services, in newspapers and on the radio. A friendly-looking older woman in a hard hat beams at the camera. \u201cThanks to natural gas, the US is leading the way in reducing emissions,\u201d the sign reads.</p> <p>The ad campaign, called We\u2019re On It, is sponsored by API \u2013 which represents the oil companies that have contributed significantly to the climate crisis.</p> <p>While it\u2019s true that US climate pollution is declining in large part because of the switch from coal to natural gas, scientists say far more drastic action is needed to slow climate change. And forecasts show natural gas threatening continued progress. </p> <p>As the American public has become more aware of the climate crisis, oil companies have fought back.</p> <p>Over roughly the last three decades, five major US oil companies have spent a total of at least $3.6bn on advertisements \u2013 not counting their investments in public relations programs like sponsored beach clean-ups, or their influence through trade associations, dark money groups and campaign donations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d10f6140558520285dbc8b12c662ceb2edd34f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d10f6140558520285dbc8b12c662ceb2edd34f87/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists gather with signs outside the American Petroleum Institute during the global climate action week in Washington DC, on 23 September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists gather with signs outside the American Petroleum Institute during the global climate action week in Washington DC, on 23 September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Advertising spending has increased as politicians have paid more attention to climate change and API\u2019s campaign comes as progressive candidates bidding for the White House, such as the US senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, propose to ban fracking \u2013 a drilling method that has unlocked huge supplies of natural gas and driven down the cost of the fuel.</p> <p>Any renewed investigation from Congress could reveal more about how the industry has tried to sway public opinion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/index-html-11-zip/giv-3902nr6kTMN4WiLA/\" data-alt=\"oil corporate spending advertisement\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/index-html-11-zip/giv-3902nr6kTMN4WiLA/\">oil corporate spending advertisement</a> </figure>  <p>Investigative reporting has already shown that Exxon has known <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/oil-company-records-exxon-co2-emission-reduction-patents\">since at least the 1960s</a> that its products were causing global warming. But Exxon has fought back, saying it is the victim of \u201ca coordinated campaign perpetuated by activist groups with the aim of stigmatizing ExxonMobil\u201d.</p> <p>Exxon touts itself instead as an answer to the climate crisis. The top advertisement on Exxon\u2019s YouTube page touts research on making biofuels from algae in order to cut climate pollution, but the technique is currently prohibitively expensive, and the research represents a tiny portion of Exxon\u2019s budget.</p> <p>In response to questions from the Guardian, an Exxon spokesman, Casey Norton, said Exxon is \u201ccommitted to doing our part\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe world faces a dual challenge: meeting growing demand for energy while also reducing environmental impacts, including the risks of climate change,\u201d Norton said.</p> <p>Norton maintains that \u201call forms of energy are needed\u201d, including natural gas and renewables, although scientists have concluded humans will have to stop using fossil fuels entirely to stem the crisis.</p> <p>In the call with reporters, API\u2019s CEO took a similar stance. He acknowledged the industry has a responsibility to help slow emissions that are causing rising temperatures, but he said the demand for affordable energy is growing and American fossil fuel companies will meet it.</p> <p>Pressed to commit to any significant goal to curb emissions, Sommers said API could back some bipartisan legislation to incentivize technology that would capture carbon dioxide so that it cannot enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s legislation that\u2019s supported by far-right Republicans and far-left Democrats, but it\u2019s some place in the middle where we think we can meet and we can work together on this key priority,\u201d Sommers said.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Critics of the oil industry say the Democrat-led House should be aggressive in seeking to counter the industry\u2019s narrative. Some want Democrats to call executives into hearings and subpoena internal records about their influence campaigns \u2013 one of the most powerful tools available to Congress.</p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t happened. Instead of going directly for the oil companies, House committees have instead been holding dozens of hearings and introducing legislation about ways to cut pollution and help people affected by the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cOur oversight staff decided that OK, rather than kind of punching an industry that\u2019s already pretty down in the public image, there are plenty of other things they also needed and wanted to pursue, so subpoenaing big oil just didn\u2019t really rise to the top of the heap,\u201d the staffer said.</p> <p>Supran, who works with Harvard climate politics expert Naomi Oreskes, says they have a collection of information that could help Democrats determine which questions to ask and which documents to demand.</p> <p>\u201cHistorical record points to a number of individuals, documents, and questions that could help Congress get to the bottom of how the fossil fuel regime misled America,\u201d Supran said.</p> <p>The other route \u2013 which Democrats are already pursuing \u2013 is state lawsuits against companies. But those challenges could take much longer and aren\u2019t guaranteed to succeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a386fd6d3759f38d6d2f9a8170d2f5b3297ee8eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a386fd6d3759f38d6d2f9a8170d2f5b3297ee8eb/0_0_3000_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists hold a press conference in Manhattan and delivered a letter to then New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman in support of his investigation of ExxonMobil in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists hold a press conference in Manhattan and delivered a letter to then New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, in support of his investigation of ExxonMobil in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Robert Brulle, a visiting professor of environmental sociology at Brown University who co-authored the research tallying oil spending on ads, said the findings are just the tip of the iceberg.

They say moderate Democrats might be trying to stay civil with major companies because it will be easier to pass climate legislation with their support.</p> <p>But it\u2019s hard to imagine the industry backing substantial action that would limit oil production and use \u2013 which scientists say is required to avoid catastrophe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think what we\u2019ll find is that the fossil fuel campaigns are going to dwarf what the tobacco industry did</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Brulle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, congressional efforts have only scratched the surface of the sector\u2019s influence. In October, the oversight committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/exxon-climate-crisis-house-democrats-hearing\">reviewed evidence</a> of how much Exxon has known about the climate crisis and for how long. The Democrat-only climate committee in the Senate also held a hearing on dark money and climate change. The Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse urged his colleagues in the House to use their majority to get tougher with oil companies \u2013 subpoenaing their records if necessary.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we catch the fossil fuel industry spending money in these campaigns, we\u2019re only seeing a sliver of the total operation,\u201d Whitehouse said in a more recent interview with the Guardian. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to counter their message effectively because remember \u2013 they have a $600bn annual subsidy that they\u2019re defending, according to the [International Monetary Fund].</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that some other entity, particularly some struggling charitable organization, is going to be able to go toe-to-toe in spending and outspend them is not really feasible.\u201d</p> <p>Despite fossil fuel companies massive spending, they have continued to lose public support. Elected officials just haven\u2019t followed the shift.</p> <p>A majority \u2013 60% of Americans \u2013 want to \u201cdramatically reduce\u201d fossil fuel use in 10 or 20 years, according to Gallup. And between 2013 and 2019, the percentage of people who wanted to emphasize oil production has dropped from 46% to 28%.</p> <p>\u201cIf you take climate change seriously, then you have to think about what your path is to getting a serious climate bill,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cAnd the path to a serious climate bill requires disabling the fossil fuel industry\u2019s obstruction apparatus that has been the thing that has prevented that from happening.\u201d</p>",

Supran said obtaining corporate documents is \u201cone of the most important actions Congress could take to address the climate crisis\u201d. \u201cThe reality is that as much as we know about fossil fuel interests\u2019 denial and delay, we\u2019ve really found those skeletons in the closet just by looking through a tiny keyhole \u2013 everything we know is based on just a few hundred documents scrounged from various sources,\u201d Supran said. \u201cFrom my perspective every indication of this evidence is once that closet door gets blown open, the skeletons are going to come tumbling out.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Walking through Washington\u2019s national airport this holiday season, travelers saw a type of advertisement that is becoming more mainstream \u2013 it pops up on social media, in commercial breaks for streaming video services, in newspapers and on the radio. A friendly-looking older woman in a hard hat beams at the camera. \u201cThanks to natural gas, the US is leading the way in reducing emissions,\u201d the sign reads. The ad campaign, called We\u2019re On It, is sponsored by API \u2013 which represents the oil companies that have contributed significantly to the climate crisis. While it\u2019s true that US climate pollution is declining in large part because of the switch from coal to natural gas, scientists say far more drastic action is needed to slow climate change. And forecasts show natural gas threatening continued progress. As the American public has become more aware of the climate crisis, oil companies have fought back. Over roughly the last three decades, five major US oil companies have spent a total of at least $3.6bn on advertisements \u2013 not counting their investments in public relations programs like sponsored beach clean-ups, or their influence through trade associations, dark money groups and campaign donations. Advertising spending has increased as politicians have paid more attention to climate change and API\u2019s campaign comes as progressive candidates bidding for the White House, such as the US senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, propose to ban fracking \u2013 a drilling method that has unlocked huge supplies of natural gas and driven down the cost of the fuel. Any renewed investigation from Congress could reveal more about how the industry has tried to sway public opinion. Investigative reporting has already shown that Exxon has known since at least the 1960s that its products were causing global warming. But Exxon has fought back, saying it is the victim of \u201ca coordinated campaign perpetuated by activist groups with the aim of stigmatizing ExxonMobil\u201d. Exxon touts itself instead as an answer to the climate crisis. The top advertisement on Exxon\u2019s YouTube page touts research on making biofuels from algae in order to cut climate pollution, but the technique is currently prohibitively expensive, and the research represents a tiny portion of Exxon\u2019s budget. In response to questions from the Guardian, an Exxon spokesman, Casey Norton, said Exxon is \u201ccommitted to doing our part\u201d. \u201cThe world faces a dual challenge: meeting growing demand for energy while also reducing environmental impacts, including the risks of climate change,\u201d Norton said. Norton maintains that \u201call forms of energy are needed\u201d, including natural gas and renewables, although scientists have concluded humans will have to stop using fossil fuels entirely to stem the crisis. In the call with reporters, API\u2019s CEO took a similar stance. He acknowledged the industry has a responsibility to help slow emissions that are causing rising temperatures, but he said the demand for affordable energy is growing and American fossil fuel companies will meet it. Pressed to commit to any significant goal to curb emissions, Sommers said API could back some bipartisan legislation to incentivize technology that would capture carbon dioxide so that it cannot enter the atmosphere. \u201cThat\u2019s legislation that\u2019s supported by far-right Republicans and far-left Democrats, but it\u2019s some place in the middle where we think we can meet and we can work together on this key priority,\u201d Sommers said. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Critics of the oil industry say the Democrat-led House should be aggressive in seeking to counter the industry\u2019s narrative. Some want Democrats to call executives into hearings and subpoena internal records about their influence campaigns \u2013 one of the most powerful tools available to Congress. But that hasn\u2019t happened. Instead of going directly for the oil companies, House committees have instead been holding dozens of hearings and introducing legislation about ways to cut pollution and help people affected by the climate crisis. \u201cOur oversight staff decided that OK, rather than kind of punching an industry that\u2019s already pretty down in the public image, there are plenty of other things they also needed and wanted to pursue, so subpoenaing big oil just didn\u2019t really rise to the top of the heap,\u201d the staffer said. Supran, who works with Harvard climate politics expert Naomi Oreskes, says they have a collection of information that could help Democrats determine which questions to ask and which documents to demand. \u201cHistorical record points to a number of individuals, documents, and questions that could help Congress get to the bottom of how the fossil fuel regime misled America,\u201d Supran said. The other route \u2013 which Democrats are already pursuing \u2013 is state lawsuits against companies. But those challenges could take much longer and aren\u2019t guaranteed to succeed. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Robert Brulle, a visiting professor of environmental sociology at Brown University who co-authored the research tallying oil spending on ads, said the findings are just the tip of the iceberg. Brulle has previously found that more than $2bn was spent lobbying Congress on climate legislation between 2000 and 2016. He says lawmakers should investigate the oil industry the way the former congressman Henry Waxman took on tobacco companies in the 1990s. \u201cI think what we\u2019ll find is that the fossil fuel campaigns are going to dwarf what the tobacco industry did. It\u2019s an order of magnitude larger,\u201d Brulle said. Some accuse Democrats of fearing a backlash from the oil industry \u2013 which still donates to Democratic campaigns. They say moderate Democrats might be trying to stay civil with major companies because it will be easier to pass climate legislation with their support. But it\u2019s hard to imagine the industry backing substantial action that would limit oil production and use \u2013 which scientists say is required to avoid catastrophe. So far, congressional efforts have only scratched the surface of the sector\u2019s influence. In October, the oversight committee reviewed evidence of how much Exxon has known about the climate crisis and for how long. The Democrat-only climate committee in the Senate also held a hearing on dark money and climate change. The Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse urged his colleagues in the House to use their majority to get tougher with oil companies \u2013 subpoenaing their records if necessary. \u201cWhen we catch the fossil fuel industry spending money in these campaigns, we\u2019re only seeing a sliver of the total operation,\u201d Whitehouse said in a more recent interview with the Guardian. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to counter their message effectively because remember \u2013 they have a $600bn annual subsidy that they\u2019re defending, according to the [International Monetary Fund]. \u201cThe idea that some other entity, particularly some struggling charitable organization, is going to be able to go toe-to-toe in spending and outspend them is not really feasible.\u201d Despite fossil fuel companies massive spending, they have continued to lose public support. Elected officials just haven\u2019t followed the shift. A majority \u2013 60% of Americans \u2013 want to \u201cdramatically reduce\u201d fossil fuel use in 10 or 20 years, according to Gallup. And between 2013 and 2019, the percentage of people who wanted to emphasize oil production has dropped from 46% to 28%. \u201cIf you take climate change seriously, then you have to think about what your path is to getting a serious climate bill,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cAnd the path to a serious climate bill requires disabling the fossil fuel industry\u2019s obstruction apparatus that has been the thing that has prevented that from happening.\u201d",

He told police after his arrest that society would be better off if disabled people \u201cdisappeared\u201d. He allegedly broke into the care facility in the early hours of 26 July 2016 and fatally stabbed 10 women and nine men, aged 19- to 70-years-old. He then drove to the nearest police station to hand himself in. Police found a bag inside his car containing knives and other sharp-edged tools, and the seats were covered in blood. Uematsu had been forcibly hospitalised in early 2016 after police contacted him about a letter he had sent to the speaker of the lower house of Japan\u2019s parliament urging the government to introduce euthanasia for people with disabilities. He was released after 12 days when doctors deemed he did not pose a threat to others. Since his arrest, Uematsu has expressed no remorse, telling the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper that people with mental disabilities \u201chave no heart\u201d, and \u201cthere\u2019s no point in living\u201d for them. \u201cI had to do it for the sake of society,\u201d he said of the attack. The identities of most of the victims have not been revealed at the requests of their families \u2013 a reflection, critics say, of the stigma and shame people with disabilities still suffer in Japan. But one woman whose 19-year-old daughter, Miho, was among those killed, told public broadcaster NHK that the trial had prompted her to speak out. Photographs of Miho, who was autistic and unable to speak, showed her smiling when she entered junior high school and soon after she started living at the care home, months before she was killed. \u201cShe loved music, she lived as energetically as she could,\u201d her mother told NHK. \u201cHer name was Miho. I want that public as proof that she existed,\u201d she said. \u201cI want people to know who she was.\u201d At the time, the Sagamihara attack was the worst mass killing in Japan since the second world war. An arson attack on an anime studio in Kyoto last July killed 36 people. Uematsu faces the death penalty if convicted on some of the six charges, including murder. A verdict is expected on 16 March.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and the new European commission president have had a positive first meeting about the next round of Brexit talks in which they discussed their aspirations for a deal based on friendly cooperation, shared history and interests and values, Downing Street has said. Both sides made a concerted effort to put the bitter divisions of the past three years aside, with Ursula von der Leyen describing the meeting as the start of a new era of \u201cold friends and new beginnings\u201d. She called on both sides to focus on mutual interests and both leaders agreed there could be common ground on climate change, human rights and security. A spokesperson said Johnson made it clear in the meeting that the UK would not be requesting an extension to the transition period at the end of December. Echoing Johnson\u2019s electoral theme about his rush to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, he told the commission leader that he wanted to seal \u201ca Canada-style free trade agreement as soon as possible after January 31\u201d. \u201cHe said the UK wanted a positive new UK and EU partnership, based on friendly cooperation, our shared history, interests and values. \u201cThe PM reiterated that we wanted a broad free-trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas,\u201d said the spokesperson. However, in a speech earlier in London Von der Leyen said it would be impossible for the UK to negotiate a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of Brexit within the timeframe set by Johnson. Unless Britain accepted a level playing field in the UK and the EU\u2019s trade positions after Brexit, there would inevitably be barriers for British manufacturing, she said in a speech at the London School of Economics before the summit. At the same event, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned in an impromptu exchange that leaving the EU was not a simple process and involved the renegotiation of \u201c600 international agreements\u201d as well as a new free-trade agreement. Von der Leyen said: \u201cIt is basically impossible to negotiate all [of the areas].\u201d She also warned that tariff, quota-free access to the single market came with strings attached and Britain would have to agree to level playing field rules on workers\u2019 rights, the environment and anti-dumping measures. She warned against a fantasy in which the UK has a hard exit but retains all the benefits. \u201cThe more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be,\u201d Von der Leyen said. \u201cWithout an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership. \u201cWithout the freedom of movement of people, you cannot have the free movement of capital, goods and services. Without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid, you cannot have highest-quality access to the world\u2019s largest single market.\u201d Johnson has already indicated he wants to break with EU rules and regulations to achieve the clear sovereignty for which he believes Brexit supporters voted. Von der Leyen said the EU was ready to negotiate \u201ca truly ambitious and comprehensive new partnership\u201d with the UK and would work \u201cday and night\u201d to make best use of the time the two sides had. With the prime minister ruling out any extension to the transition period, Von der Leyen said that in practice the UK had \u201cnine to 10 months at most\u201d to get a deal in time for it to be ratified by 31 December. \u201cTherefore it is not an all or nothing [in the trade talks], it is a question of priorities,\u201d she said. In addition to laying out the EU\u2019s position, she mounted a charm offensive, telling the audience how she loved her time as a student at the LSE and loved Britain and its humour. She warned that Brexit day would be hard for those who wished to remain in the EU. \u201cThis will be a tough and emotional day,\u201d she said, adding that both sides needed to be optimistic about the future beyond 31 January. \u201cWhen the sun rises again on 1 February the EU and the UK will still be the best of friends and partners,\u201d she said. She said both sides had to \u201cweave together a new way forward\u201d even though talks would be tough and \u201ceach side would do what was best for them\u201d. She said the EU was ready to negotiate a frictionless trade deal that involved no barriers to manufacturers and a partnership that went \u201cwell beyond\u201d trade. \u201cWe are ready to design a new partnership with zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping\u201d and \u201ca partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope\u201d, she said. The list of elements beyond trade, which she said was not exhaustive, included \u201cclimate action, data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space [and] financial services to security\u201d. She added: \u201cWe are ready to work day and night to get as much of this done within the timeframe we have. \u201cNone of this means it will be easy, but we start this negotiation from a position of certainty, goodwill, shared interests and purpose.

      "bodyText": "Seven UK betting websites are live-streaming FA Cup matches as part of a TV and media rights deal struck by the Football Association that runs until 2024, despite the governing body having announced an end to all sponsorships with gambling companies in 2017. Campaigners against the enormous growth of gambling companies\u2019 association with football have criticised the deal, which offers the ability to watch live FA Cup matches exclusively on betting sites, usually if you have had a bet on that site or have an account with money in it. In the UK, Bet365, the giant gambling company owned by the Coates family, who also own Stoke, has the rights as part of the deal, along with Betfair, William Hill, Coral, Ladbrokes, Unibet and Paddy Power. The FA does not sell the rights to these companies directly; it has sold global betting rights on the FA Cup to the marketing company IMG for a reported $4m (\u00a33.1m) a year and IMG sells the packages on. In addition to the seven companies that have bought the rights to show the matches in the UK, IMG has sold similar streaming rights to other betting sites internationally; the company declined to provide a list of those companies. Although the deals have been running since the start of last season, the FA is facing particular criticism now because it used the third-round matches last weekend as an opportunity to promote its \u201ctake a minute\u201d campaign to improve mental health. The FA emphasised that the media deals were concluded, via IMG, before the decision was taken to sever sponsorships with betting companies. The governing body has said it will review the sale of betting rights to FA Cup matches before the rights deals are renewed for the 2024-25 season. \u201cThe FA agreed a media rights deal with IMG in early 2017, part of which permits them to sell the right to show live footage or clips of FA Cup matches to bookmakers,\u201d an FA spokesman said. \u201cThis deal was agreed before we made a clear decision on the FA\u2019s relationship with gambling companies in June 2017 when we ended our partnership with Ladbrokes. \u201cWe will review this element of the media rights sales process ahead of tendering rights to the new cycle from the 2024-25 season onwards. Leagues and clubs continue to govern their own relationships with gambling companies.\u201d When the FA ended its official betting partnership with Ladbrokes and all sponsorships with betting companies in May 2017, it said it followed a three-month review of its approach as football\u2019s governing body \u201ctaking betting sponsorship, whilst being responsible for the regulation of sports betting within the sport\u2019s rules\u201d.

Barton then stated that he had a gambling addiction and pointed to betting companies\u2019 increasingly heavy involvement in sponsorship and other associations with football, including the FA\u2019s high-profile partnership with Ladbrokes. IMG packages rights for betting companies with live streaming through its IMG Arena operation, which says on its website: \u201cWe specialise in bringing sport and the sports betting industry closer together via our federation services and world-class sports content.\u201d Sports included in the IMG Arena betting deals include football, tennis, golf, basketball and T20 cricket, with \u201cmore than 22,800 events, which are served to more than 100 operators worldwide\u201d. Dr Darragh McGee of the University of Bath, who has conducted extensive research on the consequences for some men\u2019s mental and financial health of excessive gambling on football, said this sale of FA Cup broadcasting rights was \u201can alarming new dimension in the \u2018gamblification\u2019 of football, which is already saturated with targeted advertising campaigns, sponsorship of high-profile clubs, and naming rights to stadia and supporter events. \u201cIn effect, it means that Bet365 and other betting companies can become primary gatekeepers for public access to live sporting coverage.

Publicly, Starmer talks of maintaining Labour\u2019s radicalism, and his team privately extols his commitment to public investment.

What of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/nov/29/what-is-the-green-new-deal\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a>?

And her fixation with towns is all the more important after the party\u2019s devastating losses in the north and Midlands. But she too faces questions on her policy prospectus and on her passionate cry: \u201cHow dare we tell working-class people what\u2019s good for them.\u201d Listening after a devastating defeat is clearly crucial. But surely the point of politics is to offer a plan that will improve people\u2019s lives \u2013 though, to be effective, it should be married to their lived experiences, and explained in a way that isn\u2019t patronising or elitist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/labour-leadership-where-do-the-candidates-stand\">Labour leadership: where do the candidates stand?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jess Phillips\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/03/jess-phillips-poised-to-enter-labour-leadership-contest\" title=\"\">campaign</a> extols her background and promises a policy offer focusing on social care, childcare and the climate crisiswith a theme of priorities and \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d. But with backers firmly on the Blairite wing, it would prove a decisive turnaround in the membership\u2019s attitudes for them to accept an inevitable decisive shift to the right. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/18/emily-thornberry-throws-her-hat-into-ring-for-labour-leadership\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry</a>\u2019s sassy charisma and loyalty to Corbyn during the 2016 coup won her many admirers, and she was once Len McCluskey\u2019s favoured successor. Today she faces the same questions as Starmer, and is unlikely to make the ballot. As is Clive Lewis, who won\u2019t get the MPs and unions needed to pass the threshold. He is using the campaign to flag-wave for his passionate priorities: like a so-called progressive alliance, democratising the party and challenging what he sees as an intolerant machine politics. He deserves a bright political future.</p> <p>The left\u2019s flagbearer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/rebecca-long-bailey-defends-corbyns-legacy-as-she-launches-labour-leadership-bid\" title=\"\">Rebecca Long-Bailey</a>, had a slow start for ironic reasons: her fear of being boxed in as \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d made her reluctant to hire figures associated with the project, and there are few experienced leftwingers ready to serve who are not. And while her first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\" title=\"\">Guardian article</a> read like it was written by committee, her tub-thumping launch piece in Tribune energised the left\u2019s base. Bright and details-focused, a working-class woman from a leave community, her impressive first interview on the BBC\u2019s Today programme was cheerful and full of willingness to accept Labour\u2019s major errors: on Brexit, on antisemitism, on not having a coherent vision, not having the public\u2019s trust, not rebutting a vicious media onslaught. But her pitch must go beyond being \u201cCorbyn without the baggage\u201d or a one-more-heave approach: her team needs a detailed, coherent strategy for why a compelling socialist vision can win in 2024 that decisively breaks with what came before. Some fear a return to the worst machine politics of the Corbyn era: to convince doubters, her team should emphasise a pluralistic, let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom style. Indeed, elements from the current leadership who are wedded to such machine politics tried to encourage Labour chair Ian Lavery to stand and are now promoting <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/barry-gardiner-labour-leadership-bid_uk_5e15d8edc5b6c7b859d39afb?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHu0cR3zJeiKCNT7wkjd6OFxkrvKgYwXgiAcln-2GPi7a4rHntTTqJ2ln_cOLR1s7dFBu9ZNNGGLt5uZ1XfmTj4lWVR6Z37IGRxZVMK-1vzHGs3Ddi8OZ_F3OXD6H_71ksErp4uMsFSrAkB5Vb18Op2u7ZAzdyG6HsPfdgXAiVfX\" title=\"\">Barry Gardiner</a> as a candidate, fearing they cannot control Long-Bailey.

But here are the questions Starmer and other candidates must answer. Will tax rises on the top 5% and corporation tax be maintained? What of scrapping tuition fees? What of public ownership, not just of rail, but of other utilities? What of the Green New Deal? Any Labour leader will face a campaign to purge Corbynism from Labour. Would Starmer withstand such pressure? He has now accepted that the election result ends the debate on Brexit, and that it must now happen; but how does he answer the likes of Caroline Flint, who lost her Don Valley seat and does not believe he can win back leave-voting areas? These questions need compelling answers. Lisa Nandy\u2019s advantages are that she resisted Labour\u2019s shift towards a referendum, and that she is a woman and a solid media performer. And her fixation with towns is all the more important after the party\u2019s devastating losses in the north and Midlands. But she too faces questions on her policy prospectus and on her passionate cry: \u201cHow dare we tell working-class people what\u2019s good for them.\u201d Listening after a devastating defeat is clearly crucial. But surely the point of politics is to offer a plan that will improve people\u2019s lives \u2013 though, to be effective, it should be married to their lived experiences, and explained in a way that isn\u2019t patronising or elitist. Jess Phillips\u2019s campaign extols her background and promises a policy offer focusing on social care, childcare and the climate crisiswith a theme of priorities and \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d. But with backers firmly on the Blairite wing, it would prove a decisive turnaround in the membership\u2019s attitudes for them to accept an inevitable decisive shift to the right. Emily Thornberry\u2019s sassy charisma and loyalty to Corbyn during the 2016 coup won her many admirers, and she was once Len McCluskey\u2019s favoured successor. Today she faces the same questions as Starmer, and is unlikely to make the ballot. As is Clive Lewis, who won\u2019t get the MPs and unions needed to pass the threshold. He is using the campaign to flag-wave for his passionate priorities: like a so-called progressive alliance, democratising the party and challenging what he sees as an intolerant machine politics. He deserves a bright political future. The left\u2019s flagbearer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, had a slow start for ironic reasons: her fear of being boxed in as \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d made her reluctant to hire figures associated with the project, and there are few experienced leftwingers ready to serve who are not. And while her first Guardian article read like it was written by committee, her tub-thumping launch piece in Tribune energised the left\u2019s base. Bright and details-focused, a working-class woman from a leave community, her impressive first interview on the BBC\u2019s Today programme was cheerful and full of willingness to accept Labour\u2019s major errors: on Brexit, on antisemitism, on not having a coherent vision, not having the public\u2019s trust, not rebutting a vicious media onslaught. But her pitch must go beyond being \u201cCorbyn without the baggage\u201d or a one-more-heave approach: her team needs a detailed, coherent strategy for why a compelling socialist vision can win in 2024 that decisively breaks with what came before. Some fear a return to the worst machine politics of the Corbyn era: to convince doubters, her team should emphasise a pluralistic, let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom style. Indeed, elements from the current leadership who are wedded to such machine politics tried to encourage Labour chair Ian Lavery to stand and are now promoting Barry Gardiner as a candidate, fearing they cannot control Long-Bailey. It is entirely self-destructive. All candidates have pressing questions to answer, and they must be addressed to a membership desperate to end Tory rule while offering an unquestioningly inspiring alternative. A break with the past, yes, but a genuine one \u2013 not a return to the discredited compromise of 2015, or irrelevant nostalgia for 1997. \u2022Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

A consortium of major lenders to the company, understood to include HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, have hired the advisory firm FTI Consulting, which has previously worked with lenders to troubled high street businesses Debenhams and New Look as well as the collapsed Thomas Cook. FTI is expected to take several weeks to conclude the business review that could result in Ted Baker\u2019s lenders tightening the terms on which they provide debt to the retailer, according to Sky News, which first reported the appointment. The review raises fears for Ted Baker, which is thought to be close to reaching the ceiling on its borrowing agreements for \u00a3180m of debt after a difficult period of trading. In October, debts were \u00a3130m and since then trading has been poor.

That, at least, was the thinking of a team of researchers who set themselves the task of working out how the marine molluscs know how far away prey is before launching their explosive, tentacled attacks. The puzzle has occupied an admittedly select group of scientists because of the cuttlefish\u2019s unusual ability to scope out a 360-degree field of vision by moving its eyes independently. Dr Trevor Wardill, who led the work at the University of Minnesota, said that given the complexities of cuttlefish vision, it was considered unlikely that the animals judged distance in the same way as humans.

Vicki Guster-Hines and Domineca Neal, senior directors working for McDonald\u2019s in Dallas, allege that discrimination at the company worsened under the former chief executive Steve Easterbrook, who took over the company in 2015. UK-born Easterbrook was ousted from the firm last year after it was revealed he had been involved in a romantic relationship with a colleague that broke company rules. He left with over $37m in stock awards and a severance deal of $675,000. During Easterbrook\u2019s tenure, Guster-Hines and Neal allege, McDonald\u2019s \u201cconducted a ruthless purge\u201d of high-ranking African Americans and shifted advertising away from black customers. The suit claims the number of African Americans in the top ranks of McDonald\u2019s operations fell to seven last year from 42 in 2014. The two executives allege McDonald\u2019s created a \u201chostile and abusive work environment\u201d for black executives and franchisees. Guster-Hines and Neal were demoted from vice-president to senior director positions in July 2018 as part of a broader corporate restructuring conducted under Easterbrook. They are seeking compensation following those demotions, claiming that they occurred as a result of discrimination. The suit also names the company\u2019s current chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, and Charles Strong, the Chicago-based west zone president for McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIn shocking ways difficult to overstate, McDonald\u2019s under Easterbrook and Kempczinski declared war against the African American community,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. McDonald\u2019s said it disagreed with the characterization of the company\u2019s behavior. In a statement, it said 45% of its corporate officers and all of its field vice-presidents are people of color. \u201cAt McDonald\u2019s, our actions are rooted in our belief that a diverse, vibrant, inclusive and respectful company makes us stronger,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhile we disagree with characterizations in the complaint, we are currently reviewing it and will respond to the complaint accordingly.\u201d The suit comes as McDonald\u2019s conducts a broad examination of its corporate culture in the wake of Easterbrook\u2019s departure. According to the Wall Street Journal, under Easterbrook staff allege the company culture was characterized by \u201clate-night socializing with some executives and staffers at bars and flirtations with female employees\u201d. The suit, filed on Tuesday in McDonald\u2019s hometown of Chicago, is the latest in a series of racial and sexual harassment cases that have been brought against the company. In 2015, shortly after Easterbrook\u2019s appointment, 10 former McDonald\u2019s workers in Virginia filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the fast-food chain, claiming they were fired because the stores had \u201ctoo many black people\u201d. Last year Brazilian authorities opened an investigation into allegations of widespread racism at the company\u2019s operations in Brazil. And in November the company was sued and faced industrial action by staff for an allegedly \u201cpervasive\u201d culture of sexual harassment at its restaurants in Michigan.",

Arfon Jones, a veteran Welsh police officer and the North Wales police and crime commissioner, has expressed grave concern about the deployment of the surveillance technology at Sunday\u2019s clash between Cardiff City and Swansea City. Civil liberties and fan groups have also criticised South Wales police\u2019s decision to train cameras on supporters and employ facial recognition on them at the Cardiff City stadium. Jones, who served as a police officer in North Wales for 30 years, described the plans as \u201cdisproportionate\u201d. He also accused the South Wales force of being engaged in a \u201cfishing expedition where, once again, football fans are being unfairly targeted in a way that supporters of other sports are not\u201d.

He said: \u201cWe are deploying automated facial recognition to prevent offences by individuals who are wanted for questioning for football-related offences or have been convicted of football-related criminality and are now subject to football banning orders that preclude them from attending. \u201cFootball banning orders are issued by the court to those who have misbehaved at a previous football game and hence this provides us with a clear rationale in our strategy to prevent any crime and disorder.\u201d He said the data of all those captured by the technology on Sunday who were not on the \u201cwatch list\u201d would be instantaneously deleted. Valentine stressed that under a high court ruling in September 2019, the use of facial recognition technology was legally justified and proportionate. But the Football Supporters\u2019 Association Wales said the use of facial recognition treated fans like criminals. Vince Alm, the association\u2019s spokesman, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that police are targeting us with facial recognition surveillance again. Fans coming out for a local football match, including hundreds of families and children, will be treated like they\u2019re in a police line-up and have their faces scanned without their consent.\u201d The civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch has called for an immediate ban on facial recognition surveillance in the UK.

      "body": "<p>Sidney Holt, who has died aged 93, aimed to live long enough to save the great whale species from extinction \u2013 something he had been fighting for since being appointed to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1961 to give scientific advice on annual catch limits for each hunted species.</p> <p>He managed to curtail the slaughter but did not succeed in halting it until 26 December 2018, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/26/japan-confirms-it-will-quit-iwc-to-resume-commercial-whaling\" title=\"\">Japan left the International Whaling Commission</a> and announced it would no longer kill whales in Antarctica, at last guaranteeing the great whales a sanctuary where their seriously depleted numbers might continue to recover.</p> <p>Holt\u2019s battle to save the whales began after he had established himself as a world-renowned scientist in the field of fisheries, having co-written a book published in 1957 on how to calculate fish stocks and therefore work out sustainable catches. The book, On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations, was a collaboration with a fellow UK Ministry of Fisheries and Food (Maff) scientist, Ray JH Beverton. It became the must-have textbook for fisheries scientists.</p> <p>Holt had worked out the equations that formed the core of the book while camping on Rannoch Moor in Scotland, waiting for wood ants to return to their nests. He had been sent out on a motorbike to scout for areas of Scotland that could be turned into nature reserves, and out of curiosity began weighing the ants when they set off to forage in the morning. He marked them with tiny spots of green paint so he could identify individuals when they returned and weigh them again.</p> <p>He posted off the fishery equations to his co-author and four years later the ministry published the results, establishing the international reputations of both men.</p> <p>Holt, who had an intense curiosity, believed in spreading his knowledge and had already represented the UK at various international conferences on fishing. Four years before the book was published he was asked by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to run a training course in Istanbul, after which he was recruited to work full time.</p> <p>Holt and his wife, Nan (nee Meadmore), known as Judy, whom he married in 1947, went to live in Rome, and he spent the following 25 years working for the UN. His reputation continued to grow as he produced more than 400 scientific papers and articles. He served as director of the fisheries resources and operations division of the FAO in Rome, secretary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and director of Unesco\u2019s marine sciences division in Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19b6f7d85a7fe3cd4f03bc4f8a05b67ce1a8b572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19b6f7d85a7fe3cd4f03bc4f8a05b67ce1a8b572/0_279_5119_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tail of a Humpback whale in Antarctica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tail of a humpback whale in Antarctica, where the Japanese finally stopped whaling in December 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Bloom/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1961, as a part-time additional job, he became one of the so-called \u201cthree wise men\u201d \u2013 independent scientists advising the IWC, which was intent on devising sustainable limits to catches of great whales. Although he officially retired from the UN in 1979, he continued work to limit the slaughter of whales, first for the IWC until 2002, and then as a scientific adviser to various anti-whaling countries, including the Seychelles and France, as well as environment groups.</p> <p>After retiring from the UN he became first director of the International Ocean Institute in Malta and helped draft the Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982).</p> <p>He won many accolades for his work on protecting marine mammals, animal welfare and fisheries science, including the Global 500 award of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Blue Planet award of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).</p> <p>Sidney was born in the East End of London. His father, also Sidney Holt, was a briar-pipe maker, and his mother, Ethel (nee Fryatt), had worked in a confectionery factory. They moved to Colindale and Sidney won a scholarship to Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s boys\u2019 school before going to Reading University, where he got a first-class degree in biology.

      "bodyText": "Sidney Holt, who has died aged 93, aimed to live long enough to save the great whale species from extinction \u2013 something he had been fighting for since being appointed to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1961 to give scientific advice on annual catch limits for each hunted species. He managed to curtail the slaughter but did not succeed in halting it until 26 December 2018, when Japan left the International Whaling Commission and announced it would no longer kill whales in Antarctica, at last guaranteeing the great whales a sanctuary where their seriously depleted numbers might continue to recover. Holt\u2019s battle to save the whales began after he had established himself as a world-renowned scientist in the field of fisheries, having co-written a book published in 1957 on how to calculate fish stocks and therefore work out sustainable catches. The book, On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations, was a collaboration with a fellow UK Ministry of Fisheries and Food (Maff) scientist, Ray JH Beverton. It became the must-have textbook for fisheries scientists. Holt had worked out the equations that formed the core of the book while camping on Rannoch Moor in Scotland, waiting for wood ants to return to their nests. He had been sent out on a motorbike to scout for areas of Scotland that could be turned into nature reserves, and out of curiosity began weighing the ants when they set off to forage in the morning. He marked them with tiny spots of green paint so he could identify individuals when they returned and weigh them again. He posted off the fishery equations to his co-author and four years later the ministry published the results, establishing the international reputations of both men. Holt, who had an intense curiosity, believed in spreading his knowledge and had already represented the UK at various international conferences on fishing. Four years before the book was published he was asked by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to run a training course in Istanbul, after which he was recruited to work full time. Holt and his wife, Nan (nee Meadmore), known as Judy, whom he married in 1947, went to live in Rome, and he spent the following 25 years working for the UN. His reputation continued to grow as he produced more than 400 scientific papers and articles. He served as director of the fisheries resources and operations division of the FAO in Rome, secretary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and director of Unesco\u2019s marine sciences division in Paris. In 1961, as a part-time additional job, he became one of the so-called \u201cthree wise men\u201d \u2013 independent scientists advising the IWC, which was intent on devising sustainable limits to catches of great whales. Although he officially retired from the UN in 1979, he continued work to limit the slaughter of whales, first for the IWC until 2002, and then as a scientific adviser to various anti-whaling countries, including the Seychelles and France, as well as environment groups. After retiring from the UN he became first director of the International Ocean Institute in Malta and helped draft the Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982). He won many accolades for his work on protecting marine mammals, animal welfare and fisheries science, including the Global 500 award of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Blue Planet award of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). Sidney was born in the East End of London. His father, also Sidney Holt, was a briar-pipe maker, and his mother, Ethel (nee Fryatt), had worked in a confectionery factory. They moved to Colindale and Sidney won a scholarship to Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s boys\u2019 school before going to Reading University, where he got a first-class degree in biology. He wanted to continue studying but his parents could not afford to support him and he joined Maff, working in its Lowestoft laboratory. Although he began his research life at sea, sewing buttons on plaice and releasing them to determine where they had migrated when they were caught again by fishermen, he was soon in demand elsewhere. He was keen to accept a job in the US at five times his Maff salary, but was refused a visa. He later discovered he had been labelled a communist for helping two visiting Russians translate their scientific paper into English. Instead of America he worked at Nature Conservancy in Scotland before joining the UN in Rome. Holt was proud to have worked for the UN, but it was saving the great whale species that became his passion. He used his scientific, communication and diplomatic skills to turn the IWC from pro-hunting to a conservation body, a process that took decades of dedication. The first great milestone in saving the whales came when a moratorium was introduced in 1984. However, Japan immediately invented \u201cscientific\u201d whaling \u2013 killing whales to check their age and the state of the stock \u2013 a loophole that allowed it to continue to slaughter the mammals for meat, also exploited by Norway and Iceland. The annual meetings of the IWC were a political battleground in which Holt was ever present, patiently explaining the science and revealing to journalists the \u201cbribes\u201d of fish plants and cash sums used by Japan to get small nations to vote alongside it. As he got older he grew more radical and became a Greenpeace representative, helping to found Greenpeace Italy, advising the IFAW, and finally endorsing the work of the Sea Shepherd organisation, directly confronting the Japanese whaling fleet as it hunted in the designated Antarctic sanctuary. When Japan announced it had stopped \u201cscientific\u201d whaling in the Antarctic the news was hardly reported, but last September, when Holt was physically ailing, a group of prominent whale campaigners from around the world made a pilgrimage to his home in Umbria to celebrate and thank him for his immense contribution to their cause. He met his partner, Leslie Busby, while they were working at Unesco. She survives him, along with his son, George, from his marriage to Judy, from whom he separated in the late 1970s. \u2022 Sidney Joseph Holt, marine scientist and campaigner, born 28 February 1926; died 22 December 2019",

      "body": "<p>How much does the British political world really know about Boris Johnson? It certainly thinks that it knows a lot. After all, Johnson has been around for a long time. He has always courted publicity. He possesses a mega-wattage personality. Many will feel that they know too much about him rather than too little.</p> <p>But there is a danger that politics may not be keeping up with the way he is evolving as prime minister. On the right, Johnson is still the conquering hero. He won the Brexit battle, trounced the liberal establishment and has led the Conservatives back to a level of power they have not known for 30 years. On the left, Johnson is the villain of the era. He has hitched his ambition to a rightwing nationalist deregulatory project, and he is a Trump admirer who does not care what gets in his way, or who suffers, as long as he wins.</p> <p>Pinning down the real Johnson is trickier than these caricatures suggest. Johnson may indeed have won the referendum and led the Tories to election victory on the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/09/get-brexit-done-lie-leave-eu-johnson\" title=\"\"> get Brexit done</a>\u201d platform. But he is more complex than that. He was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/04/boris-johnson-london-mayor-conservatives\" title=\"\">politically liberal mayor of London</a>, he loses no opportunity to identify with the Tories\u2019 one-nation reformist tradition, and he talks the talk about post-austerity public spending. In fact, Johnson may be better understood if he is treated as the unknown prime minister.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/05/johnson-needs-to-fix-nhs-to-keep-new-voters-on-side\">Johnson must satisfy new Tory voters by unifying NHS and social care systems</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Underpinning all this \u2013 and it feels increasingly important \u2013 Johnson has behaved with far more political discipline and care ever since he moved into Downing Street than he appeared to do in the past. This may not last. It may be an illusion. He may be knocked off course. The discipline may be at the service of an undeserving purpose. But it implies a degree of calculation that requires more recognition than it sometimes gets.</p> <p>Note in particular that, thus far, this discipline has been a feature of both of Johnson\u2019s two periods in Downing Street, not of one rather than the other. In the first phase, after succeeding Theresa May in the last parliament, everything was subordinated to winning on Brexit and to fighting an early election. Discipline made absolute sense in such circumstances. It was massively rewarded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-achieves-landslide-victory-visual-guide\" title=\"\">at the polls</a>.</p> <p>Yet now those constraints no longer apply. Brexit is settled. The election is well won. But the discipline has not been binned. Johnson\u2019s visit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/14/boris-johnson-to-visit-new-tory-seats-in-the-north-election-live-updates\" title=\"\">Sedgefield in December</a> and his recognition that former Labour voters expect him to deliver for them were early signs that he is working to a plan. When he told the cabinet that he is a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/12/boris-johnson-no-right-call-himself-one-nation-conservative\" title=\"\">Brexity Hezza</a>\u201d, Johnson signalled that the redressing of regional imbalances in the manner of Michael Heseltine could be at the heart of the new political era.</p> <p>Discipline has been a marked feature of Johnson\u2019s handling of the current Iranian crisis. Two aspects stand out.

      "bodyText": "How much does the British political world really know about Boris Johnson? It certainly thinks that it knows a lot. After all, Johnson has been around for a long time. He has always courted publicity. He possesses a mega-wattage personality. Many will feel that they know too much about him rather than too little. But there is a danger that politics may not be keeping up with the way he is evolving as prime minister. On the right, Johnson is still the conquering hero. He won the Brexit battle, trounced the liberal establishment and has led the Conservatives back to a level of power they have not known for 30 years. On the left, Johnson is the villain of the era. He has hitched his ambition to a rightwing nationalist deregulatory project, and he is a Trump admirer who does not care what gets in his way, or who suffers, as long as he wins. Pinning down the real Johnson is trickier than these caricatures suggest. Johnson may indeed have won the referendum and led the Tories to election victory on the \u201c get Brexit done\u201d platform. But he is more complex than that. He was a politically liberal mayor of London, he loses no opportunity to identify with the Tories\u2019 one-nation reformist tradition, and he talks the talk about post-austerity public spending. In fact, Johnson may be better understood if he is treated as the unknown prime minister. Underpinning all this \u2013 and it feels increasingly important \u2013 Johnson has behaved with far more political discipline and care ever since he moved into Downing Street than he appeared to do in the past. This may not last. It may be an illusion. He may be knocked off course. The discipline may be at the service of an undeserving purpose. But it implies a degree of calculation that requires more recognition than it sometimes gets. Note in particular that, thus far, this discipline has been a feature of both of Johnson\u2019s two periods in Downing Street, not of one rather than the other. In the first phase, after succeeding Theresa May in the last parliament, everything was subordinated to winning on Brexit and to fighting an early election. Discipline made absolute sense in such circumstances. It was massively rewarded at the polls. Yet now those constraints no longer apply. Brexit is settled. The election is well won. But the discipline has not been binned. Johnson\u2019s visit to Sedgefield in December and his recognition that former Labour voters expect him to deliver for them were early signs that he is working to a plan. When he told the cabinet that he is a \u201cBrexity Hezza\u201d, Johnson signalled that the redressing of regional imbalances in the manner of Michael Heseltine could be at the heart of the new political era. Discipline has been a marked feature of Johnson\u2019s handling of the current Iranian crisis. Two aspects stand out. The first is the moderation of the public British response. This has stuck closer to the stabilising instincts of Germany and France than to the intemperate ones of the US. The second, though much criticised by his opponents, is Johnson\u2019s reluctance to grandstand the Iranian issue in the presidential manner that most modern prime ministers have adopted. Both of these choices may be tactical \u2013 not least because of the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case, for which many blame him \u2013 but that does not make them either insignificant or unwelcome. A similar restraint can also be discerned in Johnson\u2019s handling of his signature issue of Europe. He is determined to treat Brexit as a done deal. The Brexit department is to close. The word itself is to be outlawed from Whitehall. But Johnson knows that Brexit is an oceanic process. It can\u2019t be wished out of existence. What matters to him is to change the subject. That is why he is determined to do a trade deal that protects supply chains and to move Brexit off the agenda. No-deal preparations \u2013 which would have perpetuated the Brexit conflict \u2013 have been stood down, it was reported this week. Europeans are being hugged close, as Iran illustrates. Ursula von der Leyen was feted at Downing Street on Wednesday. How significant is all of this for the longer term? This is only the start of whatever process is evolving. I am not suggesting that Johnson is either sympathetic or visionary. But if you listen to Johnson\u2019s words, and examine the decisions that he has made so far, his purpose is hiding in plain sight. He is planning to move his party towards the centre, by casting it as the supporter and enabler of middle-Britain voters who want spending on the NHS, social care and the climate emergency. Polling for the thinktank Bright Blue this week shows Johnson has a job on his hands to clinch that deal. At the close of Shakespeare\u2019s Henry IV, as Prince Hal is about to be crowned king, he stuns his former drinking companion Sir John Falstaff by telling him: \u201cPresume not that I am the thing I was./ For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,/ That I have turned away my former self.\u201d In Johnson\u2019s case it is hard to be sure whether he has turned his former self away.

But Johnson does not have to turn all the way from Hal to Henry to show that there are likely to be more shades of grey in his prime ministership than some have yet grasped.

But it appeared the initiative was running into difficulties even before it had begun: late on Wednesday it was reported that Sarraj refused to meet Conte because the Italian prime minister had previously met his rival, Haftar. Haftar has been fighting to seize Tripoli since April and this week made a military breakthrough when his forces, known as the Libyan National Army (LNA), captured the coastal town of Sirte. His spokesman said the LNA was extending a no-fly zone immediately to include Mitiga airport. Turkey recently announced it was sending military advisers to support the GNA while Russian mercenaries have been fighting on behalf of Haftar. The Turkish military intervention, backed by the Turkish parliament, has been heavily criticised by Russia and the European Union. A Turkish presidential spokesman, \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n, said Turkey only wanted to engineer a ceasefire, and called on the parties to return to the positions they held before Haftar mounted his attack in April. \u201cIn Libya, our priority is to stop the clashes as soon as possible, the declaration of a ceasefire and all parties, particularly Haftar, to return to their positions of April,\u201d Kal\u0131n said after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \u201cThe Haftar side, which violates the agreement between Tripoli and Benghazi that was signed in April, continues its attacks recklessly.

Suleimani\u2019s influence in Iraq had been well understood by successive US administrations \u2013 as had the Iraqi government\u2019s unwillingness to oppose him on most issues. Nevertheless, Washington had coveted a strategic relationship with Baghdad that would give it some sway in the country\u2019s affairs. An early reading of Suleimani\u2019s death is that US goals have been set back, not advanced. Iraq is more adamant than before about ousting Washington\u2019s forces and under mounting pressure from Iran to do so. In his first remarks following the Iranian response, Trump urged Nato to do more to contain Iran \u2013 a call that adds weight to a belief that the Trump administration now intends to do less. His remarks were an acknowledgement that the US did not intend to strike back at Iran. Officials in the region are now preparing for a return to the cat and mouse games that have marked hostilities; a widespread use of proxies, plausible deniability \u2013 and a war driven largely from the shadows. Iran\u2019s network of surrogate forces say they are yet to avenge the death of a man who directed their activities over many years. One of the most powerful Iraqi militia leaders, Qais al-Khazali \u2013 who has led Asa\u2019ib ahl al-Haq for more than a decade \u2013 said: \u201cThe first Iranian response to the assassination of the martyr leader happened. Now is the time for the initial Iraqi response. And because the Iraqis are brave and jealous, their response will not be less than the size of the Iranian response, and this is a promise.\u201d In Baghdad, where tensions remained high ahead of Trump\u2019s address; aid worker Noof Assi, 30, said: \u201cWe\u2019re going through the same motions we did back in 2003. \u201cLast night was very scary for us \u2013 we\u2019ve experienced Iranian missiles before and they more often than not miss their target. If the US announces a war, we will not survive. The Iraqi government doesn\u2019t care for us, they care more about the wellbeing of Iran. Our lives are not our own.\u201d",

Her lawyer, Lewis Power QC, said her legal team would challenge the conviction and were prepared to take the case to the European court of human rights. Although the case is far from over, Cypriot officials are clearly relieved that the negative publicity that has swirled around the country as a result of the often controversial court proceedings is out of the spotlight \u2013 for now. The Cyprus Mail, the island\u2019s English-language daily, described authorities as being \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the threat of a tourism boycott of the island. The proposed boycott, initiated on social media, was publicly backed by the teenager\u2019s mother. \u201cThere is no indication yet that it has [affected us] despite what some people are saying,\u201d said the deputy tourism minister, Savvas Perdios.

The court was very lenient with her. If the town had been defamed in England the way Ayia Napa has the girl would have got a much harsher sentence.\u201d Yiannis Karoussos, mayor of the resort at the time of the alleged gang-rape and now a minister in the government of Nicos Anastasiades, has said repeatedly that the Briton \u201cowes Ayia Napa an apology\u201d for the damage she had caused the town. The 19-year-old woman flew into London Heathrow from Larnaca on Tuesday after spending a month in prison. Earlier in the day, the Briton was handed a four-month jail sentence suspended for three years for wilfully indulging in public mischief for the offence of fabricating \u201can imaginary crime\u201d. After the sentencing, she hugged her family and legal team, leaving the Famagusta district court in Paralimni in tears. Her mother shouted to supporters outside: \u201cShe\u2019s coming home.\u201d Two passengers who had been booked on to the British Airways flight the teenager boarded with her family agreed to take a later plane so she could get home sooner. Speaking to the Sun, the young woman said: \u201cI am innocent and the fight will go on to clear my name. It\u2019s been a nightmare for me, Mum and everyone. Now I just want to be with my friends and family. \u201cWhat kept me going was my family and the amazing support of my friends and all other people who got in contact to say they believed me.\u201d Cypriot police claimed she lied about being attacked by up to 12 Israelis in an Ayia Napa hotel room on 17 July. A dozen young men and boys aged between 15 and 20 who had been arrested over the incident were freed after she signed a retraction statement. The teenager was then stuck in the country for nearly five months after being charged. She spent four and a half weeks in Nicosia prison before being granted bail on the condition that she surrender her passport. She maintains that she agreed to consensual sex with one of the Israelis, before he knelt on her shoulders and raped her along with the others \u2013 a claim they all deny. The woman said she was forced to retract her claim under duress from police following seven hours of questioning without a lawyer or interpreter. Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said he had raised concerns about her treatment with Cypriot authorities. After the sentence, he said: \u201cWe will be following up on some of the issues in relation to the case. I spoke to the Cypriot foreign minister about that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>December\u2019s election saw parties of the left forced to spend inordinate amounts of time debating how to vote tactically, how to game the system, and fighting among themselves \u2013 rather than taking the battle to the Conservatives. That\u2019s the result of a warped voting system at Westminster which forces people to \u201chold their nose\u201d, which castigates splitting the vote \u2013 ie having real democratic choice \u2013 and favours binary narratives over diversity and cooperation.</p> <p>For too long, Westminster\u2019s political system has been for the few, and by the few. Just 16% of the public believe politics is working well in the UK \u2013 and only 2% feel they have a significant influence over decision-making, according to recent BMG polling for the Electoral Reform Society. It\u2019s no wonder when our broken constitutional set-up distorts representation \u2013 driving a sense of powerlessness across the country.</p> <p>So it\u2019s welcome to see Clive Lewis putting the need for real democracy \u2013 including proportional representation for the Commons \u2013 front and centre in his leadership bid (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/clive-lewis-to-beat-tories-labour-has-to-work-with-other-progressives\" title=\"\">Clive Lewis: Labour must be radical and reject tribalism</a>, 7 January).</p> <p>The future of the left has to be pluralist, diverse and cooperative: to recognise that we have more in common and to build alliances.</p> <p>Whoever wins this leadership election, it\u2019s vital that these issues are part of the debate \u2013 and that Lewis secures enough nominations to take part. The democratic crisis must not be ignored in this race. Now is the right time for Labour to discuss a genuinely progressive way forward, away from tribalism, and to back a real overhaul of Britain\u2019s broken political system.<br><strong>Neal Lawson </strong><em>Chair of Compass, </em><strong>James Meadway </strong><em>Former adviser to John McDonnell, </em><strong>Klina Jordan</strong><strong>, Willie Sullivan </strong><em>Director, Electoral Reform Society Scotland, </em><strong>Jeremy Gilbert</strong><em> Academic and author</em><strong>, Jo Littler </strong><em>Professor, </em><em>department of sociology,</em><em> City, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Anyone who enjoys sums, as both Robert Frazer (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/01/labour-not-the-tories-benefit-from-first-past-the-post-voting-system\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 2 January) and I do, can have fun in these miserable times deriving different winner/loser permutations produced by our electoral system. But one thing is obvious: no matter how you cut the figures, under first past the post, votes cast have only limited connection to seats won.</p> <p>Thus, FPTP in my home borough of Lewisham meant Labour swept the board in the 2018 local elections, winning all 54 council seats. However, while its 54% victory for the mayoralty showed Labour was the \u201ctrue\u201d winner of that ballot, it only underlined the unrepresentative nature of our wider local government. Tens of thousands across Lewisham had voted against Labour, without delivering a single opposition member to hold the council to account.</p> <p>Similar exercises can be done nationally. So, in spite of knowing their votes would be \u201cwasted\u201d, across Britain well over 800,000 people chose the Greens in the last general election, producing just one seat.

      "bodyText": "December\u2019s election saw parties of the left forced to spend inordinate amounts of time debating how to vote tactically, how to game the system, and fighting among themselves \u2013 rather than taking the battle to the Conservatives. That\u2019s the result of a warped voting system at Westminster which forces people to \u201chold their nose\u201d, which castigates splitting the vote \u2013 ie having real democratic choice \u2013 and favours binary narratives over diversity and cooperation. For too long, Westminster\u2019s political system has been for the few, and by the few. Just 16% of the public believe politics is working well in the UK \u2013 and only 2% feel they have a significant influence over decision-making, according to recent BMG polling for the Electoral Reform Society. It\u2019s no wonder when our broken constitutional set-up distorts representation \u2013 driving a sense of powerlessness across the country. So it\u2019s welcome to see Clive Lewis putting the need for real democracy \u2013 including proportional representation for the Commons \u2013 front and centre in his leadership bid (Clive Lewis: Labour must be radical and reject tribalism, 7 January). The future of the left has to be pluralist, diverse and cooperative: to recognise that we have more in common and to build alliances. Whoever wins this leadership election, it\u2019s vital that these issues are part of the debate \u2013 and that Lewis secures enough nominations to take part. The democratic crisis must not be ignored in this race. Now is the right time for Labour to discuss a genuinely progressive way forward, away from tribalism, and to back a real overhaul of Britain\u2019s broken political system. Neal Lawson Chair of Compass, James Meadway Former adviser to John McDonnell, Klina Jordan, Willie Sullivan Director, Electoral Reform Society Scotland, Jeremy Gilbert Academic and author, Jo Littler Professor, department of sociology, City, University of London \u2022 Anyone who enjoys sums, as both Robert Frazer (Letters, 2 January) and I do, can have fun in these miserable times deriving different winner/loser permutations produced by our electoral system. But one thing is obvious: no matter how you cut the figures, under first past the post, votes cast have only limited connection to seats won. Thus, FPTP in my home borough of Lewisham meant Labour swept the board in the 2018 local elections, winning all 54 council seats. However, while its 54% victory for the mayoralty showed Labour was the \u201ctrue\u201d winner of that ballot, it only underlined the unrepresentative nature of our wider local government. Tens of thousands across Lewisham had voted against Labour, without delivering a single opposition member to hold the council to account. Similar exercises can be done nationally. So, in spite of knowing their votes would be \u201cwasted\u201d, across Britain well over 800,000 people chose the Greens in the last general election, producing just one seat. Meanwhile, Labour garnered one MP for every 50,800 votes, the Tories one for every 38,300 votes and the SNP averaged just under 26,000 in securing each seat. As a Labour supporter, I don\u2019t think any of us benefit from huge discrepancies between votes cast and representatives elected. Cynicism and resentment rack up in an already dangerously disaffected electorate; vast and disproportionate power goes to a winner that lacks legitimacy among many voters; and elections themselves turn into guesswork (where to invest resources, whether to vote tactically). Most important, playing with election statistics is displacement activity: it distracts us from engaging in crucial political reflection as to why a party with a caring and moderate social democratic agenda was smashed by one that is sectarian, incompetent, shoddy, careless, dishonest, racist and visionless.

The political declaration obliges both parties to employ their \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to reach agreement. The large European fishing nations insist on their historic rights of access.

The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has also suggested that there is little to be gained in the City being a rule-taker. Of greater political salience, despite its much smaller economic significance, is the issue of access to UK fishing waters. The political declaration obliges both parties to employ their \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to reach agreement. The large European fishing nations insist on their historic rights of access. The threat to close off the European market to UK fish and seafood looms in what senior EU diplomats warn will be a \u201chorrendously complex and fraught\u201d negotiation. On the other side, British fishermen want radical change from the common fisheries policy under which nearly 60% of fish in UK waters is caught by EU-based boats. Some, whether in Grimsby or Brittany, will inevitably be left feeling betrayed. The talks are expected to go beyond the summer. On trade in goods, Von der Leyen made it clear that the current business models for the car and pharma industries would have to change. A gamut of checks and paperwork will be required once the UK is outside the single market and customs union, disrupting the frictionless flow under current agreements. But Von der Leyen repeated her intention to agree a \u201czero tariff, zero quotas\u201d deal. The price for that is agreement on a level playing field for British and European businesses, ensuring the UK does not undercut the bloc in environmental, labour or social standards, and continues to apply state aid rules. Johnson said he would not \u201calign\u201d the UK to EU standards. That commitment will be unpacked over the coming months. EU officials say the prime minister\u2019s concessions over a customs border in the Irish Sea suggests that he could be allowing himself sufficient wriggle-room to satisfy EU and domestic demands late in the process. European School pupils are apparently taught to be creative thinkers \u2013 much will depend on it.",

He wisely courted officials from across the country\u2019s contested political system, resisting alignment with any one side.</p> <p>Rouzbeh Parsi, a senior lecturer in Iranian history, based at Sweden\u2019s Lund University, said that Suleimani, because of his role overseeing the Quds force, the Guards\u2019 elite external operations unit, was able to portray himself as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/general-qassam-suleimani-obituary\">a soldier devoted to a higher cause</a>, above the fray of career politicians. \u201cHe was not a regime or religious icon, he was a nationalist icon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, addressed the strikes only briefly at an event in the holy city of Qom on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWe just gave [the US] a slap in the face last night,\u201d he said. He spent much more time trying to tie Suleimani\u2019s legacy to an Islamic revolution that many Iranian citizens now view with cynicism or contempt. \u201cHis martyrdom showed that the revolution is alive,\u201d Khamenei said.</p> <p>Activists against the regime did not deny it had received a boost from Suleimani\u2019s death, but said such support would fade if tensions with the US relented. \u201cYes, his killing is in the interests of the regime,\u201d said one man who had demonstrated in November. But the factors that drove Iranians into the streets then \u2013 high inflation and unemployment \u2013 had not been extinguished by Suleimani\u2019s martyrdom, he added. \u201cThe boost will be short-lived and the protests will reappear in some form.\u201d</p> <p>What may be longer lasting is a renewed sense of anti-Americanism among ordinary people, said Sina Toossi, a senior analyst at the National Iranian American Council. \u201cFor years anti-Americanism has been a top-down phenomenon, but the Iranian people wanted to move past this. Trump has destroyed a lot of that sentiment, and the assassination of Suleimani will cement it as a bottom-up phenomenon again. This is going to be seen as something as great, if not greater, than the [CIA-sponsored] 1953 coup.\u201d</p>",

Revolutionary songs, and clips of the life of Suleimani, late head of al-Quds, a wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, played in between bulletins solemnly reporting Iran\u2019s bombardment of the Iraqi bases hosting American troops in Anbar province and in Kurdistan. Less than two months ago the Islamic Republic witnessed the largest protests in its history. On Wednesday it sought to surf a wave of deep public grief and rage at the assassination of Suleimani, one of the country\u2019s most popular political figures. \u201cThey took good revenge,\u201d said a man, one of dozens of people whose reactions to the attacks were broadcast on state-run television outlets. \u201cWe are proud of our Sepah [Revolutionary Guards]. I will stand with my government until the last drop of blood.\u201d During morning news programmes, commentators and reporters cited military sources telling them that, contrary to American claims that none of their forces had been hit, a dozen, then 80, then more than 100 US soldiers, had been killed or injured, their bodies ferried away by helicopters before the sun rose. People were shown waving flags, chanting against America and Israel, and handing out sweets. \u201cI\u2019m thankful,\u201d said a woman, explaining why she was crying. \u201cThese are tears of pride.\u201d Opinions shared outside the gaze of the largely state-controlled media were more nuanced. \u201cI expected a harsher revenge,\u201d said a taxi driver in Tehran as a news bulletin blared from the radio. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t know how strong we are. I\u2019m shaking, hearing the news \u2013 I wish I could have been one of those soldiers who pushed the buttons for the strikes.\u201d He dismissed American claims that none of their soldiers had been harmed in the strikes. \u201cOf course they wouldn\u2019t announce it,\u201d he said. One of his passengers was more circumspect. \u201cThis will bring a war and loss of life. Look at what happened during the Iraq war,\u201d he said. The driver interrupted him. \u201cYou\u2019re not grateful for Suleimani,\u201d he said. \u201cHe lost his life for you and us.\u201d The conversation died down. Suleimani, 62, was rare among government officials for the reverence with which he was held by many of Iran\u2019s citizens. He wisely courted officials from across the country\u2019s contested political system, resisting alignment with any one side. Rouzbeh Parsi, a senior lecturer in Iranian history, based at Sweden\u2019s Lund University, said that Suleimani, because of his role overseeing the Quds force, the Guards\u2019 elite external operations unit, was able to portray himself as a soldier devoted to a higher cause, above the fray of career politicians. \u201cHe was not a regime or religious icon, he was a nationalist icon,\u201d he said. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, addressed the strikes only briefly at an event in the holy city of Qom on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWe just gave [the US] a slap in the face last night,\u201d he said. He spent much more time trying to tie Suleimani\u2019s legacy to an Islamic revolution that many Iranian citizens now view with cynicism or contempt. \u201cHis martyrdom showed that the revolution is alive,\u201d Khamenei said. Activists against the regime did not deny it had received a boost from Suleimani\u2019s death, but said such support would fade if tensions with the US relented. \u201cYes, his killing is in the interests of the regime,\u201d said one man who had demonstrated in November. But the factors that drove Iranians into the streets then \u2013 high inflation and unemployment \u2013 had not been extinguished by Suleimani\u2019s martyrdom, he added. \u201cThe boost will be short-lived and the protests will reappear in some form.\u201d What may be longer lasting is a renewed sense of anti-Americanism among ordinary people, said Sina Toossi, a senior analyst at the National Iranian American Council. \u201cFor years anti-Americanism has been a top-down phenomenon, but the Iranian people wanted to move past this. Trump has destroyed a lot of that sentiment, and the assassination of Suleimani will cement it as a bottom-up phenomenon again. This is going to be seen as something as great, if not greater, than the [CIA-sponsored] 1953 coup.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In a long and detailed press conference on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carlos-ghosn\" title=\"\">Carlos Ghosn</a> \u2013 former head of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, who made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosn-escaped-japan-hiding-in-a-musical-instrument-case\" title=\"\">dramatic escape</a> from his house arrest in Japan last month \u2013 came out with guns blazing.</p> <p>Speaking in Beirut, he alleged that former Nissan colleagues and prosecutors were co-conspirators in a plot to oust him in order to prevent a closer merger with Renault. Ghosn denied the allegations against him, which include under-reporting his income and misusing company funds, and said that he was mistreated while in solitary confinement. This included interrogations that lasted for up to eight hours a day without a lawyer present. The presumption of guilt, and the pressure placed on him by Japanese prosecutors to confess, convinced him that there was no chance of a fair trial. And so he fled.</p> <p>Given his brash demeanour and immense wealth, Ghosn is not a sympathetic character. Indeed, he may well be guilty of financial misconduct. But he is right to shine a light into the dark corners of Japan\u2019s justice system. Anyone familiar with the Japanese justice system would know that Ghosn\u2019s allegations are not far-fetched.</p> <p>In Japan, laws are used as weapons against targeted people and not applied equally. One example of this is the \u201chostage justice\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20181204-ghosn-arrest-puts-japans-justice-system-dock\" title=\"\">hitojichi-shiho</a>) system. Hostage justice boils down to the accused remaining in custody until they incriminate themselves by signing a confession. Often this is drawn up by prosecutors who browbeat the accused without defence counsel. Knowing that the playing field is tilted in favour of the prosecutors and that they could spend a very long time in jail even before going to court, many innocent defendants confess. Ghosn spent more than 120 days in detention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c99db4cd300f8aa73cb80874b9271046422c59ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c99db4cd300f8aa73cb80874b9271046422c59ae/0_70_4558_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japan\u2019s justice minister, Masako Mori, speaks to the media about Ghosn\u2019s escape.

Despite extreme pressure to confess, Ezoe defied prosecuting authorities by pleading not guilty. Over a decade of judicial purgatory later, he was effectively exonerated by receiving a suspended three-year sentence in 2003. In 2010 he published a book, <a href=\"https://japantoday.com/category/features/where-is-the-justice?comment-order=latest\" title=\"\">Where is the Justice?</a>, a savage indictment of a system in which the presumption of innocence is abandoned and defendants are railroaded.

      "bodyText": "In a long and detailed press conference on Wednesday, Carlos Ghosn \u2013 former head of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, who made a dramatic escape from his house arrest in Japan last month \u2013 came out with guns blazing. Speaking in Beirut, he alleged that former Nissan colleagues and prosecutors were co-conspirators in a plot to oust him in order to prevent a closer merger with Renault. Ghosn denied the allegations against him, which include under-reporting his income and misusing company funds, and said that he was mistreated while in solitary confinement. This included interrogations that lasted for up to eight hours a day without a lawyer present. The presumption of guilt, and the pressure placed on him by Japanese prosecutors to confess, convinced him that there was no chance of a fair trial. And so he fled. Given his brash demeanour and immense wealth, Ghosn is not a sympathetic character. Indeed, he may well be guilty of financial misconduct. But he is right to shine a light into the dark corners of Japan\u2019s justice system. Anyone familiar with the Japanese justice system would know that Ghosn\u2019s allegations are not far-fetched. In Japan, laws are used as weapons against targeted people and not applied equally. One example of this is the \u201chostage justice\u201d (hitojichi-shiho) system. Hostage justice boils down to the accused remaining in custody until they incriminate themselves by signing a confession. Often this is drawn up by prosecutors who browbeat the accused without defence counsel. Knowing that the playing field is tilted in favour of the prosecutors and that they could spend a very long time in jail even before going to court, many innocent defendants confess. Ghosn spent more than 120 days in detention. In the late 1980s, a once high-flying company president called Hiromasa Ezoe was accused of bribery. Despite extreme pressure to confess, Ezoe defied prosecuting authorities by pleading not guilty. Over a decade of judicial purgatory later, he was effectively exonerated by receiving a suspended three-year sentence in 2003. In 2010 he published a book, Where is the Justice?, a savage indictment of a system in which the presumption of innocence is abandoned and defendants are railroaded. Ghosn may well have wanted to avoid this fate. In Japan, the accused can be held for 23 days without charge \u2013 this is almost indefinitely renewable as judges normally give prosecutors the benefit of the doubt. In April 2019, more than 1,000 lawyers and scholars submitted a petition to the justice ministry demanding an end to this antediluvian system. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations has also long lobbied against it. The 2019 petition doesn\u2019t mince its words, asserting that the \u201clong-term detention in the Carlos Ghosn case has triggered surprise and criticism overseas, leading to doubts about Japan\u2019s integrity as a democratic nation that guarantees human rights\u201d. Japan\u2019s hostage justice, interrogation procedures barring lawyers and arbitrary denial of family contact are out of step with many other democracies and international law. The UN Human Rights committee has called on Japan to reform its criminal justice system to allow for the presence of defence counsel, while a UN committee against torture called Japan\u2019s criminal justice system \u201cmedieval\u201d. In recent years, the media has exposed many cases of prosecutors\u2019 abuse of power, inventing, misinterpreting or ignoring exonerating evidence in an attempt to maintain the dubious distinction of a 99% conviction rate. Recognising the problem, the justice ministry has since the 2000s introduced piecemeal reforms to reduce dependence on confessions and allowing some videotaping of interrogations. Even so, the system remains stacked against defendants. While Ghosn managed a dramatic escape, ordinary Japanese citizens remain vulnerable to a judicial system that draws sharp criticism from domestic civil society organisations, lawyers\u2019 federations and the media. The vested interests are scrambling to defend this system, but it\u2019s high time to end the era of Japanese prosecutors running amok and trampling on civil liberties. \u2022 Jeff Kingston is director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan",

      "body": "<p>The Bucovina and Moldova regions in the north-east of Romania are rich in traditions and ancient customs. Lots of towns and villages host winter festivals and parades; one of the biggest is the Festivalul de Datini \u0219i Obiceiuri Str\u0103mo\u0219e\u0219ti (the festival of customs and ancestors\u2019 customs) in Com\u0103ne\u0219ti on 30 December. Different groups come from miles around to participate, and it has become best known for its bear dancers: groups who process through the streets in bear costumes, often made from real animal furs, some as much as 50 years old.</p> <p>The bear was a sacred animal in ancient Romania. It\u2019s thought that the tradition of dancing bears originated many centuries ago among the Roma who would visit villages just before New Year with real bears on leashes to dance and chase away bad spirits from the outgoing year. When the country was under communist rule, it was banned; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xt8mEv3qe8\">bear dancing was made illegal in 1998</a>; and, <a href=\"http://horinca.blogspot.com/2007/09/end-of-dancing-bears.html\">when Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007</a>, the last of the dancing bears were bought from their owners and \u201cretired\u201d to a bear reserve in the Rila mountains.</p> <p>As well as the \u201cbears\u201d in Com\u0103ne\u0219ti\u2019s festival, each group will also have someone playing the \u201cGypsy\u201d and/or \u201cThe Bear Tamer\u201d, plus musicians with drums and panpipes. Everyone dances and sings as they go through the streets, making their way to a stage where they act out a simple ritual scene in which the bear collapses because a demon is inside him. The Gypsy comes with a knife and bleeds the bear, lets the demon out and the bear revives. It\u2019s a story of rebirth for the new year. In some versions of the tradition, the bear, the Gypsy and the drummers also go from house to house in the village, singing and dancing to ward off evil and bring good luck.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The boy is wearing a real bear skin that would have been very old and very heavy and very hot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I didn\u2019t go to the festival as a child. Photography has helped me discover my country in a fuller way. I live in the UK now but have been to Com\u0103ne\u0219ti and the region five times over the past decade to photograph the festivals. This shot was from 2013. It\u2019s mostly men and boys who dress up in the bear skins, but I have seen girls, too. The boy is wearing a real bear skin that would have been very old and very heavy \u2013 some of them weigh up to 50kg - and also very hot.</p> <p>It\u2019s really hard to shoot a procession. You can either sprint ahead and wait for the group, or walk backwards in front of them. I prefer that way, but you can\u2019t then see where you\u2019re going and I\u2019m always praying I\u2019m not going to step on something or trip.</p> <p>I\u2019d spotted this boy earlier \u2013 sometimes the dancers take the masks off because they get too hot \u2013 and was struck by something about his expression. There are lots of photographers at the event, so the boy knew I was shooting him but didn\u2019t take any notice of me. He was flushed because he\u2019d been dancing and running all day, and there was this one moment when he was looking in my direction. I didn\u2019t realise at the time I\u2019d got such a good shot.</p> <p>When I photograph, I\u2019m always so immersed in what I\u2019m doing that I don\u2019t stop to consider what I\u2019ve taken. I just try to get as many shots as possible \u2013 if you stop you risk missing things. You never know what\u2019s round the corner. When I look at the photo now, the only thing I regret is the lack of snow. There\u2019s usually snow on the ground at the time, but climate change is affecting Romania\u2019s weather like everywhere else, and the snow often comes in March rather than December/January.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This picture has changed my life.

It has brought me international recognition and commissions, and has also helped make the festival famous all over the world. It\u2019s even live on Facebook these days.

In a costume you can be something other than yourself. In recent visits to the region\u2019s winter festivals, I\u2019ve also focused on a <a href=\"https://www.alecsandraralucadragoi.com/ritual-portraits\">portraiture series</a>, asking people in their colourful costumes to pose for me in front of a mobile studio. I came across one bear costume made entirely of reeds that weighed 100kg. Other costumes (there can be horses, deer and goats as well as bears) are made of rags or paper, while some people paint their faces or wear really elaborate masks or pointed hats that are a metre high.</p> <p>Many Romanians who work abroad return each year specifically to take part in the winter festivals \u2013 it\u2019s how they express and celebrate their cultural identity. There\u2019s always an amazing vibe in Com\u0103ne\u0219ti. I dance, too \u2013 you feel so much energy.

      "bodyText": "The former Renault-Nissan chair Carlos Ghosn likened his arrest by Japanese prosecutors to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor as he spoke publicly for the first time since his audacious escape from Japan. In an animated presentation to the global media in Beirut on Wednesday, Ghosn said his prosecution on charges of financial misconduct was politically motivated, the result of an elaborate conspiracy involving \u201cmalevolent\u201d Nissan executives and even the Japanese government. The erstwhile giant of the automotive world said he loved Japan and its people but that the country\u2019s authorities were \u201crepaying me with evil\u201d because he was an easy target as a foreigner. Ghosn refused to address speculation that his escape from strict bail conditions on 29 December involved taking a bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka\u2019s Kansai airport, being whisked through security while hidden inside a large audio equipment case and boarding a private jet to Turkey and on to Lebanon. But he insisted he was innocent of the charges brought by Japanese prosecutors, who following his initial arrest in November 2018 have accused him of underreporting $80m (\u00a361m) of income and misusing company funds allegedly transferred into the account of a company owned by him. \u201cI didn\u2019t run from justice, I want justice,\u201d he said, adding that Japan\u2019s justice system was \u201crigged\u201d. The 65-year-old could still face legal difficulties in Lebanon, after Interpol issue a \u201cred notice\u201d to the Middle Eastern country officially alerting Beirut to his fugitive status and the allegations against him. Officials are also understood to be keen to question him about previous visits to Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. During a two-and-a-half-hour press conference, Ghosn told a packed room that he had been a victim of an \u201canachronistic and inhumane system of hostage justice\u201d, pointing to a 99.4% conviction rate in Japan\u2019s justice system. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to come to the conclusion that you\u2019re going to die in Japan, or you\u2019re going to have to get out,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not escape justice, I fled injustice and political persecution. \u201cI was left with no other choice but to protect myself and my family. A risk one only takes if resigned to the impossibility of a fair trial.\u201d He accused Nissan executives in Japan of colluding with prosecutors and the government in a \u201csystematic campaign by a handful of malevolent actors to destroy my reputation and impugn my character\u201d. The reason for the alleged conspiracy, he said, was Nissan\u2019s declining performance, combined with anger in Japan that Renault, backed by the French state, had greater voting rights in the alliance between the two carmakers. \u201cSome of our Japanese friends thought the only way to get rid of Nissan influence [by] Renault is to get rid of me.\u201d He named three executives on the Nissan board whom he said were \u201cpetty, vindictive and lawless\u201d individuals, and said that both prosecutors and the company had evidence that might exonerate him. The Guardian has approached Nissan for comment. In a comparison certain to enrage commentators in Japan, he likened his surprise arrest to the ambush of the US naval base Pearl Harbor in the second world war. \u201cI didn\u2019t suspect anything \u2026 did you see Pearl Harbor happening?\u201d Describing the personal impact of his arrest, he said: \u201cI was brutally taken from my world as I knew it, ripped from my family, my friends, my communities.\u201d Ghosn claimed he had been seen as a \u201crole model\u201d in Japan for 17 years before he was thrown in jail, where he said he had been kept in solitary confinement in a cell that was lit day and night, interrogated for eight hours a day without a lawyer, and denied showers and prescription medication. \u201cIt will get worse for you if you don\u2019t just confess, the prosecutor told me repeatedly,\u201d Ghosn said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t confess, not only will we go after you, we\u2019ll go after your family,\u201d he claimed to have been told. \u201cThese allegations are untrue and I should never have been arrested in the first place.\u201d Japan\u2019s justice minister, Masako Mori, later issued a statement defending the system against Ghosn\u2019s claim and emphasised the country\u2019s low crime rate. Mori also accused Ghosn of \u201cpropagating \u2026 false information on Japan\u2019s legal system and its practice.

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s aviation authority has said it will not hand over flight recorders from the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 plane that crashed moments after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 passengers and crew onboard, either to the aircraft\u2019s manufacturer or US aviation authorities. The statement was issued on Wednesday as the leaders of Ukraine and Canada, from which dozens of citizens died, vowed to identify the cause of the crash amid contradictory statements and swirling speculation. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cOur government will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that \u2026 [the crash] is thoroughly investigated, and that Canadians\u2019 questions are answered.\u201d The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: \u201cOur priority is to establish the truth and those responsible for this terrible catastrophe.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said there were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians on board. The Ukrainian nationals included two passengers and the nine crew. There were also 10 Swedish passengers, four Afghans, three Germans and three British nationals, he said. The announcement by Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation head, Ali Abedzadeh, followed the launch of an urgent inquiry into the crash by the Ukrainian government, which rowed back on an earlier statement ruling out a terrorist act. The developments have fuelled uncertainty over the circumstances of the crash, which occurred hours after Iran had fired a volley of missiles at bases used by US forces in neighbouring Iraq, in retaliation for the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad by the US. Speaking after the black box flight recorders were found at the crash site, Abedzadeh said: \u201cWe will not give the black boxes to the manufacturer and the Americans. It\u2019s not yet clear which country the black box will go to for the investigation. \u201cThis accident will be investigated by Iran\u2019s aviation organisation, but the Ukrainians can also be present during the incident\u2019s investigation.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called for complete cooperation with any investigation and said the US was prepared to offer Ukraine all possible assistance in identifying the cause of the crash. Journalists at the site described farmland covered with debris. The dead lay among shattered pieces of the aircraft, and their possessions \u2013 including a child\u2019s electric toothbrush, a stuffed animal, luggage and electronics \u2013 were strewn across the site. Iran\u2019s insistence that it will not hand over the black boxes to Boeing comes amid claims that at least two aircraft which had been originally routed through Iranian airspace around the time of the Iranian missile attacks on the bases in Iraq were either told to turn around or redirected. The Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 disappeared from flight trackers a few minutes after its delayed takeoff from Tehran, apparently suffering a catastrophic incident that caused it to break up in flames over farmland outside the city with crew unable to issue a mayday alert. Amateur video, allegedly capturing the plane\u2019s final moments, appeared to show a brightly burning object in the sky, breaking into pieces before exploding in orange flames on the horizon. The video was published on the website of the state-run Iranian Students News Agency, which also carried a photograph of section of wing from the crashed aircraft, which some analysts said appeared to show penetration damage. Ukraine International Airlines said it had indefinitely suspended flights to Tehran after the crash, amid announcements from a slew of other international airlines that they would be avoiding Iranian and Iraqi airspace following the escalating tensions between the US and Iran. \u201cIt was one of the best planes we had, with an amazing, reliable crew,\u201d Yevheniy Dykhne, the president of Ukraine International Airlines, said at a briefing following the crash. As the investigation got under way, the aviation safety information-sharing website OpsGroup, which was set up following the shooting down of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, urged airline operators to err on the side of caution until the cause of the crash had been established and work on the assumption the plane had been shot down. Under the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of which Iran, Ukraine and the US are all members, air crash investigations are led by the country where the accident occurred. Iranian officials said they suspected a mechanical issue brought down the three-and-a-half-year-old Boeing 737-800, an assessment Ukrainian officials initially agreed with but later backed away from while the investigation is ongoing. Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute, said that he believed on balance the incident was \u201ca tragic coincidence\u201d. He said it would require a fairly large surface-to-air missile to inflict such catastrophic damage on a civilian airliner, \u201cbut there was no evidence of a rocket plume\u201d in the videos that have emerged so far. \u201cIt would also be very hard to conceal such a large rocket battery from the ground,\u201d he added. Amid speculation about the cause of the crash, the third in recent months involving a Boeing passenger aircraft, civil aviation insiders also pointed to the large debris field to suggest the plane had broken up suddenly in midair. The 737-800 belongs to the same family as, but is different from, the 737 Max 8 aircraft, which has been grounded since two fatal crashes occurred within six months in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018. The 737-800 operates with a different software system to the one implicated in the Max 8 crashes. The plane had been last serviced two days before the accident, according to the airline. An investigation team was deployed to the site of the crash on the south-western outskirts of Tehran on Wednesday morning, said Reza Jafarzadeh, a civil aviation spokesman. Qassem Biniaz, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s road and transportation ministry, told the state-run Irna news agency it appeared the pilot had lost control after a fire struck one of the plane\u2019s engines. Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the air crash investigation committee, said it appeared the pilot could not communicate with air traffic controllers in Tehran in the last moments of the flight. He did not provide further details. Zelenskiy, who cut short a visit to Oman following the crash, ordered an investigation and a sweeping check of \u201call civilian aircraft\u201d in Ukraine. \u201cOur task is to establish the cause of the crash of the Boeing and provide all necessary help to the families of the victims,\u201d Dmytro Razumkov, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said in a statement on Facebook. The UK Foreign Office said it was urgently seeking confirmation about how many British nationals were onboard, and would do all it could to support any families affected. One witness, Aref Geravand, told AP the pilot managed to steer the plane towards a football field and away from a residential area, saying: \u201cIt crashed near the field and in a water canal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The rate of electric scooter injuries among American millennials living in cities more than tripled in one year, researchers have found. The research letter, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Surgery, comes from researchers in San Francisco. The city has been especially inundated by \u201cmicro-mobility\u201d devices from startups renting e-scooters, bicycles and electric mopeds. The devices are usually used for short trips within cities. Researchers from the University of California San Francisco and San Francisco general hospital called for more helmet access and generally, \u201cimproved rider safety measures and regulation\u201d. The group used the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to examine the rate of e-scooter injuries between 2014 and 2018. During that time, more than 39,000 e-scooter injuries were reported to the database. Millennials had the greatest increase in injuries of any group, with a more than ninefold increase in injuries over four years. In 2014, 582 injuries were reported to the database among millennials. In 2018, 5,309 injuries were reported. The vast majority of hospital admissions were in city settings and many of those injuries were serious. One quarter of injuries included a broken bone and one-third of injuries were to the head, double the rate among bicyclists. A separate 2019 study found less than 5% of e-scooter riders wear helmets. Researchers called for more study and better safety features. Dr Benjamin Breyer, one of the authors and an associate professor of urology at the University of San Francisco California, said: \u201cI was just struck by how pervasive they [e-scooters] were\u2026 and seeing some people ride at very high speeds in and out of traffic and on sidewalks\u201d. Most concerning to Breyer was the high rate of head injuries among young adults. \u201cThere have been previous studies that show helmet usage among scooter users is low.

She says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As for Jeremy, based on his reaction at the meeting, I think he knew nothing about the row, even though his advisers had invoked his name several times beforehand when pressuring me to drop my objections, something I believe they frequently did without his knowledge.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also says the party needs to be much tougher with antisemites in the party.

Here is my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/08/ursula-von-der-leyen-uk-deadline-makes-full-brexit-deal-impossible\">write-up.</a> And here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Von der Leyen said it would be impossible to negotiate a full UK-EU trade deal by the end of this year</strong>. Boris Johnson claims it will be possible to conclude the negotiations within this time frame. But in her speech Von der Leyen said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be. And without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She went even further in the Q&amp;A, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The transition time - it is very, very tight. I briefly [in the speech] touched on the topics we have to negotiate, and this was not even the whole list. It is basically impossible to negotiate all of what I\u2019ve been mentioning ... Therefore we will have to prioritise as long as we face that deadline of the end of 2020.</p> \n   <p>I can only recommend that we prioritise in a way we first of all tackle those topics where, at the end of the year, when we are running out of time, we will not have an international agreement or something to fall back on, but only a hard exit, which would not be good for the UK, nor would it be good for the European Union. Therefore the priorities will have to be sorted out.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She urged Johnson to reconsider his opposition to an extension of the post-Brexit transition period.</strong> Johnson has amended the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill to make it illegal for the government to agree an extension with the EU. But Von der Leyen said this option should remain open. In the Q&amp;A she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would prefer that we look at the whole scenery during the summer, or before the summer starts would be better, because we might together want to take reconsideration of the time frame before 1 July. But let us start first of all at 1 February with sorting the field and going into the negotiations determined to work as hard as we can, as much as we can, but there are of course limits. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The 1 July deadline is important because, if the UK and the EU do want to extend the transition period for one year or for two years, as allowed under the withdrawal agreement, they have to decide that by that point.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said that after Brexit the UK and the EU would continue to be \u201cthe best of friends and partners\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said that after Brexit the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU would change.</strong> In her speech she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before. And it cannot and will not be as close as before \u2013 because with every choice comes a consequence. With every decision comes a trade-off. Without the free movement of people, you cannot have the free movement of capital, goods and services. Without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid, you cannot have the highest quality access to the world\u2019s largest single market.</p> \n   <p>The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But she did say the EU wanted a trade deal \u201cunprecedented in scope\u201d.</strong> In her speech she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are ready to design a new partnership with zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping. A partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope. Everything from climate action to data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space, financial services to security. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked in the Q&amp;A what she meant by a zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping relationship, she replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Zero quotas, zero tariffs, zero dumping means level playing field, clear level playing field, on both sides. So whatever is diverging from a level playing field decreases the uncomplicated access to the single market.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Brexit had strengthened faith in the EU project.</strong> In her speech she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One consequence of the Brexit vote has been to strengthen the unity and the faith in Europe as a project for the common good. The truth is that Brexit has highlighted the value of being together in today\u2019s ever more unsettled world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She praised the contribution of Britons to Europe and to the European Union.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Before the ashes of the second world war had even settled, it was Winston Churchill who made the best case for a united Europe. I read out passages from his 1946 Zurich speech the last time I was here \u2013 it is the most eloquent and powerful case for the European Union you could ever wish to read ....</p> \n   <p>As president of the European commission, I want to pay tribute today to all those British people who contributed so much to the 45-plus years of EU membership. I think of the British pragmatism and leadership when it came to opening up our union to members of our family who had been out in the cold for so long. The successive EU enlargements were historic steps for our continent and they bear the British hallmark. I think of those who helped to build our institutions.</p> \n   <p>People like Commissioner Arthur Cockfield who was known as the \u2018father of the single market\u2019. Or Roy Jenkins, president of the European commission while I was at LSE, who did so much to pave the way for our single currency. I think of the European civil servants of British nationality who devoted their lives and careers to Europe and have done so much to build our Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She stressed her love for the UK. </strong>Speaking about her time as a student at the LSE, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I got to know a warm, vibrant, colourful, multicultural society \u2013 the likes of which I had not really experienced before. I saw people from different walks of life going out together, enjoying life, breathing in freedom. I immersed myself in this melting pot of cultures, traditions and music. And I truly fell in love with this city and this country.</p> \n   <p>This country, strong-willed, open-minded and big hearted. Proud and patriotic.

Firstly, while the Greens would argue for a more radical reshaping of the economy than Labour, it seems inevitable they would back a Labour green new deal plan in parliament anyway.

In an interview on Wednesday morning, the former shadow defence minister said he did not believe the country needed nuclear weapons and that they did not act as a deterrent. </p> \n  <p>Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show about whether he would ever \u201cpress the nuclear button\u201d, Lewis said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I couldn\u2019t conceive of any circumstance where I would. Think about what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re wiping out millions of women and children and probably consigning the planet to perpetual night, darkness, death, famine, destruction.

I could not conceive of a situation where I would push the button.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The former infantry officer, who served on a three-month tour in Afghanistan in 2009, said the party was committed to paying for the renewal of the deterrent. However, he said his personal opinion was that were other means of defending the UK should it be threatened by a nuclear power. </p> \n  <p>Jeremy Corbyn has been a long-standing opponent of nuclear weapons but in November he said Britain\u2019s Vanguard submarine fleet, based at Faslane in Scotland, would continue if he became PM but would be part of the \u201cequation\u201d when it came to non-proliferation discussions. Lewis said: \u201cOur party policy is to renew [the nuclear deterrent].\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked how he would mark Corbyn out of 10 (in the light of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/rebecca-long-bailey-defends-corbyns-legacy-as-she-launches-labour-leadership-bid\">Rebecca Long Bailey\u2019s awarding Corbyn \u201c10 out of 10\u201d </a>on Tuesday), Lewis said he would give Corbyn six out of 10 for his performance during the election. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be 10 out of 10. I would say maybe six out of 10,\u201d he said. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There were mistakes made in terms of our position on Brexit and actually sticking to a position and understanding this was a rightwing, hard-right project and we should have stuck to our guns on our position from 2016. That\u2019s one of my own personal views.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stronger and better leadership was needed on antisemitism, he said, as well as a better strategy during the election campaign.

Well, it was obviously Sir Lindsay Hoyle, because he has transformed PMQs, getting it back down to a brisk, 30-minute event, instead of the sprawling fixture it was under John Bercow normally lasting the best part of an hour. Whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing, it is probably too early to tell, but it means that Hoyle has stamped his authority on the place. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were clearly warned in advance that they weren\u2019t going to be allowed to talk as much as in the Bercow era, and both questions and answers were tighter than in the past.</p> \n  <p>It was the first time Johnson has spoken in public about the Iran crisis \u2013 in fact, it was the first time he has spoken in public on anything in 2020 - and he came out with about the strongest endorsement heard so far from the UK government of the US decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Suleimani had supplied \u201cimprovised explosive devices to terrorists, which I\u2019m afraid killed and maimed British troops\u201d, he said. \u201cThat man had the blood of British troops on his hands.\u201d But even in this answer he avoided saying outright that the US attack was lawful, and overall Johnson sounded like someone who would rather be commenting on other matters, not this one. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/08/brexit-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-to-tell-eu-chief-at-first-meeting-that-trade-deal-wont-be-based-on-alignment-live-news?page=with:block-5e15aa4f8f08c39722646c3a#block-5e15aa4f8f08c39722646c3a\"> 10.14am.)</a></p> \n  <p>Corbyn has spent his life denouncing US warmongering and last week it felt as if President Trump\u2019s decision to order the killing of Suleimani vindicated everything the Labour leader has ever said about Washington being a threat to the world order. But he did not make that case very well at PMQs, and Johnson successfully brushed him aside. Ministers can\u2019t say clearly that they think the killing of Suleimani was a wise thing to do (presumably because they don\u2019t think it was \u2013 their support has been quite qualified) and they seem to have some doubts about the legality of the operation too. But it would have taken sustained, forensic questioning to get this to show up at PMQs, and Corbyn did not pull that off. He is obviously right about Johnson being nervous about criticising Trump in public. But British prime ministers are always wary of criticising US presidents, and so Corbyn\u2019s attempt to link this to sensitivities around a US trade deal was unconvincing. </p> \n  <p>But with the date for his departure already set, Corbyn could be forgiven for not operating at full pelt. Johnson seemed relatively disengaged in their exchanges too, and his anti-Corbyn put-downs felt rather underpowered. He seemed much more animated arguing with Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, but that is not surprising; looking ahead over the next five years, Scotland will be much more of a threat to his premiership than Corbyn.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b79079de-add5-4435-807e-173c761edd4c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MeCF3YEMbB4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T15:20:10.366Z\">at 3.20pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e15cbc68f087e8308e6aa3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T12:33:58.236Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Karl Turner</strong> asks about a constituent serving a life sentence.

We had additional time available for scrutiny of the bill, and yet we actually finished the scrutiny early because the house did not want to go into more detail.</p> \n   <p>So people speculate as to how much time is needed.

You might think some of the Brexiters have concluded that the whole process hasn\u2019t been quite the triumph that some of them were predicting in 2016. But it would be surprising if the UK-EU trade negotiating taking place this year does not end up being a front page story and, although that negotiation is not starting today, there will be an important landmark in the process when <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> holds his first meeting with the new president of the European commission, the former German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen. They will meet in Downing Street this afternoon, a few hours after Von der Leyen delivers a lecture on the UK-EU relationship at the LSE.</p> \n  <p>According to Downing Street, Johnson will tell Von der Leyen that he is firmly committed to wrapping up the negotiation this year (which many experts think is unrealistic), that he is firmly opposed to extending the post-Brexit transition period and that the new deal will not be based on \u201calignment\u201d with EU rules. In a statement last night Downing Street said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the leaders\u2019 first face to face meeting since Von der Leyen took office in December, the prime minister is expected to stress the importance of agreeing a confident and positive future relationship by the end of December 2020.</p> \n   <p>He is expected to tell President Von der Leyen that, having waited for over three years to get Brexit done, both British and EU citizens rightly expect negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement (FTA) to conclude on time. There will be no extension to the implementation period, which will end in December 2020 as set out in the political declaration. The withdrawal agreement bill enshrines this in UK law.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister will likely underline that the upcoming negotiations will be based on an ambitious FTA, not on alignment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As my colleague <strong>Jennifer Rankin </strong>reports, Von der Leyen is expected to tell Johnson that this might not be as beneficial for the UK as he thinks.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/1214821574089625600\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ursula von der Leyen meeting Boris Johnson today.

      "bodyText": "Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, has said it will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for the UK to negotiate a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of Brexit within the timeframe set by Boris Johnson. She also said Johnson should reconsider his decision to rule out extending the post-Brexit transition period. (See 2.29pm.) At the afternoon lobby briefing a spokesman for the PM said this would not happen. He said: The prime minister has been clear that the implementation period will end at the end of this year and we will work with the European Union to negotiate an FTA [free trade agreement]. Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour leadership campaign has received a boost after he won the backing of the UK\u2019s biggest trade union, Unison, and became the first person to get more than the 22 MPs required to become a candidate. Boris Johnson has strongly backed the US\u2019s decision to kill the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a missile strike, telling prime minister\u2019s questions that while he could not comment on the legality of the act, \u201cmost reasonable people\u201d would think the operation was justified. The UK could introduce tariffs on imports of food from countries with lower food safety and farming standards than the UK, using World Trade Organization rules, Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, has suggested. MPs have voted down proposals to enshrine protections for child refugees as part of the government\u2019s Brexit agreement. As the Press Association reports, following his election victory, Boris Johnson re-drafted his European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill and rowed back on the previous government\u2019s acceptance of an amendment from Labour peer Lord Dubs to allow unaccompanied child refugees to continue to be reunited with their families in the UK after exit day. Clause 37 of the bill replaces the pledge with a watered-down vow for ministers to \u201cmake a statement\u201d on the progress of the talks once the divorce with Brussels is complete. An attempt to re-instate the Dubs provision was defeated this afternoon by a majority of 96 votes. This is from the Green MP Caroline Lucas. Three MEPs who quit - and one who was sacked by - the Brexit party have joined the Conservatives. Annunziata Rees-Mogg - sister of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg - Lance Forman and Lucy Harris resigned the Brexit party whip only a week before the election to back the PM\u2019s push to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. As the Press Association reports, they were joined in backing Boris Johnson by John Longworth, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce who was sacked for \u201crepeatedly undermining\u201d leader Nigel Farage\u2019s election strategy only days before the trio\u2019s walkout. The four confirmed they have switched allegiance to become Tory MEPs in the European parliament, in a move that will more than double the number of Conservatives in Brussels. It takes the number of Tory representatives to seven. Airbnb-style short-term lets could be subject to new licensing schemes from spring next year, the Scottish government has announced. As the Press Association reports, as well as handing councils the power to bring in licensing schemes, local authorities will in future be able to designate new control areas for short-term lets, with those wanting to let out properties in this way first having to obtain planning permission. The measures are being introduced following concerns about the impact such lets have on areas such as Edinburgh - one of the most popular places for Airbnb listings. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, who attended the meeting in Dowing Street with Boris Johnson alongside Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission. From LabourList\u2019s Sienna Rodgers Jon Lansman is head of Momentum, the Labour organisation set up for Jeremy Corbyn supporters. And Matt Zarb-Cousin is a former press spokesman for Corbyn. Here is Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and Labour leadership candidate, responding to news that Unison is backing his campaign. Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen have been reminiscing about the fact that they attended the same school in Brussels during their meeting in No 10. Their fathers both worked for the European commission, and so they both attended the European school in Brussels, although not at the same time. The Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster has a good take on the exchanges. Northern Ireland businesses have vowed to take their fight for a Brexit mitigation package to the House of Lords any beyond. And they have dared the government to \u201cprove it\u201d after the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker told MPs that \u201cthis deal is a good deal for both businesses and individuals in Northern Ireland.\u201d An amendment proposing cash compensation for the extra disruption they will face post-Brexit because of checks on goods crossing the Irish sea was comprehensively defeated by 75 voters in the Commons, as was a proposal for an annual review of the new arrangements if the impact of Brexit is adverse. \u201cThe fight will go on in the House of Lords, at Committees and with the EU. We are determined to protect NI families and the affordability and choice they enjoy,\u201d the business groups said in a statement. The 12 business groups backing the amendment include the Ulster Farmers Union and the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland. So far there have been four votes on amendments to the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill in the Commons this afternoon. The government has won them all very easily. Here is a rather sad tweet from Laura Smith, who was Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich until she lost her seat in the election. These are from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, who has been at the afternoon Downing Street lobby briefing. The Labour leadership candidates have mostly been wary of criticising Jeremy Corbyn directly, but they have been more willing to have a go at his advisers and none more so than Emily Thornberry, who in an interview before Christmas effectively called for Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy, who have been Corbyn\u2019s two most powerful aides, to be sacked. Today Thornberry has escalated her attack, saying that unnamed \u201cadvisers\u201d in Corbyn\u2019s office tried to remove a line from the 2019 manifesto criticising rocket and terror attacks by Palestinian groups against Israel. In a blog for Jewish News she says: Even that didn\u2019t prepare me for the battle I had over Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto, where the advisers around Jeremy Corbyn proposed to amend the language we had used in the 2017 version to remove the condemnation of rocket and terror attacks by Palestinian groups against Israel, while rightly continuing to condemn the illegal occupation of Palestinian land and the blockade of Gaza. When I repeatedly complained that this was utterly unacceptable, I was told by Jeremy\u2019s office that they thought this was \u201cvery balanced considering the considerable imbalance in the conflict\u201d. Disgustingly, attacks on Israeli civilians were being deliberately dismissed in a way that would never have been tolerated of attacks on any civilians in any other country around the world. At Labour\u2019s clause V meeting to agree the manifesto, I finally won the argument, and succeeded in reverting the proposed text to the 2017 language, but the whole process left me deeply disturbed at the mentality of the advisers around Jeremy. In a passage on Israel and Palestine the manifesto said: All sides must avoid taking action that would make peace harder to achieve. That means both an end to the blockade, occupation and settlements, and an end to rocket and terror attacks. In the blog Thornberry says she does not think Corbyn was aware that his advisers were trying to make sure the manifesto did not contain implicit criticism of groups like Hamas. She says: As for Jeremy, based on his reaction at the meeting, I think he knew nothing about the row, even though his advisers had invoked his name several times beforehand when pressuring me to drop my objections, something I believe they frequently did without his knowledge. She also says the party needs to be much tougher with antisemites in the party. She says: If I was leader ... driving antisemitism out of Labour would be my most urgent and immediate priority. No more suspensions, training sessions, or forgiveness, I would just kick these scumbags out of our party, the way we should have done long before now. Corbyn\u2019s office has been asked to comment, but has not replied yet. I will post their response if I get one. A government minister has said there will be \u201creporting requirements\u201d for goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. But Robin Walker, a Northern Ireland minister, told MPs during the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill: \u201cIt is clear there are reporting requirements in terms of the functioning of the protocol.\u201d But Walker said the checks would be light touch. He said: What we want to ensure is, as set out in article 6 [promising unfettered access] of the [Northern Ireland] protocol, that we use the joint committee in that to reduce those and make sure we have the absolute minimum burden. Walker added he recognised the concerns of businesses over checks because of Brexit and the government would seek to minimise them. They are demanding cash compensation that could run to more than \u00a3100m for the disruption caused by Brexit. Walker said the government recognised the \u201cstrong voice\u201d and concerns of Northern Ireland businesses but article 6 of the withdrawal agreement NI protocol gave the government the power to ensure \u201cunfettered\u201d access. He said: The prime minister has been absolutely clear, that beyond our obligations under international law, there will be no new checks or processes on the movement of such goods and our manifesto commitment is absolutely clear the bill gives us the power to deliver this. Unison, the largest union in the UK, has endorsed Sir Keir Starmer for next Labour leader. Starmer has already become the first candidate to get the required number of nominations from MPs (see 11.18am) and the Unison endorsement means that he can be confident of clearing the other nomination threshold: getting the support of either 10% of CLPs, or 5% of the affiliate vote. Unison accounts for more than 5% of the affiliate vote. Under Labour rules Starmer needs another two affiliated organisations to back him \u2013 either trade unions or socialist societies. Given the support he is already attracting, he is certain to achieve this. Explaining Unison\u2019s decision, Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, said: This is a pivotal time for Labour. We believe \u2013 if elected by the membership \u2013 Keir Starmer would be a leader to bring the party together and win back the trust of the thousands of voters who deserted Labour last month. Unions created the Labour party to give working people a voice in Westminster. But it can only achieve for them, their families, their communities and the country\u2019s public services when in government. Keir has a clear vision to get Labour back to the winning ways of the past. He is best placed to take on Boris Johnson, hold his government to account and ensure Labour can return to power and once more change working people\u2019s lives for the better. Here is the full text of the speech by Ursula Von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission, at the LSE earlier. Here is my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s write-up. And here are the key points. Von der Leyen said it would be impossible to negotiate a full UK-EU trade deal by the end of this year. Boris Johnson claims it will be possible to conclude the negotiations within this time frame. But in her speech Von der Leyen said: The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be. And without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership. She went even further in the Q&amp;A, saying: The transition time - it is very, very tight. I briefly [in the speech] touched on the topics we have to negotiate, and this was not even the whole list. It is basically impossible to negotiate all of what I\u2019ve been mentioning ... Therefore we will have to prioritise as long as we face that deadline of the end of 2020. I can only recommend that we prioritise in a way we first of all tackle those topics where, at the end of the year, when we are running out of time, we will not have an international agreement or something to fall back on, but only a hard exit, which would not be good for the UK, nor would it be good for the European Union. Therefore the priorities will have to be sorted out. She urged Johnson to reconsider his opposition to an extension of the post-Brexit transition period. Johnson has amended the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill to make it illegal for the government to agree an extension with the EU. But Von der Leyen said this option should remain open. In the Q&amp;A she said: I would prefer that we look at the whole scenery during the summer, or before the summer starts would be better, because we might together want to take reconsideration of the time frame before 1 July. But let us start first of all at 1 February with sorting the field and going into the negotiations determined to work as hard as we can, as much as we can, but there are of course limits. The 1 July deadline is important because, if the UK and the EU do want to extend the transition period for one year or for two years, as allowed under the withdrawal agreement, they have to decide that by that point. She said that after Brexit the UK and the EU would continue to be \u201cthe best of friends and partners\u201d. She said that after Brexit the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU would change. In her speech she said: The truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before. And it cannot and will not be as close as before \u2013 because with every choice comes a consequence. With every decision comes a trade-off. Without the free movement of people, you cannot have the free movement of capital, goods and services. Without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid, you cannot have the highest quality access to the world\u2019s largest single market. The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be. But she did say the EU wanted a trade deal \u201cunprecedented in scope\u201d. In her speech she said: We are ready to design a new partnership with zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping. A partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope. Everything from climate action to data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space, financial services to security. When asked in the Q&amp;A what she meant by a zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping relationship, she replied: Zero quotas, zero tariffs, zero dumping means level playing field, clear level playing field, on both sides. So whatever is diverging from a level playing field decreases the uncomplicated access to the single market. She said Brexit had strengthened faith in the EU project. In her speech she said: One consequence of the Brexit vote has been to strengthen the unity and the faith in Europe as a project for the common good. The truth is that Brexit has highlighted the value of being together in today\u2019s ever more unsettled world. She praised the contribution of Britons to Europe and to the European Union. She said: Before the ashes of the second world war had even settled, it was Winston Churchill who made the best case for a united Europe. I read out passages from his 1946 Zurich speech the last time I was here \u2013 it is the most eloquent and powerful case for the European Union you could ever wish to read .... As president of the European commission, I want to pay tribute today to all those British people who contributed so much to the 45-plus years of EU membership. I think of the British pragmatism and leadership when it came to opening up our union to members of our family who had been out in the cold for so long. The successive EU enlargements were historic steps for our continent and they bear the British hallmark. I think of those who helped to build our institutions. People like Commissioner Arthur Cockfield who was known as the \u2018father of the single market\u2019. Or Roy Jenkins, president of the European commission while I was at LSE, who did so much to pave the way for our single currency. I think of the European civil servants of British nationality who devoted their lives and careers to Europe and have done so much to build our Union. She stressed her love for the UK. Speaking about her time as a student at the LSE, she said: I got to know a warm, vibrant, colourful, multicultural society \u2013 the likes of which I had not really experienced before. I saw people from different walks of life going out together, enjoying life, breathing in freedom. I immersed myself in this melting pot of cultures, traditions and music. And I truly fell in love with this city and this country. This country, strong-willed, open-minded and big hearted. Proud and patriotic. Kind and generous in spirit. Clive Lewis, the Labour leadership hopeful, has revealed plans for increased cooperation with the Greens if he takes over from Jeremy Corbyn, highlighting what seems likely to be an increasing focus for Labour as it comes to terms with its latest election defeat. Lewis, the Norwich South MP and shadow Treasury minister, said that if he became leader he would seek to work directly with the Greens on a so-called green new deal, the idea of investing heavily to transform the economy on a sustainable basis. He said: We need a new politics of collaboration and openness as the building blocks of the political forces and practices necessary for progressives to take power nationally by 2024 at the latest. The Greens\u2019 sole MP, Caroline Lucas, said she welcomed the idea of cooperation on the green new deal, an idea pioneered in the UK by her party. In practical terms this probably won\u2019t make much difference, for two reasons. Firstly, while the Greens would argue for a more radical reshaping of the economy than Labour, it seems inevitable they would back a Labour green new deal plan in parliament anyway. Also, Lewis is currently seen as an outsider to win the leadership contest. But it is nonetheless a notable move, cementing ideas of the so-called progressive alliance on the left as a way to circumvent the first-past-the-post electoral system. Lewis himself is a notable Labour proponent of proportional representation, which does tend to necessitate closer cross-party collaboration. Speaking to reporters after PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said it was \u201chard to see\u201d how the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a US drone strike could be justified as a legal action. The spokesman said: Since the assassination of senior officials, generals, or ministers of internationally recognised governments is, on the face of it, entirely illegal in international law, that defence \u2013 the defence of an imminent threat \u2013 has to be made public for there to be any question of there being legality around it. No such evidence has been forthcoming and, on the face of it, it\u2019s hard to see how that would be the case. But, of course, if that was produced by the US government then that would have to be taken seriously. The spokesman also said if the Iraqi government called for the expulsion of foreign troops then the British government should respect that. Following the decision of the Iraqi parliament by 175 votes to none to request the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Iraq, if that is subsequently requested by the sovereign Iraqi government then that must be respected. If Iraq is a sovereign country, and the British government and the US government have always said that that was their intention following the invasion and occupation of Iraq, then that sovereignty must be respected and if such a request is made then that should be respected. He also said there should be an emergency meeting of the UN security council to de-escalate the crisis. Here is my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s story on the Ursula von der Leyen speech. And this is how it starts. The president of the European commission has said it will be \u201cimpossible\u201d for the UK to negotiate a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of Brexit within the timeframe set by Boris Johnson. Speaking before her first face-to-face bilateral meeting with the prime minister in Downing Street on Wednesday, Ursula von der Leyen said the price of the clean-break Brexit the prime minister was pursuing was a \u201cdistant\u201d partnership with the EU. Unless the UK accepted a level playing field in the UK and EU\u2019s trade positions after Brexit, there would inevitably be barriers for British manufacturing, she said in a speech at the London School of Economics. Labour leadership hopeful Clive Lewis has said he cannot think of any reason why he would authorise the use of Britain\u2019s nuclear weapons should he ever become prime minister. In an interview on Wednesday morning, the former shadow defence minister said he did not believe the country needed nuclear weapons and that they did not act as a deterrent. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show about whether he would ever \u201cpress the nuclear button\u201d, Lewis said: I couldn\u2019t conceive of any circumstance where I would. Think about what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re wiping out millions of women and children and probably consigning the planet to perpetual night, darkness, death, famine, destruction. Why would any politician want to boast about pushing the nuclear destruction of billions of people on this planet? I find that quite difficult. I could not conceive of a situation where I would push the button. The former infantry officer, who served on a three-month tour in Afghanistan in 2009, said the party was committed to paying for the renewal of the deterrent. However, he said his personal opinion was that were other means of defending the UK should it be threatened by a nuclear power. Jeremy Corbyn has been a long-standing opponent of nuclear weapons but in November he said Britain\u2019s Vanguard submarine fleet, based at Faslane in Scotland, would continue if he became PM but would be part of the \u201cequation\u201d when it came to non-proliferation discussions. Lewis said: \u201cOur party policy is to renew [the nuclear deterrent].\u201d Asked how he would mark Corbyn out of 10 (in the light of Rebecca Long Bailey\u2019s awarding Corbyn \u201c10 out of 10\u201d on Tuesday), Lewis said he would give Corbyn six out of 10 for his performance during the election. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be 10 out of 10. I would say maybe six out of 10,\u201d he said. He explained: There were mistakes made in terms of our position on Brexit and actually sticking to a position and understanding this was a rightwing, hard-right project and we should have stuck to our guns on our position from 2016. That\u2019s one of my own personal views. Stronger and better leadership was needed on antisemitism, he said, as well as a better strategy during the election campaign. The individual policies in the manifesto were correctly \u201cradical\u201d, he said, but it needed to be explained that they would take place over several years and not all in one go. Who won? Well, it was obviously Sir Lindsay Hoyle, because he has transformed PMQs, getting it back down to a brisk, 30-minute event, instead of the sprawling fixture it was under John Bercow normally lasting the best part of an hour. Whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing, it is probably too early to tell, but it means that Hoyle has stamped his authority on the place. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were clearly warned in advance that they weren\u2019t going to be allowed to talk as much as in the Bercow era, and both questions and answers were tighter than in the past. It was the first time Johnson has spoken in public about the Iran crisis \u2013 in fact, it was the first time he has spoken in public on anything in 2020 - and he came out with about the strongest endorsement heard so far from the UK government of the US decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Suleimani had supplied \u201cimprovised explosive devices to terrorists, which I\u2019m afraid killed and maimed British troops\u201d, he said. \u201cThat man had the blood of British troops on his hands.\u201d But even in this answer he avoided saying outright that the US attack was lawful, and overall Johnson sounded like someone who would rather be commenting on other matters, not this one. (See 10.14am.) Corbyn has spent his life denouncing US warmongering and last week it felt as if President Trump\u2019s decision to order the killing of Suleimani vindicated everything the Labour leader has ever said about Washington being a threat to the world order. But he did not make that case very well at PMQs, and Johnson successfully brushed him aside. Ministers can\u2019t say clearly that they think the killing of Suleimani was a wise thing to do (presumably because they don\u2019t think it was \u2013 their support has been quite qualified) and they seem to have some doubts about the legality of the operation too. But it would have taken sustained, forensic questioning to get this to show up at PMQs, and Corbyn did not pull that off. He is obviously right about Johnson being nervous about criticising Trump in public. But British prime ministers are always wary of criticising US presidents, and so Corbyn\u2019s attempt to link this to sensitivities around a US trade deal was unconvincing. But with the date for his departure already set, Corbyn could be forgiven for not operating at full pelt. Johnson seemed relatively disengaged in their exchanges too, and his anti-Corbyn put-downs felt rather underpowered. He seemed much more animated arguing with Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, but that is not surprising; looking ahead over the next five years, Scotland will be much more of a threat to his premiership than Corbyn. Labour\u2019s Karl Turner asks about a constituent serving a life sentence. But the constituent was also one of the people who tackled the terrorist in the London Bridge attack. Will the PM congratulate him? Johnson says he hopes this gallantry is respected in the usual way. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. The SNP\u2019s Douglas Chapman says the SNP\u2019s mandate is much stronger than Johnson\u2019s. He says the Scottish government has an \u201coven-ready\u201d plan for an independence referendum. When will discussions begin? Johnson says he has already addressed this. Asked what he has done to restore the Iran nuclear deal, Johnson says the UK still thinks the JCPOA is the best way forward. He says he thinks that way forward will remain. It is a shell at the moment. But it is a shell into which substance can be put. Labour\u2019s Colleen Fletcher asks Johnson to support a new walk-in centre for Coventry. Johnson refers this one to the health secretary too, saying he is sure he will be able to do something about it. Dehenna Davison, a new Conservative MP, asks about the NHS. Johnson congratulates Davison on her election victory. He says the health secretary is looking into the matter raised by Davison. Shailesh Vara, a Conservative, asks the PM if he agrees that overseas companies would invest in Northern Ireland if the assembly were revived. Johnson says the UK is the third highest recipient of inward investment in the world. Northern Ireland could get more with the assembly up and running, he says. David Morris, a Conservative, says the north of England needs an Eden project. Does the PM support it going to Morecambe? Johnson says Sajid Javid, the chancellor, tells him the Eden project is \u201cvery likely\u201d to come to Morecombe. The SNP\u2019s Brendan O\u2019Hara says Margaret Thatcher and other Tory leaders accepted the union with Scotland would only survive by consent. What mechanism is available to the Scottish people to give their consent to maintaining the union, he says. Johnson says the Scottish people had a mechanism, they used it in 2014, and it was a once-in-a-generation vote, he says. Labour\u2019s Ian Murray asks Johnson to accept that he will be responsible for any negative consequences from Brexit. Johnson says, contrary to the claims of doomsters, unemployment is at a record low. He will get Brexit done, he says. Johnson says he will chair a new cabinet committee to drive forward change on climate change. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Hywel Williams asks what the PM\u2019s vision is for the relationship between Wales and England. Johnson says he wants it to go from strength to strength. Paul Holmes, a Conservative, asks about a Lib Dem housing plan for Eastleigh. Johnson says the government wants more home on brownfield sites. Fiona Bruce, a Conservative, asks what the government will do to support troubled families? Johnson says it was thanks to Bruce that \u201cfamily hubs\u201d were proposed in the Tory manifesto. They will be introduced, he says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks: who should decide the future of Scotland \u2013 the PM, or the people of Scotland? Johnson says the people of Scotland decided to stay part of the UK. Blackford says this is about democracy. That provokes some laughter from MPs. Blackford says people voted for the SNP. Why is the Tory government dismissing the will of the people of Scotland? Johnson says the real question is why the SNP keeps going on about breaking up the most successful union in history to distract from its appalling domestic record. Penny Mordaunt, a Conservative, asks how many people are being held in inappropriate adult social care settings, like Winterbourne View. Johnson says the number is 2,190, but it is coming down. Corbyn says he asked if the UK would respect the sovereignty of Iraq. He says Johnson did not answer. He says the UK has not been putting the interests of the UK first. He says Johnson has been prioritising his relationship with President Trump. He is not standing up for the UK because he has prioritised a trade deal with the US. Johnson says he was waiting for the \u201clittle green men\u201d to come out at the end of Corbyn\u2019s contribution, implying that Corbyn is reciting a conspiracy. He says Corbyn took \u00a310,000 from Iranian TV. He says he is surprised the Corbyn has yet to condemn Suleimani\u2019s activities. Johnson says the British government should be doing everything it can to protect the integrity of Iraq. Corbyn asks what evidence there is that the killing of Suleimani was legal. Johnson says it is not for the UK government to provide this evidence. But he refers to Suleimani\u2019s record. He says Suleimani helped orchestrate bomb attacks on British troops in the region. He had the blood of British troops on his hands, he says. Corbyn asks what representations the PM will make to President Trump to make sure the Iranian foreign minister can attend the UN in New York. Johnson says the US is obliged to let people attend the UN. Jeremy Corbyn starts by paying tribute to Andrew Miller, the former Labour MP who died on Christmas Eve. He says the Australian fires are a warning of what climate change does. He asks the PM to confirm that he opposes any further retaliation or violence in the Middle East. Johnson says of course he can confirm that. He says the UK has been working with its EU allies to urge a de-escalation. But he says the EU three criticised the \u201cbaleful\u201d role played by Qassem Suleimani. He says Corbyn has not condemned Suleimani in the same way. Corbyn ignores this, and asks Johnson if is he confident that UK personnel in the region are safe. Johnson says non-essential personnel have been moved. The government wants to de-escalate this, he says. Andrew Lewer, a Conservative, asks for a review of the rules affecting benefit claimants with terminal illnesses. Johnson says the DWP is reviewing these rules. Boris Johnson starts by condemning the Iranian attacks on US bases. He says Iran should not pursue these attacks. He offers condolences to those affected by the Australian bushfires, and by the crash of a Ukrainian airliner. Boris Johnson is taking PMQs now. Q: Would it be possible to negotiate parts of a trade deal this year, and then conclude it after 2020? Or is it all or nothing? Von der Leyen says it will be \u201cimpossible\u201d to conclude a comprehensive deal by the end of this year. It is impossible to negotiate all of what I have been mentioning [in 2020] ... Therefore we will have to prioritise. She says therefore they should prioritise negotiating on issues where, if there is no deal by the end of 2020, there is a fall-back that does not involve \u201cno deal\u201d. Von der Leyen says getting a comprehensive UK-EU trade deal by the end of 2020 will be \u201cimpossible\u201d. She says she would like both sides to consider where they are before the summer, so that they can \u201creconsider the timeframe\u201d. Von der Leyen says she does not want to rule out extending the trade talks beyond 2020. Johnson has ruled this out. Here is the full text of the Von der Leyen speech. Ursula von der Leyen is now taking questions \u2013 from students in the audience, and from journalists. Q: Are you concerned about the UK watering down its protections for EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit? How should the UK respond? Von der Leyen says of course this is a pressing issue. She says there are around 3.5 million EU nationals living in the UK, and around 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries. The good news is people will be able to stay where they work and live until the end of their lives, she says. Q: What will the security arrangements be like after Brexit? Von der Leyen says the UK will be a third country after Brexit. There are rules that prevent third countries being involved in agencies like the European Defence Agency. But these rules are being reviewed. She says she wants the EU to be clear-minded, and for it to build an unprecedented security partnership. Talking about relations with China, Von der Leyen says it is important for the EU to be very clear on issues where it disagrees with China. For example, the cybersphere. But on other issues, like climate change, the two sides have the same agenda. Here is some Twitter commentary on the speech from Peter Foster, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor. Von der Leyen says Brexit does not just mark the end of something. It marks the beginning of a new relationship, she says. Addressing her audience, she says young people can shape this future. Von der Leyen says the EU\u2019s priority will be to protect the single market. But she says the EU is willing to offer a trade deal including zero tariffs, zero quotas, and zero dumping. It can go well beyond trade and be \u201cunprecedented in scope\u201d, she says. She says the EU is willing to work day and night to achieve this. It must be ambitious in scope, she says. Here is the key quote. Von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will still share the same values after Brexit, as well as the same geography and history. As one door closes, another will open, she says. She says now is the time to look forward, time \u201cfor the best and oldest friends to build a new future together\u201d. She says during the first stage of the Brexit negotiations, the uncertainty about whether Brexit would happen caused difficulties. Now there will be more clarity, she says. She says the EU wants to go as far as it can in building the new relationship. But the relationship will not be as close as before. Without free movement of people, you cannot have free movement of capital and services, she says. And without a level playing field, the UK cannot have full access to the single market. She says both sides will have to prioritise in the talks. Von der Leyen says the UK and the EU will still be \u201cthe best of friends and partners\u201d after Brexit. And they will still have a lot to learn from each other. Von der Leyen is now paying tribute to the contribution of individual Britons to the EU, like Roy Jenkins, a former president of the commission, and Lord Cockfield, a European commissioner. Cockfield helped to pave the way for the single market, she says. Ursula von der Leyen is speaking now. She says she spent just a year at the LSE, but she learned a lot while she was here. The time she spent here \u201copened my eyes\u201d, she says. She saw a warm, vibrant, multicultural society. She fell in love with London, and with the UK. The UK is strong-willed, open-minded, patriotic, kind and generous, and full of contradictions, she says. She says she learned there can be a hidden meaning in every sentence. Before and after the referendum she thought about this period a lot \u2013 not just because of her love for the UK, but because of what the UK has contributed to Europe. She says it was Winston Churchill who made the best case for a united Europe. She says his Zurich speech is the best case made for a united Europe. At the LSE Minouche Shafik, the LSE director, is introducing Ursula von der Leyen. Shafik says that Von der Leyen was a student of the LSE, and that her daughter has studied there too. Sir Keir Starmer has become the first Labour leadership candidate to get the 22 nominations from MPs that he needs to be on the ballot, Sky\u2019s Sam Coates reports. But Starmer, and all the other candidates, will also need to clear the threshold from nominations either from CLPs or from affiliates. The details of those rules are here. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission, is due to start her lecture at the LSE on UK-EU relations very soon. From Politico Europe\u2019s Cristina Gallardo Yesterday Rebecca Long Bailey, a candidate for the Labour leadership, said she would give Jeremy Corbyn 10 out of 10 as a leader. On Sky News a few minutes ago Margaret Hodge, the Labour former minister and one of Corbyn\u2019s most outspoken critics in the PLP, said this was \u201ccrazy\u201d. Hodge, who is supporting Jess Phillips for leader, told the programme: I think Rebecca Long Bailey would be a disaster for the Labour party ... For Rebecca Long Bailey to give 10 out of 10 to Corbyn when we\u2019ve all come back from the election where on the doorstep Corbyn was a huge problem, to deny that is crazy. And to say that it\u2019s all the media\u2019s fault is an insult to the intelligence of the electorate. What was so interesting about this election was that people sussed what Labour was about in the offer we were giving, and they voted against it. If you don\u2019t hear that, if you don\u2019t listen to that, you are actually condemning the Labour party to history. Labour MPs are currently listening to candidates for the deputy leadership speak at a private hustings organised by the parliamentary Labour party (PLP). One of the candidates is Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, and according to extracts from his speech released by his office, he is saying that he would like to be a campaigning deputy leader in the style of John Prescott. Burgon says: Whoever is leader \u2013 I\u2019ll be a team player. I don\u2019t see this job as an alternative pole to the leader. Or as leader in-waiting. It\u2019s important in its own right. When I joined the party back in the mid-90s, I was impressed by how John Prescott used it as a campaigning role. I\u2019ll be a campaigning deputy leader, one focused on getting us election-ready to win local, mayoral and devolved elections \u2013 but most importantly to win that next general election. One focused on powerful local campaigning to demonstrate to those communities, whose trust we\u2019ve lost, that we\u2019re on their side. The reference to a \u201cleader-in-waiting\u201d deputy will be seen as a jibe at Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, who is seen as favourite in the deputy leadership contest. Some of her supporters think that she would be a good leader now, and that if she wins the deputy leadership, that will put her in a strong position to take the top job next time round. Burgon\u2019s speech also repeats some of the points he made in his pre-Christmas Tribune article, saying Labour\u2019s election defeat was largely down to Brexit and that a special commission should be set up to consider how it can win back leave voters. In an interview this morning Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, rejected claims that Boris Johnson should have taken a higher public profile over the Iran crisis. Although No 10 has issued statements, Johnson has not been speaking about it in public, and yesterday he got Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, to give an oral statement to the Commons on the subject, instead of doing it himself. But Barclay said it was not fair to say Johnson had been absent. He said: The prime minister has been engaging, he has been speaking on a regular basis with world leaders, he is continuing to do that today, as are my colleagues across government. According to Annabelle Dickson at Politico Europe, Johnson is deliberately keeping a low profile on this issue. In her story she says: According to officials familiar with the thinking in Downing Street, the prime minister\u2019s decision to delegate the foreign policy spotlight to other cabinet ministers \u2013 leaving Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to do the flagship media interviews and Wallace to face MPs in the Commons \u2014 is deliberate. It is also a sign of things to come. The prime minister will make domestic priorities such as the UK\u2019s public health care system, the National Health Service, and rebalancing the economy toward the north of England and the Midlands his public focus, according to one official. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has caught up with yesterday\u2019s news that the government is looking for a career civil servant to replace Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington. Farage used to claim that he did not want the job himself, despite Donald Trump once saying he would be ideal for the role, but judging from this tweet, perhaps he was still hoping that he, or one of his Brexit party chums, would get the call. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has been giving interviews this morning (although not to the BBC\u2019s Today programme, which is still subject to a No 10 boycott for reasons that have never been properly explained by Downing Street). Judging by the interviews I did hear, Today didn\u2019t miss much, but Barclay did use a new argument to justify the government\u2019s claim that it will be possible to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020. This is what he told Radio 5 Live: When you say there needs to be this much time for parliamentary scrutiny and so forth, just look at what happened in the House of Commons yesterday. When I was involved in the withdrawal agreement bill in the previous parliament, I was constantly being told that there needed to be much more time for parliamentary scrutiny, that the House of Commons needed to be able to go through the bill in great detail, that it was a very significant bill, and that the time put forward by the government was insufficient. We had time yesterday in parliament that was not used. We had additional time available for scrutiny of the bill, and yet we actually finished the scrutiny early because the house did not want to go into more detail. So people speculate as to how much time is needed. I\u2019m optimistic about the deal. Both sides have said they want to have a close partnership. The commission president is here as part of that commitment and discussion on the EU side. Barclay is right about the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill debate taking much less time than expected yesterday. Eight hours had been set aside for the first day of the committee stage debate. Yet MPs started voting after less than three and a half hours of debate. There were three divisions but the government won them all, with majorities of 90, 86 and 92 respectively. The era of knife-edge Brexit votes is well and truly behind us. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has posted a helpful thread on Twitter about the talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street today. It starts here. It is worth reading the thread in full (just click on the link above), but here is a key assessment. One of Boris Johnson\u2019s ambitions for 2020, apparently, is to turn Brexit into a story for the business pages and not the front pages (assuming he fails in his reported ambition to get people to stop using the word altogether). You might think some of the Brexiters have concluded that the whole process hasn\u2019t been quite the triumph that some of them were predicting in 2016. But it would be surprising if the UK-EU trade negotiating taking place this year does not end up being a front page story and, although that negotiation is not starting today, there will be an important landmark in the process when Boris Johnson holds his first meeting with the new president of the European commission, the former German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen. They will meet in Downing Street this afternoon, a few hours after Von der Leyen delivers a lecture on the UK-EU relationship at the LSE. According to Downing Street, Johnson will tell Von der Leyen that he is firmly committed to wrapping up the negotiation this year (which many experts think is unrealistic), that he is firmly opposed to extending the post-Brexit transition period and that the new deal will not be based on \u201calignment\u201d with EU rules. In a statement last night Downing Street said: At the leaders\u2019 first face to face meeting since Von der Leyen took office in December, the prime minister is expected to stress the importance of agreeing a confident and positive future relationship by the end of December 2020. He is expected to tell President Von der Leyen that, having waited for over three years to get Brexit done, both British and EU citizens rightly expect negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement (FTA) to conclude on time. There will be no extension to the implementation period, which will end in December 2020 as set out in the political declaration. The withdrawal agreement bill enshrines this in UK law. The prime minister will likely underline that the upcoming negotiations will be based on an ambitious FTA, not on alignment. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, Von der Leyen is expected to tell Johnson that this might not be as beneficial for the UK as he thinks. Von der Leyen and Johnson will not be holding a press conference, and so it is not clear quite how much we will learn about what gets said at their meeting, but I will be covering everything that does emerge in full. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Candidates for the Labour party deputy leadership take part in a private hustings for Labour MPs in the Commons. 10am: MPs start voting in a ballot to elect two deputy Speakers. These two posts are both for Conservative MPs, and there are five candidates. 11.15am: Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, gives a speech at the LSE in London entitled \u201cOld Friends, New Beginnings: building another future for the EU-UK partnership.\u201d 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 12.30pm: MPs resume their debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. 3.30pm: Von der Leyen meets Johnson in Downing Street. The Iran crisis is likely to come up at PMQs, and of course I will be covering what gets said there, but generally I will be leaving coverage of developments in this story to our separate live blog, which you can read here. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Reporters were shown some documents which -- apparently -- explain away the $11m of dubious expense payments.<br></p> \n  <p>He also produced a letter approving the houses bought for the Ghosn family, signed by Saikawa.</p> \n  <p>Ghosn says he plans to prove his innocence.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t consider myself as a prisoner in Lebanon. I prefer this prison to the one before.</p> \n   <p>I am ready to stay a long time in Lebanon, but I am going to fight because I have to clear my name.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>4) He\u2019s burned his bridges in Japan.</strong> Savaging the Tokyo prosecutor is one thing. But citing Pearl Harbor as an example of Japanese cunning and secrecy is to deploy the diplomatic skills of Basil Fawlty. </p> \n  <p>Ghosn\u2019s point is that he didn\u2019t spot how his one-time allies were plotting to boot him out, to break Renault\u2019s control over Nissan - and scupper a planned merged with Fiat-Crysler. But still, it was a poor analogy that will distract from Ghosn\u2019s claims of innocence.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) He\u2019s devoted to Mrs Ghosn. </strong>I think Ghosn was trying to be chivalrous when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/08/gold-oil-as-us-iran-markets-carlos-ghosn-nissan-escape-business-live?page=with:block-5e15ef048f085eda5c114522#block-5e15ef048f085eda5c114522\"> he joked that he missed his wife badly when he was trapped in Japan, even if others might not</a>.</p> \n  <p>As he touchingly put it:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months.</p> \n   <p>It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This love is not unrequited -- Carole has spoken about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/carlos-ghosns-wife-says-his-escape-from-japan-was-beautiful-surprise\">how her husband\u2019s return was a \u201cbeautiful surprise\u201d</a>.

But there <strong><em>is</em></strong> a law banning travel to Israel, which Ghosn has broken in the past.</p> \n  <p>Beirut\u2019s prosecutor wants to discuss this with Ghosn tomorrow, alongside the Red Notice issued by Interpol for his arrest.</p> \n  <p><strong>7) Be honest, you were hoping to hear Ghosn confirm whether he was bundled out of Toyko in a big musical box.</strong><strong> I certainly was</strong>. But on this point, he remained tight-lipped. Perhaps he\u2019s saving it for the film version (although he denies that there\u2019s a deal with Netflix).</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T16:14:47.287Z\">at 4.14pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e15f3c78f087e8308e6ac39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T15:26:17.694Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>After two and half hours, Carlos Ghosn\u2019s press conference is ending as it began, with the former car chief insisting he is innocent.</strong></p> \n  <p>If I\u2019d had any hope of a fair trial, I\u2019d never have fled, he says. <br></p> \n  <p>He also criticises prosecutors for issuing an arrest warrant for his wife Carole, for allegedly giving false information.

The US president confirmed that no American troops were killed or injured by the rockets fired from Iran, and that Tehran appears to be \u2018standing down\u2019, after retaliating to the death of senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Our liveblog has full details: Tokyo\u2019s prosecutors office has hit back. In a statement, it says: Defendant Ghosn\u2019s allegations completely ignore his own conduct, and his one-sided criticism of the Japanese criminal justice system is totally unacceptable. If you missed the press conference, here\u2019s some photos: It was billed as a press conference, but Carlos Ghosn\u2019s long-awaited appearance before the world\u2019s media also felt like a courtroom, with a Powerpoint presentation thrown in too. But this courtroom, unlike the one he has avoided in Tokyo, gave the defendant free rein to explain why he\u2019s innocent, M\u2019Lud. Ghosn spent an hour presenting his own case, and then fended off suggestions that his fugitive status implies guilt. But what did we learn? 1) Ghosn blames a conspiracy between Nissan executives and forces within the Japanese government to bring him down. He named former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, whistleblower Hari Nada and board member Masakazu Toyoda, adding: My unimaginable ordeal is the result of a handful of unscrupulous, vindictive individuals. He refused to name which government officials are to blame, beyond appearing to absolve PM Shinzo Abe. 2) Japan\u2019s judicial system is in the spotlight. Ghosn makes a fair point when he criticises the Japanese habit of forcing confessions out of those accused of crimes. Pouring out his anguish, the former CEO said: I was brutally taken from my work as I knew it, ripped from my work, my family and my friends. It is impossible to express the depth of that deprivation and my profound appreciation to be able to be reunited with my family and loved ones. (I was) interrogated for up eight hours a day without any lawyers present. \u2018It will get worse for you if you don\u2019t just confess\u2019, the prosecutor told me repeatedly. 3) Ghosn claims he has proof that he\u2019s innocent. Reporters were shown some documents which -- apparently -- explain away the $11m of dubious expense payments. He also produced a letter approving the houses bought for the Ghosn family, signed by Saikawa. Ghosn says he plans to prove his innocence. I don\u2019t consider myself as a prisoner in Lebanon. I prefer this prison to the one before. I am ready to stay a long time in Lebanon, but I am going to fight because I have to clear my name. 4) He\u2019s burned his bridges in Japan. Savaging the Tokyo prosecutor is one thing. But citing Pearl Harbor as an example of Japanese cunning and secrecy is to deploy the diplomatic skills of Basil Fawlty. Ghosn\u2019s point is that he didn\u2019t spot how his one-time allies were plotting to boot him out, to break Renault\u2019s control over Nissan - and scupper a planned merged with Fiat-Crysler. But still, it was a poor analogy that will distract from Ghosn\u2019s claims of innocence. 5) He\u2019s devoted to Mrs Ghosn. I think Ghosn was trying to be chivalrous when he joked that he missed his wife badly when he was trapped in Japan, even if others might not. As he touchingly put it: I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. This love is not unrequited -- Carole has spoken about how her husband\u2019s return was a \u201cbeautiful surprise\u201d. They share something else too -- charges in Japan. In her case, prosecutors claim she committed perjury last year. 6) Lebanon might not be as safe as he hoped. Fleeing to Beirut looked like a cunning plan, as there\u2019s no extradition treaty with Japan. But there is a law banning travel to Israel, which Ghosn has broken in the past. Beirut\u2019s prosecutor wants to discuss this with Ghosn tomorrow, alongside the Red Notice issued by Interpol for his arrest. 7) Be honest, you were hoping to hear Ghosn confirm whether he was bundled out of Toyko in a big musical box. I certainly was. But on this point, he remained tight-lipped. Perhaps he\u2019s saving it for the film version (although he denies that there\u2019s a deal with Netflix). After two and half hours, Carlos Ghosn\u2019s press conference is ending as it began, with the former car chief insisting he is innocent. If I\u2019d had any hope of a fair trial, I\u2019d never have fled, he says. He also criticises prosecutors for issuing an arrest warrant for his wife Carole, for allegedly giving false information. Why do that nine months afterwards? And with that, he\u2019s finished. Q: Are you the Dreyfus of Lebanon? Ghosn says he doesn\u2019t understand the reference (to Alfred Dreyfus, the French captain, who was wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to Germany). Q: It means are you a victim? Yes I am, says Ghosn firmly. He says that several law professors say they cannot understand why he was arrested, especially as some of the alleged financial misconduct refers to money that wasn\u2019t even paid out. Q: What were your emotions during your escape? Ghosn says he was numb, from the start of the drama until he met his wife Carole in her parents\u2019 home in the Lebanon. I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. Q: Would you recommend a packing case as a mode of travel? Ghosn breaks into a grin, but won\u2019t confirm that rumour that he was smuggled out of Japan in a large box. Q: Can the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance succeed without you? Yes, says Ghosn modestly - but it needs to follow some rules. Ghosn says he is ready to answer questions from the French authorities, who last year launched an inquiry into his wealth. Incidentally, the much-pined-after Carole Ghosn is attending today\u2019s press conference, supporting her man. Associated Press asks Ghosn what triggered his decision to escape Japan. Ghosn says there were two factors. First, the Tokyo prosecutor kept postponing his trial, saying it wouldn\u2019t begin until 2021. Second, he missed his wife Carole, telling reporters that: For many people, it wouldn\u2019t be a punishment not to see their wife. But for me it was. How sweet. And yet, how rude! Channel Four asks Ghosn about the damage to his reputation: Q: Won\u2019t people say that \u2018if a man escapes from a trial in a box there\u2019s no smoke without fire\u2019? Ghosn won\u2019t be lured into confirming the details of his escape. He says many lies have been told about him, and repeats that he wants a fair trial over the claims of financial misconduct. Ghosn has reiterated that he had talked to Fiat-Chrysler about a possible merger with Renault, but the deal floundered after his arrest (allowing Peugeot to swoop in instead). Curiously, Ghosn denies that he resigned from Renault, saying such reports are a \u201ctravesty\u201d. That\u2019s odd, as France\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire announced a year ago that Ghosn had quit as Renault\u2019s chairman and CEO. Renault also announced that he had resigned both roles, but remained as a director. We\u2019ve embedded a video stream of Carlos Ghosn\u2019s press conference at the top of this liveblog - you might need to refresh to see it. Ghosn is now defending a recent visit to Israel - saying he travelled there as a Renault executive. This visit has caused some anger in Ghosn\u2019s new home, as it is a crime for Lebanese citizens to visit Israel due to the long-running conflict between the two countries. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack says Tokyo is going to respond to Ghosn\u2019s claims of a government conspiracy against him. A Japanese journalist reminds Ghosn that he has broken the law by fleeing to Lebanon. Ghosn defends his decision to escape, claiming Japan\u2019s prosecutor repeatedly broke the law by leaking details of the case against him Breaking the law in Japan because I got out of Japan is a problem, but isn\u2019t it a bigger problem that the prosecutor broke 10 laws? The Japanese people deserve better than a \u201crigged\u201d justice system, Ghosn says, adding that he has been treated like a \u201cterrorist\u201d. Reuters: Have Lebanon promised that you won\u2019t be extradited back to Japan? Ghosn says he doesn\u2019t have such a pledge, but adds: \u201cI am confident that the existing practices and laws in Lebanon will be respected. That\u2019s a reminder that there isn\u2019t currently an extradition treaty between the two countries. The BBC\u2019s John Simpson asks Ghosn about his claim of a conspiracy between Nissan and the Japanese government -- how high does it go? Ghosn says he doesn\u2019t think the top of Japan\u2019s government was involved -- absolving prime minister Shinzo Abe of blame*. He also says he would face the fraud charges outside Japan, if he felt he would get justice I am ready to stand trial anywhere that will give me a fair trial. * - Bloomberg reported today that Ghosn came within a couple of hours of running into Abe in a Japanese hotel, when he began his escape. Did you every propose a full-blown merger between Renault and Nissan? Ghosn denies it, saying he simply proposed a holding company -- but since his arrest, the alliance has gone backwards. Ghosn says his lawyers believe they can fight the Interpol Red Notice. CNN: Haven\u2019t you just swapped a small cell in Japan for a large one in Lebanon? Ghosn says he isn\u2019t unhappy in Lebanon, but he is going to fight. I have to clear my name, and this is very important to me. The Wall Street Journal asks Ghosn what he plans to do, now he\u2019s a fugitive from justice. I am \u201cused to Mission Impossible\u201d, he replies, citing his long career in the auto industry. I don\u2019t consider that I cannot do anything. I can do a lot, and I am going to clear my name. Ghosn is taking questions from reporters from different countries. I was hoping for a bit more help from the Brazilian government, but this did not happen unfortunately, he says. And on France, he argues that the Paris government wants to improve its relations with Japan, so isn\u2019t taking any steps to defy it. Ghosn is asked whether he has any political ambitions in Lebanon. He replies that he\u2019s willing to use his expertise to help the country (who he spoke warmly about earlier). However he\u2019s not planning to move into politics. Ghosn denies that he\u2019s signed a deal with Netflix to create a TV drama about his escape. Carlos Ghosn is back to answer some questions from the media. But he repeats his refusal to reveal how he escaped Japan, as it will \u201cexpose several people\u201d who helped him, and could lead to problems for them. BREAKING! While Ghosn was delivering his monologue, Lebanon\u2019s top state prosecutor Ghassan Oueidat announced he is calling him for questioning tomorrow. Oueidat wants to quiz Ghosn over the Red Notice issued by Interpol for his arrest, following his decision to flee Japan. Ghosn is now outlining why it\u2019s terribly unfair to claim he is a cold, greedy dictator. He insists he was committed to Japan, saying he was the first foreign business leader to return to the country after the 2011 tsunami. He says he was the first to dare to go to Nissan\u2019s plant near the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan is repaying me with evil for all the good I have done to the country. I don\u2019t understand that. On the greed charge, Ghosn claims he turned down an offer to run General Motors on double his salary. And he insists he\u2019s not a dictator, citing his long period of success turning Nissan around. And with that, we\u2019re taking a break! Ghosn is mopping his face with a handkerchief, and the media are looking hungry to ask some questions. After presenting his case for an hour, Ghosn is proposing to hold a break before taking questions from reporters. But not before he\u2019s defended himself some more. He insists that the case against him is political. I am innocent of all the charges, all of them. And I can prove that now, as I have the documents, and there are more to come. Ever the businessman, Ghosn is now railing against Nissan for botching his plan to merge with rival Fiat-Chrysler. Bringing the Italian-US carmaker into the Nissan-Renault alliance would have been a success, he says. But this deal died when Ghosn was arrested -- Fiat-Chrysler is merging with Peugeot owner, Groupe PSA, instead. Ghosn berates his former company: \u201cHow can you lose that? How can you lose a huge opportunity to become the dominant player in this industry?\u201d Ghosn also denies another key part of the case against him, that he illicitly used Nissan\u2019s money to buy houses around the world. He produces a letter approving these payments, signed by former CEO Hiroto Saikawa (who Ghosn claims is a key conspirator against him). Dozens of journalists were gathered outside Beirut\u2019s press syndicate building for Ghosn\u2019s press conference, including many who had flown in especially from Japan. They stood in the rain guarded by heavily armed Lebanese police officers, descending on each car that pulled up the building. The arrival of two black Toyota Land Cruisers around 3pm caused a flurry - until what appeared to be a group of private security officers emerged. Ghosn had appeared to use the temporary rush to enter the building unseen through a side entrance, and appeared in the conference room a few moments later. Ghosn now turns to the notorious party which he and wife Carole hosted at France\u2019s Palace of Versailles to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. We didn\u2019t want to act like Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette, he insists. We chose Versailles because it is a symbol of France\u2019s genius, and its openness to the world. That party cost \u20ac635,000, but Ghosn denies there was anything suspicious - even though some friends from Lebanon and the US also attended. Forty five minutes into his opening statement, Ghosn is now arguing that Nissan and Renault investors are also victims of the conspiracy against him. He says they are the only major carmakers whose shares have fallen since his arrest, with \u20ac20m per day wiped off Renault\u2019s value. That\u2019s a heavy price, compared to the $11m of allegedly dubious expenses, Ghosn says. [Perhaps, but I don\u2019t think fraud cases should really balanced against the impact on market capitalisation] Carlos Ghosn is now denying that there was anything irregular in the \u201cCEO reserve\u201d payments at the heart of the fraud charges against him. Pointing to a financial statement, he insists that he couldn\u2019t use these funds for illicit purposes. Last year, Reuters revealed how Ghosn and close associates spent money from a fund that some insiders dubbed \u2018the CEO Reserve\u2019 to help pay for residences used by the Ghosn family as well as for other personal expenses. Ghosn now produces another plank of his defence -- even if one was guilty of such financial misconduct charges, no other country would punish them so harshly as Japan. Not that he is admitting any guilt, of course. Carlos Ghosn is now defending his decision to flee Japan, claiming he was effectively a hostage. He says he was told he faced a five year wait before a judgement would be made on his fraud charges - giving him a choice between dying in Japan or escaping. He\u2019s also furious about the way he was portrayed. Nissan was \u201cin the dirt\u201d before my arrival, Ghosn says, and now he am described as \u201ca cold, greedy dictator\u201d. Carlos Ghosn has now been speaking without interruption for 30 minutes -- speaking passionately about his (claimed) innocence, and slamming Japan\u2019s legal system. He\u2019s now claiming that the whole arrest was staged, and that there is collusion between Nissan and the prosecutor -- who is effectively the judge, he blasts. Ghosn is now explaining how he was arrested last year. He slams the \u201cbullshit\u201d claim that he was arrested on a plane, insisting that he was apprehended going through airport security. In a highly provocative, and distasteful move, Ghosn is comparing this alleged plot to remove him to the Pearl Harbor attacks! He says his friends have asked how he didn\u2019t notice he was being set up -- and he reminds them how the Japanese air force caught the Americans by surprise in 1941. That is going to cause fury in Japan, we suspect. Ghosn also claims that Japanese government officials were involved in this plot to get rid of him. But, pressing his hands together in prayer, Ghosn says he is \u201cimposing silence\u201d on himself on this issue, as he doesn\u2019t want to hurt the Lebanese people or their government..... After that vigorous defence, Ghosn is getting down to details, and outlining his theory for why he ended up being arrested on fraud charges. Ghosn says the plot against him was triggered by Nissan\u2019s declining performance at the start of 2017. He blames Hiroto Saikawa, the former CEO, for this. He explains that there was big bitterness in Japan about the links between Nissan and Renault, which gave the French carmaker some influence over Nissan. Unfortunately there was no trust in the partnership, Ghosn continues. Some Nissan insiders concluded that the only way to get rid of Renault\u2019s influence on Nissan is to get rid of me, and they were right, he adds. So who cooked up this plot? Ghosn says Saikawa was obviously part of it, along with whistleblower Hari Nada. He also names Masakazu Toyoda, Nissan director, as a key link. Ghosn blames \u201cunscrupulous, vindictive individuals\u201d at Nissan and its legal firm Latham and Watkins for launching the legal charges against him. I am not above the law, he insists -- but had no choice but to escape Japan because its legal system and its 99% conviction rate. Choosing to escape was the most difficult decision of my life, he continues. But as the charges against him are \u201cbaseless\u201d he had \u201cno other choice\u201d but to protect himself and his family. Carlos Ghosn turns to Greg Kelly, his former aide who was also arrested last year -- and remains in custody. Ghosn says that Kelly has been persecuted because he refused to sign up to a plea bargaining deal, alongside Hari Nada- a senior vice-president at Nissan who blew the whistle on Ghosn. Kelly is a \u201cvictim of the system\u201d and an honourable man, \u201cwith no release date in sight\u201d, Ghosn says, asking the media to remember him. Carlos Ghosn says he won\u2019t reveal how he escaped from Japan -- and you can feel the wave of disappointment rippling through the press conference. Instead, he is going to outline how he is innocent, and how the charges should never have been brought. He thanks his family, his wife Carole (cue some applause), his friends and his lawyers. And he takes another swipe at Japan, saying baseless media attacks had been orchestrated by Japanese authorities. Carlos Ghosn says his imprisonment went against United Nations standards. Ghosn is laying into the Japanese criminal justice system, saying he was interrogated for up to eight hours a day without a lawyer present, and without knowing what evidence was held against him. It is impossible to express the depths of my deprivation, he declares. Ghosn claims investigators threatened him, saying things would get even worse if he didn\u2019t confess. He had no contact with his family, apart from through letters. The feeling of hopelessness was profound, he adds, hitting out at prosecutors for re-arresting him after he was released on bail the first time last year. Carlos Ghosn begins by welcoming the press to today\u2019s event. As you can imagine, today is a very important day for me, he says. Ghoshn says he has looked forward to it for 400 days, since he was taken into custody in Japan and \u201cbrutally\u201d taken away from his family, his friends and his company. Ghosn is being introduced now - here\u2019s a live feed. And here\u2019s the scene inside: Here\u2019s the scene outside the press conference a few minute ago: Carlos Ghosn has arrived for today\u2019s press conference. He\u2019s looking suitably serious, dressed smartly in a suit, white shirt and a pinky salmon-coloured tie. There\u2019s a flurry of camera flashes from the assembled press (who have now navigated the tight security outside). The Financial Times has drawn up a list of questions for Ghosn to answer today. They include: Why did you defer part of your salary (a key part of the case against him in Japan) Who else should have been arrested? You say that your enemies wanted to block a Renault-Nissan merger, but why couldn\u2019t you persuade them the deal made sense? Have you evidence to back up your claim that a Japanese government official agreed to help Nissan to bring you down? More here. Some background: Carlos Ghosn faced four charges in Japan, and was held in custody for more than three months before securing bail. Two of those charges were for allegedly understanding Ghosn\u2019s by more than $80m for the best pat of a decade. He was also accused of transferring $14.7m from a Nissan account to a friend\u2019s company, and another $5m to companies controlled by his family. You can get up to speed on the world\u2019s most famous corporate fugitive here: Ghosn\u2019s wife, Carole, is clearly delighted to have her husband back in the country. The Lebanese-born fashion designer has given an interview to the Le Parisien magazine, in which she explains how Carlos\u2019s dramatic bunk from Tokyo to Beirut before the new year was a lovely surprise. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know about anything. I was in Beirut with my children to celebrate Christmas. Someone called me, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u2019 \u201cIt was the most beautiful surprise of my life. We met at my parents\u2019 apartment. I held Carlos very tightly in my arms for at least five whole minutes before I could even speak.\u201d Mrs Ghosn is also caught up in the legal battle. Yesterday, Japanese prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for her, claiming she had given false testimony last year. More here: Journalists are also being scanned by security staff before they\u2019re allowed into today\u2019s press conference. Ironic really, as Carlos Ghosn appears to have evaded such security measures during his dramatic escape. There\u2019s huge interest in Carlos Ghosn\u2019s appearance. Scores of journalists have flocked to the Lebanese Journalists Syndicate building to hear from the former Nissan chief -- and there are even armed police outside. Over in Beirut, Carlos Ghosn is preparing to appear for the first time since he fled Tokyo. The former boss of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance is hosting a press conference, where he\u2019s likely to insist he is innocent of the financial misconduct charges filed in Japan. It\u2019s scheduled to begin at 3pm local time, or 1pm GMT (in around 50 minutes). Ghosn\u2019s dramatic escape by private jet (apparently in an audio equipment case), captured headlines around the world last week. He\u2019s now likely to blast Japan\u2019s justice system, and could also criticise colleagues who - he claims - set him up. My colleague Justin McCurry sets the scene: At a highly anticipated press conference due to be held in Beirut on Wednesday afternoon, speculation is growing that he will divulge details of his escape and flesh out claims that he was the victim of a \u201ccoup\u201d by former colleagues determined to wreck his plans to merge Nissan and Renault. Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business said Ghosn had told her over the weekend that he has \u201cactual evidence\u201d and documents proving there was a plot to \u201ctake him out\u201d in response to his plan to merge the Japanese and French automakers. There is also the mouthwatering prospect that Ghosn, who consistently denied the charges throughout his detention and while out on bail, will name Japanese government officials he claims worked with Nissan executives to oust him, two decades after he rescued the company from near bankruptcy. The former auto tycoon has yet to publicly back those allegations with evidence. Shares in holiday firm TUI are falling deeper into the red, down 4.5% today, making it one of the top fallers. Rising tensions in the Middle East could hit demand for holidays to the region, even if both sides avoid further escalation. A number of airlines have said they are suspending flights over Iraqi and Iranian airspace, or cancelled flights, including Air France, KLM, Qantas, Lufthansa and Emirates. That\u2019s a blow to the local economies. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that Iran is trying to avoid escalating the situation, while also showing that it has retaliated to the killing of Qassem Suleimani: Another sign that calm appears to be returning to markets: Just in: Boeing says it is \u201cready to assist\u201d over the Ukranian International Airlines 737-800 plane which crashed shortly after leaving Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini airport today. In a statement, the US firm says: \u201cThis is a tragic event and our heartfelt thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families. We are in contact with our airline customer and stand by them in this difficult time. We are ready to assist in any way needed.\u201d Boeing\u2019s 737-800 is the most widely-used aeroplane in service today. It is the forerunner to the 737-MAX, which is currently grounded following two fatal crashes. Boeing shares are down 2% in pre-market trading. My colleague Michael Safi tweets: The markets are recovering some of their earlier losses. Gold has dropped back to $1,582 per ounce, compared with $1,610 after the Iranian attacks. It\u2019s still higher than yesterday, but only around $10. Brent crude has eased back to $68.64 per barrel, down from $71.75. That\u2019s still 0.5% up today. European markets are pulling back too, now down only 0.2% on average. That puts the FTSE 100 down 15 points at 7,558. There are also signs that Wall Street will open calmly. Why the turnaround? Traders are relieved that Iraq\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office says it has not heard of any Iraqi casualties yet -- there also don\u2019t appear to be any casualties on the US forces side. Wall Street has also noted Iraq\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who says We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression. Marios Hadjikyriacos of trading firm XM sums up the mood at present: Investors seem to have sided with the view that while this is clearly a worrisome situation, it doesn\u2019t end with an actual war. The concern was that Iran would strike back against US personnel, leaving Trump no choice but to hit back again, generating a vicious tit-for-tat cycle of retaliation. With no US casualties to speak of though, and with Tehran having replied in a strong enough fashion to save face domestically, the risk of the situation escalating out of control appears fairly low. In an interesting twist, Iraq has now confirmed that it was warned by Iran that last night\u2019s missile attacks were taking place. That could reassure the markets that Iran isn\u2019t trying to escalate the situation, but still felt forced to make a public retaliation. Corrections corner: Gold hit $1,600 per OUNCE this morning, not per barrel as I foolishly mistyped earlier. Thanks to kind readers who flagged up (and let\u2019s pretend they were very small barrels....) Finablr\u2019s share price is also being dragged down by the news that two investors are trying to sell stock. Saeed Mohamed al-Qebaisi and Khalifa Butti al-Muhairi hope to sell $75m of Finablr stock, and another $490m in FTSE 100-listed NMC Health -- whose stock is down 15% today. This comes after NMC was attacked by US short-seller Muddy Waters, which claimed last month that its financial statements are bogus. NMC\u2019s shares have halved in value since. The Times reckons al-Qebaisi and al-Muhairi may need to sell shares to meet a margin call on shares pledged as collateral for debts.... Back in the City, shares in financial services group Finablr have plunged by a sixth after its Travelex subsidiary was struck by a major cyber attack. The Abu Dhabi-based firm has tumbled to the bottom of the FTSE 250 index, with hackers reportedly demanding a $3m ransom before they unlock its computer systems. Travelex, which also provides foreign currency services for Virgin Money and Tesco, was attacked by the Sodinokibi ransomware more than a week ago. Finablr told shareholders this morning that \u201csome data\u201d has been encrypted by Sodinokibi - which locks down data until the victim pays up. It added: Travelex is gradually restoring a number of internal systems and is working to resume normal operations as quickly as possible. Finablr\u2019s other six brands are not affected and are operating normally. Finablr does not currently anticipate any material financial impact for the Group, continues to monitor the situation closely and will update the market as required. In the meantime, investors have sent shares down 17% to 127.8p, the lowest since it floated last May. Bad News: Germany\u2019s factories are continuing to struggle badly. Factory orders across the eurozone\u2019s largest economy slumped by 1.3% month-on-month in November, meaning they were 6.5% lower than a year ago. This is rather weaker than expecting, showing that German manufacturing stumbled through much of 2019. It suggests growth was weak in the final quarter of last year. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, says the \u201chard reality\u201d is that Germany\u2019s economy is struggling. All in all, there are still no signs at all of a bottoming out for German industry. Instead, the free fall continues. In fact, there is simply one word to describe the current state of the German industry: \u2018dire\u2019. Good News: Staff at UK bakery chain Greggs are sharing a \u00a37m special payment, partly thanks to the success of its vegan sausage roll. It works out at around \u00a3300 for the group\u2019s longer-serving staff - a handy bonus to start the new year with. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The bakery chain\u2019s 25,000 employees will receive up to \u00a3300 each in their pay packets this month \u2013 with shop floor staff and managers receiving the same amount. Greggs said it was making the one-off payment to workers \u201cin recognition of their crucial contribution to business success\u201d. Some 19,000 staff, who have been with the company before and up to March last year, will receive the full \u00a3300 payment. The rest will be given \u00a375 for every quarter they have been with the company, up to last March. Market volatility has risen today, but remains at moderate levels despite the risk of conflict in the Gulf region. That suggests that investors are worried, but not yet in a major panic. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, isn\u2019t ditching his shares yet, saying: \u201cWhile tensions between the US and Iran are likely to continue, our base case does not assume significant and serious escalation as both sides do not have an interest to pursue a broader military conflict. Hence, we maintain our overweight positions on global and US equities.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has declared that Tehran has given America a \u201cslap in the face\u201d, and call for its troops to leave the Middle East. In a live TV speech, Khamenei said: \u201cLast night, a slap in the face was delivered... \u201cAn important incident has happened. The question of revenge is another issue. Joanne Stocker of Defense Post suggests that Iran may be signalling that its retaliation is over, at least officially.... Here\u2019s our latest news story on the oil price spike: European stock markets have, as feared, opened lower - but it\u2019s not a rout. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 42 points, or 0.5%. Holiday and airline stocks are among the fallers, with TUI losing 2.7% and IAG (owner of British Airways) losing 1.6%. Across Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB have both lost 0.6%. Theres\u2019s some relief that the US authorities haven\u2019t reported any casualties from the attacks on its bases. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says there\u2019s a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d that the crisis may not escalate further: In the past President Trump has shown restraint in previous attacks in the region blamed on Iran which didn\u2019t kill any US citizens. This gives a glimmer of hope that this might not lead to an all-out escalation in the conflict. There are already some commentators saying that if the US doesn\u2019t ratchet up tensions further this could be good news for risk as it might be spun by Iran as a big response and the world can move on for now. Every major Asia-Pacific stock market has dropped today: Gold will keep rising if Middle East tensions continue to build, predicts Stephen Innes of AxiTrader. But the flip-side is that bullion could tumble back from today\u2019s seven-year high if calmer heads prevail. Innes says: Escalating geopolitical risk has lifted Gold to $1,600, and a further escalation is likely to attract more safe-haven flows. Still, with the near-term position builds hovering around 12-month highs, it increases the risks of a large-scale meltdown if tensions suddenly ease. While Gold\u2019s sensitivity to geopolitical risks appears higher than any other defensive assets at the moment, it\u2019s worth noting that surges in geopolitical risk can, by their nature, be short-lived and volatile. Still, it\u2019s tough not to get encapsulated by the heat of the moment when it comes to the fog of war. Geopolitical anxiety has pushed Bitcoin to its highest level since November. The cryptocurrency has jumped to $8,463 today, a two-month high, and is now up 20% since Qassem Suleimani\u2019s death last week. The gold price was swift to respond to Tehran\u2019s missile attack at two US basis in Iraq. It spiked to $1,610 per ounce, from $1.575, once the retaliation was announced, a near seven-year high. Oil also spiked alarmingly when Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard announced the move. Brent crude immediately bounced back over the $70 mark -- levels last seen when Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil processing sites were attacked in September. Equities suffered as investors tried to protect themselves from risk -- as this chart of Japan\u2019s Topix index shows: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are dashing for cover today as tensions in the Middle East escalate - rattling markets and sending asset prices swinging wildly. Gold hit a seven-year high, and oil spiked back over $70 per barrel, after Iran launched a missile attack on two US military bases in Iraq. The attack, which began at 1.30am local time on Wednesday, is Tehran\u2019s first retaliation to the death of general Qassem Soleimani in a US drone attack last week. More than a dozen missiles were fired, which Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, described as \u201cproportionate measures in self-defence\u201d. No casualties have been reported yet, but the situation is still unclear. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) declared: \u201cThe brave soldiers of IRGC\u2019s aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on the al-Asad military base in the name of martyr General Qassem Suleimani.\u201d Although Donald Trump swiftly tweeted that \u201call is well\u201d, the markets fear further escalation between the two sides. The sad news that a Ukranian passenger jet had crashed leaving Tehran Airport will also weigh on the aviation sector, although it doesn\u2019t appear linked to the Iranian missile attack. Investors dashed for save-haven assets, driving gold over $1,600 per ounce for the first time since 2013. Fears of oil supply disruption from the Gulf region sent Brent crude spiking up to $71.75, a new four-month high, although prices have subsided a little since. Asia-Pacific equity markets are also spooked, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei down 1.5% and China\u2019s CSI 300 shedding 1.2%. European markets are set to fall, with Germany\u2019s DAX seen down 1%. Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, says the crisis is worrying investors as they can\u2019t predict the next moves - how will Trump respond to Iran\u2019s retaliation? \u201cGeopolitical tensions are certainly heightening, and this always creates uncertainty \u2013 something which markets typically loathe as it becomes more difficult to know where things are headed. In other words, they can\u2019t price uncertainty. \u201cIn many regards, the U.S.-Iran situation has now surpassed the U.S.-China trade war as the biggest risk to financial markets. This has been reflected in the current volatility.\u201d But Green also advises against panic selling - he recommends staying diversified, and holding your nerve.... Also coming up today A week after dramatically escaping from Japan, Carlos Ghosn is due to hold a press conference in Lebanon. The former auto magnate is expected to argue that he was the victim of a conspiracy by senior managers at Nissan, who set him up with fraud charges to prevent a merger with Renault. Ghosn may also reveal exactly how he managed to flee from Tokyo without being detected. The latest theory is that he enlisted a group of top private security operatives, was concealed a large box and smuggled onto a private jet bound for Istanbul, and then Beirut where he should be safe from extradition back to Japan.

One day it may even rival the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Faldo#Personal_life\" title=\"\">\u201cPersonal Life\u201d section of Nick Faldo\u2019s entry</a>. (Enjoy \u2013 though I will just take this opportunity to pass on his second wife\u2019s deathless quote: \u201cSocially, he was a 24-handicapper.\u201d)</p> \n<p>Is the latest horror tackle likely to be career-ending for the Ibrahimovic statue? That remains unclear. Officially, it is in for repairs, though at this rate of degeneration it is difficult to see how it can keep realistically rising again. Perhaps they could do something for it at one of the Italian clubs, with their special gyms and so on.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, meanwhile, desecration of statues happens in contemporary societies for a variety of reasons. News cuttings for the very day on which the Zlatan statue was removed reveal that a Gandhi statue in Gujarat was also vandalised. Though the Indian independence leader is widely accepted to be a less significant cultural figure than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/27/zlatan-ibrahimovics-return-to-serie-a-strugglers-milan-is-confirmed\" title=\"\">the current Milan striker</a>, I am sure Zlatan would take comfort from the fact that this sort of impudence is also happening lower down the international statuary leagues.</p> \n<p>As for the trigger of the Ibrahimovic statue\u2019s ongoing woes, it seems to go beyond matters of mere style and taste. After all, the Zlatan rendition is relatively lifelike and aesthetically inoffensive compared with many notable modern football statues, which aim to make even the heavily disguised waxworks of Madame Tussauds look like those they are apparently supposed to resemble. Players insulted in bronze of late include Cristiano Ronaldo, of whom a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/30/cristiano-ronaldo-bust-social-media-madeira-statue-reaction\" title=\"\">comically misshapen image was unveiled</a> at Madeira airport, and Mo Salah, who has for some reason been immortalised as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/05/mohamed-salah-statue-mocked-by-fans-as-striker-gets-ronaldo-treatment\" title=\"\">a sort of homunculus Art Garfunkel</a> in his hometown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9f1f27b9507dfa80dc0646d6af9e325e248d033\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f1f27b9507dfa80dc0646d6af9e325e248d033/0_96_2300_1380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zlatan Ibrahimovic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic has recently signed for Milan at the age of 38.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Mascolo/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Given that Zlatan is presented as arrogantly shirtless in his statue, you could really only fault the medium for its inability to replicate the subject\u2019s body art.

One of mine is that the Zlatan statue is involved in some kind of modern realisation of the Oscar Wilde story The Happy Prince. Did you ever read this one? Basically there\u2019s a statue of a prince in a poor town, and the prince can\u2019t bear to see the suffering, so with the help of a swallow, he sacrifices bits of himself \u2013 a sapphire eye, some surface gilding, and so on \u2013 to alleviate poverty. So this, but with a footballer\u2019s bronze nose, toe, and lower leg. Is Malm\u00f6 being regenerated via these valuable Zlatan relics? We daren\u2019t rule it out.</p> \n<p>Speaking of ruling things out, perhaps all this has the distinct air of a dark Scandi crime drama. It\u2019s not just that celebrated show The Bridge is set partly in Malm\u00f6 \u2013 more that there have now been a series of grotesque attacks, which presumably someone will have to solve. A review of the evidence sparks my own hunch. Broken legs, broken noses, a little serial ultraviolence \u2013 is the villain\u2019s MO not redolent of a man whose own arsenal of threats and injurings was famously vast and baroque? Think about it. Who, in all honesty, could inflict this amount of damage on the Zlatan statue other than \u2026 Zlatan Ibrahimovic himself? Far be it from me to give pointers to the Malm\u00f6 police department \u2013 but could there yet be the ultimate twist in this tale?</p>",

I imagine Rafael van der Vaart sent flowers. All told, the \u201cVandalism\u201d section of the Zlatan statue\u2019s dedicated Wikipedia entry is fast becoming one of my favourite sporting subheadings. One day it may even rival the \u201cPersonal Life\u201d section of Nick Faldo\u2019s entry. (Enjoy \u2013 though I will just take this opportunity to pass on his second wife\u2019s deathless quote: \u201cSocially, he was a 24-handicapper.\u201d) Is the latest horror tackle likely to be career-ending for the Ibrahimovic statue? That remains unclear. Officially, it is in for repairs, though at this rate of degeneration it is difficult to see how it can keep realistically rising again. Perhaps they could do something for it at one of the Italian clubs, with their special gyms and so on. Needless to say, meanwhile, desecration of statues happens in contemporary societies for a variety of reasons. News cuttings for the very day on which the Zlatan statue was removed reveal that a Gandhi statue in Gujarat was also vandalised. Though the Indian independence leader is widely accepted to be a less significant cultural figure than the current Milan striker, I am sure Zlatan would take comfort from the fact that this sort of impudence is also happening lower down the international statuary leagues. As for the trigger of the Ibrahimovic statue\u2019s ongoing woes, it seems to go beyond matters of mere style and taste. After all, the Zlatan rendition is relatively lifelike and aesthetically inoffensive compared with many notable modern football statues, which aim to make even the heavily disguised waxworks of Madame Tussauds look like those they are apparently supposed to resemble. Players insulted in bronze of late include Cristiano Ronaldo, of whom a comically misshapen image was unveiled at Madeira airport, and Mo Salah, who has for some reason been immortalised as a sort of homunculus Art Garfunkel in his hometown. Given that Zlatan is presented as arrogantly shirtless in his statue, you could really only fault the medium for its inability to replicate the subject\u2019s body art. You can\u2019t do tattoos in bronze. (Even so, let\u2019s take a moment to agree that the \u201cOnly God Can Judge Me\u201d tattoo \u2013 sported by Zlatan and countless other true originals \u2013 is one of the absolute cast-iron signs you\u2019re in the presence of a certain type. On the off-chance there is a heaven, I imagine it would contain a vast daily queue of people waiting for God to judge their Only God Can Judge Me tattoos. The Almighty\u2019s verdict would be communicated by a bored angel, going: \u201cCliched, lame, and only acceptable on Tupac. Otherwise, one of the leading international signs of the shit. Could the next tattooee step forward to the celestial throne, please!\u201d) No, in terms of motive, the Zlatan tale is thought to fall strictly into the damnatio memoriae \u2013 condemnation of memory \u2013 category, which saw statues of Lenin and so on purged across former Soviet territories. Zlatan\u2019s offence has been to buy a large stake in Malm\u00f6\u2019s rivals, Hammarby, and promise to make them \u201cthe best in Scandinavia\u201d. That said, I am extremely open to other theories. One of mine is that the Zlatan statue is involved in some kind of modern realisation of the Oscar Wilde story The Happy Prince. Did you ever read this one? Basically there\u2019s a statue of a prince in a poor town, and the prince can\u2019t bear to see the suffering, so with the help of a swallow, he sacrifices bits of himself \u2013 a sapphire eye, some surface gilding, and so on \u2013 to alleviate poverty. So this, but with a footballer\u2019s bronze nose, toe, and lower leg. Is Malm\u00f6 being regenerated via these valuable Zlatan relics? We daren\u2019t rule it out. Speaking of ruling things out, perhaps all this has the distinct air of a dark Scandi crime drama. It\u2019s not just that celebrated show The Bridge is set partly in Malm\u00f6 \u2013 more that there have now been a series of grotesque attacks, which presumably someone will have to solve. A review of the evidence sparks my own hunch. Broken legs, broken noses, a little serial ultraviolence \u2013 is the villain\u2019s MO not redolent of a man whose own arsenal of threats and injurings was famously vast and baroque? Think about it. Who, in all honesty, could inflict this amount of damage on the Zlatan statue other than \u2026 Zlatan Ibrahimovic himself? Far be it from me to give pointers to the Malm\u00f6 police department \u2013 but could there yet be the ultimate twist in this tale?",

The hardy crops grow everywhere except Antarctica, from deserts to plains to the alps. Coming in a vast array of shapes and colours, they sprout as shrubs, vines and even trees. The one thing common to these plants is the fruit they grow in pods that can be split open to reveal the seeds. Edible versions are enjoyed fresh, dried, fermented and processed. Some well-known examples are broad beans, lentils, kidney beans, chickpeas, soya beans and lima beans. More bizarre varietals include jack, winged, tongue of fire, rattlesnake, sword and velvet beans.</p> <p>These little gems are brimming with nutritional goodness, including antioxidant polyphenols and essential nutrients such as B vitamins, iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium. Being high in fibre, legumes have a low glycemic index, which helps keep blood sugar levels under control, and they feed the hard-working microbes that keep our gut healthy.

      "bodyText": "From fagioli-eating peasants to lentil-loving hippies, legumes have quietly endured \u2013 in fact, they\u2019ve been around since before 6000 BCE, filling the plates and bellies of people from cultures as diverse as Greece, Italy, Morocco, Lebanon, Ethiopia, Egypt, Mexico and India. Yet legumes have often been maligned as bland food for vegans and the down at heel \u2013 a cliche that does a disservice to both people and plants. Less than one in three Australians eat them regularly. Some people aren\u2019t even sure what they are, let alone how to cook them. Whether it be for health, the environment, animal ethics or simply tapping into their diverse potential for simple, scrumptious meals, the time has come to shake some more cobwebs off the humble beans and restore them to their rightful glory. They were so precious to my late Italian mother-in-law that she smuggled dried cannellini beans into Australia in her bra when she migrated to join her husband here in the 1940s. Combined with generous dollops of velvety extra virgin olive oil, hand-crushed from their own trees, and homegrown \u201cscarola\u201d (endive), the beans were transformed into a simple yet exquisitely creamy dish that remains one of my husband\u2019s favourites to this day. Cannellini beans comprise one of nearly 20,000 different species of legume. The hardy crops grow everywhere except Antarctica, from deserts to plains to the alps. Coming in a vast array of shapes and colours, they sprout as shrubs, vines and even trees. The one thing common to these plants is the fruit they grow in pods that can be split open to reveal the seeds. Edible versions are enjoyed fresh, dried, fermented and processed. Some well-known examples are broad beans, lentils, kidney beans, chickpeas, soya beans and lima beans. More bizarre varietals include jack, winged, tongue of fire, rattlesnake, sword and velvet beans. These little gems are brimming with nutritional goodness, including antioxidant polyphenols and essential nutrients such as B vitamins, iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium. Being high in fibre, legumes have a low glycemic index, which helps keep blood sugar levels under control, and they feed the hard-working microbes that keep our gut healthy. They are also a quality source of plant protein, especially when combined with wholegrains. This is good news for people seeking healthier meat alternatives that are also gentle on the planet. Legumes have some unique qualities that make them a no-brainer for sustainable agriculture. Growing them can release five to seven times fewer greenhouse gases than wheat and oilseed rape crops and they help sequester carbon in the soil.

A Lebanese feast invariably includes the traditional falafels and hummus, while a Moroccan twist can transform chickpeas into something else altogether. Indian dahls, made from an assortment of different lentils, beans and spices, are good comfort foods \u2013 simple recipes abound, or you can get more creative. On that note, Yotam Ottolenghi has risen to the challenge with his unique take on bean mash and vegetarian kubbeh; spicy cannellini bean, leek and eggs (pictured above) or mouth-watering lentil recipes. If you fancy some butter beans, Rose Elliot has four recipes to choose from, depending on whether you feel like curry, soup, dip or warm roast vegetable salad. Lentils can provide a satisfying, savoury alternative for meat pies, and they can be moulded into burgers for summer barbecues or hamburgers. Baked beans are always popular, either from a tin, or as a gourmet excursion in themselves.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Greg Mullins, the former Fire and Rescue NSW chief and current Climate Council member who is leading calls for stronger climate action, said the VFFA was entitled to express its opinions. But he said it became problematic when the group started expounding certain political views while purporting to be a large representative body of firefighters.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverybody is entitled to an individual opinion on any issue,\u201d Mullins told the Guardian. \u201cBut where an organisation is used as a vehicle for personal political views \u2026 then that\u2019s quite dangerous, particularly when they purport to represent the most trusted people in our community, but appear to have only a small membership base.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have personal friends who are members of the organisation but I\u2019m quite dismayed at some of the official, what I assume to be official, statements by their president, who seems to believe that the panacea for everything is burning, when it\u2019s a far more complex issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Holton said he had great respect for Mullins, but that he did not agree with him on climate change.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t agree that climate change is to be blamed for these big fires,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried that big fuel loads will indeed further impact upon climate change as mega amounts of carbon are unlocked by big fires. Indigenous land management is the key to reducing the impact upon climate by big fires.\u201d</p> \n<p>Borsak said the Shooters party initially linked up with the VFFA largely because it wanted to understand firefighting issues but neither the RFS or Rural Fire Service Association would speak to it.</p> \n<p>Borsak said there was nothing untoward about the VFFA donating money to Holton\u2019s NSW election campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t donate us anything.

      "bodyText": "A small volunteer firefighting association that disputes the link between climate change and the current bushfires has close ties to the New South Wales Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party and diverted thousands of dollars from its meagre finances to bankroll a bid by its president to run as an SFF candidate in the NSW election. The Volunteer Fire Fighters Association has been quoted extensively in the media during the bushfire crisis, particularly on Sky News and in the Australian, downplaying the links to climate change, attacking the group of ex-fire and emergency chiefs who have called for climate action, and placing blame for the fires chiefly on a lack of hazard reduction burning and poor land management. The VFFA, which splintered from NSW\u2019s main volunteer firefighting representative body in 2004, has repeatedly refused to say how many members it has, and recently drew the ire of the RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, who called it a \u201chighly politically-charged\u201d group with unclear motivations that had failed to reveal \u201cwho they claim to represent, how many they represent, and how they operate\u201d. The Guardian can now reveal the group\u2019s close links to the SFF party, whose leader Robert Borsak frequently disputes that humans are causing climate change and similarly blames the fires on a lack of hazard reduction burning. Last year the VFFA president, Mick Holton, launched a failed election campaign to represent the Shooters in the seat of Monaro in NSW parliament. VFFA meeting minutes and financial records show the association set aside $10,000 from its small pool of funds to bankroll Holton\u2019s election campaign. In August 2018, the VFFA resolved that: \u201cA donation of $10,000.00 be made available as required for Mick Holton to be used for his 2019 state election campaign to be paid into an election account. An expenditure report is to be furnished outlining all costings of the donation with regular reports. The executive is to ensure it complies with the VFFA Constitution and electoral campaign guidelines.\u201d The $10,000 was a significant sum for the VFFA. Its total revenue for 2017-18 was just $23,000, including $1,945 in donations. Holton told the Guardian his SFF election campaign ended up using only $2,240.74 of VFFA money. Asked whether it was appropriate to use VFFA money to fund his election bid, Holton said: \u201cDonated money was not used, the VFFA earns $10,000 with each edition of our magazine through advertising sales.\u201d Groups like the VFFA are regulated in NSW by the Office of Fair Trading. The office said there was no prohibition on associations making political donations, but noted the law required individuals to take steps to disclose their interests and prohibited an association from \u201cproviding a pecuniary gain for its members\u201d. \u201cFair Trading is reviewing the information provided to determine whether any further action is required,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cIf necessary, further action and enquiries will be made as per established procedures.\u201d Holton denied any suggestion that the VFFA\u2019s views on the fires were influenced by its associations with the SFF party. \u201cNo, SFFP support was sought by the VFFA just as it has been sought of other parties,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just so happens that the SFFP has assisted more than the others. \u201cI have at times congratulated the Greens on some changes to their policies and an interest in Indigenous land management practices.\u201d Holton\u2019s candidacy is not the only link between the two organisations. VFFA meeting minutes state that the group has enjoyed \u201cimmense support\u201d from Borsak. Borsak and then Shooters MP Robert Brown have both spoken at VFFA events, according to the minutes. The VFFA registered itself as a third-party campaigner during the NSW election and declared the $2,000 in donations to the SFF party. Holton said the money was used for a truck sign, banner, T-shirts, a gazebo, awning, table cloth and other campaign material. Greg Mullins, the former Fire and Rescue NSW chief and current Climate Council member who is leading calls for stronger climate action, said the VFFA was entitled to express its opinions. But he said it became problematic when the group started expounding certain political views while purporting to be a large representative body of firefighters. \u201cEverybody is entitled to an individual opinion on any issue,\u201d Mullins told the Guardian. \u201cBut where an organisation is used as a vehicle for personal political views \u2026 then that\u2019s quite dangerous, particularly when they purport to represent the most trusted people in our community, but appear to have only a small membership base. \u201cI have personal friends who are members of the organisation but I\u2019m quite dismayed at some of the official, what I assume to be official, statements by their president, who seems to believe that the panacea for everything is burning, when it\u2019s a far more complex issue.\u201d Holton said he had great respect for Mullins, but that he did not agree with him on climate change. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree that climate change is to be blamed for these big fires,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried that big fuel loads will indeed further impact upon climate change as mega amounts of carbon are unlocked by big fires. Indigenous land management is the key to reducing the impact upon climate by big fires.\u201d Borsak said the Shooters party initially linked up with the VFFA largely because it wanted to understand firefighting issues but neither the RFS or Rural Fire Service Association would speak to it. Borsak said there was nothing untoward about the VFFA donating money to Holton\u2019s NSW election campaign. \u201cThey didn\u2019t donate us anything. In the end, I think the association donated $2,000-odd to Mick\u2019s campaign, which happened to relate to him campaigning as a candidate for Shooters, Farmers, Fishers in Queanbeyan,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing cynical about it. There\u2019s nothing cloak-and-dagger, it\u2019s all there in black and white. \u201cThat somehow it\u2019s immoral for the VFFA to donate money to one of our candidates who happens to be one of them\u2026 I could trot out a thousand examples of people doing the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the National party do it with someone taking money from the NSW Farmers, that\u2019s not different?\u201d The largest representative volunteer firefighting body, the Rural Fire Service Association, said the VFFA should disclose its membership numbers. \u201cThey have a right to exist,\u201d the RFSA president, Brian McDonough, told the Guardian. \u201cWe wish they would disclose how many legitimate members they have. And really, that\u2019s all we can say about them.\u201d The RFSA says it represents more than 70,000 volunteer firefighters. Holton said the VFFA had \u201cmany thousands\u201d of firefighters but would not give a specific figure. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anywhere near the volunteers that the RFSA has on their books, but we have many thousands,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Two senior media executives and an eminent media lawyer were passed over for appointment as chair of the ABC board last year in favour of prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201ccaptain\u2019s pick\u201d of journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose, documents released on Wednesday under freedom of information confirm. Buttrose was appointed as the direct choice of the prime minister despite the fact she had not been through the arm\u2019s length independent selection process. The men recommended for the job by the independent panel were former Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood, former News Corporation CEO Kim Williams and senior lawyer Ian Robertson AO, the national managing partner of Holding Redlich. All three subjected themselves to an extensive vetting process, involving a number of gruelling interviews and background police and taxation checks, only to see the process and its recommendations ignored by the government. Buttrose, on the other hand, did not apply for the job. The document released on Wednesday also reveals that in 2015, the man who went on to be appointed as Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, was recommended for the ABC board but was rejected in favour of then minister for communications Mitch Fifield\u2019s \u201ccaptains picks\u201d of businesswomen Dr Kirstin Ferguson and Donny Walford. At the time of Buttrose\u2019s appointment Morrison defended bypassing the selection process, saying she was an \u201cextraordinary Australian\u201d and he had been disappointed the independent panel had not recommended any women. While the Buttrose appointment was widely welcomed, it continued a chain of decisions by the government that sidestepped the process set up to safeguard the ABC from political interference. The result is that most ABC board members now hold office as the direct appointees of the government, meaning the exhaustive selection process has often been in vain. The revelations raise the issue of whether the current minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, will continue the pattern of \u201ccaptain\u2019s picks\u201d set by his predecessor. Two board positions will fall vacant in November this year, when the terms of Ferguson and Walford expire. The selection process for their replacements should begin soon. Fletcher told Guardian Australia that \u201call appointments to the ABC and SBS boards are carefully considered based on a range of factors with a view to the boards doing their jobs effectively\u201d. \u201cOf course another important factor is complying with legislative requirements which set out steps to be taken before appointments can be made.\u201d Hywood, Williams and Robertson all declined to comment on Wednesday, and Finkel is on leave and could not be reached. But other applicants for the board said the process had been so frequently abused that good candidates would be reluctant to subject themselves to it, meaning the minister should either commit to acting on its recommendations or abolish the process \u2013 which would mean changes to legislation. The \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d selection process for appointments to the ABC and SBS board was established by the Rudd Labor government after years of political stacking by both sides of politics. Under the process, applicants for board positions are vetted against selection criteria by a panel that puts a shortlist of recommended candidates to the minister for communications. But the Coalition government has routinely ignored the recommendations in favour of making its own choices. There are nine members of the ABC Board, including managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, and staff-elected director Dr Jane Connors. Out of the remaining seven, five were appointed directly by the Coalition government, outside the independent process. As well, former media executive Peter Lewis, who was appointed through the independent process in 2014, had his term extended by the government for another five years in 2019, meaning there was no independent selection process on that occasion. Wednesday\u2019s release follows an earlier disclosure in August last year that showed some of Australia\u2019s most eminent cultural figures were passed over in 2017 in favour of appointing mining executive Vanessa Guthrie to the board, despite the fact she was not recommended by the independent process. Those recommended but not appointed in 2017 included singer, writer and director Robyn Archer, former managing director of SBS Shaun Brown, and Sandra Levy, former chief executive of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. The release covers the board appointments made in 2015, 2018 and the appointment of the chair early last year. In November 2015, Walford and Ferguson were appointed, but the panel recommended Finkel, company director Kathleen Bailey-Lord, lawyer Katrina Rathie and two other nominees who objected to their names being released. Ferguson was recommended by the independent process but withdrew before being persuaded to take up the appointment by the Fifield. Walford was not recommended. In May 2018, businessman Joseph Gersh was appointed despite not being recommended. The panel preferred Stephen Targett, a company director and deputy chair of the P&amp;N Bank, and two other nominees who objected to their names being released. A Senate inquiry into allegations of political interference at the ABC recommended last April the strengthening of requirements for the leader of the opposition to be consulted over the appointment of the ABC chair, as well as improvements to the transparency of the board selection process. The government rejected all its recommendations, saying the existing process was adequate.",

Nearly all of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, most of the Northern Territory, significant parts of Victoria including east Gippsland and populated areas in south-western Western Australia and north-eastern Tasmania set new records for accumulated fire risk for December, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Most of the rest of the country, including southern Victoria and Tasmania, had scores on the forest fire danger index that were \u201cvery much above average\u201d \u2013 in the worst 10% recorded. The index was developed by the CSIRO in the 1960s, combining data for temperature, wind speed, humidity and dryness. It does not consider the amount of fuel available or how the fire started. Data released on Thursday as part of the bureau\u2019s annual climate statement suggests that, independent of arguments about hazard reduction and arson, most of Australia was more prone to fire in December than in any month since 1950, when records began. This was particularly the case in the worst fire-affected areas: eastern NSW, east Gippsland, southern South Australia and southern Queensland. Average rainfall across the country in December was the lowest on record. Across the year it was 277.6 millimetres, about 40% below average. It was 11% lower than the previous record, set in 1902.

Maximum temperatures were hotter still: 2.09C above average. The data is drawn from the bureau\u2019s long-term ACORN-SAT data. Scientists said climate change due to heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere pushed what would have been a hot year, due to a particularly strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole and a negative Southern Annular Mode over Antarctica, into record territory. Braganza said there were clear decades-long trends of maximum, minimum and average temperatures increasing across Australia. Average temperatures have increased about 1.4C since 1910. There are fewer colder than average days and five times more days of extreme heat than in the middle of last century. He said there was also quite clear evidence that rainfall in south-western Western Australia and parts of the south-east of the country had decreased. The fire season was months longer in some locations, particularly along the south-coast and in east Gippsland, and there was more dangerous fire weather during the fire season. Asked about the role of hazard reduction in preventing bushfires, Braganza said climate change interacted with other risks, including reducing the window of time in which safe hazard reduction could be carried out.

Australia\u2019s national bushfire crisis has burned 10.7m hectares of land, killed at least 26 people and pushed countless species towards extinction. Across the globe, 2019 was the second hottest year on record and the warmest without an El Ni\u00f1o event over the Pacific Ocean. Looking ahead, Braganza said there were signs the delayed northern monsoon that brings rain to northern Australia was starting to get active, but people should not expect widespread above average rainfall.

The Doctor argued that even if done in self-defence, this would make Graham \u201cthe same\u201d as Tim Shaw. It was an especially uncomfortable message at a time when those fighting fascism are often condemned as being as bad as the fascists themselves, for example in Donald Trump\u2019s remarks after Charlottesville, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\">equated</a> white nationalists with those speaking out against them.</p> <p>Another episode focused on Kerblam, an Amazon-a-like delivery company.

However, representation in Chibnall\u2019s era has been severely lacking so far. Characters have repeatedly been introduced as LGBT+, only to be promptly killed off.

The most prominent LGBT+ character in a Chibnall-penned episode, Angstrom, revealed her sexuality by referring to her dead wife. This is an unnerving pattern, and a common trope in media representation of LGBT+ people more widely. An episode featuring an alien man giving birth was criticised as being part of the \u201cPC agenda\u201d, when in reality it felt more like a lazy attempt at trans inclusion.</p> <p>The fans decrying the show as too PC have been lost \u2013 and it\u2019s a loss that should not be mourned. But the show has many loyal progressive fans, too. The Doctor may always have been a beacon of compassion and empathy, but too many of us are wondering where it\u2019s gone.</p>",

An episode featuring an alien man giving birth was criticised as being part of the \u201cPC agenda\u201d, when in reality it felt more like a lazy attempt at trans inclusion. The fans decrying the show as too PC have been lost \u2013 and it\u2019s a loss that should not be mourned. But the show has many loyal progressive fans, too. The Doctor may always have been a beacon of compassion and empathy, but too many of us are wondering where it\u2019s gone.",

He said casualty assessments were under way but \u201cso far, so good\u201d. Zarif made clear the strikes had \u201cconcluded\u201d early on Wednesday morning and characterised them as \u201cproportionate measures in self-defence\u201d rather than an act of war. Iranian officials told state media, without presenting evidence, that at least 80 US personnel had been killed or injured in the strikes and that the toll was being hidden from the public. Television stations ran interviews with people praising the strikes. \u201cThis showed our power,\u201d one man said. It is unclear whether the missile attack will mark an end to Iranian reprisals for the death of Suleimani, the head of al-Quds, an external operations wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), or whether the leadership intends further retribution at a later date. Analysts said the limited casualties could indicate the strikes \u2013 the first direct Iranian attack on a US base \u2013 were designed to allow Iran\u2019s leaders to satisfy their domestic audience that Suleimani\u2019s killing had been avenged, without forcing the Trump administration to retaliate. Reuters news agency cited unnamed US and European officials as saying they believed Iran had deliberately sought to avoid wounding or killing US soldiers in its strikes. The office of the Iraqi prime minister said it had not received any reports of casualties on the Iraqi side and had not been officially notified of any losses among the US-led coalition. Iraq refused any violation of its sovereignty and any attacks on its territory, the statement said. It added that Iraq was doing everything in its power \u201cto contain the situation to avoid a devastating all-out war\u201d. In addition to the strikes, Iranian state media said the country had launched fighter jets that had penetrated Iraqi airspace, but it was unclear whether their mission had been defensive or intended as misdirection. Iran\u2019s Khamenei told an audience in the city of Qom: \u201cWe just gave [the US] a slap in the face last night. But that is not equivalent to what they did.\u201d He said: \u201cMilitary action like this is not sufficient. What is important is ending the corrupting presence of America in the region.\u201d Washington\u2019s targeted killing of Suleimani in Baghdad had already stoked resentment of the US\u2019s longstanding presence in Iraq. On Sunday, the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding motion to expel US troops. The Iraqi government, however, has not said whether it will demand a withdrawal. In the Iraqi city of Ramadi, a 50-year-old man who did not provide his name, said he feared that the moment US troops left, Iran would move in to take control of Iraq. And if the two powers continued to fight in Iraq, \u201cwe will pay the price\u201d, he said. The US has said that both the attacked bases were on high alert in recent days in anticipation of an Iranian response to Suleimani\u2019s assassination. The sprawling al-Asad airbase, about 37 miles (60km) west of Baghdad, has been used by American and coalition forces since its capture during the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, and has been visited by Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence, in the past 18 months. It is estimated to host about 1,500 foreign troops. IRGC officials were quoted in state media warning the US against retaliating for the missile strikes. They said Israel could be attacked if it did. Speaking in Jerusalem on Wednesday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his country would strike back hard if targeted. \u201cWhoever tries to attack us will be dealt the strongest blow,\u201d he said, adding the country stood behind Trump\u2019s decision to kill Suleimani. Al-Asad has previously been a target of an Iranian-backed Shia militia, Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, whose attacks on US and coalition troops triggered tit-for-tat strikes that culminated in the drone strike. Threats between Washington and Tehran have escalated in the past few days, with Iran warning it had multiple \u201crevenge scenarios\u201d, while Trump said he could bomb Iranian cultural sites, a potential war crime. The tensions have led US allies to start leaving Baghdad, which was buzzing as night fell on Tuesday with helicopters flying in and out of the city\u2019s fortified diplomatic district, known as the Green Zone. Canada, which leads the Nato training mission, said it was pulling out some of its 500 troops, and Germany said its presence in Iraq would be \u201ctemporarily thinned out\u201d. Most of the Nato troops withdrawing were reported to be heading for Kuwait. \u201cWe have temporarily suspended our training on the ground, and we are taking all precautions necessary to protect our people,\u201d a Nato spokesperson said. \u201cThis includes the temporary repositioning of some personnel to different locations both inside and outside of Iraq.\u201d The US-led coalition to counter Isis is also repositioning its forces to lessen their vulnerability to attack. Britain\u2019s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said non-essential personnel were being moved from Baghdad to Taji, about 19 miles to the north. Responding to the strikes, Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said: \u201cWe condemn this attack on Iraqi military bases hosting coalition \u2013 including British \u2013 forces. \u201cWe are concerned by reports of casualties and use of ballistic missiles. We urge Iran not to repeat these reckless and dangerous attacks, and instead to pursue urgent de-escalation. \u201cA war in the Middle East would only benefit Daesh [Isis] and other terrorist groups.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A PALMING INFLUENCE Anyone who witnessed Manchester United being trampled on by their noisy neighbours in the Worthington Cup will have noticed a slight gulf in class. Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is also aware of it but the club are intent on only signing players who will improve the squad, meaning William Prunier and David Bellion are waiting by the phone. How do you improve on perfect mid-table mediocrity? Well ... The Fiver has been scouting to help Ole replace the outgoing Ashley Young, who looks likely to swap the Lowry Outlet for the chic streets of Milan. If a former Watford winger-cum-full-back is not what is required then the only answer is to find an even more versatile ex-Hornet to bring to Old Trafford. The finest utility man around is Steve Palmer, aged 51. Before we even start on his footballing capabilities, Palmer is a Cambridge graduate. The cerebral qualities of a man with a degree in software engineering could be useful for the ticket office, something Youngy cannot boast. During the 1997-98 season (yes, he brings a wealth of experience) Palmer started the penultimate game in goal just so he could wear the No 1 shirt, eventually sporting every number from 1-14 during the campaign. He swapped shirts with Alec Chamberlain after roughly four seconds, so has never conceded as a goalkeeper. With David De Gea chucking a few into his own net in recent weeks, it could be useful to have an extra pair of hands. Joking aside, Palmer\u2019s main position is defensive midfield and United are crying out for someone there to replace the injured Scott McTominay and provide more mobility than Nemanja Matic. Alternatively, he is no stranger to playing at centre-back and with the defensive crisis at United caused by varying degrees of knack suffered by Harry Maguire, Eric Bailly and calamity\u2019s Phil Jones \u2013 not to mention Victor Lindelof forgetting what football was on Tuesday night \u2013 he could do a job there, too. Palmer can slot in alongside whoever is left.

      "body": "<p>The new year may provide the impetus to look for a new job, but is your CV good enough? A <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/business/bosses-biggest-cv-faux-pas-21233881\" title=\"\">poll</a> of 1,000 recruiters, by Adecco Retail, found it takes 34 seconds for an employer to decide whether a CV is worth further consideration. Cliches, lies and typos are all reasons people are not offered an interview. So how do you craft the perfect CV? Two experts give their tips.</p> <h2><strong>Be relevant</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cThe key to a great CV is helping you stand out. You need to present yourself well, but you also need to ensure the experience you are communicating is relevant to the job,\u201d says David D\u2019Souza, the membership director of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the professional HR body. \u201cLook at the job description, and make sure that it\u2019s clear why you\u2019ll be able to deliver in that role.\u201d Some employers still welcome a cover letter, but he advises contacting the hiring team to gauge what they would like.</p> <h2><strong>Mind your language</strong><br></h2> <p>Avoid tired expressions such as passionate, hardworking and team player. \u201cIt does depend on the type of job you do, but use descriptive words that mean something,\u201d says Ruth Cornish, an HR expert who runs consultancy Amelore.com. She likes the word \u201caccountable\u201d, as well as \u201cachieve\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d. \u201cWhat was the purpose of your role? Why were you there?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Pay attention to detail</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be positive about yourself because we tend to be quite humble, and it\u2019s hard to read your CV as if you\u2019re seeing it for the first time,\u201d says D\u2019Souza. Show it to someone you trust \u2013 ideally, someone who has worked with you \u2013 and ask for feedback.</p> <h2><strong>Keep it short</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cBe concise and don\u2019t be afraid to delete experience if it\u2019s not relevant to that role,\u201d says D\u2019Souza. \u201cPeople talk about the traditional two-page limit, but it depends on the sector and the seniority you\u2019re going for but, broadly speaking, if you can keep it to two pages, the recruiter will be delighted.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Be accurate</strong><br></h2> <p>Recruiters will judge you on mistakes, either in structure or in spelling or punctuation. \u201cUse auto-correct, but also get other people to check for errors,\u201d says D\u2019Souza.</p> <h2><strong>Make sure it reflects you</strong><br></h2> <p>The look and feel \u2013 making it polished and professional \u2013 is important. \u201cWhat font have you used?\u201d says Cornish. \u201cAre there different fonts, and bold here and there? No header? Think about the use of colour.

      "bodyText": "The new year may provide the impetus to look for a new job, but is your CV good enough? A poll of 1,000 recruiters, by Adecco Retail, found it takes 34 seconds for an employer to decide whether a CV is worth further consideration. Cliches, lies and typos are all reasons people are not offered an interview. So how do you craft the perfect CV? Two experts give their tips. Be relevant \u201cThe key to a great CV is helping you stand out. You need to present yourself well, but you also need to ensure the experience you are communicating is relevant to the job,\u201d says David D\u2019Souza, the membership director of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the professional HR body. \u201cLook at the job description, and make sure that it\u2019s clear why you\u2019ll be able to deliver in that role.\u201d Some employers still welcome a cover letter, but he advises contacting the hiring team to gauge what they would like. Mind your language Avoid tired expressions such as passionate, hardworking and team player. \u201cIt does depend on the type of job you do, but use descriptive words that mean something,\u201d says Ruth Cornish, an HR expert who runs consultancy Amelore.com. She likes the word \u201caccountable\u201d, as well as \u201cachieve\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d. \u201cWhat was the purpose of your role? Why were you there?\u201d Pay attention to detail \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be positive about yourself because we tend to be quite humble, and it\u2019s hard to read your CV as if you\u2019re seeing it for the first time,\u201d says D\u2019Souza. Show it to someone you trust \u2013 ideally, someone who has worked with you \u2013 and ask for feedback. Keep it short \u201cBe concise and don\u2019t be afraid to delete experience if it\u2019s not relevant to that role,\u201d says D\u2019Souza. \u201cPeople talk about the traditional two-page limit, but it depends on the sector and the seniority you\u2019re going for but, broadly speaking, if you can keep it to two pages, the recruiter will be delighted.\u201d Be accurate Recruiters will judge you on mistakes, either in structure or in spelling or punctuation. \u201cUse auto-correct, but also get other people to check for errors,\u201d says D\u2019Souza. Make sure it reflects you The look and feel \u2013 making it polished and professional \u2013 is important. \u201cWhat font have you used?\u201d says Cornish. \u201cAre there different fonts, and bold here and there? No header? Think about the use of colour. You can really polish that document.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to include personal information Don\u2019t ramble on about your pets or travel experiences, but if you have been on maternity leave, say it. \u201cPeople are more aware of the fact that women and men take time out to have children,\u201d says Cornish. Don\u2019t necessarily include a photo D\u2019Souza is not a fan of photos. \u201cThey can be problematic \u2013 it invites people to evaluate you on how you look rather than the substance of your work. There is some debate about whether people should be inventive on CVs. If you want to play it safe, a traditional CV, highlighting your key achievements that are relevant to the role is still the best way of securing a job, unless it\u2019s a particularly creative sector.\u201d Include interesting hobbies Team sports look good, \u201cor something which show a degree of dedication, but avoid things that are \u2018I go out and enjoy socialising\u2019 because that doesn\u2019t tell them anything more about you as a person,\u201d says D\u2019Souza. Or maybe don\u2019t do a CV at all \u201cI\u2019ve seen video CVs, where you just send in a clip about yourself,\u201d says Cornish. \u201cThat\u2019s increasingly common for younger, creative people.

Barbash was approached by the film\u2019s producers about her involvement but she claims they offered her \u201cpeanuts\u201d. In the suit, Barbash alleges they tried to \u201cobtain a consent and waiver\u201d but she refused to sign it. Barbash also alleges she has been defamed in the film, which shows Lopez\u2019s character \u201cusing and manufacturing illegal substances in her home where she lived with her child\u201d. The suit reads: \u201cDefendants did not take caution to protect the rights of Ms Barbash by creating a fictionalised character, or by creating a composite of characters to render J-Lo\u2019s character a new fictitious one; rather they engaged in a systematic effort to make it well-known that J-Lo was playing Ms Barbash.\u201d Barbash was placed on probation for five years after pleading guilty to conspiracy, assault and grand larceny. When the film was released to great acclaim and a $157m total at the global box office, Barbash told Vanity Fair she wasn\u2019t a fan. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really that impressed,\u201d she said. \u201cI was impressed with Jennifer. She was incredible. Her body looked incredible. She had it down to a tee, but it wasn\u2019t factual.\u201d Roselyn Keo, who inspired Constance Wu\u2019s lead character, chose to support the release at its Toronto film festival premiere and has written a memoir called The Sophisticated Hustler. Lopez and the companies at the centre of the suit have yet to respond.",

      "bodyText": "Elton John, the Marvel star Chris Hemsworth and the heavy metal act Metallica are the latest big names to donate significant amounts to the Australian bushfire relief effort, with John and Hemsworth each committing A$1m (\u00a3523,000) to the cause. John announced his donation while on stage during a concert in Sydney on Tuesday, saying people should be \u201cin awe of the work the firefighters are doing\u201d, before pledging to send A$1m to help with the relief effort. \u201cThere are people out there who have lost their lives trying to save homes, there are people who have lost their lives and their homes,\u201d the singer said. \u201cAnd lastly, there\u2019s the plight of the animals, a loss of their habitat that frankly is on a biblical scale and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d Hemsworth, who was born in Melbourne, encouraged people to \u201cchip in\u201d with donations during an Instagram video in which he also confirmed he was personally donating A$1m to the effort. The Avengers actor included donation links to firefighting organisations and charities \u2013 including the Australian Red Cross, New South Wales regional fire service and the WWF \u2013 which he said were \u201cworking flat-out to provide support and relief during this devastating and challenging time\u201d. Metallica announced on Twitter they would be pledging A$750,000 to be split between the NSW Rural Fire Service and to the Country Fire Authority in Victoria to aid in the relief efforts. They said: \u201cNSW Rural Fire Service is the world\u2019s largest volunteer firefighting organisation and all funds donated during this state of emergency are directed toward services related to and victims of these particularly destructive Australian bushfires.\u201d The donations come after news that three Australian states (South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales) will be exposed to more dangerous bushfire weather from Thursday. The fires have already burned through 8.4m hectares of land (32,430 sq miles) and caused the death of three volunteer firefighters and at least 26 people. The economic impact of the fires is estimated to climb above A$4.4bn, which was the record set by the Black Saturday blazes in 2009that burned through 450,000 hectares. The donations follow those by other high-profile cultural figures who have made significant contributions to the relief effort. Pink said she would donate A$500,000, Kylie Minogue pledged the same amount, while the Australian comedian Celeste Barber has raised more than A$27m for the NSW Rural Fire Service and Brigades Donations Fund. Nicole Kidman and the American country music star Keith Urban also pledged A$500,000 to the Rural Fire Services, while pop star Halsey played a benefit concert for Melbourne\u2019s Country Fire Authority after the Falls festival in Byron Bay she was due to play was forced to evacuate due to a severe weather warning.",

I, too, had lived with depression, with the mysterious shadow that was either a part of myself or beyond myself, I could never quite tell. Was this me, all the time, or could this be fixed? What was it, anyhow, that needed fixing? I had read William Styron\u2019s memoir of his depression, Darkness Visible, when it came out in 1989, my final year in college; it\u2019s a book I still admire, yet Styron\u2019s life was so far removed from mine that it was hard to find a real echo of my suffering in its pages. Suffering: it\u2019s hard to type, even now. Who was I to suffer when there was, and is, so much real suffering in the world? But that\u2019s not how depression works.</p> <p>Prozac Nation is a portrait of depression\u2019s narcissism, the desperate focus on the self that blots out the rest of the world. But, if there here was no denying Wurtzel\u2019s privilege, there was also no denying her pain: she gave it all to us, every last drop. When I found her book \u2013 thanks to all the hype that surrounded it \u2013 well, it was a godsend. It allowed me to begin to think about whatever it was I was going through. It also allowed me to consider the possibility of taking medication for an illness, as I took medication for other illnesses; that, too, was an extraordinary personal liberation.</p> <p>If Prozac Nation now seems less remarkable than it did in 1994, that\u2019s because it did mark a shift in the conversation. You could argue that it was one of the most characteristic literary products of the early 90s: the end of history, remember? The Berlin Wall had fallen, Clinton had yet to be impeached, Britain was now seamlessly connected to Europe thanks to the opening of the Channel tunnel: no need to look outward any more, so why not gaze right in? Not that the confessional memoir was really anything new: St Augustine had opened up the subject centuries before, and certainly it\u2019s fair to say that Wurtzel\u2019s memoir rhymes with books such as Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar and JD Salinger\u2019s The Catcher in the Rye.</p> <p>But those books are, of course, novels. The way in which we now take the most coruscating personal memoir for granted owes something to Wurtzel. Kathryn Harrison\u2019s The Kiss, about incest, appeared a few years later; into the new millennium came books such as James Frey\u2019s A Million Little Pieces, about his drug addiction and recovery, and Rachel Cusk\u2019s Aftermath, a powerful portrait of divorce. Is there an echo of Wurtzel in Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s obsessive detailing of his and his family\u2019s lives over the six volumes of My Struggle? Perhaps.</p> <p>All these books, in their different ways, worked to begin difficult conversations and that is no bad thing. Wurtzel continued along the path of brutal self-revelation, and it didn\u2019t always win her friends. But the way in which she revealed herself blew open a door. I would think of her work, too, when I read Andrew Solomon\u2019s extraordinary book, The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression, published in 2001. It is a memoir of his own bitter suffering, but also a complete engagement with how depression is viewed and treated across the world; it looks both inward and outward, with both thoroughness and compassion.</p> <p>Sometimes, I admit, I\u2019m forced to wonder if there is a downside to all this openness. Part of the pleasure \u2013 let\u2019s call it that \u2013 of reading a book like Prozac Nation is the shocking sense that you, the reader, are privy to information to which you are not at all entitled. In our daily lives the sharing of this sort of information is a true intimacy, a marker that a friendship or relationship has crossed a very particular boundary. Confessional memoir leaps across that boundary with abandon. I wonder, now, if there is an unspoken or even an unconscious pressure on those who embark on memoir to give themselves away wholly, to hold nothing back, no matter what it might cost them \u2013 or those close to them.</p> <p>Yet the pull towards revelation, and the push back against it, has always been the compelling tension in the memoir form. How much is enough? How much is too much. Elizabeth Wurtzel was, in all her writing, thrillingly <em>too much</em> \u2013 and the world is a poorer place without her.</p>",

Kathryn Harrison\u2019s The Kiss, about incest, appeared a few years later; into the new millennium came books such as James Frey\u2019s A Million Little Pieces, about his drug addiction and recovery, and Rachel Cusk\u2019s Aftermath, a powerful portrait of divorce. Is there an echo of Wurtzel in Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s obsessive detailing of his and his family\u2019s lives over the six volumes of My Struggle? Perhaps. All these books, in their different ways, worked to begin difficult conversations and that is no bad thing. Wurtzel continued along the path of brutal self-revelation, and it didn\u2019t always win her friends. But the way in which she revealed herself blew open a door. I would think of her work, too, when I read Andrew Solomon\u2019s extraordinary book, The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression, published in 2001. It is a memoir of his own bitter suffering, but also a complete engagement with how depression is viewed and treated across the world; it looks both inward and outward, with both thoroughness and compassion. Sometimes, I admit, I\u2019m forced to wonder if there is a downside to all this openness. Part of the pleasure \u2013 let\u2019s call it that \u2013 of reading a book like Prozac Nation is the shocking sense that you, the reader, are privy to information to which you are not at all entitled. In our daily lives the sharing of this sort of information is a true intimacy, a marker that a friendship or relationship has crossed a very particular boundary. Confessional memoir leaps across that boundary with abandon. I wonder, now, if there is an unspoken or even an unconscious pressure on those who embark on memoir to give themselves away wholly, to hold nothing back, no matter what it might cost them \u2013 or those close to them. Yet the pull towards revelation, and the push back against it, has always been the compelling tension in the memoir form. How much is enough? How much is too much. Elizabeth Wurtzel was, in all her writing, thrillingly too much \u2013 and the world is a poorer place without her.",

      "bodyText": "This live blog has closed. You can follow the latest updates on our new live blog: Iran launched more than a dozen missiles at Iraqi bases hosting US and coalition troops overnight, declaring the strikes to be retaliation for the killing last week of the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. You can read the full report here. Iranian officials initially told state media, without presenting evidence, that at least 80 US personnel had been killed or injured in the strikes, but President Donald Trump tweeted that casualty assessments were underway but \u201cso far, so good\u201d. He is expected to make a statement this morning. The Iraqi prime minister\u2019s office said they had received a verbal message from the Iranians shortly after midnight saying that their \u201cresponse to the assassination of the martyr Qassem Soleimani had begun or would start shortly\u201d and would be limited to US military stationed in Iraq. At the same time, they were informed by the Americans that strikes had begun against US forces at various locations in the country. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, described the bombings as \u201ca slap in the face\u201d for the US but warned that Tehran still had a wider goal of expelling its enemy from the region. He told an audience in the city of Qom: We just gave [the US] a slap in the face last night. But that is not equivalent to what they did. International leaders have called on both sides to refrain from further violence. EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said \u201cthe use of weapons must stop now to give space for dialogue\u201d. Meanwhile, a passenger plane bound for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has crashed a few minutes after taking off from Tehran\u2019s main international airport, killing 176 people. Iran\u2019s Red Crescent said there was no chance of finding survivors, and Pir Hossein Kulivand, an Iranian emergency official, later told state TV all those onboard had been killed. Iran has said it will not hand over the black box of the plane \u2013 which contains vital records of how the tragedy occurred \u2013 to Boeing. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has condemned Iran\u2019s missile strike against US forces in Iraq, while a Nato official says there were no casualties among the military alliances personnel in the country. The Iraqi mission consists of several hundred staff from allied nations and non-Nato countries. In a message to the Associated Press, the Nato official who was not authorised to speak publicly said they were \u201ckeeping the situation under close review\u201d. Meanwhile, in a message posted on Twitter, Stoltenberg urged Iran to refrain from further violence. French citizens in the Israeli city of Haifa should exercise caution in light of the tensions in the Middle East, the French Foreign Ministry has said in an update to security advice on its website. \u201cFollowing the recent escalation in tensions in the region, the city of Haifa has been the subject of explicit threats,\u201d it said in a statement, without giving any more precise details. Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office doesn\u2019t specifically mention Haifa, but advises visitors to the travel section of its website: \u201cThere is a possibility of an increased threat against western interests and the security situation could worsen with little warning.\u201d Slovenia\u2019s defence ministry has said its six soldiers stationed in northern Iraq with a German-led training mission will be evacuated after their base came under Iranian missile attack overnight. The Slovenian ministry said the soldiers were unhurt in the attack near Irbil as they were in the base\u2019s shelter during the strike. As we reported on Tuesday, Germany is reducing its troop numbers in Iraq for security reasons after the death of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad last week. It is the first coalition withdrawal since the Iraqi parliament voted on Sunday to call for the withdrawal of US forces from the country. The non-binding resolution has prompted a chaotic response from US officials. We\u2019ve produced a useful visual guide to the latest developments in the region, as Iranian strikes on US airbases in Iraq intensified the crisis sparked by the US killing of Suliemani last week. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said: \u201cIsn\u2019t the truth, Mr Speaker, that this prime minister is unable to stand up to President Trump because he has hitched his wagon to a trade deal with the United States and that prioritises everything else that he ought to be considering?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cThis is absolute fiction. But what I will say is that the UK will continue to work for de-escalation in the region.\u201d Boris Johnson has told parliament that Qassem Suleimani had the \u201cblood of British troops on his hands\u201d. Answering a question from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, during the first prime minister\u2019s questions since the British general election, Johnson said the US had the right to defend its bases. During exchanges that were interpreted as a further move by Britain towards the US position on the killing of the Iranian general last week, Johnson also sidestepped questions from Corbyn about the legality of the killing. \u201cClearly the strict issue of legality is not for the UK to determine since it was not our operation,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cBut I think most reasonable people would accept that the United States has the right to protect its bases and its personnel.\u201d He added that the senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards figure had supplied \u201cimprovised explosive devices to terrorists, which I\u2019m afraid killed and maimed British troops\u201d. He added: \u201cThat man had the blood of British troops on his hands.\u201d Johnson also left open the question of whether Britain would abide by Iraqi wishes for US and British troops to withdraw from the country if the government followed through on a vote taken by the Iraqi parliament. He added that Britain would work to secure the security of people in Iraq from Isis. Prime minister\u2019s questions is taking place in the UK parliament and Boris Johnson has been asked about escalating tensions between the US and Iran. You can read live updates from the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Sparrow here: Nechirvan Barzani, the president of Iraq\u2019s autonomous Kurdish north, has issued a televised statement, saying that he does not want Iraq to \u201cbecome a battleground\u201d and that it needs the support of coalition forces to help tackle Isis. Kuwait says its state-run Kuna news agency\u2019s Twitter account was hacked and posted a false story about US troops withdrawing from the country. There are more than 13,000 US troops in Kuwait. Major airlines have cancelled Iran and Iraq flights and rerouted others away from both countries\u2019 airspace, Reuters reports. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa, Dubai-based Emirates and the low-cost flydubai were among airlines that cancelled flights, as the US Federal Aviation Administration barred American carriers from the area. Several other carriers will continue operations over the affected airspace. This is from the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour: Iran says it will not hand over the black box of the Ukrainian plane to Boeing. The black box containing vital records of how the plane crashed has been located in a field among the debris of the plane outside Tehran. It is not clear whether Iranian authorities are disputing the legality of handing over the black box to Boeing, or whether they are seeking to inspect the box themselves. The Ukrainian government has deleted a tweet saying the plane\u2019s crash was the result of an accident. The news has fuelled speculation that there is something suspicious about the downing of the plane, with one theory doing the rounds on social media that Iran could have mistaken the plane for an incoming US military aircraft. Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u2019s president, has tweeted that the country\u2019s \u201cfinal answer\u201d to the assassination of Gen Qassem Suleimani will be to \u201ckick all US forces out of the region\u201d. From the Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi: Poland\u2019s foreign ministry says its ambassador to Iraq, Beata Peksa, has been recalled to Poland for security reasons amid rising tensions between the US and Iran, reports the Associated Press. The evacuation came at Britain\u2019s request because Poland\u2019s diplomatic mission is located in the British embassy. According to Poland\u2019s foreign ministry, only the ambassador was evacuated while its embassy in Baghdad continues its work. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Middle East correspondent, Raf Sanchez: The Twitter account for the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, has issued a statement saying he received a verbal message from the Iranians shortly after midnight saying that their \u201cresponse to the assassination of the martyr Qassem Soleimani had begun or would start shortly\u201d and would be limited to US military stationed in Iraq. At the same time, they were informed by the Americans that strikes had begun against US forces at various locations in Iraq. The statement said there had not been any Iraqi casualties reported so far and they had not been told of losses by coalition forces. Here is a passage, translated using Google translate: \u201cWe have called, and we call on all, to exercise restraint \u2026 adhere to international covenants, respect the Iraqi state and the decisions of its government, and help it to contain and overcome this serious crisis threatening it, the region, and the world with a devastating, comprehensive war.\u201d The EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has commented on tensions between Iran and the US. She said \u201cthe use of weapons must stop now to give space for dialogue\u201d. The Twitter account for Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, has issued the following statements: The Guardian\u2019s international correspondent Michael Safi has this analysis of last night\u2019s events. The attacks will provide an opportunity for hawks inside the Donald Trump administration to ratchet up the conflict with Iran \u2013 but also potentially a pathway out of the crisis. The Iranian strikes were heavy on symbolism. The missiles were launched around 1.30am in Iraq, roughly the same time as the drone strike that killed Suleimani on Friday morning. Top Iranian advisers and semi-official media outlets tweeted pictures of the country\u2019s flag during the attack, mirroring Donald Trump\u2019s tweet as the first reports of Suleimani\u2019s death were emerging. The Revolutionary Guards dubbed the operation \u201cMartyr Suleimani\u201d. Videos of the missiles being launched were released to Iranian media outlets. But in their immediate aftermath, the attacks appear to have been carefully calibrated to avoid US casualties \u2013 fired at bases that were already on high alert. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned that his country would strike back hard against anyone who attacked it, as he reiterated his support for the US killing of the Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani last week. \u201cWhoever tries to attack us will be dealt the strongest blow,\u201d Netanyahu said, according to Reuters. He said Israel \u201cstands completely\u201d behind Trump\u2019s decision and that the president should be congratulated for acting \u201cswiftly, boldly and resolutely\u201d. The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has said preliminary reports on the Iranian strikes were \u201cpositive\u201d. \u201cInitial assessments are positive and we pray those reports are true. Our military is by far the strongest in the world and our cause is just,\u201d Friedman, a former Trump bankruptcy lawyer, said at an event hosted by the rightwing Kohelet Policy Forum in Jerusalem. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has told the chief of the Australian defence force \u201cto take whatever actions are necessary\u201d to protect Australian troops and diplomats in Iraq after Iran began bombing allied military bases. Morrison said all defence and diplomatic staff in the country were safe, reports Guardian Australia\u2019s Ben Doherty. David Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief, has written about how the US clash with Iran echoes the march into the Iraq war. A Republican president facing a tough re-election campaign and widely viewed as hopelessly out of his depth. Bureaucrats itching to turn US military firepower on a Middle Eastern regime they claim without evidence is plotting an imminent attack. Compliant sections of the media that put flag-waving jingoism ahead of skeptical scrutiny. So it was in late 2002, when President George W Bush\u2019s administration built unstoppable momentum towards invading Iraq, promising to destroy weapons of mass destruction (WMD) that never existed. Nearly two decades later the potential target is not Iraq but Iran, with many of the same concerns over false pretexts and official lies. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister has released more information about the people onboard the plane bound for Kiev that crashed minutes after taking off from Tehran\u2019s main international airport. Among the plane\u2019s passengers were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians (two passengers and nine crew), 10 Swedish people, four people from Afghanistan, three from Germany and three from the UK. Ukraine\u2019s national security council has confirmed that 11 Ukrainian citizens died in the crash of an Ukrainian airliner in Iran, including nine crew members. In a separate statement, reported by Reuters, Ukraine International Airlines said it was suspending flights to Tehran indefinitely and that the crashed plane had its last scheduled maintenance on Monday. The airline said it was doing everything possible to find out the causes of the crash and that it was providing all possible assistance to the relatives of those killed. The Conservative MP Tom Tugenhat, who was chairman of the defence committee during the last UK parliament, has been speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said the Iran attack on US military bases in Iraq was \u201cnot hugely surprising\u201d. He said it would be \u201cextremely welcome\u201d if the action marked the end of the tensions and both sides could \u201cget back to talking\u201d. As far as I\u2019m aware, it is the first time Iranian ballistic missiles have been fired directly at US bases. That is slightly caveating it, because of course the Iranians have been firing missiles via proxy for many, many years \u2026 If both sides can declare victory and get back to talking, then that would be extremely welcome. The Ukrainian embassy to Iran has said preliminary information suggests engine failure caused the crash of a Ukrainian airliner in Iran, rather than a missile attack or act of terrorism. Reuters reports that the embassy also said in a statement that 168 people had bought tickets for the flight. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is still speaking in Qoms. He\u2019s now paying tribute to Qassam Suleimani. \u201cHis martyrdom showed that the revolution is alive,\u201d he says. The crowd in the hall is audibly crying and chanting \u201cdeath to America\u201d. He addresses the missile strikes in Iraq only briefly. \u201cWe just gave them a slap in the face last night,\u201d he says. \u201cRetaliation, these military actions, do not compensate for the issue. What is important is the ending of American presence.\u201d Now he\u2019s moved on to elucidating the evils of the US presence in the region. Here\u2019s the full statement from the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, responding to the Iranian missile strikes against US troops in Iraq: We condemn this attack on Iraqi military bases hosting coalition \u2013 including British \u2013 forces. We are concerned by reports of casualties and use of ballistic missiles. We urge Iran not to repeat these reckless and dangerous attacks, and instead to pursue urgent de-escalation. A war in the Middle East would only benefit Daesh and other terrorist groups. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is speaking in the holy city of Qom. He is addressing a ceremony to commemorate a 1978 massacre of protesters by the Shah\u2019s security forces. He says he will first discuss this anniversary before his talks about Qassam Suleimani and \u2013 we expect \u2013 the missile strikes overnight. The Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau researcher, Lillian Yang, reports that Iran\u2019s Beijing embassy posted about the missile strikes on Weibo today, saying: \u201cThe end of the US\u2019s evil force in western Asia has begun.\u201d Reuters reports that Iran\u2019s president will deliver a speech to the nation, Iranian state television said on Wednesday after Tehran launched missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq. It did not give a timing for the speech by President Hassan Rouhani. No Iraqis were harmed in Wednesday morning\u2019s attacks on bases by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, according to the security cell of the country\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office. The cell says the missile barrage lasted for 30 minutes from 1.45am and included 22 projectiles, 17 of which landed on the Al Asad base, including two that failed to explode. A further five missiles struck the city of Erbil in the north. So far we\u2019ve had the Iraqis, the Canadians and the Norwegians say they suffered no casualties, and the US is saying \u201cso far so good\u201d. This supports the idea that Iran carefully designed this strike to satisfy its domestic audience that Qassem Suleimani\u2019s death had been publicly avenged while also providing room for the US not to respond and to de-escalate the conflict. Our reporter Michael Safi writes that while this claim is \u201calmost certainly not true\u201d, it allows Iran to \u201cbeat their chest and claim victory\u201d. In analysis for the Guardian, Safi writes that the highly symbolic missile strikes potentially offer \u201ca pathway out of the crisis\u201d. In their immediate aftermath, the attacks appear to have been carefully calibrated to avoid US casualties \u2013 fired at bases that were already on high alert. Iran\u2019s foreign minister has said the strikes have concluded and characterised them as self-defence within the boundaries of international law \u2013 not the first shots in a war. Trump, in his first comments after the strikes, also sought to play them down. If Trump\u2019s assessment of the damage holds, Wednesday\u2019s strikes might be an opportunity for both sides to de-escalate without losing face. Iran will be able to say it took violent revenge for Suleimani\u2019s death and pivot to a campaign of proxy warfare \u2013 with which it feels more comfortable, against a vastly more powerful adversary \u2013 and diplomatic pressure to eject American forces from Iraq. The US can also step back, shrugging off the retaliation as being of no significant consequence. That is the best-case scenario, but it rests on two risky premises: that more than a dozen missiles struck bases hosting US military personnel without substantial damage or casualties; and that the White House will resist any urge to respond. The Red Crescent organisation in Iran has confirmed that all those who were on board the Boeing flight from Tehran to Ukraine, which crashed minutes after takeoff, will have died. The plane was believed to have been carrying 180 people. Early indications suggested the crash did not appear to have links to Wednesday morning\u2019s missile strikes on bases in Iraq hosting US and coalition troops. Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, who is a combat veteran as well as being a Congresswoman, was asked about the missile attacks tonight. She said that hearing about the attack at al-Asad airbase \u201cbrought back a flood of memories\u201d from when she served in Iraq in 2005, during which time her camp \u201creceived daily mortar attacks, daily rocket attacks\u201d. \u201cI just checked my phone, and I\u2019ve got a flood of messages from friends of mine who I deployed with, some who are still serving in the National Guard or Reserves or on active duty. And honestly, they\u2019re texting me saying: \u2018What the fuck is going on?\u2019 \u201cThose of us who have served there understand very clearly the serious ramifications and the cost of what is happening here and the fact that we do not need to be here nor should we be in the position, as a country, of waging yet another wasteful, unnecessary war.\u201d Boeing has released a statement about reports that one of their passenger planes crashed minutes after takeoff from Tehran airport, though there\u2019s not much information in the statement at this stage. Canada has confirmed that its deployed personnel are safe and accounted for following the missile attacks. Jon Ostrower, a self-confessed aviation geek and the editor-in-chief of The Air Current, has tweeted a screenshot of Flight Radar, which shows the plane that crashed taking off from Tehran. He has also clarified the plane was a 737-800, not the 737 Max, which has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes. Hello, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Maanvi Singh. Some more breaking news out of Iran, a passenger plane carrying 180 people bound for the Ukrainian capital Kiev has crashed a few minutes after taking off from Tehran\u2019s main international airport, according to Iranian media outlets. The Boeing 737-800 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines took off from Imam Khomeini international airport at 6.12am Tehran time and crashed about eight minutes later, according to flight tracking websites. At this stage, the crash appears to have no link to Wednesday morning\u2019s missile strikes on bases in Iraq hosting US and coalition troops. The story is just breaking, we\u2019ll bring you updates in the blog and in our full news wrap here. Iran launched more than a dozen missiles at US military sites in Iraq. There is no official word yet on the number of casualties and injured. The attacks were in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, who US forces killed in a strike last week. Donald Trump has said little about the attacks so far, tweeting \u201cAll is good!\u201d and indicating that he would make a statement in the morning. The Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif said that his country has taken and \u201cconcluded\u201d what he believed to be \u201cmeasures in self-defense\u201d, indicating that the attacks were over, for now. The FAA issued restrictions on flying over Iran and Iraq. 2020 presidential candidates stated support for Americans overseas and a desire to deescalate as news of the attack trickled in. British forces are on standby to respond to as the crisis escalates. The Australian prime minister confirmed that Australian defense and diplomatic staff in the country were now safe. Iranian\u2019s Fars news agency reported that a jet bound for Ukraine crashed in Iran shortly after taking off from Tehran, possibly due to technical issues. There\u2019s no further information available at this time. Here\u2019s a map of all the flights moving out of the airspace over Iran, Iraq and the Gulf. The FAA issued restrictions on flying over Iraq and Iran just over an hour ago. The Australian prime minister has confirmed that no Australians were hurt in the strikes. There\u2019s no official word yet on US casualties. Unconfirmed reports indicate that some Iraqi nationals may have been hurt or killed. The president has tweeted after hours of silence. \u201cAssessment of casualties &amp; damages taking place now. So far, so good!\u201d he said, adding that he will be making a statement tomorrow morning. The White House has released Trump\u2019s schedule for tomorrow, which looks very thin. He has an intelligence briefing at 2:15 ET, but apparently has nothing else scheduled for the day. Iran\u2019s foreign minister Javad Zarif has tweeted a statement, saying \u201cwe do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression\u201d. It\u2019s worth noting that Zarif said Iran took and concluded attacks against the US, suggesting that his country won\u2019t escalate further, for now. Meanwhile, 2020 presidential candidates have made statements urging de-esclation and expressing support for US troops in the region. Elizabeth Warren, who spoke to supporters in New York along with Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 her former 2020 competitor \u2013 started by addressing the Iranian attacks. Joe Biden who earlier had said that Trump \u201cis bringing us dangerously close to starting\u201d another war, said he\u2019s holding off on commenting \u201cuntil we know more\u201d, and added that he and his wife Jill Biden are praying for troop and American overseas. Pete Buttigieg also expressed support forAmericans overseas. Amy Klobuchar reportedly skipped a fundraiser in DC this evening due to the developments in the Middle East. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has told the chief of the Australian defense force to \u201cto take whatever actions are necessary to protect and defend\u201d Australian troops and diplomats in Iraq. This may involve pulling Australian troops out of the country. Earlier, the foreign minister Marise Payne said Australia was contemplating the \u201cpossible implications\u201d of being forced to withdraw troops by the Iraqi government. Australia\u2019s military commitment in the Middle East is numerically small - about 450 personnel - but as an unswerving US ally, Australia\u2019s presence in Iraq is symbolically significant, and its withdrawal would be a blow to the US-led coalition. The Federal Aviation Commission has restricted flights over Iran, Iraq, the Gulf of Oman, and the Persian Gulf. It looks like Trump may not be giving a televised address after all. The White House press secretary has told reporters that the president won\u2019t be addressing the nation tonight. He may deliver statements or updates via tweet. News of the attacks has had an effect on the markets. Asian markets have fallen on news of the Iranian missile strikes. The Australian Stock Exchange\u2019s benchmark index, the ASX200, was down 0.92% at a little after 12.30pm, Australian east coast time, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index tumbled 1.14% on open. No sector was spared the sell-off. Among the leading losers in Australia was flag carrier Qantas, which plunged 4.37%, but healthcare companies and financial sector groups were also down. Shares in each of the big four banks that dominate the Australian financial sector fell more than 1.2%. For readers just catching up, here\u2019s a recap from the Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi in Beirut and Julian Borger in London: Iran has launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at US and coalition military sites in Iraq in retaliation for the killing last week of top general Qassem Suleimani. Al-Asad air base in Iraq\u2019s Anbar province, which hosts a US contingent, was hit at least six times, the US military confirmed. The Pentagon said at least one other base in the northern city of Erbil was targeted in the attack which commenced around 1.30am local time on Wednesday (10.30pm GMT). Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), of which Suleimani was a member, issued a statement saying: \u201cThe brave soldiers of IRGC\u2019s aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on Al Asad military base in the name of martyr General Qassem Suleimani.\u201d There were also unconfirmed reports of missile attacks elsewhere in Iraq. The semi-official Tasnim new agency reported a second wave of strikes against the al-Asad base took place at around 3.20am. Read on for more context. The White House is planning a possible televised address from Donald Trump tonight, according to multiple reports. The White House has yet to confirm any plans. Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency is now quoting Iranian officials warning that if the US retaliates against these strikes in Iraq, Hezbollah will fire rockets at Israel \u2014 a threat to widen the conflict and bring Iran\u2019s regional allies into play. A top adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader posted an image of the Iranian flag as news steams in of multiple attacks on US military sites. The tweet seems to be a counterpoint to Donald Trump\u2019s tweet featuring a low-resolution image of the American flag, following a strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Nancy Pelosi says she\u2019s \u201cclosely monitoring the situation\u201d, adding that she\u2019d like \u201cneedless provocations from the Administration\u201d end. In the meantime, defense secretary Mark Esper and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have arrived at the White House. According to CNN, Esper was carrying a large bag. The Department of Defense has confirmed: \u201cAt approximately 5:30 p.m. (EST) on January 7, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq. It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil.\u201d The assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, Jonathan Hoffman, said that the US is \u201cworking on initial battle damage assessments\u201d: In recent days and in response to Iranian threats and actions, the Department of Defense has taken all appropriate measures to safeguard our personnel and partners. These bases have been on high alert due to indications that the Iranian regime planned to attack our forces and interests in the region. As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the region. Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency has just reported a second wave of attacks has commenced against the al-Asad airbase in Iraq, according to the Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi. More to come. Nancy Pelosi received a phone call from Mike Pence, as she was about to open the House for new session. The speaker\u2019s chief of staff said Pelosi called the vice president back minutes after presiding over the House, and was briefed on Iran\u2019s attacks. Pelosi reportedly received a note with news of the attacks in the interim. Missiles have fired from Iran at Erbil in northern Iraq, as well as Al Asad Air Base in the west, according to ABC News. The Guardian has not yet independently confirmed this report. The White House press secretary said that Donald Trump \u201chas been briefed and is monitoring the situation\u201d in Iraq. From The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger and Patrick Wintour: An airbase in Iraq\u2019s Anbar province that hosts a US contingent has come under fire, the US military confirmed, after a day in which Donald Trump and the Iranian leadership exchanged threats of retaliatory attacks. Initial reports said al-Asad base was hit by six rockets. It has previously been a target of an Iranian-backed Shia militia, Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, whose attacks on US and coalition troops triggered tit-for-tat strikes that culminated in the killing on Friday of top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. There were also unconfirmed reports of missile attacks elsewhere in Iraq. Earlier in the day, the secretary of Iran\u2019s national security council, Ali Shamkhani, said 13 \u201crevenge scenarios\u201d were being considered in the wake of the assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds force, and that even the most limited options would be a \u201chistoric nightmare\u201d for the US. Ali Shamkhani told the Tasnim news agency: \u201cThe 27 US bases that are closest to Iran\u2019s border are already on high alert; they know that the response is likely to include medium-range &amp; long-range missiles.\u201d Trump responded to Iranian threats in remarks to the press at the White House \u201cWe\u2019re totally prepared. And likewise, we\u2019re prepared to attack if we have to,\u201d he said. According to Iran state TV, Tehran has launched \u201ctens\u201d of surface-to-surface missiles toward Iraq\u2019s Ain Assad air base, which houses US troops. US military officials have confirmed to reporters that at least six rockets fell on the air base. In a statement, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said: \u201cThe brave soldiers of IRGC\u2019s aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on Al Assad military base in the name of martyr Gen.Qasem Soleimani\u201d. There is no information yet on any casualties or damage from the rockets. The Guardian will have more updates soon. Republican senators block a resolution to declare that attacks on cultural sites are war crimes Although Donald Trump has walked back threats to attack Iranian cultural sites, which are forbidden under international law, Democratic senators today tried to pass a resolution rebuking such attacks. Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, tried to get unanimous consent to pass the resolution, but his efforts were blocked by the Senate armed services committee chair Jim Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma. Inhofe said he appreciated \u201cthe spirit\u201d of Markey\u2019s resolution but criticized its lack of \u201cspecificity\u201d. California Representative Duncan Hunter posted his resignation letters to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom. Trump campaign plans to spend $10m on a Super Bowl ad The president has bought 60 seconds of air time during what\u2019s likely to be the most-watched television event of the year. In a statement to The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss, the Trump reelection campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh confirmed that the president has reserved time: We have been in discussions with Fox since the fall and reserved time in December. We paid for the ad last week. We bought 60 seconds of time. President Trump made the unprecedented decision to keep the campaign open following his first election, which allows to do things like buying a Super Bowl ad. We got in early, which gave us prime ad position early in the game. This is a clear indication that we\u2019re ramping up the campaign, which also includes unprecedented pushes for black, women, Latino, and women voters. The news was first reported by Politico. Report: Pompeo tells diplomats not to meet with Iranian opposition groups amid escalating tensions The US Secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has ordered diplomats not to meet with Iranian opposition groups without approval, according to a cable obtained by CNN and Bloomberg. \u201cMany exiled Iranian opposition groups try to engage US officials regularly to gain at least the appearance of tacit support and enhance their visibility and clout. Direct US government engagement with these groups could prove counterproductive to our policy goal of seeking a comprehensive deal with the Iranian regime that addresses its destabilizing behavior,\u201d Pompeo reportedly said. Among the groups that Pompeo has said to avoid is Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK, which once hired Rudy Giuliani, and paid John Bolton to speak at its rallies. Pompeo reportedly indicated that diplomats who met with opposition groups could jeopardize Trump\u2019s diplomatic efforts in Iran. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said the strike that killed the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was \u201cretaliation\u201d for his past actions against the US, but the president then repeated senior officials\u2019 claims that Suleimani was planning an \u201cimminent\u201d attack on Americans. The president brushed off concerns about John Bolton potentially testifying in a Senate impeachment trial, claiming his former national security adviser \u201cwould know nothing about what we\u2019re talking about\u201d. But Bolton was reportedly present for several key events in the Ukraine saga. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, announced he had the votes to establish rules for the impeachment trial without Democratic support and would model the proceedings on Bill Clinton\u2019s 1999 trial. The Republican congressman Duncan Hunter submitted his expected resignation after pleading guilty to misusing campaign funds last month. The US defense secretary, Mark Esper, said American forces were not leaving Iraq, despite the letter from the US military outlining an intention to withdraw from the country. Esper said yesterday that the letter was inaccurate. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Congressman Duncan Hunter, who pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy for misusing campaign funds last month, has officially submitted his resignation. The California Republican\u2019s departure had been expected, but the timing of the move remained unclear as lawmakers returned from the holiday recess. By waiting until after the first of the month to submit the resignation, Hunter will likely be able to collect one last paycheck, as well as his congressional pension. Hunter told the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the California governor, Gavin Newsom, that his resignation would be effective 13 January. With Hunter out of the way, Republicans are expected to maintain control of the House seat. Although the district leans Republican, there had previously been speculation that Democrats could pick up the seat if Hunter remained on the ballot as he faced corruption allegations. Trump is reportedly planning to hold a campaign rally in Iowa days before the Democratic caucuses take place on 3 February. The Wall Street Journal reports: President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign is planning to hold a rally in Iowa in the days leading up to the state\u2019s leadoff caucuses, said people familiar with the plans. Mr. Trump is expected to appear in the state several days before the Feb.3 caucuses. No event has officially been announced and the campaign did not comment. A gathering would give the president the opportunity to frame his campaign message in what will be a key general election state, as well as counter Democrats flooding the area before the first voting of 2020. Trump carried Iowa by 10 points in 2016, and his allies have expressed confidence he will win the Hawkeye State again this year. Depending on the timing of the rally, Trump might have to race back to Washington after the event because he\u2019s scheduled to deliver his annual state of the union address on 4 February. While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump suggested the letter from the US military indicating an imminent withdrawal of US troops from Iraq was a \u201choax\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that letter is a hoax.\u201d The Secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who was sitting next to the president, then jumped in to say the drafting of the letter had been a mistake. The defense secretary Mark Esper said yesterday that the letter was inaccurate and repeated today, \u201cThe United States is not withdrawing from Iraq.\u201d The former national security adviser John Bolton was actually present for a number of key events in the Ukraine saga that ultimately led to Trump\u2019s impeachment, despite the president\u2019s claim that Bolton \u201cwould know nothing about what we\u2019re talking about\u201d. Taking questions from reporters in the Oval Office, Trump brushed off concerns about John Bolton, his former national security adviser, potentially testifying in a Senate impeachment trial. Bolton said yesterday he would testify in the trial if he were subpoenaed, but it\u2019s unclear whether the Republican-controlled Senate would approve a subpoena. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be up to the lawyers,\u201d Trump said of Bolton\u2019s testimony. \u201cIt\u2019ll be up to the Senate, and we\u2019ll see how they feel. He would know nothing about what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d But reports have indicated the former official had firsthand knowledge of the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance and advised Trump to release the funds. Although Trump said he would obey international laws forbidding attacks on cultural sites, the president seemed to complain about the necessity for such restraint. \u201cThey kill our people, they blow up our people and then we have to be very gentle with their cultural institutions,\u201d Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. \u201cBut I\u2019m OK with it. It\u2019s OK with me. I will say this, if Iran does anything that they shouldn\u2019t be doing, they\u2019re going to be suffering the consequences and very strongly.\u201d Trump initially said the strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was \u201cretaliation\u201d, but the president then claimed the strike was carried out due to an imminent threat on Americans, echoing senior officials. \u201cWe saved a lot of lives by terminating his life, a lot of lives were saved,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were planning something and you\u2019re going to be hearing about it or at least various people in Congress are going to be hearing about it tomorrow.\u201d Defense officials have so far dodged questions about the specific nature of the threat Suleimani posed. Trump appeared to back off of his earlier threat to target Iranian cultural sites, which would violate international law. \u201cIf that\u2019s what the law is, I like to obey the law,\u201d the president told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. Senior administration officials, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defense secretary Mark Esper, have vowed that any American military effort would comply with international laws of warfare. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office alongside the Greek prime minister, Trump claimed the US strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was \u201cretaliation.\u201d \u201cHe was a monster. And he\u2019s no longer a monster. He\u2019s dead,\u201d Trump said, according to the White House pool report. But senior US officials have previously said the strike was meant to prevent an \u201cimminent\u201d attack on Americans, although they have refused to provide further details on the threat. While speaking to reporters, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell also said Trump\u2019s threat to strike Iranian cultural sites was \u201cnot appropirate,\u201d marking a rare rebuke from the Republican leader. Senior officials, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defense secretary Mark Esper, have tried to downplay Trump\u2019s threat by emphasizing they would act within the confines of international law, which would obviously rule out striking cultural sites. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell informed his Republican caucus about the planned rules for an eventual impeachment trial during a meeting today. The New York Times reports: Mr. McConnell shared his intentions with senators over lunch in the Capitol, declaring that he has the votes he needs \u2014 including among moderate Republicans \u2014 to proceed with the trial while putting off a final decision on witnesses or new evidence. That would mean the Senate would tackle those questions after representatives of the House and the president make opening arguments and senators question both sides. Notably, the plan offers no guarantee that senators will hear new testimony beyond what the House\u2019s inquiry gathered last fall. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has just confirmed earlier reports that he has the votes to set rules for the looming impeachment trial without Democratic support. The Kentucky Republican has said he intends to follow the same framework established during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial in 1999. Trump said in a tweet that he had a \u201cvery good meeting\u201d with Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi deputy defense minister and brother of the crown prince, after the foreign official shared a photo of the pair in the Oval Office yesterday. The meeting did not appear on Trump\u2019s official schedule yesterday, and the White House did not release a readout, as is standard procedure. In a statement, the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association critcized the president and his team for not disclosing the meeting sooner: President Trump met with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vice Minister of Defense at the White House yesterday, but the public did not learn about the meeting until the Saudi government released a statement about it today. The Saudi government also released photographs of the President and his senior advisers meeting with the Vice Minister of Defense in the Oval Office. A meeting with a foreign leader in the Oval Office should, at the very least, be on the public schedule with a read-out of the meeting released after it is over. This has been the long-standing precedent for presidents of both political parties. It is disturbing to see the government of Saudi Arabia have more transparency than the White House about a meeting with the President in the Oval Office. Following a campaign event in New York City this morning, Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump\u2019s assassination of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, last week, Joanna Walters writes. The former US vice president lamented the lack of \u201clevel-headed words\u201d from the Trump administration to explain the aggressive action, nor signals that would \u201ctake us off the path of conflict\u201d. \u201cAll we\u2019ve heard are shifting explanations, evasive answers and repeated assertions of an imminent threat, without the necessary evidence to support that conclusion,\u201d Biden added. Then he decried the president\u2019s adherence to the truth \u201cThis is a president with a history of lying about virtually everything and has destroyed his own credibility as well as that of the US on the global stage...no-one around the world seems to be taking his word for it.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Prosecutors recommended 0 to 6 months of prison time for Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell reportedly has the votes to adopt rules for the impeachment trial without Democratic support. The Kentucky Republican hopes to model the proceedings on Bill Clinton\u2019s trial. Defense secretary Mark Esper said the US is not leaving Iraq after a draft memo from the US military seemed to indicate a withdrawal was imminent. Esper also told CNN, \u201cWe are not looking to start a war with Iran, but we are prepared to finish one.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. In his CNN interview, secretary of defense Mark Esper also said the \u201cimminent\u201d threat that Iranian general Qassem Suleimani posed to Americans could be measured in days. Trump administration officials have previously dodged questions about the specific threat that Suleimani posed, raising questions about the planning of the attack. Speaking to CNN, secretary of defense Mark Esper said the US is not leaving Iraq, after a draft memo from the US military seemed to indicate a withdrawal was imminent. \u201cThe United States is not withdrawing from Iraq,\u201d Esper said, saying the US was committed to continuing \u201cthe important \u2018defeat ISIS\u2019 mission.\u201d The cabinet secretary echoed the president\u2019s comments about not looking to start a war with Iran by killing the country\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. \u201cWe are not looking to start a war with Iran, but we are prepared to finish one,\u201d Esper said. He also deflected a question about Trump\u2019s threat to strike Iranian cultural sites. \u201cWe do not violate the laws of armed conflict,\u201d Esper said. Prosecutors argued Michael Flynn\u2019s aggressive new posture in the case, arguing he was tricked into pleading guilty, should impact the former national security adviser\u2019s sentence. Federal prosecutors had previously recommended probation for the former Trump administration official because of his \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d in several investigations, including special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe. But Flynn has more recently launched a series of attacks against the FBI and the Justice Department. The sentencing of Michael Flynn has been set for 28 January after a federal judge rejected the former national security adviser\u2019s claim that he was tricked into pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. \u201cRegardless of Mr Flynn\u2019s new theories, he pled guilty twice to the crime, and he fails to demonstrate that the disclosure of the requested information would have impacted his decision to plead guilty,\u201d US district court judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in an opinion delivered last month. The prosecutors overseeing the case against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, have recommended zero to six months of incarceration after he pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said leadership had not ruled out the possibility of issuing a subpoena to John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. Bolton has said he would testify in a Senate impeachment trial if he were subpoenaed, but it\u2019s unclear how he would respond to a House subpoena. House Democrats previously decided against subpoenaing Bolton because he signaled he would join a lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena or White House guidance not to cooperate with the impeachment investigation. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell reportedly plans to advance a set of rules for the looming impeachment trial without Democratic support. Politico reports: McConnell is on the verge of having sufficient backing in his 53-member caucus to pass a blueprint for the trial that leaves the question of seeking witnesses and documents until after opening arguments are made, according to multiple senators. That framework would mirror the contours of President Bill Clinton\u2019s trial and ignore Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s demands for witnesses and new evidence. No final decision has been made, but in a brief interview, McConnell said he would address the possibility of spurning Democrats on Tuesday afternoon. Appearing at the US Capitol for the first time in 2020, House speaker Nancy Pelosi deflected reporters\u2019 repeated questions about when she might transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Pelosi has delayed sending the articles in the hope of gaining leverage over the parameters of the Senate trial, but majority leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he has no intention of allowing the strategy to affect his handling of the trial. This is a headline that Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg did not need: \u201cButtigieg Fails To Secure Delegates In Illinois\u2019 Most Diverse Districts.\u201d HuffPost reports: Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign filled less than half of the delegate slots for the four most diverse congressional districts in Illinois, a sign of how his campaign continues to struggle with Black and Latino voters. Voters in Illinois cast ballots not only for their pick for president, but also for delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Delegates are generally associated with one of the presidential campaigns, meaning each campaign needs to find 101 people willing to serve as a delegate \u2014 at least three in each of the state\u2019s 18 congressional districts, with additional delegates in more heavily Democratic districts. Finding a person to fill each slot \u2014 and collecting the 500 signatures necessary to put them on the ballot \u2014 is considered an early test of a campaign\u2019s strength in the delegate-rich state, and supporters of Buttigieg\u2019s rivals said his failure to fill the slots points to a potentially fatal weakness with voters of color. Buttigieg has surged to the top of polls in the first caucus state of Iowa, but his struggles to attract support from voters of color have raised questions about his long-term durability in the nominating contest. Congressman Justin Amash, a former Republican who left the party over his opposition to Trump, criticized Senate Republicans who have argued the eventual impeachment trial should only allow evidence collected by the House. Marco Rubio and other Republican senators raised this objection after John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, said he would testify in the trial if he were subpoenaed. It\u2019s still unclear whether Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer can convince four of his Republican colleagues to join the Democratic effort to subpoena Bolton and three other administration officials. The White House said in a statement that Trump is monitoring the situation in Puerto Rico, where an earthquake this morning left at least one person dead. \u201cThe President has been briefed on the earthquakes that Puerto Rico has experienced over the past month, including the earthquake early this morning,\u201d spokesman Judd Deere said in the statement. \u201cAdministration officials, including FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, have been in touch with the Governor and her team today, and we will continue to monitor the effects and coordinate with Puerto Rico officials.\u201d The island has been hit with a series of earthquakes since December 28, but this morning\u2019s 6.4-magnitude quake was the strongest yet. Prince Khalid bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy defense minister, shared a photo from an Oval Office meeting yesterday with Trump, saying the pair discussed \u201cefforts to confront regional and international challenges.\u201d The meeting did not appear on the president\u2019s public schedule yesterday, and the White House did not offer a readout from the meeting, which came as US-Iranian tensions escalate following the killing of general Qassem Suleimani. Khalid is the younger brother of the Saudi crown prince and previously served as the country\u2019s ambassador to the US. Khalid was reportedly the person who instructed Jamal Khashoggi to go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where the dissident journalist was then killed by agents sent by the crown prince. House speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly staying mum on when she might transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, casting even more confusion over the timeline for the eventual trial. Republican senator Ron Johnson, who has traveled to Ukraine and previously spoken to officials who became key players in the impeachment inquiry, said he does not believe John Bolton should testify in a Senate trial. \u201cHaving been involved, having spoken with John Bolton myself on this issue, I don\u2019t know what additional information he might have,\u201d Johnson said of Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, according to the Daily Beast. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be particularly revealing.\u201d Other Republican senators, such as Marco Rubio, have not weighed in on the potential value of Bolton\u2019s testimony, instead arguing that the Senate impeachment trial should be based on the information gathered by the House. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the US would only pursue military measures that are \u201cconsistent with the international rule of law,\u201d after Trump raised the possibility of hitting cultural sites in Iran. Pompeo dismissed repeated questions about whether the president was still considering striking cultural sites, instead emphasizing that \u201cevery action\u201d the US takes would comport with international law. The secretary of state then argued the Ayatollah posed the highest threat to Iranian culture. \u201cThe real risk to Persian culture does not come from the Unites States of America,\u201d Pompeo said. The cabinet secretary offered no details on what \u201cimminent\u201d threat Iranian general Qassem Suleimani posed before he was killed in a US drone strike. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for imminence, you need look no further than the days that led up to the strike,\u201d Pompeo said. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo laughed off the idea that Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was in Baghdad for a diplomatic mission when he was killed in a US drone strike, as Iranian and Iraqi officials have claimed. \u201cAnyone here believe that?\u201d Pompeo asked the reporters gathered at the State Department. Pompeo dismissed the idea of Suleimani conducting a peace mission as \u201cIranian propaganda.\u201d Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said escalating tensions between the US and Iran did not contribute to his decision not to enter the Senate race in his home state of Kansas. The former congressman has repeatedly said he would stay in his cabinet role as long as Trump wanted him to, but Pompeo has also made repeated trips to Kansas since taking over the state department, leading to speculation about his plans. But Pompeo reportedly informed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell yesterday that he had decided against launching a campaign. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is addressing reporters at the State Department, touching on the everything from the protests in Hong Kong to the situation in Venezuela. The cabinet secretary also made a quick mention of Iran at the beginning of his remarks, accusing Tehran of \u201cactively working to undermine the peace process\u201d in Afghanistan. For more updates on Pompeo\u2019s remarks, follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog on the fallout from the Suleimani strike. US forces across the Middle East are reportedly on high alert, monitoring for potential Iranian drone strikes after the killing of general Qassem Suleimani. CNN reports: US forces and air-defense missile batteries across the Middle East were placed on high alert overnight Monday to possibly shoot down Iranian drones as intelligence mounted about a threat of an imminent attack against US targets, two US officials tell CNN. ... US intelligence also has observed Iran moving military equipment, including drones and ballistic missiles, over the last several days. US officials said the movement may be an Iranian effort to secure its weapons from a potential US strike, or put them in positions to launch their own attacks. ... Iran has put missiles on its drones that have been used in other attacks, including a significant attack on Saudi oil installations last year. While forces have already been on high alert for several days, they were even more vigilant Monday night, both officials said. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is out with a new plan to overhaul the 2005 bankruptcy law in order to help families who are looking for a way out of crushing debt. \u201cThanks in part to the 2005 bankruptcy bill, our current system makes it far too hard for people in need to start the bankruptcy process so they can get back on their feet,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post outlining her proposal. \u201cMy plan streamlines the process, reduces costs, and gives people more flexibility in bankruptcy to find solutions that match their financial problems.\u201d The 2005 law was championed by then-senator Joe Biden, now a frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary, so Warren\u2019s proposal implicitly criticizes her rival for his legislative record. In the Medium post, Warren notes she served on a blue-ribbon panel in the 1990\u2019s to review US bankruptcy laws and later fought against the passage of the 2005 law, which the credit-card industry lobbied for. \u201cI lost that fight in 2005, and working families paid the price,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t stop fighting to hold the financial industry accountable and to help American families.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan would make it easier to file for bankruptcy, end rules making it difficult to discharge student loans and address racial and gender disparities in the bankruptcy system. The State Department has just announced secretary of state Mike Pompeo will address reporters at 10 a.m. ET, which is about 45 minutes from now. Pompeo\u2019s appearance comes as questions continue to swirl about what \u201cimminent\u201d threat Iranian general Qassem Suleimani allegedly presented before being killed in a US drone strike. The secretary of state may also be asked about yesterday\u2019s confusion between the US military and the Pentagon regarding a draft memo indicating American troops were withdrawing from Iraq. Secretary of defense Mark Esper quickly disputed the accuracy of the memo, saying the US had no intention of leaving Iraq. On top of all that foreign-policy chaos, reports emerged yesterday that Pompeo has decided to pass on a potential Senate run in his home state of Kansas. Good morning, live blog readers! The House of Representatives will convene for the first time of the new year today, and all eyes are on speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump that her chamber passed last month. Considering Congress recessed for the holidays shortly after the articles were approved, this week will be the first true signal of when Pelosi might advance the issue of impeachment to the Senate. Close observers of Capitol Hill had widely speculated Pelosi would transmit the articles at some point this week, but the calculus has shifted since John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, said yesterday that he would testify in a Senate trial if subpoenaed. Now Democrats are weighing how to best leverage that news to try to influence the parameters of the Senate trial, but majority leader Mitch McConnell has made clear he has no intention of allowing the articles\u2019 delay to affect his handling of impeachment. Pelosi now has to weigh the potential benefit of gaining leverage with the cost of perpetually delaying a trial that will almost certainly end in the president\u2019s acquittal. This week will likely provide many clues on how the speaker plans to proceed. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump will welcome Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the White House. Elizabeth Warren wild hold a Brooklyn event tonight alongside former Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, who endorsed her yesterday. The burial of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, who was killed in a US airstrike last week, has been postponed, due to a stampede during his funeral procession. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "When brand protection analyst Fa Somers talks about her fellow law graduates from the University of Exeter, it\u2019s clear that traditional legal jobs won\u2019t be their only destination. \u201cA lot of my friends are taking that trajectory but many more have gone into consultancy. One works for Bloomberg, others have gone into NGOs or Greenpeace.\u201d Fa is part of a generation of graduates with less attachment to jobs and organisations than their forebears. In one poll by the Law Society, 26% of total respondents felt they might change jobs in the following year, but among those aged 25\u201334 the figure was as high as 35%. It\u2019s a trend reflected by 2018 research from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which found that the concentration of legal graduates who go into related careers was much lower than for those with degrees in medicine, education, business or media. For law grads who do want to diversify, career coach Kath Houston has good news. \u201cA high level of attention to detail, analytical ability and writing with clarity and concision are common among graduates, but a law degree really beefs up those skills employers want,\u201d she says. The options now available range widely. Brand protection Following her LPC, Somers decided a traditional law career was not for her. \u201cThe pay is good,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you want to focus on personal development and variety, I think it\u2019s beneficial to look elsewhere.\u201d Approached initially for cybersecurity roles, Fa eventually joined Pointer Brand Protection, a company that provides anti-counterfeiting and intellectual property (IP) protection for businesses. Brand protection is a growing field for legal professionals whose background is valued for their IP knowledge and commercial awareness. Analysts investigate and enforce against online and physical IP infringement, which can range from fake medicines to digital apps. Startups and entrepreneurship When Varun Bhanot finished at the London School of Economics, it was with a sense that \u201ctech was this gamechanging industry I wanted to be part of\u201d. Varun eschewed legal firms in favour of tech startups and found himself at the office space website, Hubble. Now a serial entrepreneur, Varun is the CEO and cofounder of Unhoused.org, a website which matches one-for-one product sales with donations to the homeless. In addition to being able to analyse gaps in the market, navigate business legislation and negotiate with potential investors, Varun says that \u201cbeing able to communicate and to scrutinise is invaluable to growing a business\u201d. Journalism The links between media, law and culture can equip law students for careers as journalists and writers. One journalist who made the jump from barrister to broadcaster is ITV News presenter Lucrezia Millarini. She feels that making the switch from law to journalism wasn\u2019t such a huge leap. Lucrezia says that having a law degree \u201cencourages the kind of analytical thinking that\u2019s required of a journalist\u201d, but that there\u2019s also \u201ca performance element to being a barrister that naturally translates to broadcast journalism\u201d. Social enterprises The number of social enterprises has grown steadily in recent years: in 2017, a government survey found that 22.2% of employers expected to hire more staff. Social enterprise is a good fit for legal grads with an eye for detail as they deal with complex structures and negotiations.",

The industry\u2019s traditional players are under pressure from Aldi and Lidl, which increased their market share and achieved dramatic sales growth, partly driven by new store openings. Boots data indicated that the health and beauty chain was also under pressure from the German-owned discounters as well as B&amp;M, Home Bargains, and Select. Walgreens Boots Alliance, the US-listed conglomerate owner of the British chain, announced a 2.7% fall in underlying sales at its international business, mainly due to poor sales at Boots. Gross profits slid 3.7% reflecting lower sales at margins at the group, which closed 200 of its nearly 2,500 stores last year.",

King Jesus international ministries, located outside of Miami, Florida, hosted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/04/donald-trump-iran-miami-rally-2020-election\">Evangelicals for Trump</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/04/donald-trump-iran-miami-rally-2020-election\"> Coalition kick-off</a>. Before boasting about his commitment to fight for the religious right\u2019s agenda, the president bowed his head to receive prayers from prosperity preacher Paula White and other religious nationalists who offer spiritual cover for a corrupt and immoral administration.</p> <p>As a bishop of the church, I am troubled anytime I see Christianity used to justify the injustice, deception, violence and oppression that God hates. Even if Donald Trump had a perfect personal moral r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his policy agenda is an affront to God\u2019s agenda to lift the poor and bless the marginalized. The distorted moral narrative these so-called Evangelicals for Trump have embraced is contrary to God\u2019s politics, which have nothing to do with being a Democrat or Republican. But this misuse of religion is not new.

      "bodyText": "Last Friday the Trump 2020 campaign held its first rally at a megachurch. King Jesus international ministries, located outside of Miami, Florida, hosted the Evangelicals for Trump Coalition kick-off. Before boasting about his commitment to fight for the religious right\u2019s agenda, the president bowed his head to receive prayers from prosperity preacher Paula White and other religious nationalists who offer spiritual cover for a corrupt and immoral administration. As a bishop of the church, I am troubled anytime I see Christianity used to justify the injustice, deception, violence and oppression that God hates. Even if Donald Trump had a perfect personal moral r\u00e9sum\u00e9, his policy agenda is an affront to God\u2019s agenda to lift the poor and bless the marginalized. The distorted moral narrative these so-called Evangelicals for Trump have embraced is contrary to God\u2019s politics, which have nothing to do with being a Democrat or Republican. But this misuse of religion is not new. It has a long history in the American story. When the segregationist George Wallace faced the moral challenge of Dr Martin Luther King Jr and the civil rights movement in 1960s Alabama, he also called upon religious leaders to vouch for him. \u201cBy no stretch of the imagination is George C Wallace a racist,\u201d Dr Henry L Lyon, the pastor of Montgomery\u2019s Highland Avenue Baptist church, testified. \u201cHe has shown fairness to all people, regardless of race or color,\u201d the Rev RL Lawrence, a Methodist minister, concurred.

      "body": "<p>The owner of a group of children\u2019s homes has been jailed for 14-and-a-half years for sexually abusing boys in his care.</p> <p>John Allen, who was the owner and manager of the Bryn Alyn Community homes in north Wales, was sentenced for offences against five boys committed between 1976 and 1992.</p> <p>Allen, a former hotelier who set up care homes in and around the Wrexham area despite having no training in childcare, was already serving a life sentence for abusing 18 vulnerable boys as young as seven, as well as one girl.</p> <p>Sentencing him for the further offences at Mold crown court in north Wales, the judge, Rhys Rowlands, said Allen had used his position of trust to groom and abuse children, and had showed no remorse.</p> <p>The judge said the care homes had seemed successful and local authorities paid large fees in the expectation that those placed would be looked after \u201cin a safe and caring environment\u201d. Rowlands added: \u201cFor many youngsters, it was quite the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>A jury found Allen guilty of seven counts of indecent assault and another serious sexual offence.</p> <p>Victims told in impact statements how Allen had ruined their lives. Now middle-aged, some said they had turned to alcohol and drugs to try to blot out what he did to them, and some had tried to kill themselves.</p> <p>One victim said he was no longer frightened of Allen but would never forgive him. \u201cOnce he started to attack me, I tried to avoid him at all costs. The only option to escape was to run away, which I did on a number of occasions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another victim said that within six months of leaving care, he began to take heroin to forget Allen. \u201cMy life did not turn out as I had hoped,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A third victim said he had turned to alcohol and had tried to take his own life on two occasions, while another said Allen made him feel dirty and he had self-harmed to try to take the pain away. \u201cHe should have been caring for me. His interest was his own sexual satisfaction and desires,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eleanor Laws QC, the prosecuting barrister, told the jury Allen was a \u201cformidable presence\u201d at the homes. \u201cBoys were picked out, groomed and turned into his favourites,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He would offer gifts or money, or simply cause them to be in such fear of him that he was able to abuse them regularly, the barrister said.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the abused had to learn to live with it as they felt there was no other option. But for most of them, the abuse took its toll. Most describe carrying the weight of that abuse with them still today,\u201d Laws said.</p> <p>Some boys tried to disclose the abuse to authorities, including the police, at the time, but were often ignored or disbelieved. Most said nothing, either out of shame or because they would not be believed, Laws said.</p> <p>Most of the victims in the latest trial came forward as a result of the publicity surrounding the earlier trial of Allen in 2014.</p> <p>The National Crime Agency said Allen would sexually abuse the boys in one of his cars, offices, at hotels or in the snooker room at his home in Wrexham.</p> <p>The five victims were between the ages of 12 and 16 when they were first abused. One said Allen regularly tried to locate him around various homes, and he used to hide under the seats of the community handyman\u2019s van, who would protect him from Allen.</p> <p>Another told NCA investigators Allen rented a flat for him to live in, which Allen would occasionally visit, where he would subject him to sexual acts.</p> <p>The NCA\u2019s senior investigating officer, Philip Marshall, said: \u201cAllen used his position of trust to abuse boys who were young, vulnerable and from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>\u201cHe controlled and manipulated his victims, and rewarded them by giving cash and gifts that any young boy would want.</p> <p>\u201cThe victims have been incredibly courageous coming forward to the NCA many years later and recounting the abuse they were subject to.\u201d</p> <p>Operation Pallial \u2013 the independent NCA investigation into allegations of past abuse in the care system in North Wales \u2013 began in November 2012.</p> <p>Thirteen people have been convicted under Operation Pallial. There is one further trial scheduled for later this month. So far, 375 people have contacted Operation Pallial.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The owner of a group of children\u2019s homes has been jailed for 14-and-a-half years for sexually abusing boys in his care. John Allen, who was the owner and manager of the Bryn Alyn Community homes in north Wales, was sentenced for offences against five boys committed between 1976 and 1992. Allen, a former hotelier who set up care homes in and around the Wrexham area despite having no training in childcare, was already serving a life sentence for abusing 18 vulnerable boys as young as seven, as well as one girl. Sentencing him for the further offences at Mold crown court in north Wales, the judge, Rhys Rowlands, said Allen had used his position of trust to groom and abuse children, and had showed no remorse. The judge said the care homes had seemed successful and local authorities paid large fees in the expectation that those placed would be looked after \u201cin a safe and caring environment\u201d. Rowlands added: \u201cFor many youngsters, it was quite the opposite.\u201d A jury found Allen guilty of seven counts of indecent assault and another serious sexual offence. Victims told in impact statements how Allen had ruined their lives. Now middle-aged, some said they had turned to alcohol and drugs to try to blot out what he did to them, and some had tried to kill themselves. One victim said he was no longer frightened of Allen but would never forgive him. \u201cOnce he started to attack me, I tried to avoid him at all costs. The only option to escape was to run away, which I did on a number of occasions,\u201d he said. Another victim said that within six months of leaving care, he began to take heroin to forget Allen. \u201cMy life did not turn out as I had hoped,\u201d he said. A third victim said he had turned to alcohol and had tried to take his own life on two occasions, while another said Allen made him feel dirty and he had self-harmed to try to take the pain away. \u201cHe should have been caring for me. His interest was his own sexual satisfaction and desires,\u201d he said. Eleanor Laws QC, the prosecuting barrister, told the jury Allen was a \u201cformidable presence\u201d at the homes. \u201cBoys were picked out, groomed and turned into his favourites,\u201d she said. He would offer gifts or money, or simply cause them to be in such fear of him that he was able to abuse them regularly, the barrister said. \u201cMost of the abused had to learn to live with it as they felt there was no other option. But for most of them, the abuse took its toll. Most describe carrying the weight of that abuse with them still today,\u201d Laws said. Some boys tried to disclose the abuse to authorities, including the police, at the time, but were often ignored or disbelieved. Most said nothing, either out of shame or because they would not be believed, Laws said. Most of the victims in the latest trial came forward as a result of the publicity surrounding the earlier trial of Allen in 2014. The National Crime Agency said Allen would sexually abuse the boys in one of his cars, offices, at hotels or in the snooker room at his home in Wrexham. The five victims were between the ages of 12 and 16 when they were first abused. One said Allen regularly tried to locate him around various homes, and he used to hide under the seats of the community handyman\u2019s van, who would protect him from Allen. Another told NCA investigators Allen rented a flat for him to live in, which Allen would occasionally visit, where he would subject him to sexual acts. The NCA\u2019s senior investigating officer, Philip Marshall, said: \u201cAllen used his position of trust to abuse boys who were young, vulnerable and from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cHe controlled and manipulated his victims, and rewarded them by giving cash and gifts that any young boy would want. \u201cThe victims have been incredibly courageous coming forward to the NCA many years later and recounting the abuse they were subject to.\u201d Operation Pallial \u2013 the independent NCA investigation into allegations of past abuse in the care system in North Wales \u2013 began in November 2012. Thirteen people have been convicted under Operation Pallial. There is one further trial scheduled for later this month. So far, 375 people have contacted Operation Pallial.",

      "body": "<p>Since the end of the 2017 season, 18 NFL teams have made coaching changes. Two of that number, the Arizona Cardinals and Cleveland Browns, have had three different head coaches in four years. </p> <p>What\u2019s notable in 2020 is the dearth of minority candidates getting anything more than the league-mandated interview for those vacancies. This week critics are pouncing after the New York Giants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/07/giants-eye-judge-as-new-head-coach-with-panthers-set-to-appoint-rhule\">hired Joe Judge</a>, a little-known 38-year-old assistant for the New England Patriots, as their new head coach. While experienced minority coaches like Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier and Miami Dolphins assistant head coach Jim Caldwell await serious consideration for a top position, less experienced (white) candidates like Judge are securing some of the game\u2019s most coveted jobs.</p> <p>The question is whether minority candidates feel they have any recourse against the league, or if they simply have to continue waiting for their turn. What remains obvious is that team owners, in a league where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/31/nfl-tv-coverage-racial-demographics-super-bowl\">more than 70% of players are black</a>, are not making significant efforts to diversify the coaching ranks. Not only do the jobs continue to go to white coaches, they\u2019re going to white coaches with limited experience.</p> <p>The NFL passed the \u201cRooney Rule\u201d in 2002 \u2013 named after late Pittsburgh Steelers owner and diversity champion Dan Rooney \u2013 which mandated at least one interview of a minority candidate for any team\u2019s head coaching vacancy. It was implemented to try and diversify a position historically occupied by white men and in part because of research by civil rights attorneys <a href=\"http://media.wix.com/ugd/520423_24cb6412ed2758c7204b7864022ebb5d.pdf\">Johnnie Cochran and Cyrus Mehri</a> arguing that black coaches had fewer opportunities as head coaches despite historically strong performances. After an initial surge of hires \u2013 the percentage of minority head coaches before the rule was 6% and rose to as high as 22% \u2013 there are currently only four minority head coaches among 31 teams (the Browns, at time of writing, have yet to replace the fired Freddie Kitchens).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/24/rooney-rule-black-coaches-nfl\">Are NFL owners making a mockery of the Rooney Rule?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some question whether the Rooney Rule is having any effect at all. The only minority candidate recruited in this current coaching carousel is Washington\u2019s Ron Rivera, who became just the third minority head coach hired during this volatile three-year cycle. Rivera joined Brian Flores of the Miami Dolphins and Steve Wilks of the Arizona Cardinals, but Wilks was fired after the 2018 season.</p> <p>Wilks provides a cautionary tale of what it takes to become a black head coach and how quickly that dream can dissolve. When he was hired by Arizona in 2018, Wilks was 48 and had 23 years\u2019 coaching experience in the NFL and college football. After a 3-13 season in his first year in Arizona, the Cardinals fired Wilks and replaced him with 39-year-old Kliff Kingsbury, a white candidate with no NFL experience who had been fired by Texas Tech University after compiling a 35-40 record over five seasons. This came in the same offseason that the Cincinnati Bengals hired Zac Taylor, the 35-year-old quarterbacks coach of the Los Angeles Rams, another man with no NFL head coaching experience. </p> <p>Wilks\u2019s fate seems kind compared to that of Jim Caldwell, who was arguably the best Detroit Lions coach since the 1950s. When Caldwell took the Detroit job in 2014, the Lions had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Detroit_Lions_seasons\">logged just one winning season since 2001</a>. In his first year, Detroit won more than 10 games for the first time since 1991. They also clinched two playoff berths in four seasons. Caldwell was fired in 2017 after a 9-7 campaign, despite finishing every season he was in charge with at least seven wins. His replacement \u2013 New England Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia \u2013 is 9-22-1 in his first two seasons.</p> <p>Maybe the most dispiriting element for minority coaching candidates isn\u2019t simply the lack of minority head coaches \u2013 there are currently four (Rivera, Flores, Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Anthony Lynn of the Los Angeles Chargers) \u2013 but the perception that they aren\u2019t taken seriously when interviewed. CBS Sports\u2019 Jason La Canfora reported last year that the topic is so uncomfortable that most minority coaches <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/coaches-echo-tony-dungys-comments-about-the-good-but-flawed-rooney-rule/\">refuse to go on the record to discuss it</a>. The agent for Pittsburgh secondary coach Teryl Austin told The Athletic<em> </em>that he felt his client received a \u201ctoken\u201d interview from the Lions in 2017.</p> <p>The biggest snub this year is Bieniemy, the Chiefs offensive coordinator who has presided over the professional development of the 2018 MVP Patrick Mahomes and helped guide arguably the league\u2019s most exciting offense. His boss, head coach Andy Reid, has seen his former assistants become Super Bowl winners (Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson) and respected offensive minds (Chicago Bears head coach Matt Nagy) after leaving his tutelage. Bieniemy may yet be named the head coach in Cleveland, but he wasn\u2019t hired after interviewing with the Jets last year, who instead went for Adam Gase, who was coming off an underwhelming career at the Miami Dolphins. Another odd exclusion is Bills defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier, who presided over one of the league\u2019s best defenses in Buffalo, but was not even linked to an interview for one of the recent openings.</p> <p>Whether they are affiliated with a successful team (Judge, Patricia and Flores were all assistants under Bill Belichick at the Patriots; Taylor was the QB coach on the 2018 NFC champion Rams) or vaunted for their technical innovation, young coaches are extremely popular hires right now. The biggest problem facing minority coaches in the past was that they needed to check boxes \u2013 position coach, coordinator etc \u2013 before being considered for a head coaching job. The Athletic\u2019s Tim Graham documented <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/828084/2019/02/21/there-isnt-a-black-offensive-coaching-tree-what-can-be-done-to-bolster-the-pipeline-of-minority-coaches-on-offense/\">the striking lack of black offensive coaches in the NFL</a> in 2018, making it even more difficult for a young minority coach to be considered a \u201cwhiz\u201d like Kingsbury or Taylor. As a result, they\u2019re losing to coaches like Judge, who are younger and far less experienced. \u201cYou almost have to have an Obama-like aura to get an opportunity,\u201d <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/828084/2019/02/21/there-isnt-a-black-offensive-coaching-tree-what-can-be-done-to-bolster-the-pipeline-of-minority-coaches-on-offense/\">passing instructor George Whitfield told Graham</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a flier. It\u2019s not like you have to come in with a five-pound resume anymore.</p> <p>The one striking exception is Flores. He is only 38 and never rose to coordinator as a Patriots assistant, but his affiliation with six-time Super Bowl champion Belichick likely bolstered his profile with the Dolphins. Would Flores, a young, inexperienced black coach, have been considered had he not worked for the Patriots? It\u2019s impossible to tell, but the hirings of Patricia, Flores and Judge suggest that an association with a genius like Belichick will help your future head coaching chances.</p> <p>Teams are ultimately going to hire the coach they want to hire, but the striking imbalance between white and minority coaches suggests that it\u2019s not the Rooney Rule that\u2019s the problem, but team leadership. With so much turnover \u2013 remember that over 60% of teams have made at least one coaching change in the past three years \u2013 it\u2019s confusing that veteran black coaches like Caldwell and Frazier aren\u2019t given another opportunity. Perhaps this is because of a complete lack of diversity in ownership ranks and front offices, perhaps it\u2019s because of lacking enforcement for teams who engage the Rooney Rule in bad faith.</p> <p>Until it is addressed, however, players in a predominantly black league will be risking their health for the entertainment and enrichment of owners and coaches who don\u2019t look like them.<br></p>",

What remains obvious is that team owners, in a league where more than 70% of players are black, are not making significant efforts to diversify the coaching ranks. Not only do the jobs continue to go to white coaches, they\u2019re going to white coaches with limited experience. The NFL passed the \u201cRooney Rule\u201d in 2002 \u2013 named after late Pittsburgh Steelers owner and diversity champion Dan Rooney \u2013 which mandated at least one interview of a minority candidate for any team\u2019s head coaching vacancy. It was implemented to try and diversify a position historically occupied by white men and in part because of research by civil rights attorneys Johnnie Cochran and Cyrus Mehri arguing that black coaches had fewer opportunities as head coaches despite historically strong performances. After an initial surge of hires \u2013 the percentage of minority head coaches before the rule was 6% and rose to as high as 22% \u2013 there are currently only four minority head coaches among 31 teams (the Browns, at time of writing, have yet to replace the fired Freddie Kitchens). Some question whether the Rooney Rule is having any effect at all. The only minority candidate recruited in this current coaching carousel is Washington\u2019s Ron Rivera, who became just the third minority head coach hired during this volatile three-year cycle. Rivera joined Brian Flores of the Miami Dolphins and Steve Wilks of the Arizona Cardinals, but Wilks was fired after the 2018 season. Wilks provides a cautionary tale of what it takes to become a black head coach and how quickly that dream can dissolve. When he was hired by Arizona in 2018, Wilks was 48 and had 23 years\u2019 coaching experience in the NFL and college football. After a 3-13 season in his first year in Arizona, the Cardinals fired Wilks and replaced him with 39-year-old Kliff Kingsbury, a white candidate with no NFL experience who had been fired by Texas Tech University after compiling a 35-40 record over five seasons. This came in the same offseason that the Cincinnati Bengals hired Zac Taylor, the 35-year-old quarterbacks coach of the Los Angeles Rams, another man with no NFL head coaching experience. Wilks\u2019s fate seems kind compared to that of Jim Caldwell, who was arguably the best Detroit Lions coach since the 1950s. When Caldwell took the Detroit job in 2014, the Lions had logged just one winning season since 2001. In his first year, Detroit won more than 10 games for the first time since 1991. They also clinched two playoff berths in four seasons. Caldwell was fired in 2017 after a 9-7 campaign, despite finishing every season he was in charge with at least seven wins. His replacement \u2013 New England Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia \u2013 is 9-22-1 in his first two seasons. Maybe the most dispiriting element for minority coaching candidates isn\u2019t simply the lack of minority head coaches \u2013 there are currently four (Rivera, Flores, Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Anthony Lynn of the Los Angeles Chargers) \u2013 but the perception that they aren\u2019t taken seriously when interviewed. CBS Sports\u2019 Jason La Canfora reported last year that the topic is so uncomfortable that most minority coaches refuse to go on the record to discuss it. The agent for Pittsburgh secondary coach Teryl Austin told The Athletic that he felt his client received a \u201ctoken\u201d interview from the Lions in 2017. The biggest snub this year is Bieniemy, the Chiefs offensive coordinator who has presided over the professional development of the 2018 MVP Patrick Mahomes and helped guide arguably the league\u2019s most exciting offense. His boss, head coach Andy Reid, has seen his former assistants become Super Bowl winners (Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson) and respected offensive minds (Chicago Bears head coach Matt Nagy) after leaving his tutelage. Bieniemy may yet be named the head coach in Cleveland, but he wasn\u2019t hired after interviewing with the Jets last year, who instead went for Adam Gase, who was coming off an underwhelming career at the Miami Dolphins. Another odd exclusion is Bills defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier, who presided over one of the league\u2019s best defenses in Buffalo, but was not even linked to an interview for one of the recent openings. Whether they are affiliated with a successful team (Judge, Patricia and Flores were all assistants under Bill Belichick at the Patriots; Taylor was the QB coach on the 2018 NFC champion Rams) or vaunted for their technical innovation, young coaches are extremely popular hires right now. The biggest problem facing minority coaches in the past was that they needed to check boxes \u2013 position coach, coordinator etc \u2013 before being considered for a head coaching job. The Athletic\u2019s Tim Graham documented the striking lack of black offensive coaches in the NFL in 2018, making it even more difficult for a young minority coach to be considered a \u201cwhiz\u201d like Kingsbury or Taylor. As a result, they\u2019re losing to coaches like Judge, who are younger and far less experienced. \u201cYou almost have to have an Obama-like aura to get an opportunity,\u201d passing instructor George Whitfield told Graham. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a flier. It\u2019s not like you have to come in with a five-pound resume anymore. The one striking exception is Flores. He is only 38 and never rose to coordinator as a Patriots assistant, but his affiliation with six-time Super Bowl champion Belichick likely bolstered his profile with the Dolphins. Would Flores, a young, inexperienced black coach, have been considered had he not worked for the Patriots? It\u2019s impossible to tell, but the hirings of Patricia, Flores and Judge suggest that an association with a genius like Belichick will help your future head coaching chances. Teams are ultimately going to hire the coach they want to hire, but the striking imbalance between white and minority coaches suggests that it\u2019s not the Rooney Rule that\u2019s the problem, but team leadership. With so much turnover \u2013 remember that over 60% of teams have made at least one coaching change in the past three years \u2013 it\u2019s confusing that veteran black coaches like Caldwell and Frazier aren\u2019t given another opportunity. Perhaps this is because of a complete lack of diversity in ownership ranks and front offices, perhaps it\u2019s because of lacking enforcement for teams who engage the Rooney Rule in bad faith. Until it is addressed, however, players in a predominantly black league will be risking their health for the entertainment and enrichment of owners and coaches who don\u2019t look like them.",

Quite what Reed may be subjected to at the Players Championship, where Floridians make drinking on empty heads a virtue, or the US Open, which takes place on the outskirts of New York, is anyone\u2019s guess. Reed at least has the moderate comfort of a home Ryder Cup later in 2020.</p> <p>How did we reach this point? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/06/patrick-reed-handed-two-stroke-penalty-for-improving-his-lie\" title=\"\">Reed\u2019s brushing of sand, twice</a>, behind his ball in a waste area at the Hero World Challenge earned him a two-stroke penalty and the wrath of the golfing world. Essentially, Reed had improved his lie. The golfer\u2019s own assertions \u2013 and he delivered this in a totally convincing manner \u2013 that he had no idea exactly what had transpired have cut little ice. \u201cI think with a different camera angle they would have seen it was not improving the lie as I was far enough away from the golf ball,\u201d Reed said.</p> <p>So why accept the penalty? \u201cIt is my word against their word and because they only have one camera angle, I don\u2019t really have a choice. After seeing it brush some sand, they thought that was a breach and, in the Rules of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf\" title=\"\">Golf</a> , if you improve your lie, it is a penalty. At the end of the day you have to accept it and move on.\u201d</p> <p>Reed didn\u2019t know he would be subject to a meeting with rules officials until he finished that round. When citing availability or otherwise of camera angles, the 2018 Masters champion would be taking an outrageous gamble if actually wanting to be certain there was no alternative footage (as did prove the case). Top level players now are subject to such scrutiny that actively seeking to break rules is futile. People watching the Reed match live didn\u2019t notice anything unusual about his actions on the now infamous 11th at Albany.</p> <p>The wave of indignity towards Reed has become more fascinating than the essentially minor matter that caused it. This has roots in the essential commodity of intent: sniping galleries and social media commandos are absolutely adamant Reed broke a rule on purpose, thereby seeking to gain an advantage. Reed himself says the opposite. How on earth can anybody, with certainty, contradict the Texan? And on the basis they can\u2019t, this situation has become wholly disproportionate to the point of unfairness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a51d1e206357f72fb2ae3934a3143e9e3e72923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a51d1e206357f72fb2ae3934a3143e9e3e72923/0_0_3917_2611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Reed hits out of the sand on the 11th hole during the final round in the Tournament of Champions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Reed hits out of the sand on the 11th hole during the final round in the Tournament of Champions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kyle Terada/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reed is the major winner the US doesn\u2019t want to love. Attitudes towards other golfers tell us all we need to know about that. Tiger Woods \u2013 whose personal indiscretions of old take cheating into a fresh stratosphere \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/16/tiger-woods-penalty-drop-golf-rules\" title=\"\">punished on four separate occasions in 2013</a>, including at the Masters, because of incorrect drops. If Reed is under pressure amid the perception he isn\u2019t sorry enough, Woods\u2019s comments from the Barclays Championship should strike a chord. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I did anything [wrong],\u201d he said. As Woods won his 15th major at Augusta National last April, sports fans exploded with joy.</p> <p>It is therefore instructive and hilariously inconsistent how use of rules shape perception. You needn\u2019t wander far through tales of Seve Ballesteros\u2019s greatness to realise he had a penchant for bending scenarios to his advantage. This adds to the Spaniard\u2019s legend.

      "bodyText": "Twelve years have passed since a banking executive took a prestigious golf club in the Highlands of Scotland to court after being suspended for allegedly cheating in a match. Decades earlier in the same part of the country, an individual collected a trophy for a competition he hadn\u2019t played in. Upon the reality of that case coming to light, the gentleman in question emigrated to Canada. The common thread for these, and scores of other cases, is that the c-word even when attached to amateur golfers has potentially life-changing repercussions. Cheat on your partner by all means \u2013 brag about it in the clubhouse, even \u2013 but don\u2019t mark a golf ball closer to the hole. For Patrick Reed, an end-of-year jaunt to the Bahamas has ended up resonating beyond a guaranteed pay day, some sunshine and preparation for the following week\u2019s President\u2019s Cup. By the time Reed took to the course in Royal Melbourne \u2013 in an event hardly depicted by the smell of cordite \u2013 he had been called out by a member of the opposition team and suffered cat-calling from galleries. The latter went on, and on, and on, until Reed\u2019s caddie and brother-in-law snapped in retaliation during the penultimate day to the point where he was asked to sit out the final session. A sin-binned caddie \u2013 this is unheard of. Fast forward to Sunday in Maui, that notoriously hostile sporting environment, and a spectator bawled \u201ccheater\u201d at Reed on the final green of the Tournament of Champions. Quite what Reed may be subjected to at the Players Championship, where Floridians make drinking on empty heads a virtue, or the US Open, which takes place on the outskirts of New York, is anyone\u2019s guess. Reed at least has the moderate comfort of a home Ryder Cup later in 2020. How did we reach this point? Reed\u2019s brushing of sand, twice, behind his ball in a waste area at the Hero World Challenge earned him a two-stroke penalty and the wrath of the golfing world. Essentially, Reed had improved his lie. The golfer\u2019s own assertions \u2013 and he delivered this in a totally convincing manner \u2013 that he had no idea exactly what had transpired have cut little ice. \u201cI think with a different camera angle they would have seen it was not improving the lie as I was far enough away from the golf ball,\u201d Reed said. So why accept the penalty? \u201cIt is my word against their word and because they only have one camera angle, I don\u2019t really have a choice. After seeing it brush some sand, they thought that was a breach and, in the Rules of Golf , if you improve your lie, it is a penalty. At the end of the day you have to accept it and move on.\u201d Reed didn\u2019t know he would be subject to a meeting with rules officials until he finished that round. When citing availability or otherwise of camera angles, the 2018 Masters champion would be taking an outrageous gamble if actually wanting to be certain there was no alternative footage (as did prove the case). Top level players now are subject to such scrutiny that actively seeking to break rules is futile. People watching the Reed match live didn\u2019t notice anything unusual about his actions on the now infamous 11th at Albany. The wave of indignity towards Reed has become more fascinating than the essentially minor matter that caused it. This has roots in the essential commodity of intent: sniping galleries and social media commandos are absolutely adamant Reed broke a rule on purpose, thereby seeking to gain an advantage. Reed himself says the opposite. How on earth can anybody, with certainty, contradict the Texan? And on the basis they can\u2019t, this situation has become wholly disproportionate to the point of unfairness. Reed is the major winner the US doesn\u2019t want to love. Attitudes towards other golfers tell us all we need to know about that. Tiger Woods \u2013 whose personal indiscretions of old take cheating into a fresh stratosphere \u2013 was punished on four separate occasions in 2013, including at the Masters, because of incorrect drops. If Reed is under pressure amid the perception he isn\u2019t sorry enough, Woods\u2019s comments from the Barclays Championship should strike a chord. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I did anything [wrong],\u201d he said. As Woods won his 15th major at Augusta National last April, sports fans exploded with joy. It is therefore instructive and hilariously inconsistent how use of rules shape perception. You needn\u2019t wander far through tales of Seve Ballesteros\u2019s greatness to realise he had a penchant for bending scenarios to his advantage. This adds to the Spaniard\u2019s legend. Dustin Johnson\u2019s relief from a TV tower and deep rough in the crucial throngs of the 2016 US Open \u2013 which he won \u2013 remains iffy to those who believe in the spirit of rules as well as the black and white of them. If back stories are key, as has been implied regards Reed, then nobody chooses to look too closely at Johnson. Was Jordan Spieth\u2019s drop for the ages in the 2017 Open at Birkdale an act of genius or outrageous abuse of process? Bryson DeChambeau\u2019s glacial pace of play, which erupted into a storm last season, isn\u2019t defined as cheating when arguably it should be; such antics have a detrimental impact on other players in the field. Phil Mickelson can readily admit to wilfully breaching the rules of golf during the US Open of two years ago \u2013 the left hander started playing hockey mid-round \u2013 without any lasting consequence because \u2026 he is Phil Mickelson. We could go on, even before starting on the vomit-inducing desire of Mickelson and others to beat a path to Saudi Arabia for a golf tournament where appearance fees equal the GDP of a small nation. Instead, Reed is berated for adjusting some sand \u2013 when nobody knows if it was intentional \u2013 and not subsequently behaving according to the \u201cHere\u2019s How to Act Post Penalty\u201d manual. The good news for Reed is that he never appears altogether bothered by external opinion. Yet if this issue doesn\u2019t reflect well on him, it unquestionably looks worse for those so desperate to castigate or bawl. Golf can well do without them.",

An unmanned US drone killed Suleimani, and several others, in the early hours of Friday as he was being driven away from Baghdad international airport. The strike was carried out by an American MQ-9 Reaper drone, a weapon made by California-based General Atomics that has been in use by the US military since it replaced the MQ-1 Predator in July 2017. According to the US Air Force website, the MQ-9 Reaper\u2019s \u201csignificant loiter time, wide-range sensors, multi-mode communications suite and precision weapons\u201d mean that it \u201cprovides a unique capability to perform strike, coordination and reconnaissance against high-value, fleeting, and time-sensitive targets\u201d. How long has the crisis been brewing? Tensions between Washington and Tehran had been escalating since a US contractor was killed on an Iraqi airbase near the city of Kirkuk on 27 December. The American citizen was killed in a rocket attack by the Shia militia group Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah (KH). The group is backed by Iran. The US then launched a series of retaliatory attacks on KH bases, three in Iraq and two in Syria. Iran and Russia condemned the attacks, which are reported to have killed at least 25 people. Hundreds of protesters also stormed the US embassy inside Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone on 31 December. After declaring the embassy safe, Trump tweeted: \u201cIran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!\u201d So is the Iranian missile strike the end of it? Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that Iran \u201ctook and concluded proportionate measures\u201d with the attacks and that \u201cwe do not seek escalation or war\u201d. This may mean that Iran feels Suleimani\u2019s death has been avenged and this matter is now closed. But on the one hand it has also said it does not mean to comply any more with a deal struck to end its nuclear development. On the other it has allies and proxies throughout the region who it will presumably continue to support in their struggles against the US and its allies.",

Most of the passengers were en route to Kyiv, transiting through there to other destinations. The Boeing 737-800, operated by Ukraine International Airlines, took off from Imam Khomeini international airport at 6.12am Tehran time on Wednesday, after being delayed by almost an hour. It took off to the west, but never made it above 8,000ft and went down a few minutes later, according to flight-tracking websites. A video purportedly of the crash circulated by Isna showed the aircraft burning as it fell from the sky. Iranian officials said the plane\u2019s engine had caught fire, causing the pilot to lose control. A statement initially posted on the website of the Ukrainian embassy in Iran ruled out an act of terror and said the crash had been caused by an engine malfunction. However, this was later redacted, with the embassy stating that all information would be provided by an official commission. The black box containing vital records of how the plane crashed has been located in a field among the debris outside Tehran, but Iran said it would not hand the device over to plane maker Boeing. It is not clear whether Iranian authorities are disputing the legality of handing over the black box to Boeing, a US company, or whether they are seeking to inspect the box themselves. The news has fuelled speculation that there was something suspicious about the downing of the plane. Boeing, which would usually assist with such investigations, released a brief statement saying it was aware of the media reports about the disaster and was gathering more information. The 737-800 belongs to the same family as, but is different to, the 737 Max 8 aircraft, which has been grounded since two fatal crashes occurred within six months in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018.

The UK Foreign Office added it was urgently seeking confirmation about how many British nationals were onboard, and that it would do all it could to support any families affected.

The dead lay among shattered pieces of the aircraft, their possessions, including a child\u2019s electric toothbrush, a stuffed animal, luggage and electronics, strewn across the site. One witness, Aref Geravand, told AP the pilot managed to steer the plane towards a football field and away from a residential area. \u201cIt crashed near the field and in a water canal,\u201d they said. Boeing, the US\u2019s largest manufacturing exporter, has struggled to regain public trust after its 737 Max plane was involved in the two crashes that killed 346 people. The company has faced intense scrutiny, including allegations that it was aware of problems with a new automatic flight control feature on the 737 Max, which investigators believe is likely to have been the cause of the crashes. Last month, the company fired its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, who had been widely criticised by families and regulators for his handling of the crisis. Several 737-800 aircraft have been involved in deadly accidents. In March 2016, a FlyDubai 737-800 from Dubai crashed while trying to land at Rostov-on-Don airport in Russia, killing 62 people onboard. Another 737-800 flight from Dubai, operated by Air India Express, crashed in May 2010 while trying to land in Mangalore, India, killing more than 150.

For many, adherence to these narrow, oppressive expectations about what it means to be a man will logically express itself in the most grotesque ways.</p> <p>My novel <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-good-man-9781785152214.html\">A Good Man</a><em> </em>is a psychological thriller narrated by Thomas Martin, a devoted family man and successful advertising executive who appears to have an enviable life. However, as his meticulously constructed world unravels, Thomas grapples with his sense of self, and ultimately commits horrifying acts against his loved ones.

Moshfegh\u2019s novella takes the reader on a blackly comic trip through the vagaries of memory to portray a volatile male friendship shot through with aggression, acute alcoholism, and repressed eroticism \u2013 a relationship ultimately pushed into calamity by an imbalance of power.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-end-of-eddy-9780099598466.html/\">The End of Eddy by Edouard Louis</a><br></strong>Louis\u2019 memoir is a coming-of-age story about growing up poor and queer in a small, isolated village in France. Alienated from his family and from the peers he refers to with bitter irony as his \u201cbuddies\u201d, Louis endures a childhood marked by routine violence and humiliation because of his difference and inability to \u201cbe a man\u201d. \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t be one of them, I had to reject that whole world.

The entire story is set in motion by the warrior Achilles\u2019 monumental tantrum over being forced to give up a captive woman he considers his property, which results in a pissing contest at the expense of thousands of lives.

Isabel Archer\u2019s commitment to her independence backfires miserably when she rejects two promising suitors to marry the scheming Gilbert Osmond, who wastes no time in siphoning her fortune and robbing her of all spark and freedom. Toward the novel\u2019s end, she remarks: \u201cIf I were afraid of my husband that would be simply my duty. That\u2019s what women are expected to be.\u201d</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/24/the-vegetarian-by-han-kang-review-family-fallout\">The Vegetarian by Han Kang</a><br></strong>Kang\u2019s novel is an account of one woman\u2019s struggle for bodily autonomy and self-determination. Disturbed by gory nightmares, Yeong-he stops eating meat, a decision that enrages her casually misogynist husband and titillates her brother-in-law, both of whom believe she exists to service their needs. The women of the novel are faced with an impossible bind: \u201cIt\u2019s your body, you can treat it however you please. The only area where you\u2019re free to do just as you like. And even that doesn\u2019t turn out how you wanted.\u201d The only way to be free is to reject personhood altogether and become something else.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.buchiemecheta.co.uk/about-buchi/\">The Joys of Motherhood by Buchi Emecheta</a></strong><br>Nnu Ego, the heroine of this biting novel, struggles to live up to the expectations of a patriarchal society, and founders when faced with seismic changes. Caught in the trap of first being the dutiful daughter, then the subjugated wife, and then the beleaguered mother of an ever-growing family, Nnu\u2019s life of toil and deprivation at the hands of men unfurls in a devastatingly matter-of-fact style. Worse, she internalises her own oppression, reflecting only when it\u2019s too late, \u201cThe men make it look as if we must aspire for children or die\u2026 We women subscribe to that law more than anyone. Until we change all this, it is still a man\u2019s world, which women will always help to build.\u201d</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lolita-9780241953242.html\">Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov</a><br></strong>Humbert Humbert is the epitome of the unreliable, self-serving narrator, so convincing in telling his tale of star-crossed love with the \u201cnymphet\u201d Lolita that he could almost be mistaken for a tragic hero. The gorgeousness of the language seduces the reader into believing Humbert Humbert is sympathetic in his monstrosity; when the mask slips to reveal the reality of his abuse, the effects are breathtaking. This is, in my opinion, the best 20th-century #MeToo novel \u2014 it illuminates how the self-delusions of masculinity are seen as essentially virtuous. Its lessons and hurts are as fresh and relevant as ever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/22/top-10-books-about-angry-women\">Top 10 books about angry women</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/19/booksforchildrenandteenagers\">The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier</a><br></strong>As an elementary school teacher preoccupied with children\u2019s developing understanding of power and gender roles, I had to give a spot on this list to an exceptional work of young adult literature. Cormier\u2019s novel turns a prep school into a pressure cooker, in which freshman Jerry Renault\u2019s impulsive, fateful decision to abstain from a school fundraiser provokes the ire of a powerful secret society. The story is populated by choir boys who sound like Scorsese characters; enabled by their adult custodians, they engage in acts of violence both psychological and physical in service of a brutal conformity.</p> <p>\u2022 A Good Man by Ani Katz is published by William Heinemann on 16 January.

Alienated from his family and from the peers he refers to with bitter irony as his \u201cbuddies\u201d, Louis endures a childhood marked by routine violence and humiliation because of his difference and inability to \u201cbe a man\u201d. \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t be one of them, I had to reject that whole world. The smoke was unbreathable because of the beatings; the hunger was unbearable because of my father\u2019s hatred.\u201d 5. The Iliad by Homer The original epic of toxic masculinity. The entire story is set in motion by the warrior Achilles\u2019 monumental tantrum over being forced to give up a captive woman he considers his property, which results in a pissing contest at the expense of thousands of lives. In the end, the men weep as they reckon with the human cost of war before renewing their campaign of mutual destruction. 6. The Portrait of a Lady by Henry James A young woman\u2019s auspicious future and personal autonomy is destroyed by one of the most poisonous men in fiction. Isabel Archer\u2019s commitment to her independence backfires miserably when she rejects two promising suitors to marry the scheming Gilbert Osmond, who wastes no time in siphoning her fortune and robbing her of all spark and freedom. Toward the novel\u2019s end, she remarks: \u201cIf I were afraid of my husband that would be simply my duty. That\u2019s what women are expected to be.\u201d 7. The Vegetarian by Han Kang Kang\u2019s novel is an account of one woman\u2019s struggle for bodily autonomy and self-determination. Disturbed by gory nightmares, Yeong-he stops eating meat, a decision that enrages her casually misogynist husband and titillates her brother-in-law, both of whom believe she exists to service their needs. The women of the novel are faced with an impossible bind: \u201cIt\u2019s your body, you can treat it however you please. The only area where you\u2019re free to do just as you like. And even that doesn\u2019t turn out how you wanted.\u201d The only way to be free is to reject personhood altogether and become something else. 8. The Joys of Motherhood by Buchi Emecheta Nnu Ego, the heroine of this biting novel, struggles to live up to the expectations of a patriarchal society, and founders when faced with seismic changes. Caught in the trap of first being the dutiful daughter, then the subjugated wife, and then the beleaguered mother of an ever-growing family, Nnu\u2019s life of toil and deprivation at the hands of men unfurls in a devastatingly matter-of-fact style. Worse, she internalises her own oppression, reflecting only when it\u2019s too late, \u201cThe men make it look as if we must aspire for children or die\u2026 We women subscribe to that law more than anyone. Until we change all this, it is still a man\u2019s world, which women will always help to build.\u201d 9. Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov Humbert Humbert is the epitome of the unreliable, self-serving narrator, so convincing in telling his tale of star-crossed love with the \u201cnymphet\u201d Lolita that he could almost be mistaken for a tragic hero. The gorgeousness of the language seduces the reader into believing Humbert Humbert is sympathetic in his monstrosity; when the mask slips to reveal the reality of his abuse, the effects are breathtaking. This is, in my opinion, the best 20th-century #MeToo novel \u2014 it illuminates how the self-delusions of masculinity are seen as essentially virtuous. Its lessons and hurts are as fresh and relevant as ever. 10. The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier As an elementary school teacher preoccupied with children\u2019s developing understanding of power and gender roles, I had to give a spot on this list to an exceptional work of young adult literature. Cormier\u2019s novel turns a prep school into a pressure cooker, in which freshman Jerry Renault\u2019s impulsive, fateful decision to abstain from a school fundraiser provokes the ire of a powerful secret society. The story is populated by choir boys who sound like Scorsese characters; enabled by their adult custodians, they engage in acts of violence both psychological and physical in service of a brutal conformity. \u2022 A Good Man by Ani Katz is published by William Heinemann on 16 January.

I want to make this place a better place and I want the fans to trust me because I want to move the club forward. If I do and when we get a new ground, my investment will be very shrewd. If I don\u2019t, at least I will have had long enough to try and make a change and have a positive effect. A lot of managers don\u2019t get that and it\u2019s getting ridiculous. How can [Pep] Guardiola be questioned now? The man\u2019s a genius. It doesn\u2019t make sense. What are we living in? But in this world of football madness, I am totally sane.\u201d</p> <p>In some ways Holloway\u2019s arrival was a long time in the making given he held talks with Grimsby before taking charge of Blackpool in 2009. But this time the interview process culminated in a four-hour conversation with the majority shareholder John Fenty in a fish and chip restaurant on Cleethorpes pier. On Monday Holloway left his home near Chippenham before 5am to get to training on time (allowing for repairs to a slow puncture en route), but he has since found a house in Lincolnshire for him, his wife, Kim, and their dogs, Dougal, Ted, Milo and Ernie, to move into at the end of the month.</p> <p>That afternoon Holloway also made his first signing, and later that night he fell asleep watching Arsenal against Leeds. Holloway has managed almost 1,000 games and was interviewed for the Swansea job last summer but, despite his uncurbed enthusiasm for the game, he admits he considered calling it a day. \u201cI\u2019m far too young to retire, but I was thinking about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI know there will be a day where I\u2019ll be past my sell-by date but it ain\u2019t now, because I want to do it too much. To stand on that line and hear what some people say, you\u2019d think we [managers] are mad sometimes. It doesn\u2019t matter the ship I\u2019m on or how big the waves are, I\u2019m on another journey and it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>Stocked with an infectious personality, Holloway has already struck up a rapport with supporters, buying some gloves and calendars in the club shop hours before Grimsby edged out Salford City on New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 their first win for more than three months. Since he was appointed manager, Grimsby, who travel to Leyton Orient on Saturday, have garnered maximum points after beating Mansfield last time out, despite playing more than 80 minutes with 10 men. After that win Holloway apologised for over-celebrating, acknowledging a cocktail of pent-up energy and frustration had got the better of him. But Holloway, who describes the former Grimsby managers Bill Shankly and Lawrie McMenemy as inspirations, need not apologise for restoring a feelgood factor around Blundell Park in double-quick time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been gobsmacked by the response from everybody at the club,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a Bristol Rovers fan and we\u2019ve had some terrible times but you never change the kit that\u2019s around your heart. Ever. But unfortunately, as a football manager, I\u2019ve had to. Bristol Rovers sacked me years ago so I\u2019ve had to change colours and these colours have never fit so well on me in my life.</p> <p>\u201cEvery club should be a fit for the manager, a marriage between the manager and the owner. At the moment there\u2019s too many layers above the manager now, so you cannot get a close relationship with the chairman. You have got chief executives, directors of football, all sorts of things \u2026 but this is old fashioned and I absolutely love it. This is me all over.\u201d</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Several clubs have raided non-league in search of goalscoring rough diamonds since the transfer window reopened. Josh March has joined Forest Green Rovers from Leamington Town after scoring 24 goals in 27 games, becoming the second striker to swap the National League North for the Football League in six months after Colby Bishop joined Accrington in July. Meanwhile, Muhammadu Faal has signed for Bolton from the Isthmian Premier League side Enfield Town, for whom he has scored 27 goals in 30 games this season. Also, 21-year-old Reeco Hackett-Fairchild has joined Portsmouth from Bromley.</p> <p>\u2022 Birmingham could face a second points deduction in two seasons after being charged with breaching financial rules by the EFL. The Championship club said the charge relates to a breach of a business plan imposed by the league last March, when they were deducted nine points for breaking profitability and sustainability rules. \u201cThe club denies the charge and we await the outcome of ongoing disciplinary proceedings,\u201d read a Birmingham statement. Meanwhile, the decision to suspend Bolton\u2019s five-point deduction regarding unfulfilled fixtures has been upheld by an arbitration panel following a failed appeal by the EFL, who said they are \u201cdisappointed with the verdict\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Ben Garner has made his second signing since being appointed Bristol Rovers manager, with the 21-year-old midfielder Josh Barrett arriving from Reading after the Derby winger Jayden Mitchell-Lawson joined on loan on Monday. Garner, who worked as a first-team coach at Crystal Palace and West Brom and was most recently assistant to Steve Coppell at the Indian Super League club ATK, has not won any of his opening four matches. Rovers, who are eighth in League One, host Doncaster on Saturday.</p>",

How can [Pep] Guardiola be questioned now? The man\u2019s a genius. It doesn\u2019t make sense. What are we living in? But in this world of football madness, I am totally sane.\u201d In some ways Holloway\u2019s arrival was a long time in the making given he held talks with Grimsby before taking charge of Blackpool in 2009. But this time the interview process culminated in a four-hour conversation with the majority shareholder John Fenty in a fish and chip restaurant on Cleethorpes pier. On Monday Holloway left his home near Chippenham before 5am to get to training on time (allowing for repairs to a slow puncture en route), but he has since found a house in Lincolnshire for him, his wife, Kim, and their dogs, Dougal, Ted, Milo and Ernie, to move into at the end of the month. That afternoon Holloway also made his first signing, and later that night he fell asleep watching Arsenal against Leeds. Holloway has managed almost 1,000 games and was interviewed for the Swansea job last summer but, despite his uncurbed enthusiasm for the game, he admits he considered calling it a day. \u201cI\u2019m far too young to retire, but I was thinking about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI know there will be a day where I\u2019ll be past my sell-by date but it ain\u2019t now, because I want to do it too much. To stand on that line and hear what some people say, you\u2019d think we [managers] are mad sometimes. It doesn\u2019t matter the ship I\u2019m on or how big the waves are, I\u2019m on another journey and it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Stocked with an infectious personality, Holloway has already struck up a rapport with supporters, buying some gloves and calendars in the club shop hours before Grimsby edged out Salford City on New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 their first win for more than three months. Since he was appointed manager, Grimsby, who travel to Leyton Orient on Saturday, have garnered maximum points after beating Mansfield last time out, despite playing more than 80 minutes with 10 men. After that win Holloway apologised for over-celebrating, acknowledging a cocktail of pent-up energy and frustration had got the better of him. But Holloway, who describes the former Grimsby managers Bill Shankly and Lawrie McMenemy as inspirations, need not apologise for restoring a feelgood factor around Blundell Park in double-quick time. \u201cI\u2019ve been gobsmacked by the response from everybody at the club,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a Bristol Rovers fan and we\u2019ve had some terrible times but you never change the kit that\u2019s around your heart. Ever. But unfortunately, as a football manager, I\u2019ve had to. Bristol Rovers sacked me years ago so I\u2019ve had to change colours and these colours have never fit so well on me in my life. \u201cEvery club should be a fit for the manager, a marriage between the manager and the owner. At the moment there\u2019s too many layers above the manager now, so you cannot get a close relationship with the chairman. You have got chief executives, directors of football, all sorts of things \u2026 but this is old fashioned and I absolutely love it. This is me all over.\u201d Talking points \u2022 Several clubs have raided non-league in search of goalscoring rough diamonds since the transfer window reopened. Josh March has joined Forest Green Rovers from Leamington Town after scoring 24 goals in 27 games, becoming the second striker to swap the National League North for the Football League in six months after Colby Bishop joined Accrington in July. Meanwhile, Muhammadu Faal has signed for Bolton from the Isthmian Premier League side Enfield Town, for whom he has scored 27 goals in 30 games this season. Also, 21-year-old Reeco Hackett-Fairchild has joined Portsmouth from Bromley. \u2022 Birmingham could face a second points deduction in two seasons after being charged with breaching financial rules by the EFL. The Championship club said the charge relates to a breach of a business plan imposed by the league last March, when they were deducted nine points for breaking profitability and sustainability rules. \u201cThe club denies the charge and we await the outcome of ongoing disciplinary proceedings,\u201d read a Birmingham statement. Meanwhile, the decision to suspend Bolton\u2019s five-point deduction regarding unfulfilled fixtures has been upheld by an arbitration panel following a failed appeal by the EFL, who said they are \u201cdisappointed with the verdict\u201d. \u2022 Ben Garner has made his second signing since being appointed Bristol Rovers manager, with the 21-year-old midfielder Josh Barrett arriving from Reading after the Derby winger Jayden Mitchell-Lawson joined on loan on Monday. Garner, who worked as a first-team coach at Crystal Palace and West Brom and was most recently assistant to Steve Coppell at the Indian Super League club ATK, has not won any of his opening four matches. Rovers, who are eighth in League One, host Doncaster on Saturday.",

You can just about detect it if you really concentrate, but I reckon these could pass as \u201cnormal\u201d brownies with all but the most dedicated of nitpickers.</p> <p>The other option, of course, is to use ground nuts instead, as in so many other flourless cakes, an approach favoured by <a href=\"https://www.honeybuns.co.uk/Blogs/Em-s-Blog/Gluten-free-Chocolate-Orange-Brownies-Recipe\" title=\"\">Emma Goss-Custard\u2019s Honeybuns cookbook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nigella.com/recipes/flourless-chocolate-brownies-with-hot-chocolate-sauce\" title=\"\">Nigella Lawson</a> and baker Paul O\u2019Brien, who kindly sends me the recipe they use at <a href=\"https://www.sunflourbakeryuk.com/\" title=\"\">the Sunflour Bakery on London\u2019s Caledonian Road</a>. I could rival a squirrel in my passion for ground almonds, in particular, but here I think they turn the brownies into something else \u2013 something delicious, yes, but not essentially brownie-like. For me, a brownie ought to be all about the chocolate; nuts can add texture, but they shouldn\u2019t dilute its flavour.</p> <p>Some recipes also use raising agents, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really necessary \u2013 fluffiness is not the name of the game here.</p> <h2>The dairy</h2> <p>Butter is a vital part of this dish \u2013 there\u2019s no getting away from it \u2013 along with eggs to lend it structure. Konditor &amp; Cook use whites to give the mixture \u201cmore stability\u201d, but as I don\u2019t find this a problem in the other recipes, I\u2019d prefer to keep things straightforward and stick in the lovely, tasty yolks, too. After all, there\u2019s no such thing as too rich when it comes to brownies.</p> <p>Whipping the eggs up with the sugar, as Eastwood and Christmas recommend, helps not only to dissolve the latter, which will give the finished bake a smoother texture, but also adds air, making an inevitably (and happily) dense cake very slightly less dense, which means, in turn, that you can eat slightly more of it. Win-win.</p> <h2>The chocolate and sugar</h2> <p>Use as much of the first as possible \u2013 though, if you want to make life really easy for yourself, may I point you in the direction of Sunflour\u2019s recipe, which folds four eggs and 150g ground almonds into 500g chocolate spread. It really is that simple, and it\u2019s very, very good.</p> <p>Sugar-wise, caster will work just fine, but I like Eastwood\u2019s toffeeish light muscovado here; the darker version in Christmas\u2019 recipe is a bit intense for an afternoon treat, though I\u2019m sure it works wonderfully on the dessert menu at his restaurant.</p> <h2>The flavourings</h2> <p>This is entirely up to you, of course, but let me give you some ideas. First point, nuts provide textural interest, further increasing the moreishness factor. (If this makes you anxious, I\u2019d suggest avoiding brownies altogether.) If you don\u2019t like nuts, you might want to consider deploying Konditor &amp; Cook\u2019s whisky-soaked figs for the same purpose, or perhaps something else crunchy, such as seeds, say, or broken biscuits, or cinder toffee. If you really like nuts, however, pour half a jar of peanut butter on top, too; that\u2019s Inman\u2019s idea and it\u2019s great. Eastwood stirs through pureed beetroot, which sounds worthy, but doesn\u2019t taste it in the least; instead, it supplies a slightly perfumed sweetness that lifts the chocolate beautifully, as well as giving a spuriously healthy feeling to the whole affair, which, again, encourages further consumption.</p> <p>Christmas adds a pinch of ground coffee, which works incredibly well, giving his brownies a subtle, but undeniably intriguing dark and bitter edge. If you don\u2019t have it, or don\u2019t like it, feel free to leave it out, or substitute a teaspoon of vanilla essence or a sweet spice of your choice (or, indeed, a non-sweet spice \u2013 they\u2019re your brownies, after all). The only thing I really must insist you include is salt: a good pinch will help balance out the sweetness and richness, so you can eat, well, you know the drill. I\u2019m duty-bound, however, to recommend you consume in moderation.</p> <h2>Perfect gluten-free chocolate brownies</h2> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>35 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>1 tray (about 20 squares or 40 triangles)</strong></p> <p><strong>250g butter</strong>, diced<br><strong>300g dark chocolate</strong>, roughly chopped<br><strong>3 eggs</strong><br><strong>275g soft light brown sugar</strong><br><strong>100g walnuts</strong>, or other nuts (optional)<br><strong>75g cornflour</strong><br><strong>1 tsp fine salt</strong><br><strong>1 tsp ground coffee</strong> (optional)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd9dfabbc9dac4429a5c543e0d3841b69e85533f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd9dfabbc9dac4429a5c543e0d3841b69e85533f/0_1152_7252_4352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grease and line a tin about 24cm square with baking paper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grease and line a 24cm square tin with baking paper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and line a tin about 24cm square with baking paper.

As Restaurant Magazine\u2019s editor, Stefan Chomka, puts it: \u201cPremium sarnies are very much in vogue.\u201d The grilled cheese sandwich, for instance, has emerged from its trashy street food years as an impressive, affordable staple at specialist craft beer and wine bars and at high-quality kiosk-cafes. Try Birmingham\u2019s Kilder, Liverpool\u2019s Wild Loaf or Leeds\u2019s Owt.

      "body": "<p>Rosamund Lupton\u2019s new novel opens on a \u201cmoment of stillness; as if time itself is waiting, can no longer be measured\u201d. This infinitesimal pause is followed by a single gunshot, a bullet moving \u201cfaster than sound\u201d, which doubles as the crack of a starter pistol \u2013 propelling us into a nail-biting three hours (\u201c180 minutes, 10,800 seconds\u201d) during which the teachers and students at a school in a remote part of Somerset are held hostage by two unidentified gunmen. The book urges us to follow a multitude of stories \u201cplaying out \u2026 simultaneously, connected by time and place\u201d.</p> <p>The most compelling narrative thread leads to Rafi, a PTSD-stricken teenager who single-handedly shepherded his eight-year-old brother Basi out of Syria, and is the first to suspect that the loud bang in the woods signals an imminent attack, from which he must now race to save his brother again. Meanwhile his girlfriend Hannah is trapped in the library desperately trying to keep the wounded headmaster alive.

      "bodyText": "Rosamund Lupton\u2019s new novel opens on a \u201cmoment of stillness; as if time itself is waiting, can no longer be measured\u201d. This infinitesimal pause is followed by a single gunshot, a bullet moving \u201cfaster than sound\u201d, which doubles as the crack of a starter pistol \u2013 propelling us into a nail-biting three hours (\u201c180 minutes, 10,800 seconds\u201d) during which the teachers and students at a school in a remote part of Somerset are held hostage by two unidentified gunmen. The book urges us to follow a multitude of stories \u201cplaying out \u2026 simultaneously, connected by time and place\u201d. The most compelling narrative thread leads to Rafi, a PTSD-stricken teenager who single-handedly shepherded his eight-year-old brother Basi out of Syria, and is the first to suspect that the loud bang in the woods signals an imminent attack, from which he must now race to save his brother again. Meanwhile his girlfriend Hannah is trapped in the library desperately trying to keep the wounded headmaster alive. Then there\u2019s Beth, a helicopter mum frantic with worry about her son Jamie, somewhere in the school but not responding to her texts or calls; Camille, a teacher sheltering her seven-year-old charges in a dangerously exposed pottery studio (\u201cthe glass windows turned into weapons\u201d); the courageous deputy head Neil; and Detective Inspector Rose Polstein, a pregnant forensic psychologist tasked with putting together a picture of the monster capable of planning such a horrific attack.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I don\u2019t care\u201d was the recurring refrain of Ricky Gervais\u2019s Golden Globe hosting gig on Sunday. Those three words were fired off after his every other crass or impolite zinger, whether he was chastising Leonardo DiCaprio for his youthful dating preferences, proposing to solve the problem of no female directing nominees by banning women from making studio movies, or simply calling James Corden a \u201cfat pussy\u201d (because he\u2019s in Cats, geddit?). \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Gervais repeated, reminding us for the umpteenth time that he wouldn\u2019t be doing this again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/06/ricky-gervais-is-wrong-political-engagement-at-the-golden-globes-was-essential\">Ricky Gervais is wrong: political engagement at the Golden Globes was essential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the British comedian\u2019s fifth go at hosting the most raucous and least prestigious of Hollywood\u2019s major awards shows, and the strain clearly showed. Ten years ago, when he first took the job, there was a kind of gleeful ebullience to his nihilism: not all the jokes landed, but what he didn\u2019t seem to care about were the consequences. This year, as he flatly drawled one weary putdown after another, it was clear he didn\u2019t care about the entire shebang, his own role in it included: with his glory years as a TV star behind him, Gervais was out to prove nothing so much as how over it is he was. An uncharacteristically muted, less-buzzed-than-usual celebrity crowd, meanwhile, looked pretty over it, too. Even Gervais\u2019s best, most pointed jabs \u2013 and there were a couple, whether he was bluntly calling Hollywood Foreign Press Association voters racist or impugning the industry for looking the other way with Harvey Weinstein \u2013 didn\u2019t elicit the usual gasps or whoops, though exhausted nods were plentiful.</p> <p>Perhaps the golden age \u2013 or even the grubby gold lam\u00e9 age \u2013 of the awards host is simply behind us: in an age where awards ceremonies are mainly fodder to be broken down into various viral highlights, the role of an emcee to link all this future meme material seems increasingly redundant. Gervais\u2019 particular presence as a provocateur, meanwhile, felt particularly extraneous in a year when others on stage were delivering punchier messages, albeit with fewer punchlines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbc/status/1214008610667155456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ricky Gervais kicks off The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenGlobes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoldenGlobes</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZSdqiWMudx\">pic.twitter.com/ZSdqiWMudx</a></p>&mdash; NBC Entertainment (@nbc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbc/status/1214008610667155456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>While the host had preemptively admonished any winners for making political speeches in his intro \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re in no position to lecture the public about anything, you know nothing about this real world\u201d \u2013 his words went unheeded by many, whether it was an absent Russell Crowe sending a message about climate as evinced by the Australian fire crisis in his stead, an awkward but earnest Joaquin Phoenix imploring the industry to make environmentally-minded changes, or Patricia Arquette and Michelle Williams both using their platforms to take an early stand against Trump in the 2020 election, the latter via an impassioned feminist pro-choice plea.</p> <p>None of this was especially amusing, but it was awards show gold: Arquette and Williams\u2019 speeches, in particular, got more rousing applause from the otherwise out-of-sorts audience than any of Gervais\u2019 caustic quips, and hogged at least as many headlines the next day. They also kept the right-ring rage machine boiling, as Twitter erupted with an equal volume of cheers and jeers for these fierce queens/Hollyweird liberals. That\u2019s just the mood of the moment: at a particularly glum time for international news, with part of the world literally on fire and war with Iran looming, incendiary threat, it\u2019s no surprise that sincere activism got a louder response than snarky \u201cwhat are you gonna do about it\u201d apathy. That like would have been the case even if the latter had been delivered by Gervais on peak form, and even he would admit that he wasn\u2019t: that, if anything, was the joke.</p> <p>Tina Fey and Amy Poehler could have pulled it off, you cry, and they probably would have. The lightning-quick duo\u2019s three-year Globes hosting stint from 2012 to 2014 was a remarkable high-wire achievement, at once warmly playing to the gallery and bluntly speaking truth to power \u2013 and in so doing, becoming the only major awards show hosts in the last decade to earn both glowing reviews the next morning and a cherished place in public memory. Chances are you have forgotten that Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon and, strangely, Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg ever hosted the Globes. Recent Oscar hosts, meanwhile, have ranged from the blandly proficient (Jimmy Kimmel) to the legendarily calamitous (Anne Hathaway and James Franco); none have met with widespread clamour for a return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9c4e5969de5e46d48975f5cc25556c1ca42edbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9c4e5969de5e46d48975f5cc25556c1ca42edbf/0_247_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Fey and Amy Poehler host the 72nd Golden Globes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tina Fey and Amy Poehler host the 72nd Golden Globes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Drinkwater/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a thankless gig, and the Academy admitted as much last year when, following a series of PR disasters over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/kevin-hart-not-returning-to-host-oscars\">Kevin Hart\u2019s hiring and firing</a> over homophobic remarks, they simply went hostless. If you\u2019ve forgotten all this, it\u2019s because the presence or otherwise of a host had little impact on the ultimate ceremony\u2019s most quoted and replayed moments: Olivia Colman\u2019s surprise win and endearingly flabbergasted speech, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga\u2019s teasingly sexy rendition of best song winner Shallow or a dynamite one-off comic routine by first-up presenters Maya Rudolph, Fey and Poehler (how about that) that effectively functioned as a brief, zesty opening monologue.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I don\u2019t care\u201d was the recurring refrain of Ricky Gervais\u2019s Golden Globe hosting gig on Sunday. Those three words were fired off after his every other crass or impolite zinger, whether he was chastising Leonardo DiCaprio for his youthful dating preferences, proposing to solve the problem of no female directing nominees by banning women from making studio movies, or simply calling James Corden a \u201cfat pussy\u201d (because he\u2019s in Cats, geddit?). \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Gervais repeated, reminding us for the umpteenth time that he wouldn\u2019t be doing this again. It was the British comedian\u2019s fifth go at hosting the most raucous and least prestigious of Hollywood\u2019s major awards shows, and the strain clearly showed. Ten years ago, when he first took the job, there was a kind of gleeful ebullience to his nihilism: not all the jokes landed, but what he didn\u2019t seem to care about were the consequences. This year, as he flatly drawled one weary putdown after another, it was clear he didn\u2019t care about the entire shebang, his own role in it included: with his glory years as a TV star behind him, Gervais was out to prove nothing so much as how over it is he was. An uncharacteristically muted, less-buzzed-than-usual celebrity crowd, meanwhile, looked pretty over it, too. Even Gervais\u2019s best, most pointed jabs \u2013 and there were a couple, whether he was bluntly calling Hollywood Foreign Press Association voters racist or impugning the industry for looking the other way with Harvey Weinstein \u2013 didn\u2019t elicit the usual gasps or whoops, though exhausted nods were plentiful. Perhaps the golden age \u2013 or even the grubby gold lam\u00e9 age \u2013 of the awards host is simply behind us: in an age where awards ceremonies are mainly fodder to be broken down into various viral highlights, the role of an emcee to link all this future meme material seems increasingly redundant. Gervais\u2019 particular presence as a provocateur, meanwhile, felt particularly extraneous in a year when others on stage were delivering punchier messages, albeit with fewer punchlines. While the host had preemptively admonished any winners for making political speeches in his intro \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re in no position to lecture the public about anything, you know nothing about this real world\u201d \u2013 his words went unheeded by many, whether it was an absent Russell Crowe sending a message about climate as evinced by the Australian fire crisis in his stead, an awkward but earnest Joaquin Phoenix imploring the industry to make environmentally-minded changes, or Patricia Arquette and Michelle Williams both using their platforms to take an early stand against Trump in the 2020 election, the latter via an impassioned feminist pro-choice plea. None of this was especially amusing, but it was awards show gold: Arquette and Williams\u2019 speeches, in particular, got more rousing applause from the otherwise out-of-sorts audience than any of Gervais\u2019 caustic quips, and hogged at least as many headlines the next day. They also kept the right-ring rage machine boiling, as Twitter erupted with an equal volume of cheers and jeers for these fierce queens/Hollyweird liberals. That\u2019s just the mood of the moment: at a particularly glum time for international news, with part of the world literally on fire and war with Iran looming, incendiary threat, it\u2019s no surprise that sincere activism got a louder response than snarky \u201cwhat are you gonna do about it\u201d apathy. That like would have been the case even if the latter had been delivered by Gervais on peak form, and even he would admit that he wasn\u2019t: that, if anything, was the joke. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler could have pulled it off, you cry, and they probably would have. The lightning-quick duo\u2019s three-year Globes hosting stint from 2012 to 2014 was a remarkable high-wire achievement, at once warmly playing to the gallery and bluntly speaking truth to power \u2013 and in so doing, becoming the only major awards show hosts in the last decade to earn both glowing reviews the next morning and a cherished place in public memory. Chances are you have forgotten that Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon and, strangely, Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg ever hosted the Globes. Recent Oscar hosts, meanwhile, have ranged from the blandly proficient (Jimmy Kimmel) to the legendarily calamitous (Anne Hathaway and James Franco); none have met with widespread clamour for a return. It\u2019s a thankless gig, and the Academy admitted as much last year when, following a series of PR disasters over Kevin Hart\u2019s hiring and firing over homophobic remarks, they simply went hostless. If you\u2019ve forgotten all this, it\u2019s because the presence or otherwise of a host had little impact on the ultimate ceremony\u2019s most quoted and replayed moments: Olivia Colman\u2019s surprise win and endearingly flabbergasted speech, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga\u2019s teasingly sexy rendition of best song winner Shallow or a dynamite one-off comic routine by first-up presenters Maya Rudolph, Fey and Poehler (how about that) that effectively functioned as a brief, zesty opening monologue. Whatever Hart had up his sleeve, the odds are against it having had equivalent staying power. All in all, it worked well enough for the Academy to spare themselves the bother and quietly go hostless again this year; few have complained, and it seems this may be the status quo going forward, at least until Rudolph, Fey and Poehler acquiesce to do the whole damn thing together. Perhaps the Globes will be minded to follow suit, particularly if Gervais \u2013 more distinctive than their last few hosts, if hardly more agreeable \u2013 keeps his word about never returning to this well. It now falls on the witty, broadly beloved Graham Norton, finally hired for the Baftas after years of seeming the obvious man for the job, to make the case for \u201cawards show host\u201d as a viable job this season, though after general controversy over the British Academy\u2019s diversity-challenged nominee slate this morning, he has an unenviable needle to thread on the jokes front.

After finding God and getting married, the stage is now set for the next Bieber story, and its opening chapter is a song called Yummy.</p> <p>Released last week, there are some things to like about it \u2013 the way the melody bounces up into the lovely, yearning upper range of his voice; the opalescent chords \u2013 but there are plenty more to hate. The shameless plug for his streetwear brand Drew House; the cringeworthy use of trap ebonics (\u201chundred racks \u2026 get litty babe\u201d); the sense of him being about two years behind the curve of hazy R&amp;B, a real shame when Purpose was so trendsetting. But most of all, that chorus, which sounds like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHC7guX-FCk\">Lonely Island parody of a pop-R&amp;B song</a>. Its use of baby talk to vaguely gesture at a world of sexual pleasure will make your genitals involuntarily fold up inside your abdomen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/03/do-something-weird-that-works-on-tiktok-how-to-write-a-pop-smash-in-2020\">'Do something weird that works on TikTok': how to write a pop smash in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More troubling than the vision of he and his wife cooing this at each other is the feeling that this has been written for one thing in mind: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/01/why-are-teenagers-on-tiktok-obsessed-with-an-eerie-1950s-song\">TikTok</a>.

The deeper problem is that a generation grown on highly sophisticated, multilayered internet culture can detect bullshit a mile off: this is so nakedly eager to go viral that it almost certainly won\u2019t.</p> <p>Yummy will probably reach No 1 off Bieber\u2019s sheer star power anyway.

I got a phone with more space and (embarrassingly) finally figured out how to put MP3s on it.</p> <p>As of 2020, I\u2019ve stopped carrying my iPod around. I feel so guilty at seeing it on the shelf, that I abandoned it before it died. It\u2019s so feeble to think that the lightest grazes of friction pushed me away from my beloved little music machine. Though maybe it\u2019s more than just convenience. Fifteen years ago, it seemed so thrilling to have thousands of songs in your pocket, the world at your fingertips. With time, I\u2019ve understood that all that access generally amounts to a lot of dabbling and not much commitment. Obviously, Spotify offers the same possibility, but I keep a judicious eye on the albums I save to it, discarding duds and eventually purchasing the good ones while MP3s still exist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/macs-ipods-apps-how-apple-revolutionised-technology\">From Macs to iPods and apps: how Apple revolutionised technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My iTunes library is still intact, an MP3 monolith built on varying degrees of legitimacy that I can pluck from at any time.

I got into podcasts, which live on my phone. When I got an office job and started commuting, I found that my iPod and wired headphones stayed in my bag as I switched from NPR\u2019s Fresh Air to Spotify, or the brilliant Bandcamp app, to soundtrack my train reading. I got a phone with more space and (embarrassingly) finally figured out how to put MP3s on it. As of 2020, I\u2019ve stopped carrying my iPod around. I feel so guilty at seeing it on the shelf, that I abandoned it before it died. It\u2019s so feeble to think that the lightest grazes of friction pushed me away from my beloved little music machine. Though maybe it\u2019s more than just convenience. Fifteen years ago, it seemed so thrilling to have thousands of songs in your pocket, the world at your fingertips. With time, I\u2019ve understood that all that access generally amounts to a lot of dabbling and not much commitment. Obviously, Spotify offers the same possibility, but I keep a judicious eye on the albums I save to it, discarding duds and eventually purchasing the good ones while MP3s still exist. My iTunes library is still intact, an MP3 monolith built on varying degrees of legitimacy that I can pluck from at any time. (You want an illicit recording of the National playing a French radio session in 2006? I got you.) I don\u2019t want to carry it around in my pocket any more, but the slippery way that streaming companies seduce consumers into abandoning their libraries, and the equally slippery way that songs can then vanish from the world\u2019s library (whether the internet or actual, physical warehouses) makes holding on to them, whatever the device, feel like a meaningful form of resistance.

We ended up in the Groucho Club, where she draped herself over various men, magazine editors. Huge, kohled eyes; long blond hair; a tiny vest top. She already had an FTW (Fuck the World) tat.

She didn\u2019t look like a yeshiva girl. Or even really like a New Yorker. She looked like a Malibu-born-and-bred hippie even back then, with her straight blond hair, her perfectly worn-in Levi\u2019s, her giant eyes that drew you in and threatened to drown you.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elizabeth-wurtzel\">Soon, everyone knew who Lizzie or Liz was</a>. She was \u201ccampus famous\u201d, throwing a party when she lost her virginity. So how, then, was she in such pain, and how did she write about it so viscerally? For that is what she did. How can one be clinically depressed and yet self-assured enough to write a memoir that would open up a whole conversation about mental health? \u201cSome things are beyond repair,\u201d she wrote \u201cAnd that was me.\u201d Clever and beautiful, why was she the way she was? To some critics, she was simply too self-indulgent. Why was she so shameless about her self-harm, her drug-taking, her promiscuity? Why did she not hide as women are meant to? Why not 30 years of therapy and suffering in silence? No.</p> <p>She fell in love, she said, with her own depression, as she thought so little of the rest of her. Her agony justified her existence. Perceptively, she would report from the unknowable frontline where feeling nothing is much the same as feeling intensely. A world where she would grab things. Often men. \u201cI would then end up with nothing and then mourn the loss of something I never had.\u201d Sex was an attempt to shut her brain down and open her heart out. I witnessed her in that mode and, really, did any guy stand a chance? She was in love with them within a day. It looked like someone bleeding out.</p> <p>But she was also very funny. On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/04/100-best-novels-no-85-the-bell-jar-sylvia-plath\">Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar</a>, in which the protagonist, Esther Greenwood, decides not to wash her hair any more, she wrote: \u201cYou know you have completely descended into madness when the matter of shampoo has ascended into philosophical heights.\u201d Prozac Nation made her an It girl in New York, and this was warranted. For her level of self-exposure was courageous. Of this I have no doubt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb75615523e31c78fd835bb13b137107a8b2c14d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb75615523e31c78fd835bb13b137107a8b2c14d/0_0_5172_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wurtzel in New York in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everyone else can be afraid of cancer.

      "body": "<p>Silvio Horta, the creator of hit TV show Ugly Betty, has died at the age of 45. The television producer and screenwriter, who was of Cuban-American descent, began his career with the satirical teen film Urban Legends starring Jared Leto, and created two sci-fi programmes, The Chronicle and Jake 2.0, which were broadcast in the early 2000s. Horta, who died by apparent suicide, went on to have mainstream success with the comedy-drama starring Vanessa Williams and America Ferrera, which became a worldwide smash following its cancellation in 2010.</p> <p>Ferrera, who played the show\u2019s titular character, an unlikely fashion intern, paid tribute to Horta on Instagram. The actor said she was \u201cstunned and heartbroken to hear the devastating news\u201d, adding that Horta\u2019s \u201ctalent and creativity brought me and so many others such joy and light\u201d. Elsewhere, Williams, who played the role of fearsome editor Wilhelmina Slater, added that his \u201ccreativity and passion will be missed by so many of us that worked with him. May he Rest In Peace\u201d. Michael Urie, who played Slater\u2019s personal assistant Marc, commented that Horta had \u201c[broken] barriers and saved lives. Losing him is hard \u2026 I hear from LGBTQ people all the time that the show helped them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Cg9OehJkj/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "The Boeing 737-800 model used by Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) that crashed in Tehran on Wednesday is the most popular aircraft in the sky, used by airlines from Ryanair to American Airlines. Boeing\u2019s short-haul workhorse is the predecessor to the 737 Max, the model that was grounded after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. The 737-800, a single-aisle aircraft that can carry 189 passengers, was launched in September 1994 as part of the 737 Next Generation (737 NG) lineup. As of February 2019 more than 4,900 had been delivered, although it has been superseded by the 737 Max, the US manufacturer\u2019s fastest-selling model. More recently some Boeing 737-800 planes have had safety issues, with groundings caused by cracks between the wing and fuselage in the so-called \u201cpickle fork\u201d structure. The UIA plane had taken off from Imam Khomeini international airport in the Iranian capital when a fire struck one of its engines, said Qassem Biniaz, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s road and transportation ministry. The pilot of the aircraft then lost control of the plane, sending it crashing to the ground, Biniaz was quoted as saying by the state-run Irna news agency. However, Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Iran dropped an initial reference to engine failure as the cause of a Ukrainian plane crash outside Tehran on Wednesday. It said in a second statement that the causes had not been disclosed and that any previous comments were not official. All Boeing 737 NG planes use CFM56 engines manufactured by CFM, a joint venture between the US manufacturer General Electric and the French manufacturer Safran. The engines are also used on Airbus planes, including the A320. There are more than 8,000 CFM56 engines in service on 737 aircraft worldwide, making it the most popular engine-aircraft combination in commercial aviation, according to the joint venture\u2019s website. Last month CFM said the engines had completed a billion flight hours, the first engine family to do so. Boeing said: \u201cThis is a tragic event and our heartfelt thoughts are with the crew, passengers and their families. We are in contact with our airline customer and stand by them in this difficult time. We are ready to assist in any way needed.\u201d A GE spokesman said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the loss of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752. We extend heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of those on board.\u201d In a statement, UIA said: \u201cUIA expresses its deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the air crash and will do everything possible to support the relatives of the victims.\u201d The location of the crash \u2013 Iran \u2013 could complicate the investigation, according to the consultant air crash investigator Tony Cable. The country in which a crash occurs usually carries out the investigation, while the airline\u2019s home country and those of the plane and engine manufacturer were also entitled to send representatives, he said. This may be complicated by the tensions between the US and Iran after the assassination of Qassem Suleimani, a senior Iranian general. Although it was too early to ascertain the cause of the crash, the findings could potentially affect the recertification of the 737 Max, which has a similar design, Cable added. The 737-800 has been involved in a number of fatal accidents over its long period of service. One of the most recent fatal incidents involving a 737-800 occurred in September 2018, when a flight by the Papua New Guinea airline Air Niugini undershot the runway at Chuuk airport in Micronesia and landed in a lagoon. One of the 47 occupants died. In March 2016 a FlyDubai flight from Dubai to the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don crashed while attempting to land. All 62 people on board died. In January 2010 an Ethiopian Airlines flight to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa crashed into the Mediterranean Sea shortly after takeoff from Beirut Rafic Hariri airport, killing 90. In 2007 a Kenya Airways flight carrying 115 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Douala, Cameroon, on a flight to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, with no survivors. The Ukraine crash comes during a crisis period for Boeing. The 737 Max has been grounded worldwide since March after two crashes in which everyone onboard died. The UIA crash comes less than a year after the second of those, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302. The grounding eventually prompted Boeing to fire its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, who had faced criticism over his handling of the crisis. His replacement, former Boeing chair David Calhoun, was due to take over formally as chief executive on 13 January. Safran has been contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Carlos Ghosn is to make his first public appearance since his extraordinary escape from Japan, where he faced charges of financial misconduct while chairman of Nissan. Ghosn became the world\u2019s most famous fugitive after he boarded a private jet from Japan \u2013 reportedly via a bullet train and inside a large case for audio equipment \u2013 to Turkey and on to Lebanon on 29 December. At a highly anticipated press conference due to be held in Beirut on Wednesday afternoon, speculation is growing that he will divulge details of his escape and flesh out claims that he was the victim of a \u201ccoup\u201d by former colleagues determined to wreck his plans to merge Nissan and Renault. Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business said Ghosn had told her over the weekend that he has \u201cactual evidence\u201d and documents proving there was a plot to \u201ctake him out\u201d in response to his plan to merge the Japanese and French automakers. There is also the mouthwatering prospect that Ghosn, who consistently denied the charges throughout his detention and while out on bail, will name Japanese government officials he claims worked with Nissan executives to oust him, two decades after he rescued the company from near bankruptcy. The former auto tycoon has yet to publicly back those allegations with evidence. Dozens of local and international journalists are expected to attend the press conference at Lebanon\u2019s press syndicate headquarters. Lebanese authorities have not commented on Ghosn\u2019s first public appearance since he fled Japan and it was not immediately clear if they planned to summon him for questioning. Ghosn, too, will face unprecedented public scrutiny over his professional conduct, namely allegations that he under-reported his salary and used Nissan money for private investments and to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees to his elder sister Claudine. Having argued that his arrest was proof that the Japanese justice system was guilty of double standards, he may be pressed to divulge if other Nissan executives should have been arrested along with him. He may also be asked to explain why, having proved Nissan\u2019s saviour in the late 1990s, he was unable to convince sceptics that a merger with Renault was in its interests. Aspects of his personal life may also be called into question, including the absence of a single Nissan executive \u2013 and only two from Renault \u2013 at a lavish party he and his wife, Carole, hosted at Versailles in 2014 to mark the 15th anniversary of the Renault-Nissan alliance. Ghosn will speak hours after prosecutors attempted to raid the offices of his legal team in Tokyo to seize a computer to which Ghosn had limited access while out on bail. His lawyers, however, refused to hand over the computer, citing attorney-client confidentiality. Japanese media reports said prosecutors believe the computer may contain details of Ghosn\u2019s escape, which has caused severe embarrassment to the country\u2019s authorities and prompted a review of security at its airports. \u201cTokyo district prosecutors came to our office with a warrant to seize items used by Mr Ghosn such as a computer,\u201d the defence team said in a statement. \u201cIn light of attorney-client confidentiality obligations, we exercised the right to refuse the seizure, as permitted under Article 105 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and asked them to leave without entering our office.\u201d Ghosn has said little publicly since he fled to Lebanon, where he holds citizenship and spent part of his childhood. In a statement released soon after his arrival, the 65-year-old, who also has Brazilian and French citizenship, said he had escaped to avoid political persecution by Japan\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d justice system.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A climate change risk assessment would be undertaken for all sectors, followed by a national adaptation program setting out how each sector needed to adapt to the effects of climate change that are already occurring. This includes higher temperatures, extended and hotter bushfire seasons, extended drought and floods.</p> \n<p>Steggall is also proposing an independent expert body to replace the \u201cpowerless\u201d Climate Change Authority, similar to the UK\u2019s committee on climate change, which would advise on climate policy and report annually to parliament.</p> \n<p>She said the framework legislation was not \u201cprescriptive\u201d and would allow flexibility for whichever party was in government to determine the best way to reduce emissions.</p> \n<p>But she said it would demonstrate that Australia had a plan to decarbonise.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is nothing here that is outrageous, it is just setting that long-term goal of where we are heading and setting a framework of how we achieve it,\u201d she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/craig-kelly-interview-piers-morgan-calls-mp-disgraceful-for-denying-climate-link-to-bushfires\">Craig Kelly interview: senior government MPs distance themselves after Piers Morgan lashing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>She said the bushfire crisis had forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/pm-scott-morrison-defends-climate-policies-and-asks-australians-to-be-patient-over-fires\">Scott Morrison to acknowledge the role being played by climate change</a> and there was a \u201cstrong public view that more needs to be done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Steggall has already begun talking to other independents about the legislation.</p> \n<p>The Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie said she would support the bill, and called on moderate Liberals to do the same.</p> \n<p>\u201cWords are one thing but many members on the government side campaigned at the last election that they were supportive of more action on climate,\u201d Sharkie said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey called themselves modern Liberals, it\u2019s now time to put those words into action.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is going to need a whole-of-parliament approach in order to change what has been a 10-year policy vacuum in this place.

      "bodyText": "The independent MP Zali Steggall is calling on self-styled \u201cmodern Liberals\u201d to support legislation to establish a new climate change framework, warning them to ignore the views of their constituents \u201cat their peril\u201d. Steggall, who toppled Tony Abbott in the Sydney seat of Warringah at the May 2019 election, largely on a platform of climate change action, is finalising draft legislation for a \u201cnational climate change framework\u201d that sets out a roadmap for Australia to transition to a decarbonised economy. The legislation is modelled on the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act, passed in 2008, and mirrors framework laws in place in New Zealand and Ireland. Germany and Fiji are considering similar draft legislation. Steggall aims to begin consultation on the draft bill later this month, and wants to introduce legislation in March, backed by a public campaign calling for a conscience vote in parliament. Steggall would not reveal full details of the planned public campaign, but said she hoped it would be a similar \u201cpeople-powered\u201d movement to the same-sex marriage campaign that successfully galvanised support for a yes vote. \u201cMy goal is to make sure all the people worried about bushfires and climate change, and drought and planning and agriculture in regional areas, and air pollution in urban areas \u2013 that they all be aware that this is on the table, and that this is an opportunity,\u201d Steggall told Guardian Australia. Steggall successfully secured more than $1m in donations for her campaign to oust Abbott, and has connections to wealthy progressive benefactors. She said so-called modern Liberals, such as Dave Sharma in Wentworth, Tim Wilson in Goldstein and Jason Falinski in Mackellar, should ensure they put the interests of their electorate first and consider crossing the floor if the government opposed the bill as expected. \u201cI think they have to be mindful of their electorates feeling disenfranchised if they aren\u2019t voting in accordance with their majority wishes,\u201d Steggall said. \u201cThe Liberal party is the party of the free vote \u2013 I am not asking them to do something they have never done before, and I think crossing the floor to vote for a climate act is something they need to do to represent their constituents. \u201cIf you choose to ignore the amount of people in your electorate [who want stronger climate action] \u2026 you do so at your peril.\u201d Under Steggall\u2019s bill, a statutory long-term target of net zero emissions by 2050 would be set, requiring five-yearly economy-wide carbon budgets to meet the goal. A climate change risk assessment would be undertaken for all sectors, followed by a national adaptation program setting out how each sector needed to adapt to the effects of climate change that are already occurring. This includes higher temperatures, extended and hotter bushfire seasons, extended drought and floods. Steggall is also proposing an independent expert body to replace the \u201cpowerless\u201d Climate Change Authority, similar to the UK\u2019s committee on climate change, which would advise on climate policy and report annually to parliament. She said the framework legislation was not \u201cprescriptive\u201d and would allow flexibility for whichever party was in government to determine the best way to reduce emissions. But she said it would demonstrate that Australia had a plan to decarbonise. \u201cThere is nothing here that is outrageous, it is just setting that long-term goal of where we are heading and setting a framework of how we achieve it,\u201d she said. She said the bushfire crisis had forced Scott Morrison to acknowledge the role being played by climate change and there was a \u201cstrong public view that more needs to be done\u201d. Steggall has already begun talking to other independents about the legislation. The Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie said she would support the bill, and called on moderate Liberals to do the same. \u201cWords are one thing but many members on the government side campaigned at the last election that they were supportive of more action on climate,\u201d Sharkie said. \u201cThey called themselves modern Liberals, it\u2019s now time to put those words into action. \u201cThis is going to need a whole-of-parliament approach in order to change what has been a 10-year policy vacuum in this place. I am right behind Zali on this.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It took the Doors\u2019 drummer, John Densmore, three years to visit the grave of his bandmate Jim Morrison after he was found dead in a Paris bathtub in 1971. He didn\u2019t even go to the funeral. \u201cDid I hate Jim?\u201d Densmore pauses, although he is not obviously alarmed by the question. \u201cNo. I hated his self-destruction \u2026 He was a kamikaze who went out at 27 \u2013 what can I say?\u201d</p> <p>Quite a lot, it transpires. Morrison was a man who was spectacularly good at being a rock star \u2013 a lithe figure in leather trousers, prophesying about death, sex and magic on some of the biggest hits of the 1960s \u2013 Light My Fire, Break on Through and Hello, I Love You. But he was catastrophically bad at the rest of life. Like many alcoholics, he could be reckless, selfish and mercurial. \u201cThe Dionysian madman,\u201d Densmore has called him \u2013 a \u201cpsychopath\u201d, a \u201clunatic\u201d and \u201cthe voice that struck terror in me\u201d. He had lobbied to get Morrison off the road before his death, and even quit the band at one point. \u201cSome people wanted to keep shovelling coal in the engine and I was like: \u2018Wait a minute. So what if we have one less album? Maybe he\u2019ll live?\u2019\u201d Why did he carry on? \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t mature enough to say that at the time. I wasn\u2019t trying to enable him. It was another era. I used to answer the question: \u2018If Jim was around today, would he be clean and sober?\u2019 with a \u2018no\u2019. Kamikaze drunk. Now I\u2019ve changed my mind. Of course he would be sober. Why wouldn\u2019t he be? He was smart.\u201d</p> <p>Densmore, 75, is a defiant survivor of the music scene he helped build. This, perhaps, is why, in the decades since Morrison\u2019s death, he has become not only one of the great chroniclers of the Doors, but the fiercest protector of Morrison\u2019s legacy. To anyone who has read Densmore\u2019s 1990 memoir \u2013 a book he says was \u201cwritten in blood\u201d \u2013 this may come as a surprise; later the book would form the basis for Oliver Stone\u2019s (dreadful) Doors biopic. \u201cIt took me years to forgive Jim,\u201d Densmore says. \u201cAnd now I miss him so much for his artistry.\u201d</p> <p>Next month, a documentary about another of his bandmates, the keyboardist Ray Manzarek, who died in 2013, will be released. Manzarek\u2019s relationship with Densmore was not smooth either. From the early 2000s, they were embroiled in a vicious six-year legal battle in which Densmore tried to stop Manzarek and the band\u2019s guitarist, Robby Krieger, from touring under the Doors name as well as selling the band\u2019s music for use on a Cadillac commercial. \u201cI know. I sued my bandmates \u2013 am I CRAZY?!\u201d he yells. People certainly thought he was. It is not usual to spend years in court trying to stop yourself from earning millions of dollars to prove a point about the value of artistic integrity over the pursuit of money. \u201cWhat can I say? Jim\u2019s ghost is behind me all the time,\u201d Densmore says. \u201cMy knees were shaking pretty strong when they upped the offer of $5m (\u00a33.8m) to $15m. But my head was saying: Break on Through for a gas-guzzling SUV? No!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10821c874b58e6757459a975e7ea50d05f15ba74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10821c874b58e6757459a975e7ea50d05f15ba74/98_0_2895_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Doors: Jim Morrison, John Densmore, Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Doors: Jim Morrison, John Densmore, Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of Edmund Teske/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Manzarek and Krieger\u2019s lawyers tried to paint Densmore as a dangerous communist \u2013 even citing a piece he wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/aug/12/artspolicy.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">that was published in the Guardian</a> as evidence for this \u2013 but eventually, and spectacularly, he won.

The pair became friends during the court case \u2013 Petty\u2019s song Money Becomes King, about a singer he once idolised who was selling his songs for a light beer advert, struck home with Densmore. \u201cHe had trouble with his hip. I guess he was taking painkillers and brown powder, too. Damn it \u2026\u201d he breathes deeply. \u201cI just ache losing him.\u201d He pauses. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s more noble to die in a friggin\u2019 hospital with a bunch of tubes up your arm. I mean, it sounds horrible, but at least you rode the train all the way to the end \u2013 you never checked out early.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was shocked when heroin became popular. Even Jim knew heroin was a serious drug</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Densmore grew up in the west LA suburbs. He was a gifted drummer from an early age, starting out in the high school marching band (an activity that in those days \u201cranked next to having leprosy\u201d he once wrote). College put him on to jazz, and he worshipped at the altar of Coltrane and Davis. He was 21 when he met Morrison, who was tall, bookish and handsome. \u201cI\u2019m not into guys, but he looked like Michelangelo\u2019s David,\u201d he says. They had met through Manzarek, a friend of Morrison\u2019s from UCLA film school, at a transcendental meditation workshop run by the guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He took up meditation, he says, because he couldn\u2019t take acid all the time and liked the \u201cseparate reality\u201d meditation offered. \u201cWhen we took LSD, it was legal. We were street scientists exploring the mind. I experimented with cocaine during the 70s and 80s. But it wasn\u2019t my drug of choice. Ugh \u2026 drug. I hate that word. I was shocked when heroin became popular. Even Jim knew heroin was a serious drug. Heroin tried to make you forget everything. It scared me. So I stayed away.\u201d</p> <p>Compared with his bandmates, Densmore was a square. He wasn\u2019t the film-school/literary type. He couldn\u2019t understand Morrison\u2019s obsession with Nietzsche (\u201cWhy would anyone want to read a whole book of such double talk?\u201d he wrote); when Manzarek suggested he watch the Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut film The 400 Blows, he ran out and got it, thinking it was The 400 Blowjobs. \u201cAdolescence!\u201d he laughs. At times, he was envious of the attention Morrison got \u2013 particularly from women. \u201cSure, I was jealous. I\u2019d been a teenage drummer with acne. I remember thinking: \u2018Why is Jim\u2019s face so big?\u2019 on the cover of our first album, The Doors. Probably because it wouldn\u2019t have sold a lot of copies if it were my face!\u201d</p> <p>While he may not have been the centrepiece of the group, there is no doubt Densmore was pivotal to the band\u2019s sound. It is hard to imagine Break on Through without his shimmying bossa nova rhythm, or LA Woman \u2013 a song that pulses with the hum of a hot California night \u2013 without the cascading drum break that makes way for Morrison\u2019s growls of \u201cMR MOJO RISIN\u2019\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5f6eef80ee66931e18f5f7faafb59bdb1c44869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5f6eef80ee66931e18f5f7faafb59bdb1c44869/0_0_3060_1837/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Densmore in the 60s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Densmore in the 60s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Copi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as he toured the world with the Doors, Densmore\u2019s family life became more unsteady. His brother had several stints in a psychiatric hospital. He describes going to visit him, finding him heavily sedated, and wondering how sleeping for 17 hours a day could possibly help his schizophrenia \u2013 a point that will be familiar even now to anyone who has had to endure acute mental illness. His brother killed himself in 1978. He was also called Jim; he also died at the age of 27. Densmore later wrote that he struggled handling sharp objects after his brother\u2019s suicide. \u201cI thought that if I did it, too, it would somehow make it better \u2013 atone for not saving him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy sister got angry at me for writing about it,\u201d he says. \u201cFor revealing the family secret. Our brother killed himself and back then it wasn\u2019t talked about. And I apologised. I said I was sorry. I said: \u2018I know it hurts, but I also want you to read these letters I\u2019ve got from fans who say they wanted to commit suicide and didn\u2019t because of this book.\u2019 And that\u2019s why it\u2019s there. Because, as difficult as it is, it\u2019s healing to get this stuff out on the table.\u201d</p> <p>Densmore made more music after the Doors split in 1973, and then turned his hand to acting and dance. But it was grief, it is clear, that drove him to the written word. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. I got Cs in English at school. I hated it. But now I want to be a writer and I\u2019m voracious for new vocabulary and new ideas. I like connecting new synapses. Like Jim Morrison did. I do sort of feel as if I\u2019m channelling his passion for life.\u201d He stops. \u201cActually, not for life \u2013 as I said, he was a kamikaze who went out at 27. But I want to set an example.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6a86f05ff0d68a6714fb3e1c05aed46eb922272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a86f05ff0d68a6714fb3e1c05aed46eb922272/1_83_3110_1866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Maclachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon and Val Kilmer in Oliver Stone\u2019s The Doors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Maclachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon and Val Kilmer in Oliver Stone\u2019s The Doors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Densmore\u2019s writing about Morrison often reads as if it were done by someone who has survived an abusive relationship, such was the terror he felt around Morrison towards the end. \u201cOn the outside, Jim seemed normal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut he had an aggressiveness toward life and women.\u201d One such incident was early in their friendship when he went to pick Morrison up from a woman\u2019s house and found him brandishing a knife at her while holding her hand behind her back. At the time, Densmore did nothing because he was worried that if anyone found out about Morrison, the band \u2013 and his own career \u2013 would be over. What does he make of this now? \u201cI was really young,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out whether they were lovers, friends or enemies. I just felt like I needed to get out of there.\u201d Would he have acted differently if it happened today? \u201cYeah, I would say: \u2018What the fuck are you guys doing? Please take it down a few notches here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is also an anecdote in his memoir, one that makes it into the Stone film, too, in which Morrison\u2019s partner Pamela Courson is brought into the vocal booth and asked to perform oral sex on the singer while he is recording the track Lost Little Girl. \u201cUrgh,\u201d he groans, when I bring it up. How does it make him feel? \u201cNot so good. I mean, I don\u2019t think he \u2026 Well, yeah \u2026 See, I\u2019m at a loss for words. SEXIST, what can I say?\u201d How did it feel at the time, when the whole band was there, seeing it happen from afar? \u201cWell, you know, it didn\u2019t really happen. They were just sort of kissing, and then she left.\u201d</p> <p>So it didn\u2019t happen?</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s odd, I say, because Stone creates a scene out of it in his film. \u201cOh, my goodness. Well, you know, Hollywood movies are an impressionistic painting of the truth,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Later in the interview, we go back to this point. \u201cI\u2019m a little nervous that I\u2019ve said stupid things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut life is messy.\u201d It is true \u2013 if you have lived as many lives as Densmore, seen generations change and shift, there is no doubt that what was acceptable 50 years ago is no longer so.</p> <p>Densmore\u2019s next book will be about his meetings with musicians. \u201cEach chapter is about a different artist who has fed me artistically,\u201d he says. It will go from his time learning to play the tabla with Ravi Shankar to his adoration for Patti Smith to the time he met Bob Marley. \u201cWriting is a little easier on a 75-year-old,\u201d he says. \u201cI gotta pace myself. No disrespect to Jim and his 27 years, but I\u2019ve been in it for the long run.\u201d He will also get married this year \u201cfor the hundredth time\u201d (it is his fourth time), to his partner of 13 years, the painter and photographer Ildiko Von Somogyi. \u201cI guess I believe in the institution,\u201d he laughs. He is proud he has found another career after music. \u201cYou want to have a bunch of lives,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd life does go on \u2013 if you stay vital.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Doors: Break on Thru - A Celebration of Ray Manzarek will be in cinemas worldwide on 12 February.

They had met through Manzarek, a friend of Morrison\u2019s from UCLA film school, at a transcendental meditation workshop run by the guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He took up meditation, he says, because he couldn\u2019t take acid all the time and liked the \u201cseparate reality\u201d meditation offered. \u201cWhen we took LSD, it was legal. We were street scientists exploring the mind. I experimented with cocaine during the 70s and 80s. But it wasn\u2019t my drug of choice. Ugh \u2026 drug. I hate that word. I was shocked when heroin became popular. Even Jim knew heroin was a serious drug. Heroin tried to make you forget everything. It scared me. So I stayed away.\u201d Compared with his bandmates, Densmore was a square. He wasn\u2019t the film-school/literary type. He couldn\u2019t understand Morrison\u2019s obsession with Nietzsche (\u201cWhy would anyone want to read a whole book of such double talk?\u201d he wrote); when Manzarek suggested he watch the Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut film The 400 Blows, he ran out and got it, thinking it was The 400 Blowjobs. \u201cAdolescence!\u201d he laughs. At times, he was envious of the attention Morrison got \u2013 particularly from women. \u201cSure, I was jealous. I\u2019d been a teenage drummer with acne. I remember thinking: \u2018Why is Jim\u2019s face so big?\u2019 on the cover of our first album, The Doors. Probably because it wouldn\u2019t have sold a lot of copies if it were my face!\u201d While he may not have been the centrepiece of the group, there is no doubt Densmore was pivotal to the band\u2019s sound. It is hard to imagine Break on Through without his shimmying bossa nova rhythm, or LA Woman \u2013 a song that pulses with the hum of a hot California night \u2013 without the cascading drum break that makes way for Morrison\u2019s growls of \u201cMR MOJO RISIN\u2019\u201d. But as he toured the world with the Doors, Densmore\u2019s family life became more unsteady. His brother had several stints in a psychiatric hospital. He describes going to visit him, finding him heavily sedated, and wondering how sleeping for 17 hours a day could possibly help his schizophrenia \u2013 a point that will be familiar even now to anyone who has had to endure acute mental illness. His brother killed himself in 1978. He was also called Jim; he also died at the age of 27. Densmore later wrote that he struggled handling sharp objects after his brother\u2019s suicide. \u201cI thought that if I did it, too, it would somehow make it better \u2013 atone for not saving him.\u201d \u201cMy sister got angry at me for writing about it,\u201d he says. \u201cFor revealing the family secret. Our brother killed himself and back then it wasn\u2019t talked about. And I apologised. I said I was sorry. I said: \u2018I know it hurts, but I also want you to read these letters I\u2019ve got from fans who say they wanted to commit suicide and didn\u2019t because of this book.\u2019 And that\u2019s why it\u2019s there. Because, as difficult as it is, it\u2019s healing to get this stuff out on the table.\u201d Densmore made more music after the Doors split in 1973, and then turned his hand to acting and dance. But it was grief, it is clear, that drove him to the written word. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. I got Cs in English at school. I hated it. But now I want to be a writer and I\u2019m voracious for new vocabulary and new ideas. I like connecting new synapses. Like Jim Morrison did. I do sort of feel as if I\u2019m channelling his passion for life.\u201d He stops. \u201cActually, not for life \u2013 as I said, he was a kamikaze who went out at 27. But I want to set an example.\u201d Densmore\u2019s writing about Morrison often reads as if it were done by someone who has survived an abusive relationship, such was the terror he felt around Morrison towards the end. \u201cOn the outside, Jim seemed normal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut he had an aggressiveness toward life and women.\u201d One such incident was early in their friendship when he went to pick Morrison up from a woman\u2019s house and found him brandishing a knife at her while holding her hand behind her back. At the time, Densmore did nothing because he was worried that if anyone found out about Morrison, the band \u2013 and his own career \u2013 would be over. What does he make of this now? \u201cI was really young,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out whether they were lovers, friends or enemies. I just felt like I needed to get out of there.\u201d Would he have acted differently if it happened today? \u201cYeah, I would say: \u2018What the fuck are you guys doing? Please take it down a few notches here.\u2019\u201d There is also an anecdote in his memoir, one that makes it into the Stone film, too, in which Morrison\u2019s partner Pamela Courson is brought into the vocal booth and asked to perform oral sex on the singer while he is recording the track Lost Little Girl. \u201cUrgh,\u201d he groans, when I bring it up. How does it make him feel? \u201cNot so good. I mean, I don\u2019t think he \u2026 Well, yeah \u2026 See, I\u2019m at a loss for words. SEXIST, what can I say?\u201d How did it feel at the time, when the whole band was there, seeing it happen from afar? \u201cWell, you know, it didn\u2019t really happen. They were just sort of kissing, and then she left.\u201d So it didn\u2019t happen? \u201cNo.\u201d That\u2019s odd, I say, because Stone creates a scene out of it in his film. \u201cOh, my goodness. Well, you know, Hollywood movies are an impressionistic painting of the truth,\u201d he says. Later in the interview, we go back to this point. \u201cI\u2019m a little nervous that I\u2019ve said stupid things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut life is messy.\u201d It is true \u2013 if you have lived as many lives as Densmore, seen generations change and shift, there is no doubt that what was acceptable 50 years ago is no longer so. Densmore\u2019s next book will be about his meetings with musicians. \u201cEach chapter is about a different artist who has fed me artistically,\u201d he says. It will go from his time learning to play the tabla with Ravi Shankar to his adoration for Patti Smith to the time he met Bob Marley. \u201cWriting is a little easier on a 75-year-old,\u201d he says. \u201cI gotta pace myself. No disrespect to Jim and his 27 years, but I\u2019ve been in it for the long run.\u201d He will also get married this year \u201cfor the hundredth time\u201d (it is his fourth time), to his partner of 13 years, the painter and photographer Ildiko Von Somogyi. \u201cI guess I believe in the institution,\u201d he laughs. He is proud he has found another career after music. \u201cYou want to have a bunch of lives,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd life does go on \u2013 if you stay vital.\u201d The Doors: Break on Thru - A Celebration of Ray Manzarek will be in cinemas worldwide on 12 February.

      "body": "<p>In the autumn of 1940, as the Luftwaffe made its daily death runs over the south coast and on to London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf\" title=\"\">Virginia Woolf</a> started drafting the outlines of a new book. Provisionally titled <em>Reading at Random</em>, it was to be a history of the creative impulse, of the expression of emotion as refracted through the idea of England \u2013 an alternative England, shaped not by the exploits of its statesmen and soldiers but its artists and communities. Women so far, she observed in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/05/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-45-a-room-of-ones-own-by-virginia-woolf-shakespeares-sister-seton-beton\" title=\"\">A Room of One\u2019s Own</a></em>, had appeared only \u201cas a glimpse ... in the lives of the great, whisking away into the background, concealing \u2026 a wink, a laugh, perhaps a tear\u201d, but that was not for want of ability or something to say. Woolf was determined her new history (it was never published) would take into account \u201cthe immense effect of environment and suggestion upon the mind\u201d. It would thus, Francesca Wade points out in her new book, allow women to take centre stage.</p> <p><em>Square Haunting</em>, which tells the lives of five women at a time when each of them lived on Mecklenburgh Square, in Bloomsbury, initially seems nothing like as ambitious a project, especially as only one of the women, the social and economic historian Eileen Power, lived there for more than a year or two. But through this conceit of time and place, Wade somehow funnels accounts of modernist poetry and prose, as well as Russian and German Jewish intellectual refugees, ancient Greek scholarship, medieval economics, the League of Nations, Chinese art and imperial decline, Grand Guignol, Freud, the October revolution, the BBC\u2019s educational lectures, a history of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/londonschoolofeconomics\" title=\"\">London School of Economics</a>, the rise of nazism, and a sympathetic portrait of a teddy bear. In the process she both reframes half a century of supposedly familiar literary and intellectual history and illustrates everything Woolf meant by \u201ca room of one\u2019s own\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335e98bcd089924426a6dfef9799af866c324c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335e98bcd089924426a6dfef9799af866c324c1d/0_380_3896_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rewriting history \u2026 Virginia Woolf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rewriting history \u2026 Virginia Woolf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GL Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had to GET AWAY to make good,\u201d the poet and novelist Hilda Doolittle, or HD, wrote to her life-partner Bryher, having left Philadelphia for Europe in 1911, and fetched up five years later in a room on the square: \u201cCan you see how London at least left me <em>free</em>?\u201d The future crime writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dorothylsayers\" title=\"\">Dorothy L Sayers</a> took the same room four years later, just after she became part of the first cohort of women to graduate from Oxford. It lacked electric light, and curtains, but \u201cis a beautiful big room\u201d, she wrote to a friend. \u201cThe landlady is a curious, eccentric-looking person with short hair \u2026 and thoroughly understands that one wants to be quite independent.\u201d The linguist, translator and classicist Jane Ellen Harrison arrived at 11 Mecklenburgh Street in 1926. She was 76, but this too was a new beginning, far from the Cambridge colleges where she had felt belittled and constrained. Historian Eileen Power lived at 20 Mecklenburgh Square, which became the joyfully glamorous centre of a kind of alternative Bloomsbury, full of social reformers, economists and would-be politicians. She thought conventional wifeliness nothing but a \u201cjudicious mixture of a cow, a muffler, a mirror. A lump of plasticine, a doormat and a vacuum, and algebraically indicated by a negative\u201d, and went to great lengths to avoid it.

      "bodyText": "In the autumn of 1940, as the Luftwaffe made its daily death runs over the south coast and on to London, Virginia Woolf started drafting the outlines of a new book. Provisionally titled Reading at Random, it was to be a history of the creative impulse, of the expression of emotion as refracted through the idea of England \u2013 an alternative England, shaped not by the exploits of its statesmen and soldiers but its artists and communities. Women so far, she observed in A Room of One\u2019s Own, had appeared only \u201cas a glimpse ... in the lives of the great, whisking away into the background, concealing \u2026 a wink, a laugh, perhaps a tear\u201d, but that was not for want of ability or something to say. Woolf was determined her new history (it was never published) would take into account \u201cthe immense effect of environment and suggestion upon the mind\u201d. It would thus, Francesca Wade points out in her new book, allow women to take centre stage. Square Haunting, which tells the lives of five women at a time when each of them lived on Mecklenburgh Square, in Bloomsbury, initially seems nothing like as ambitious a project, especially as only one of the women, the social and economic historian Eileen Power, lived there for more than a year or two. But through this conceit of time and place, Wade somehow funnels accounts of modernist poetry and prose, as well as Russian and German Jewish intellectual refugees, ancient Greek scholarship, medieval economics, the League of Nations, Chinese art and imperial decline, Grand Guignol, Freud, the October revolution, the BBC\u2019s educational lectures, a history of the London School of Economics, the rise of nazism, and a sympathetic portrait of a teddy bear. In the process she both reframes half a century of supposedly familiar literary and intellectual history and illustrates everything Woolf meant by \u201ca room of one\u2019s own\u201d. \u201cI had to GET AWAY to make good,\u201d the poet and novelist Hilda Doolittle, or HD, wrote to her life-partner Bryher, having left Philadelphia for Europe in 1911, and fetched up five years later in a room on the square: \u201cCan you see how London at least left me free?\u201d The future crime writer Dorothy L Sayers took the same room four years later, just after she became part of the first cohort of women to graduate from Oxford. It lacked electric light, and curtains, but \u201cis a beautiful big room\u201d, she wrote to a friend. \u201cThe landlady is a curious, eccentric-looking person with short hair \u2026 and thoroughly understands that one wants to be quite independent.\u201d The linguist, translator and classicist Jane Ellen Harrison arrived at 11 Mecklenburgh Street in 1926. She was 76, but this too was a new beginning, far from the Cambridge colleges where she had felt belittled and constrained. Historian Eileen Power lived at 20 Mecklenburgh Square, which became the joyfully glamorous centre of a kind of alternative Bloomsbury, full of social reformers, economists and would-be politicians. She thought conventional wifeliness nothing but a \u201cjudicious mixture of a cow, a muffler, a mirror. A lump of plasticine, a doormat and a vacuum, and algebraically indicated by a negative\u201d, and went to great lengths to avoid it. Woolf took up residence in 37 Mecklenburgh Square in August 1939 with her husband, Leonard, and their Hogarth Press. She is the only one for whom the move was not an overt existential statement: they were escaping building work at their home in nearby Tavistock Square. The women\u2019s characters and situations leap off the page, helped by the kind of details \u2013 from interior decor to what they wore \u2013 that bring prose alive. Such observations are also political.

It is a measure of their vividness, and the depth of Wade\u2019s research, that these figures far outshine TS Eliot, DH Lawrence, Freud and Keynes, who while secondary characters in this story, are more accustomed to the limelight.

Alex Greenwood played for Everton and Liverpool, then Manchester United (along with six other Liverpool players who moved there), before joining Lyon.</p> <p>So why has Mitchell\u2019s move hit a nerve?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/06/still-fledgling-w-league-remains-prone-to-climate-disruption\">Still-fledgling W-League remains prone to climate disruption | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a way it is as a result of successful moves to grow the women\u2019s game. The Football Association and clubs have used local derbies synonymous with the men\u2019s game to drive interest and attendances. With 18- to-34-year-old men identified as the biggest growth in attendees at women\u2019s matches, finding hooks to pull them in has been a focus. So we have had the showpieces: the 31,213 for the first Manchester derby of the Women\u2019s Super League era; 23,000 for Everton\u2019s win at Anfield; 38,262 for Arsenal\u2019s defeat of Tottenham at the new Tottenham stadium; 24,564 for Spurs\u2019 WSL debut against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Clubs have launched \u201cone club\u201d campaigns to drive fans to support every player that pulls on a shirt for any of their teams. The media have helped to drive the narrative with derby headlines, the tensions thrust to the fore. It is a part of growing the game, building hype, getting people emotionally invested.</p> <p>It is a good strategy. But it is hard to transfer the rivalries. Animosity takes time, and history builds rivalries. Arsenal have 15 top-division titles, whereas Tottenham are in their maiden WSL season. Before this campaign their previous two meetings were a 6-0 pre-season win and a 10-0 victory in the FA Cup in 2017 for Arsenal.</p> <p>The clubs are rivals, the women\u2019s teams are not. The same goes for Manchester City, who finished last season with a domestic cup double, and Manchester United, who were promoted to the WSL at the first attempt. United\u2019s arrival and investment mean they are climbing fast but, for now, they are not title rivals.</p> <p>The risk with promoting these games as big acrimonious encounters is that they become too one-sided and fans are put off. Luckily the big-stadium games have had narrow margins, with the underdogs rising to the occasion.</p> <p>The history is being built but we are in a transition period.</p> <p>Historically, women\u2019s football has seen fans cross the divide by supporting a different team to their men\u2019s side. It sounds strange, but for fans of clubs who didn\u2019t have a women\u2019s team or had a underfunded one, they found a home in the women\u2019s game at a rival club. A long-term women\u2019s football follower who supports Chelsea\u2019s men may well support Arsenal\u2019s women. That is an increasingly rare breed as clubs throw their weight behind their women\u2019s teams, but for a significant period it was only really Arsenal, of London\u2019s Premier League clubs, who invested in and cared about their women\u2019s team and thus had the best players.</p> <p>With the growth and professionalism uneven and the women\u2019s game unable to set up players for life in the way the men\u2019s game does, it is hard to criticise transfers that seemingly go against the grain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f64a43484a23ab3fd2c4bb6c728482854ea252f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f64a43484a23ab3fd2c4bb6c728482854ea252f/345_228_3255_1953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Mitchell celebrates after scoring for Arsenal against Bristol City in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Mitchell celebrates after scoring for Arsenal against Bristol City in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Ellis/TGS Photo/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mitchell has been barely playing. She has made 119 appearances for Arsenal since 2013, the fifth-highest in the club\u2019s current squad, but has only three starts and five substitute appearances for them this term. The Scot sat out a significant portion of last season as she struggled with her mental health.</p> <p>Arsenal\u2019s manager, Joe Montemurro, explained in pre-season why he doesn\u2019t like having players too far down the pecking order. \u201cContinuity is important,\u201d he said. \u201cRotation is a bit of a false thing because it doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019re asking a player who\u2019s not always involved to come in for that game knowing that they\u2019re going to be out for the next game. I don\u2019t want to have that; I want everyone to feel that they\u2019ve got an opportunity, that they\u2019re close, that they are one bad game away from being in there, one training session away from from being in there. And that keeps the stimulus high, that keeps the level high, that keeps the the attitude high.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell\u2019s chances of making Phil Neville\u2019s Team GB squad for the Olympics are extremely slim and her club options are also narrow. There are only 12 teams in the fully professional WSL and the level of professionalism between them varies dramatically.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may be easy for male players to uproot for a loan transfer but for female footballers it is much more complicated. Salaries are significantly lower; clubs provide different levels of accommodation assistance; many players still study or work on the side. Joining Spurs means Mitchell does not have to move and gets playing time. For Arsenal it also means strengthening a team who aren\u2019t a threat but can trouble a title rival.</p> <p>Until the women\u2019s game can provide long-term financial stability for players we cannot begrudge them moving to club rivals, nor teams for putting a player\u2019s welfare and conveniences above the frustrations of fans. It will change as the game continues to grow, but for now we are stuck in a weird world where we encourage the rivalries but have a responsibility to the players to contextualise the moves when needed.</p> <h2><strong>Talking points</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Former Arsenal manager Laura Harvey has been recruited by US Soccer as head coach of its Under-20 women\u2019s national team.

Before this campaign their previous two meetings were a 6-0 pre-season win and a 10-0 victory in the FA Cup in 2017 for Arsenal. The clubs are rivals, the women\u2019s teams are not. The same goes for Manchester City, who finished last season with a domestic cup double, and Manchester United, who were promoted to the WSL at the first attempt. United\u2019s arrival and investment mean they are climbing fast but, for now, they are not title rivals. The risk with promoting these games as big acrimonious encounters is that they become too one-sided and fans are put off. Luckily the big-stadium games have had narrow margins, with the underdogs rising to the occasion. The history is being built but we are in a transition period. Historically, women\u2019s football has seen fans cross the divide by supporting a different team to their men\u2019s side. It sounds strange, but for fans of clubs who didn\u2019t have a women\u2019s team or had a underfunded one, they found a home in the women\u2019s game at a rival club. A long-term women\u2019s football follower who supports Chelsea\u2019s men may well support Arsenal\u2019s women. That is an increasingly rare breed as clubs throw their weight behind their women\u2019s teams, but for a significant period it was only really Arsenal, of London\u2019s Premier League clubs, who invested in and cared about their women\u2019s team and thus had the best players. With the growth and professionalism uneven and the women\u2019s game unable to set up players for life in the way the men\u2019s game does, it is hard to criticise transfers that seemingly go against the grain. Mitchell has been barely playing. She has made 119 appearances for Arsenal since 2013, the fifth-highest in the club\u2019s current squad, but has only three starts and five substitute appearances for them this term. The Scot sat out a significant portion of last season as she struggled with her mental health. Arsenal\u2019s manager, Joe Montemurro, explained in pre-season why he doesn\u2019t like having players too far down the pecking order. \u201cContinuity is important,\u201d he said. \u201cRotation is a bit of a false thing because it doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019re asking a player who\u2019s not always involved to come in for that game knowing that they\u2019re going to be out for the next game. I don\u2019t want to have that; I want everyone to feel that they\u2019ve got an opportunity, that they\u2019re close, that they are one bad game away from being in there, one training session away from from being in there. And that keeps the stimulus high, that keeps the level high, that keeps the the attitude high.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s chances of making Phil Neville\u2019s Team GB squad for the Olympics are extremely slim and her club options are also narrow. There are only 12 teams in the fully professional WSL and the level of professionalism between them varies dramatically. It may be easy for male players to uproot for a loan transfer but for female footballers it is much more complicated. Salaries are significantly lower; clubs provide different levels of accommodation assistance; many players still study or work on the side. Joining Spurs means Mitchell does not have to move and gets playing time. For Arsenal it also means strengthening a team who aren\u2019t a threat but can trouble a title rival. Until the women\u2019s game can provide long-term financial stability for players we cannot begrudge them moving to club rivals, nor teams for putting a player\u2019s welfare and conveniences above the frustrations of fans. It will change as the game continues to grow, but for now we are stuck in a weird world where we encourage the rivalries but have a responsibility to the players to contextualise the moves when needed. Talking points \u2022 Former Arsenal manager Laura Harvey has been recruited by US Soccer as head coach of its Under-20 women\u2019s national team. Harvey has spent seven years coaching in the NWSL, first with Seattle Reign, then Utah Royals. \u2022 Celtic have announced their women\u2019s team will become professional with immediate effect. A number of their squad have been signed to professional contracts and recruits for the 2020 season will join on professional terms. A head coach is expected to be announced soon, a full-time assistant coach is to be employed and new sponsors are backing the move. \u2022 FA Cup holdersManchester City have been drawn against Manchester United in the fourth round. The derby is one of two all-WSL ties, with Arsenal playing last year\u2019s runners-up, West Ham. Lewes will face the the lowest-ranked team left in the tournament, either Billericay Town or Actonians, whose third-round match was postponed. Full draw here. \u2022 Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema has been named WSL player of the month for December, with Joe Montemurro manager of the month. Sheffield United\u2019s Katie Wilkinson was named Championship player of the month. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

US authorities have said there were \u201cfew, if any\u201d casualties as a result of the missile launches, which Iran carried out as a reprisal for the US killing last week of Qassem Suleimani, the top general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

He added: \u201cIf both sides can declare victory and get back to talking, then that would be extremely welcome.\u201d Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he believed it was the first time Iranian ballistic missiles had been fired directly at US bases. \u201cThat is slightly caveating it, because of course the Iranians have been firing missiles via proxy for many, many years,\u201d he said. About 400 British soldiers are located at three different sites in Iraq: Camp Taji near Baghdad, Union III in Baghdad as well as Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan. All non-essential personnel have been relocated from Baghdad to Taji as part of steps taken in response to the increase in tensions since Suleimani\u2019s death. Other measures have included sending a small British team to the region to help with contingency planning assistance, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told the House of Commons on Tuesday. Boris Johnson, will face questions from MPs about the crisis on Wednesday when he appears in parliament for his first prime minister\u2019s questions since the general election.

The problem with these particular nutters is that their website is your best bet if you need to find a doctor who performs abortions in Germany. It provides a full list of practitioners with the \u201clicence to kill\u201d by town and postcode, decorated with images of hacked-up babies in petri dishes, some of them made into gifs to show the blood still dripping. Whatever for? They obviously don\u2019t want you to go to these doctors. But they do want to make it easier for you to report these \u201ckillers\u201d to the police.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Suddenly we are living in a country where doctors are being sentenced for giving their patients information about the 'crime of abortion'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because while babycaust.de is legal, it is not legal for doctors to put information about abortion on their websites.

Suddenly we are living in a country where doctors are being sentenced for giving their patients information about the \u201ccrime of abortion\u201d. And make no mistake, abortion is a crime in Germany, only hardly anybody knew that either.</p> <p>Our happy ignorance had a lot to do with the victories of feminism. Germany\u2019s women\u2019s movement started in the 1970s with the fight against section 218 of the country\u2019s criminal code, which punished abortions with jail sentences of up to 10 years \u2013 for both the woman and the doctor. That\u2019s why it was such a big thing when 374 film stars and other famous women declared \u201cWe\u2019ve had abortions\u201d on the cover of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We%27ve_had_abortions!\" title=\"\"> Stern magazine in 1971</a>.

And it did. In 1972 East Germany passed the most progressive law in Europe, which recognised abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy as a legal right. West Germany followed in 1974, with a slightly less revolutionary law that nonetheless legalised abortions up to the 12th week. But this was repealed a year later when the Bundesverfassungsgericht \u2013 Germany\u2019s federal constitutional court \u2013 declared it unconstitutional. So West Germany went for a compromise that made abortion technically illegal, but allowed it to go unpunished under certain conditions.</p> <p>Then came 1989 and the reunification of Germany, which meant East Germans lost their full reproductive rights as well. They too now had to be assessed by different doctors and psychologists. But the political climate had changed; there was less public outcry. Yes it was tedious going through the motions, but you knew you could get an abortion in the end. Plus it was surely only a question of time before the anachronistic section 218 was abolished; after all, most people thought it had already gone and the assessments were just a pro forma matter.</p> <p>Little did we reckon with the rise of the far right, which wasn\u2019t stupid enough to tackle section 218 directly. Instead it has chosen the much more ambiguous section 219a, which laid dormant for decades, but has now been stirred up and become the biggest threat to doctors performing abortions. The most prominent of these is GP <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20180330/the-doctors-battling-germanys-nazi-era-abortion-law\" title=\"\">Kristina H\u00e4nel</a>.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s like the holocaust only worse, according to babycaust.de, the German website dedicated to abortion, or as they call it: \u201cThe mass murder of unborn children.\u201d Every country has its nutters. The problem with these particular nutters is that their website is your best bet if you need to find a doctor who performs abortions in Germany. It provides a full list of practitioners with the \u201clicence to kill\u201d by town and postcode, decorated with images of hacked-up babies in petri dishes, some of them made into gifs to show the blood still dripping. Whatever for? They obviously don\u2019t want you to go to these doctors. But they do want to make it easier for you to report these \u201ckillers\u201d to the police. Because while babycaust.de is legal, it is not legal for doctors to put information about abortion on their websites. That is seen as \u201cadvertising\u201d abortion, and is dealt with under paragraph 219a, a leftover Nazi law that had been forgotten about until so-called pro-lifers started to use it to hit practitioners with lawsuits. If that wasn\u2019t surprising enough, their campaign is actually succeeding. Suddenly we are living in a country where doctors are being sentenced for giving their patients information about the \u201ccrime of abortion\u201d. And make no mistake, abortion is a crime in Germany, only hardly anybody knew that either. Our happy ignorance had a lot to do with the victories of feminism. Germany\u2019s women\u2019s movement started in the 1970s with the fight against section 218 of the country\u2019s criminal code, which punished abortions with jail sentences of up to 10 years \u2013 for both the woman and the doctor. That\u2019s why it was such a big thing when 374 film stars and other famous women declared \u201cWe\u2019ve had abortions\u201d on the cover of Stern magazine in 1971. Because the law didn\u2019t mean fewer terminations; only more women dying of abortion by coathanger. Women like my great-grandmother. I am yet to meet a German person who does not have a section 218 victim in the extended family. It was high time the law changed. And it did. In 1972 East Germany passed the most progressive law in Europe, which recognised abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy as a legal right. West Germany followed in 1974, with a slightly less revolutionary law that nonetheless legalised abortions up to the 12th week.

In September, oil prices jumped after Iran bombed a key Saudi Arabian oil refinery. However, that was quickly repaired and prices reverted back to previous levels. How Iran responds to the US attack will determine oil-price direction, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. There are reports of Iranian cybersecurity attacks, but so far no reports of impacts on oil production. That\u2019s one reason why oil prices retreated from Monday\u2019s high, now trading at $62.76.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/iran-threatens-us-bases-missiles-retaliation-suleimani\">Iran threatens to hit US bases with medium- and long-range missiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe key is, how is output actually changed in the long run,\u201d Haworth said.</p> <p>Unless there\u2019s a sustained price rise, any impact on consumers should be fleeting, said Amanda Agati, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group. Even if US crude oil prices rise to $70 a barrel, consumers are in good shape to weather the uptick as their finances are strong, the US economy is growing and unemployment is low.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s manageable,\u201d she said.</p> <p>So far gasoline prices haven\u2019t changed much following the air strikes, with AAA <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/national-gas-price-average-holds-steady-amid-tensions-with-iran/\">saying</a> the current nationwide average price for a gallon of regular gas is $2.85, the same as a week and a month ago. It takes some movement in crude-oil prices to affect gasoline values. A $10-a-barrel price rise in oil increases gasoline prices by 24 cents a gallon, if the cost is fully passed through, Glickman said, citing IHS Markit data.</p> <p>Consumer spending on gasoline may start to slow if pump prices sustain at $3 a gallon or higher, Kessens said, which roughly translates to $80 crude. There are ways the US can temporarily manage gas prices, such as tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Sustained prices above $80 could also encourage more shale-oil production or from Opec or non-Opec members like Russia, eventually weighing on prices.</p> <p>Higher prices are good for US shale producers, and energy was the worst-performing equity sector in 2019, Agati said. Shale producers are making some money, with internal rates of return around $40 a barrel, Glickman said. However, they are still dealing with the wreckage caused by 2015\u2019s oil glut. Glickman and other sources said investors want companies to focus on cashflow, not growth.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge incentive for companies not to do anything. But at some point, if prices go up enough, they may get tempted [to drill],\u201d he said.</p> <p>The US economy is still dependent on oil and the longer the situation with Iran persists and the worse it gets, the more likely it is to hurt the US. Could the US completely wean itself off foreign oil? Maybe over the long term, but in the short term no. Kessens said the US refining system was built to process lower-quality crude oil, now mostly imported from Canada and Mexico. \u201cIt would take some time for the US to reconfigure the system to fully utilize the higher-quality crude from shale oil. It\u2019s possible, but it wouldn\u2019t happen day one,\u201d he said.</p>",

That\u2019s one reason why oil prices retreated from Monday\u2019s high, now trading at $62.76. \u201cThe key is, how is output actually changed in the long run,\u201d Haworth said. Unless there\u2019s a sustained price rise, any impact on consumers should be fleeting, said Amanda Agati, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group. Even if US crude oil prices rise to $70 a barrel, consumers are in good shape to weather the uptick as their finances are strong, the US economy is growing and unemployment is low. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s manageable,\u201d she said. So far gasoline prices haven\u2019t changed much following the air strikes, with AAA saying the current nationwide average price for a gallon of regular gas is $2.85, the same as a week and a month ago. It takes some movement in crude-oil prices to affect gasoline values. A $10-a-barrel price rise in oil increases gasoline prices by 24 cents a gallon, if the cost is fully passed through, Glickman said, citing IHS Markit data. Consumer spending on gasoline may start to slow if pump prices sustain at $3 a gallon or higher, Kessens said, which roughly translates to $80 crude. There are ways the US can temporarily manage gas prices, such as tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Sustained prices above $80 could also encourage more shale-oil production or from Opec or non-Opec members like Russia, eventually weighing on prices. Higher prices are good for US shale producers, and energy was the worst-performing equity sector in 2019, Agati said. Shale producers are making some money, with internal rates of return around $40 a barrel, Glickman said. However, they are still dealing with the wreckage caused by 2015\u2019s oil glut. Glickman and other sources said investors want companies to focus on cashflow, not growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge incentive for companies not to do anything. But at some point, if prices go up enough, they may get tempted [to drill],\u201d he said. The US economy is still dependent on oil and the longer the situation with Iran persists and the worse it gets, the more likely it is to hurt the US. Could the US completely wean itself off foreign oil? Maybe over the long term, but in the short term no. Kessens said the US refining system was built to process lower-quality crude oil, now mostly imported from Canada and Mexico. \u201cIt would take some time for the US to reconfigure the system to fully utilize the higher-quality crude from shale oil. It\u2019s possible, but it wouldn\u2019t happen day one,\u201d he said.",

Alternatively, Christian Benteke could return to Villa Park from Crystal Palace where he has failed to live up to expectations. The bad news for Palace is that Wilfried Zaha, with new agent Pini Zahavi in tow, is interesting Chelsea as a they look to add a touch more attacking flair to the ranks. Another ageing star on Dean Smith\u2019s radar is the former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who could be the answer to Aston Villa\u2019s goalkeeping problem after Tom Heaton was ruled out for the remainder of the season. The 37-year-old Spaniard is currently second choice at Milan and could be open to a return to England. Daniel Farke has decided one alice-band wearing midfielder is not enough for Norwich\u2019s survival fight and has entered the race to sign the Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher on loan for the rest of the season. Burnley are also thought to be interested in the teenager who has impressed at Charlton in the opening half of the campaign. The former Liverpool winger Ryan Babel could be making another return to the Premier League as Newcastle are keen on the Dutchman who is not enjoying life at Galatasaray where he has struggled to make an impact in the first team. Neal Maupay has impressed since joining Brighton from Brentford in the summer, so much so that he is now a target for Napoli. The French striker has scored seven times, prompting the Seagulls to slap a \u00a340m price tag on him. Another Brighton player repeatedly cropping up on scouting reports is Ben White, currently excelling on loan at Leeds. Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham are all considering where to make their move on the centre-back. The ex-Arsenal youngster Marcus McGuane is trying to return from Barcelona where he has achieved little of note since departing London. This season he\u2019s been on loan in the Dutch second-tier with Telstar but now wants to cut that short and arrange a move to his homeland.",

They are wrong now.\u201d</p> <p>According to the journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s book Plan of Attack, Bush turned his attention to regime change in Iraq just two months after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, telling the defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, \u201cLet\u2019s get started on this.\u201d</p> <p>Despite huge public protests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/19/iraq-war-saddam-bush-starts-2003\">the war started in March.</a> Saddam Hussein was toppled and captured but the WMD intelligence proved to be wrong. Years of violent insurgency and the rise of Islamic State left nearly 5,000 US service members and more than 100,000 civilians dead. It is now regarded by many as the greatest foreign policy blunder since the Vietnam war.</p> <p>Many senior figures in Washington are now worried the same dynamic is repeating itself.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.panettainstitute.org/about-us/institute-people/leon-panetta/\">Leon Panetta,</a> a defense secretary under Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama, said: <em>\u201c</em>I think the one lesson we\u2019ve learned from the wars of the 21st century is that they\u2019re easy to get into but difficult to get out of. The wars we\u2019ve seen have largely resulted from failed leadership and miscalculations, mixed messages and bad understanding of intelligence and, I think, the false hope that somehow wars could be won quickly. A lot of those elements are now playing out in the relationship between the United States and Iran.\u201d</p> <p>Trump stunned the world last week with his abrupt decision to order a drone strike that killed Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, at Baghdad airport, plunging the US and Iran closer to war than at any point in the past four decades. The president claimed: \u201cSuleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/trump-iran-suleimani-threats-retaliation\">Trump and Iran exchange new threats as US allies withdraw troops from Iraq</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evidence for this \u201cimminent\u201d attack remains shaky and has been cast into doubt by US media reports. The official narrative was further undermined when Adel Abdul Mahdi, Iraq\u2019s caretaker prime minister, said Suleimani was in the country to negotiate a de-escalation in tensions with Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>One of Powell\u2019s successors as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/mike-pompeo-qassem-suleimani-killing-trump\">failed to give specific details.</a> One of Cheney\u2019s successors as vice-president, Mike Pence, tweeted that Suleimani \u201cassisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States\u201d. The claim has been <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-pences-falsehood-about-soleimani-and-911-matters\">debunked by fact checkers.</a></p> <p>Panetta added: \u201cThey often say that truth is the first casualty of war but you could also say that truth may be the first casualty when you\u2019re leading up to war. I think there\u2019s a great deal of concern that the American people, and the world for that matter, is not getting the straight story about exactly what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Historians hear echoes of the Bush administration\u2019s march to war. <a href=\"https://history.rutgers.edu/faculty-directory/187-lears-tj-jackson\">Jackson Lears,</a> a history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: \u201cThere certainly are echoes and continuities from the whole global war on terror ethos. The arguments employed 17 or 18 years ago are being dragged out and invoked again.\u201d</p> <p>Bush was egged on by Cheney, Rumsfeld, the CIA director George Tenet and neoconservatives intent on \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d in the Middle East.

      "bodyText": "A Republican president facing a tough re-election campaign and widely viewed as hopelessly out of his depth. Bureaucrats itching to turn US military firepower on a Middle Eastern regime they claim without evidence is plotting an imminent attack. Compliant sections of the media that put flag-waving jingoism ahead of skeptical scrutiny. So it was in late 2002, when President George W Bush\u2019s administration built unstoppable momentum towards invading Iraq, promising to destroy weapons of mass destruction (WMD) that never existed. Nearly two decades later the potential target is not Iraq but Iran, with many of the same concerns over false pretexts and official lies. \u201cThe same people cheering on Trump\u2019s reckless, illogical escalation to war with Iran were the ones telling us that democracy would boom across the Middle East as soon as our cake walk invasion of Iraq was done,\u201d tweeted Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee. \u201cThey were wrong then. They are wrong now.\u201d According to the journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s book Plan of Attack, Bush turned his attention to regime change in Iraq just two months after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, telling the defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, \u201cLet\u2019s get started on this.\u201d Despite huge public protests, the war started in March. Saddam Hussein was toppled and captured but the WMD intelligence proved to be wrong. Years of violent insurgency and the rise of Islamic State left nearly 5,000 US service members and more than 100,000 civilians dead. It is now regarded by many as the greatest foreign policy blunder since the Vietnam war. Many senior figures in Washington are now worried the same dynamic is repeating itself. Leon Panetta, a defense secretary under Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama, said: \u201cI think the one lesson we\u2019ve learned from the wars of the 21st century is that they\u2019re easy to get into but difficult to get out of. The wars we\u2019ve seen have largely resulted from failed leadership and miscalculations, mixed messages and bad understanding of intelligence and, I think, the false hope that somehow wars could be won quickly. A lot of those elements are now playing out in the relationship between the United States and Iran.\u201d Trump stunned the world last week with his abrupt decision to order a drone strike that killed Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, at Baghdad airport, plunging the US and Iran closer to war than at any point in the past four decades. The president claimed: \u201cSuleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.\u201d Evidence for this \u201cimminent\u201d attack remains shaky and has been cast into doubt by US media reports. The official narrative was further undermined when Adel Abdul Mahdi, Iraq\u2019s caretaker prime minister, said Suleimani was in the country to negotiate a de-escalation in tensions with Saudi Arabia. One of Powell\u2019s successors as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has repeatedly failed to give specific details. One of Cheney\u2019s successors as vice-president, Mike Pence, tweeted that Suleimani \u201cassisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States\u201d. The claim has been debunked by fact checkers. Panetta added: \u201cThey often say that truth is the first casualty of war but you could also say that truth may be the first casualty when you\u2019re leading up to war. I think there\u2019s a great deal of concern that the American people, and the world for that matter, is not getting the straight story about exactly what\u2019s happening.\u201d Historians hear echoes of the Bush administration\u2019s march to war. Jackson Lears, a history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: \u201cThere certainly are echoes and continuities from the whole global war on terror ethos. The arguments employed 17 or 18 years ago are being dragged out and invoked again.\u201d Bush was egged on by Cheney, Rumsfeld, the CIA director George Tenet and neoconservatives intent on \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d in the Middle East. Similarly, Trump appears to be under the influence of Pompeo and the defense secretary, Mark Esper. Supporters in Congress include Cheney\u2019s daughter Liz. Before the Iraq invasion, parts of the US media were condemned for getting swept up in cheerleading the troops into battle. Judith Miller, an investigative reporter at the New York Times, wrote a series of articles since criticised for too unquestioningly promoting the administration\u2019s line about chemical and biological weapons and possible nuclear material in Iraq. This week, Miller, now an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute thinktank, turned up to be interviewed on Fox News. Predictably, some of the conservative network\u2019s hosts have been fiercely defending Trump\u2019s decision. Some media outlets \u2013 and some Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 have been reluctant to describe the killing of Suleimani as an \u201cassassination\u201d. Glenn Greenwald, a journalist at the Intercept, tweeted in response: \u201cNobody loves US militarism and violence more than US journalists. It\u2019s what gets their blood pumping.

With striking hair (a dark bob with Lily Munster streaks) and thick black spectacles, she speaks slowly, in very long sentences: interviewing her can feel like consulting a very niche psychic. She is given to issuing prophecies such as: \u201cI think we will get very inspired by blouses.\u201d</p> <p>But while it is fun to imagine her as the Nostradamus of fast-moving consumer goods, her methods are relatively down to earth. Through research, interviews and travel, she picks up ideas that are \u201ccircling around\u201d, then uses her \u201cintuition\u201d (\u201cdata is no use; it\u2019s too late,\u201d she says wearily) to predict which of them will take off.</p> <p>\u201cI can work 25 years ahead,\u201d she says. In 2000, she tells me, she predicted that by 2025 there would be a \u201cfusion of everything contrasting\u201d. \u201cWork and leisure, man and woman, very intense sport, but also laziness and meditation. I can therefore see that it is becoming [true] 100%.\u201d</p> <p>She has never made a bad call, she says, not least because her predictions \u201care not my invention\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m just picking it up and broadcasting it. It is not a creative profession. It is more analytic.\u201d What she will admit to is occasionally miscalculating the \u201cvolume\u201d of a trend. After seeing leggings on New York City messengers at the end of the 80s, for example, \u201cI thought, that\u2019s cool \u2013 it will be a trend. Little did I know it would become a billion-dollar business.\u201d</p> <p>For at least 10 years, she says, trends have slowed down, becoming \u201cvast currents which are mobilised over time\u201d. This makes me feel a bit basic, when I then ask for assurances about whether the midi skirt I\u2019m wearing will still be fashionable in 2025. \u201cThat idea left us somewhere in the 80s,\u201d she says drily. \u201cEveryone can have the length they desire.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When I made the manifesto I could have lost all my clients. But the timing was right. People sent me messages saying: \u2018This is what we all think\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Edelkoort has, in fact, gone further than this. In 2015, she predicted the death of the fashion industry as we know it, slamming it as \u201ca ridiculous and pathetic parody\u201d in a treatise titled the <a href=\"https://www.edelkoort.com/2015/09/anti_fashion-manifesto/\" title=\"\">Anti_Fashion Manifesto</a>. Last year, she wrote a similarly damning appraisal of the Met Gala, calling the red carpet a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/05/17/met-gala-waste-li-edelkoort/\" title=\"\">mesmerising and sickening</a>\u201d display, which came on \u201cthe same day the UN published a scientific survey that certified that because of human greed, excess, waste and abuse of our habitat we will lose one million species\u201d.</p> <p>She was so angry when she wrote that, she said, that \u201cI didn\u2019t even recognise myself,\u201d yet these moments of truth-telling made her more popular. \u201cWhen I made the manifesto, I could have lost all my clients \u2013 I took a risk. But the timing was right. People sent me messages saying: \u2018This is what we all think!\u2019\u201d Anyway, Edelkoort says, you only have to look at <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2019-12-12/barneys-new-york-closing-sale-deeper-discounts\" title=\"\">the closures of blue-chip brands such as Barneys</a> to see that people are sick of fashion as usual. \u201cIt is no longer attractive for people to encounter the same old thing on every street corner.

She argues that in the next decade \u2013 as people tire of overconsumption \u2013 our lives will shift radically. She urges the assembled fashion professionals to \u201cmake much less, make it better and make it more expensive\u201d. She says that success will not be expressed in dollars but \u201cin degrees of happiness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are an endangered species and if you\u2019re not part of the big change you\u2019re not relevant,\u201d she tells me afterwards. Many brands, she argues, will close if they don\u2019t change. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to turn these big boats around,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to start a new company now than scale down.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Boris Johnson\u2019s recent election \u2013 and regardless of the presence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/02/boris-johnson-urged-to-challenge-trump-on-climate-denial\" title=\"\">a climate-change denier in the Oval Office</a> \u2013 she believes young people will continue to fight for a better future, and will get one. \u201cCrazily enough, elections everywhere in the world go against it,\u201d she says, but she believes the hunger for a greener, fairer, less consumerist society is growing and that eventually there will be a tipping point.</p> <p>\u201cIn Germany and parts of China, there is an increasing understanding that ecology equals economy. The day we are able to prove this, I think we will create change.\u201d Witchcraft or otherwise, here\u2019s hoping she is right.</p> <h2><strong>Life in the 2020s</strong> according to Lidewij Edelkoort<br></h2> <p><strong>Libraries</strong><br>Libraries will \u201cstart lending clothes, offering lectures and writing courses, hosting exhibitions and concerts\u201d, says Edelkoort. She believes they will become \u201cthe epicentres of small towns and villages\u201d, partly run by community volunteers in return for access. In Tokyo, she says, there are already \u201cbeautiful\u201d libraries where people work and dine together. She believes this will be one of many \u201csocietal initiatives bringing us back together\u201d, in response to today\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d state of disconnection.</p> <p><strong>Muted colours</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91c4ab416dbf84709d1b26c3b446a99b0eeb9edd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91c4ab416dbf84709d1b26c3b446a99b0eeb9edd/0_0_418_566/369.jpg\" alt=\"A silk tank top, by Anthemia, dyed with onion skins and eucalyptus leaves.\" width=\"369\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A silk tank top, by Anthemia, dyed with onion skins and eucalyptus leaves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our eye for colour will change as <a href=\"]\" title=\"\">natural dyes</a> \u2013 such as those made from onions and avocados \u2013 become mainstream.

      "bodyText": "When Lidewij \u2013 or Li \u2013 Edelkoort started her career as a trend forecaster 45 years ago, people thought her job was \u201cwitchcraft\u201d, she says. \u201cMen would be giggling at the end of the room. But I have gained respect,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I have been right so many times.\u201d The Dutch 69-year-old is fashion\u2019s best-known soothsayer, a woman who has spent more than four decades helping brands, including Prada, Zara and Coca-Cola, to anticipate customer desire. She is also the dean of hybrid design studies for the prestigious New York fashion college Parsons School of Design, a curator (one recent exhibition was an installation in Tokyo in which Google devices were placed among artisanal homeware), and a regular on \u201cmost influential people\u201d lists in fashion and design. When we meet, she is swathed in loose, dark layers of Eskandar and Issey Miyake, and has just delivered a lecture to a rapt audience of 100 fashion and retail buyers in London. With striking hair (a dark bob with Lily Munster streaks) and thick black spectacles, she speaks slowly, in very long sentences: interviewing her can feel like consulting a very niche psychic. She is given to issuing prophecies such as: \u201cI think we will get very inspired by blouses.\u201d But while it is fun to imagine her as the Nostradamus of fast-moving consumer goods, her methods are relatively down to earth. Through research, interviews and travel, she picks up ideas that are \u201ccircling around\u201d, then uses her \u201cintuition\u201d (\u201cdata is no use; it\u2019s too late,\u201d she says wearily) to predict which of them will take off. \u201cI can work 25 years ahead,\u201d she says. In 2000, she tells me, she predicted that by 2025 there would be a \u201cfusion of everything contrasting\u201d. \u201cWork and leisure, man and woman, very intense sport, but also laziness and meditation. I can therefore see that it is becoming [true] 100%.\u201d She has never made a bad call, she says, not least because her predictions \u201care not my invention\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m just picking it up and broadcasting it. It is not a creative profession. It is more analytic.\u201d What she will admit to is occasionally miscalculating the \u201cvolume\u201d of a trend. After seeing leggings on New York City messengers at the end of the 80s, for example, \u201cI thought, that\u2019s cool \u2013 it will be a trend. Little did I know it would become a billion-dollar business.\u201d For at least 10 years, she says, trends have slowed down, becoming \u201cvast currents which are mobilised over time\u201d. This makes me feel a bit basic, when I then ask for assurances about whether the midi skirt I\u2019m wearing will still be fashionable in 2025. \u201cThat idea left us somewhere in the 80s,\u201d she says drily. \u201cEveryone can have the length they desire.\u201d Edelkoort has, in fact, gone further than this. In 2015, she predicted the death of the fashion industry as we know it, slamming it as \u201ca ridiculous and pathetic parody\u201d in a treatise titled the Anti_Fashion Manifesto. Last year, she wrote a similarly damning appraisal of the Met Gala, calling the red carpet a \u201cmesmerising and sickening\u201d display, which came on \u201cthe same day the UN published a scientific survey that certified that because of human greed, excess, waste and abuse of our habitat we will lose one million species\u201d. She was so angry when she wrote that, she said, that \u201cI didn\u2019t even recognise myself,\u201d yet these moments of truth-telling made her more popular. \u201cWhen I made the manifesto, I could have lost all my clients \u2013 I took a risk. But the timing was right. People sent me messages saying: \u2018This is what we all think!\u2019\u201d Anyway, Edelkoort says, you only have to look at the closures of blue-chip brands such as Barneys to see that people are sick of fashion as usual. \u201cIt is no longer attractive for people to encounter the same old thing on every street corner. The consumer doesn\u2019t see the point any more,\u201d she says. \u201cWake up, people!\u201d After our interview, she presents a second lecture, the latest of her big predictions, titled The Future of Luxury. She argues that in the next decade \u2013 as people tire of overconsumption \u2013 our lives will shift radically. She urges the assembled fashion professionals to \u201cmake much less, make it better and make it more expensive\u201d. She says that success will not be expressed in dollars but \u201cin degrees of happiness\u201d. \u201cPeople are an endangered species and if you\u2019re not part of the big change you\u2019re not relevant,\u201d she tells me afterwards. Many brands, she argues, will close if they don\u2019t change. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to turn these big boats around,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to start a new company now than scale down.\u201d Despite Boris Johnson\u2019s recent election \u2013 and regardless of the presence of a climate-change denier in the Oval Office \u2013 she believes young people will continue to fight for a better future, and will get one. \u201cCrazily enough, elections everywhere in the world go against it,\u201d she says, but she believes the hunger for a greener, fairer, less consumerist society is growing and that eventually there will be a tipping point. \u201cIn Germany and parts of China, there is an increasing understanding that ecology equals economy. The day we are able to prove this, I think we will create change.\u201d Witchcraft or otherwise, here\u2019s hoping she is right. Life in the 2020s according to Lidewij Edelkoort Libraries Libraries will \u201cstart lending clothes, offering lectures and writing courses, hosting exhibitions and concerts\u201d, says Edelkoort. She believes they will become \u201cthe epicentres of small towns and villages\u201d, partly run by community volunteers in return for access. In Tokyo, she says, there are already \u201cbeautiful\u201d libraries where people work and dine together. She believes this will be one of many \u201csocietal initiatives bringing us back together\u201d, in response to today\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d state of disconnection. Muted colours Our eye for colour will change as natural dyes \u2013 such as those made from onions and avocados \u2013 become mainstream. Their colours are less saturated, \u201cmore subdued and melancholic\u201d. Similarly, more sustainable fabrics, such as those made from nettle and algae, will become popular. \u2018Non-fashion\u2019 fashion Edelkoort believes \u201cproven, functional\u201d workwear shapes will be popular in the 2020s. \u201cWe will retreat, after all this newness, possibly into something more sensible and pragmatic,\u201d she says. Romantic dresses There will still be \u201ca need for romantic dresses \u2013 slightly high-waisted; a need for volume.\u201d Edelkoort cites the Irish designer Simone Rocha as someone who is \u201cnow getting major acclaim\u201d. That silhouette is, she says, \u201cbeguiling\u201d and encourages \u201ca more dancing step\u201d. Flight shaming In the next decade, we will fly a tenth as much as we do today, says Edelkoort. In Scandinavian countries, she says, wealthy people are already selling their houses abroad rather than face their friends\u2019 disapproval at their regular flying. Recently, KLM advised customers to fly less. Train travel, she believes, will take off instead. She argues that this will happen because \u201cthe big innovative companies, like Google, Tesla and Apple\u201d will invest in green technology, while some companies will rethink their business plans in a radical way. KLM and British Airways, for example, \u201cwould be smart\u201d to invest in the rail sector to make up for the shortfall in domestic flights. An age of collaboration In fashion and design, \u201cthere will be co-creation. One of my visions of the future is that it will be the age of the amateur; people will be empowered to be more creative.\u201d The end of \u2018stuffocation\u2019 Edelkoort cites the popularity of shows on Netflix about decluttering as a sign that citizens will soon buy into the \u201crevelation\u201d that having less stuff will make us happier. She believes that people will grow to cherish their selected possessions so deeply that we will eventually see the rise of animism, where objects are respected, treated \u201clike pets\u201d. \u201cThis is a bit further in time,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it will definitely happen.\u201d \u2022 This article was corrected on 8 January 2020. Simone Rocha is Irish, not British, as we originally stated.",

      "body": "<p>Idealism in British architecture has much to answer for, yet we like the idea that optimism mixes well with fresh cement. Housing estates were built on a sort of visionary, infectious hope, drawing on particular memories of bombed-out tenements and overcrowded room-and-kitchens. I once saw some letters sent to David Gibson, Glasgow\u2019s messianic early 1960s housing convenor \u2013 \u201che took seven sugars in his tea\u201d, his wife said \u2013 which came from citizens desperate to escape the slums. \u201cPlease put us down for one of your high-rises and all the clean air up there,\u201d one woman wrote. The poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview9\" title=\"\">Hugh MacDiarmid</a> tapped into a modernist hankering, a common wellspring of the better life, when he wrote that \u201cthere are ruined buildings in the world, but no ruined stones\u201d.

Like many Britons of her generation and her class, she made something of a religion of keeping up appearances. She wasn\u2019t from the slums herself, she was from Essex, but her husband was local and she loved their new house for being much more than a house, initially feeling they were renting a big new idea as much as a dwelling. \u201cThe people of Motherwell were used to being part of something much bigger than themselves,\u201d her daughter writes. \u201cWhen it went, so quickly \u2026 [it] became a town without a purpose.\u201d Set in the Lanarkshire countryside south-east of Glasgow, Motherwell at its height made trams, heavy engineering parts, and produced 3m tons of steel every year, employing 14,000 people (more than half the town\u2019s adult population), many of them at Ravenscraig, which was targeted through the 80s and closed in 1992.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a7a922be3af8fd4f4db8e325efd425305fbd0b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7a922be3af8fd4f4db8e325efd425305fbd0b6/1295_87_3415_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maisonettes and flats at Muirhouse Housing Development, Motherwell, 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maisonettes and flats at Muirhouse Housing Development, Motherwell, 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George W Hales/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The life of Motherwell was seen as an experiment that failed. As Orr would have been quick to say, all lives, looked at from a certain not un-Scottish perspective, are experiments that fail. But there are miracles too in the world of hard knocks, and Orr, by a kind of genius, finds the kernel of the town\u2019s former existence, and locates the \u201cmother\u201d in its name. By doing so, finishing the book not long before she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/21/deborah-orr-obituary\" title=\"\">died last October at the age of 57</a>, she produced what I believe to be the best memoir to appear out of Scotland since 1935, the year of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/31/poetry\" title=\"\">Edwin Muir</a>\u2019s <em>Scottish Journey</em>. A good friend of mine and a former journalist of this parish \u2013 editor of Weekend magazine 1993-98, and later a columnist \u2013 she has left behind her a non-fiction book for the ages. <em>Motherwell</em> is a searching, truthful, shocking (and timely) observance of the blight that monetarist policies can bring about in a community of workers, indeed on a whole culture of fairness and improvement, while also showing \u2013 in sentences as clean as bone \u2013 the tireless misunderstandings that can starve a family of love.</p> <p>The family lived at 18 Clyde Terrace, a timber-clad, typical two-storey dwelling in the middle of others much the same, and she recalls the bureau that stood in the corner of the living room, overseen by her mother, Win, who managed all its papers, all its memories. Win could be a fierce custodian of the family narrative and she often recoiled from her brilliant daughter\u2019s efforts to change the story. She once told me Deborah was \u201cperverse\u201d, and, of course, clever children must sometimes seem that way to their confused and fretful parents. Orr could be savage, thrawn and irrepressible, but she was also a born writer and a born improver of dull situations. Win worried about what people thought, Deborah didn\u2019t. And over the years Win\u2019s power came to seem entirely oppressive to her daughter, like the forces excoriating the town itself.</p> <p>On the west coast of Scotland they have as many expressions for embarrassment as the Inuit have for snow. You can be mortified or \u201cblack affronted\u201d or \u201cgiven a showing-up\u201d, especially over matters of cleaning your house or paying your bills or \u201ctaking too much drink\u201d. Early in <em>Motherwell</em>, it seems that Win is the engine of all this painful self-loathing, but then we see John, Deborah\u2019s father, who is either an unskilled labourer at Ravenscraig (Deborah) or a trained engineer (Win). It shouldn\u2019t really matter, but it does, very deeply, in the Orr scheme of things. Sifting through her memories as she tries to make sense of her life, Orr sees how she was never good enough, how life itself was never good enough, and that John was really a man of bigotry and anger. After Thatcherism, his world would be blown down in broad daylight, and he becomes an almost Hardyesque casualty of the land, someone carrying his trauma and his prejudices as if they were all he had.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07fbcb9a7c0ab3db131882effb9142e258bdb442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07fbcb9a7c0ab3db131882effb9142e258bdb442/49_273_523_523/500.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Orr as a child in Motherwell.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Orr as a child in Motherwell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: W&amp;N</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is great accuracy in the book\u2019s sociological depictions, great courage in its manner of uncovering family secrets. (There can be few better accounts of how the postwar working-class strove so complicatedly for \u201cbetterness\u201d.) Yet the book\u2019s greatness lies mainly in the psychological dimension, in the vivid portrait of her parents\u2019 narcissism and the just-as-vivid portrait of her own, which to some heartbreaking degree was to prove the struggle of their lives. Her mother was traumatised by the war and by the expectations that followed. She clung on to her things, stuffing them into the bureau, but also to her disappointments, as if only they could define her, keep her voice central to the life of the family, cancelling any youthful or novel encroachments. All the time, Deborah is looking at Win and asking: \u201cDid she mother well?\u201d But she also asks who she is herself, how capable, how good. She writes about the history of violence and sectarianism, the scars they leave, and slowly, with a reporter\u2019s skill, she shows the interior life of her people.</p> <p>On the day they blew Ravenscraig down, Deborah was there with her father, mother and brother David. They stood behind the cordon. \u201cThe crowd was sparse,\u201d she writes. \u201cThere was still a lot of bitterness. It took six seconds for that huge, blue gasometer and those ... massive elegant cooling towers to come down \u2026 After the ... site was decommissioned, its buildings flattened and shovelled away, its earth decontaminated, there was just a big hole, in the town, in the shire, in so many people\u2019s lives.\u201d The local council let off some balloons, to represent every person who\u2019d ever worked there, and the Orr family went home, like many others, to live out their myth of survival.</p> <p>In the present climate, this book should be given out on the NHS. It should also be dangled in the faces of one-nation opportunists, for whom working-class communities only become real when they vote Conservative. <em>Motherwell</em> shows, chapter and verse, the ravages of individualism, yet it also has the guts to demonstrate how working-class identity may be weaponised for intolerance, and snared by eager bigots into voting for its own dissolution. Great books forge a connection between the movement of single minds and the fate of nations, and Deborah, by looking at her own Scottish family and herself, put her finger on the anger and narcissism of the current political moment: \u201cThe unsettling thing about group narcissism is that there\u2019s a level on which it works really well. Group narcissism tends to keep individual narcissism at bay. It helps to regulate the feelings of shame \u2026 Within the family, John\u2019s expressions of contempt for others got him lots of attention.\u201d</p> <p>Orr grew up in an atmosphere of what she calls \u201cperformative hate\u201d. It\u2019s not that her town had any sort of monopoly on that, but Motherwell\u2019s decline, so spitefully speeded by the Thatcher \u201crevolution\u201d, got under the skin of many families, manacling them to a sense of waste. The proudest feature of her father\u2019s life, according to him, was that he had never missed a day\u2019s work in his life, a boast that persisted even after they made him redundant. People like to write about their people\u2019s defiance, not their subservience, so this is a post-industrial story we have not quite heard before, allowing a genuine flushing-out of shame and fear about the whole \u2018condition\u2019 of the British working-class, as it used to be understood. The point is: it might never be understood that way again. Orr knew it was hard to speak up, and I believe she hoped for a new openness, \u2018to take charge, to take complete control, of my own family, in my own words.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad52ec8974802379fffc643aabf3aab3e60af24a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad52ec8974802379fffc643aabf3aab3e60af24a/0_0_2141_1284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ravenscraig steelworks, Motherwell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ravenscraig steelworks, Motherwell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After dark, the lights of Ravenscraig could once be seen from the whole town, and far into the surrounding countryside.

They use floating cages, allowing fish to breed in a secure area. Also, if water levels rise, the cages will too, so flooding is less of an issue.</p> \n<p>\u201cAbout 20 to 30 years ago there would be a minimum of two crops per farming family but now because of waterlogging we have no more than one,\u201d he says. Each cage is owned by one home and yields about 15,000 taka (\u00a3135) in additional income for the families a year. It\u2019s also a consistent source of food, which could be vital if natural disaster hits. </p> \n<p>\u201cIn the last two years there was not too much rain but two years ago we were flooded,\u201d Mondal says. \u201cWe worry about the future. If there is heavy rainfall the water could remain logged for a long period of time and we would have to take shelter on main road.

They have a top cover to prevent fish jumping and escaping, or being caught by birds. With a capacity of one cubic metre, they hold up to 300 fish at a time. These cages are used for two growing seasons each year.</p> \n<p>The fish can be fed on scraps and waste \u2013 duckweed, oil cake, kitchen waste, rice bran and snails \u2013 and in just a few months they grow to full size.</p> \n<p>A woman standing beside Mondal goes down in a small wooden boat and pulls up the mesh cage, within which fish jump up and splutter around.

For the worried farmers in this area, the introduction of these cages has been reassuring, a constant amid a lot of inconsistency.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fb8f85be81d13422f6e3e83a1aec1d30e2af736\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fb8f85be81d13422f6e3e83a1aec1d30e2af736/0_166_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Villagers in Jessore district who are using mesh cages for fishing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Villagers in Jessore district who are using mesh cages for fishing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Marsh</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the nearby district of South Atulia another innovative technique has been employed. Land here is being used for fishing, with pools of water separated by a cracked mud path and spiky vegetation. Omal Biswas, 48, has three daughters and an adopted son. He used to farm rice once a year and during the monsoon he would fish in freshwater. Now he is able to make more money with dyke gardening techniques, growing vegetables around pools of water used for fishing.</p> \n<p>Omal has just harvested a crop, he says. They grow bottle gourd, chillis, indian spinach, red amaranth, sponge gourd, ridge gourd and tomatoes. \u201cBefore this technology was used I would yield around 20-25,000 taka a year but last year I harvested 120,000 taka through using different varieties of vegetables and growing more in the year.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow I can grow vegetables while fishing but I used to rotate the land. I eat the vegetables too,\u201d he adds. </p> \n<p>He adds that the additional income helps give them a better quality of life and now he has been able to buy six cows. \u201cThe cost of living is rising and the cost of production is increasing so it is a good portion of revenue,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Practical Action isn\u2019t the only charity supporting farmers. The <a href=\"https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P149553?lang=en\">National Agriculture Technology Program (NATP 2)</a> by the World Bank has also helped people adopt resilient farming methods.</p> \n<p>Farmers have deployed ancient agricultural methods such as floating beds, which involve sowing crops onto floating islands made of the fast-growing water hyacinth. Crops such as cucumbers, gourds and eggplants flourish. Beds are raised so as to lie above the reach of tidal surges. In between, trenches serve as pools to farm fish and ducks.</p> \n<p>Others have turned to shrimp farming after land was flooded but Practical Action has helped people do this in a more effective way.</p> \n<p>Rubina Khatun is one woman who has benefited from this. \u201cThe cyclone affected my family. I swam across flood waters with my two sons and took refuge on the road and sheltered in a shop we own for two months. Then we returned to our home,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Shrimp farming is now a major source of income for her family. The technique used to farm the shrimp more effectively includes using deeper water so the temperature does not change as quickly, and adding a fertiliser made from oil cake, date juice and sugar cane among other things.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4ec2e5e892c23f869498bdcfc907f66af2fa01fe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ec2e5e892c23f869498bdcfc907f66af2fa01fe/0_0_1440_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rubina Khatun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I am not sure what I would do without it now\u2019: Rubina Khatun farming shrimp.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Marsh</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI am not sure what I would do without it now,\u201d Khatun says. \u201cBut this type of farming is weather dependent. We need rain. If there is less rainfall salinity increases.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite efforts to improve the situation, Bangladesh remains at the mercy of sharp changes in weather patterns. Deep uncertainty persists for millions, even if these newfound techniques are helped to mitigate environmental impact.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am worried,\u201d Khatun says. \u201cToo much or too little rain, both are problematic.\u201d</p> \n<p>For her, however, the concept of climate change is a world away. \u201cI can feel it in terms of rain but I am not aware of this. I have heard non-government-organisations talking about it but just as a concept. All I know is shrimp farming is a major source of income out of all the ones remaining, so it\u2019s a reassurance.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Dulal Mondal, 70, a farmer, points halfway up the tree about two feet off the ground to indicate where the waters came the last time the area flooded. \u201cNext time if heavy rain comes I don\u2019t think water will recede as there is no natural draining or anywhere for it to go,\u201d he says. Mondal lives in the Jessore district of Bangladesh where increased levels of salt in the water, uneven rainfall and flooding are creating great uncertainty for a whole farming community. Bangladesh is one of dozens of countries on the frontline of the climate emergency. Here global heating is no theoretical calamity of the future, but a very real, present danger. By 2050, it is predicted that one in seven people in the country will be displaced by climate breakdown. The sea level is projected to rise by 50cm over this time period and Bangladesh may lose approximately 11% of its land. Deadly storms are usually a question of when, not if. Here, the climate crisis is so palpable that the debate is not about restricting carbon emissions or preventing global warming but about how to adapt to the change and survive in times of unpredictable weather. For example, Mondal says that where once his peers would farm mainly rice, now they have taken to fishing. They use floating cages, allowing fish to breed in a secure area. Also, if water levels rise, the cages will too, so flooding is less of an issue. \u201cAbout 20 to 30 years ago there would be a minimum of two crops per farming family but now because of waterlogging we have no more than one,\u201d he says. Each cage is owned by one home and yields about 15,000 taka (\u00a3135) in additional income for the families a year. It\u2019s also a consistent source of food, which could be vital if natural disaster hits. \u201cIn the last two years there was not too much rain but two years ago we were flooded,\u201d Mondal says. \u201cWe worry about the future. If there is heavy rainfall the water could remain logged for a long period of time and we would have to take shelter on main road. We would stay there with our remaining belongings.\u201d This farming evolution is just one element of a whole range of climate change adaptive practices taking root across southern Bangladesh, an area long prone to cyclones, rising sea levels and drought. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is investment in long-term development, to help people adapt to the effects that climate change is having now and help them to not only survive but thrive in their new climate reality,\u201d said Adib Hossain, the head of programmes implementation at Practical Action, one of the charities helping to make changes. In this part of Bangladesh they have helped introduce effective fertilisers to increase crop growth as well as growing fish in cages and vegetation in sacks or beside rivers \u2013 a novel farming technique known as a \u201cdyke garden\u201d. The cages are made using cheap materials. Bamboo poles form an outer frame that can float and is covered in netting. They have a top cover to prevent fish jumping and escaping, or being caught by birds. With a capacity of one cubic metre, they hold up to 300 fish at a time. These cages are used for two growing seasons each year. The fish can be fed on scraps and waste \u2013 duckweed, oil cake, kitchen waste, rice bran and snails \u2013 and in just a few months they grow to full size. A woman standing beside Mondal goes down in a small wooden boat and pulls up the mesh cage, within which fish jump up and splutter around. She drops the net and they swim around once more. For the worried farmers in this area, the introduction of these cages has been reassuring, a constant amid a lot of inconsistency. In the nearby district of South Atulia another innovative technique has been employed. Land here is being used for fishing, with pools of water separated by a cracked mud path and spiky vegetation. Omal Biswas, 48, has three daughters and an adopted son. He used to farm rice once a year and during the monsoon he would fish in freshwater. Now he is able to make more money with dyke gardening techniques, growing vegetables around pools of water used for fishing. Omal has just harvested a crop, he says. They grow bottle gourd, chillis, indian spinach, red amaranth, sponge gourd, ridge gourd and tomatoes. \u201cBefore this technology was used I would yield around 20-25,000 taka a year but last year I harvested 120,000 taka through using different varieties of vegetables and growing more in the year. \u201cNow I can grow vegetables while fishing but I used to rotate the land. I eat the vegetables too,\u201d he adds. He adds that the additional income helps give them a better quality of life and now he has been able to buy six cows. \u201cThe cost of living is rising and the cost of production is increasing so it is a good portion of revenue,\u201d he says. Practical Action isn\u2019t the only charity supporting farmers. The National Agriculture Technology Program (NATP 2) by the World Bank has also helped people adopt resilient farming methods. Farmers have deployed ancient agricultural methods such as floating beds, which involve sowing crops onto floating islands made of the fast-growing water hyacinth. Crops such as cucumbers, gourds and eggplants flourish. Beds are raised so as to lie above the reach of tidal surges. In between, trenches serve as pools to farm fish and ducks. Others have turned to shrimp farming after land was flooded but Practical Action has helped people do this in a more effective way. Rubina Khatun is one woman who has benefited from this. \u201cThe cyclone affected my family. I swam across flood waters with my two sons and took refuge on the road and sheltered in a shop we own for two months. Then we returned to our home,\u201d she says. Shrimp farming is now a major source of income for her family. The technique used to farm the shrimp more effectively includes using deeper water so the temperature does not change as quickly, and adding a fertiliser made from oil cake, date juice and sugar cane among other things. \u201cI am not sure what I would do without it now,\u201d Khatun says. \u201cBut this type of farming is weather dependent. We need rain. If there is less rainfall salinity increases.\u201d Despite efforts to improve the situation, Bangladesh remains at the mercy of sharp changes in weather patterns. Deep uncertainty persists for millions, even if these newfound techniques are helped to mitigate environmental impact. \u201cI am worried,\u201d Khatun says. \u201cToo much or too little rain, both are problematic.\u201d For her, however, the concept of climate change is a world away. \u201cI can feel it in terms of rain but I am not aware of this. I have heard non-government-organisations talking about it but just as a concept. All I know is shrimp farming is a major source of income out of all the ones remaining, so it\u2019s a reassurance.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

I now want to buy a home, but I am unable to get a mortgage because of the default, even though I have had no further issues with credit. This is keeping my son and me stuck in rented accommodation that we can ill afford, and is a painful reminder of what we have been through. I would like to explore whether the default could be removed from my file before the six years is up so we can move forward. GH, London This is a heart-rending story which exposes the shortcomings of the credit reporting system. The ability of potential lenders to scrutinise the reliability of applicants is what allows us to borrow, but the process is a blunt instrument that can see a single oversight ruin finances for six years after a default is settled. I\u2019ve heard from people unable to buy a home or take out a mobile phone because of \u00a310 or less they didn\u2019t know they owed. Credit reports show the default without the circumstances, which in cases such as yours are crucial, and you can\u2019t usually remove it unless you can prove an error. But you do have options. First, talk to your bank. In 2018 the Financial Abuse Code of Practice was introduced to help victims of coercive partners regain control of their money. It requires banks to train staff to recognise and help those in your situation, and 18 banks have so far signed up. Your bank may be willing to remove the default if you explain the background. If that fails, you can add what\u2019s known as a \u201cnotice of correction\u201d to your credit report with all three main credit reference agencies. This allows you to detail extenuating circumstances in up to 200 words. Experian reckons that someone with a solitary three-year-old default notice that has been paid off should be able to secure a mortgage with the help of a broker, although you may miss out on the cheapest deals. It\u2019s also worth consulting a free debt advice service such as StepChange. It says: \u201cIf your situation makes it difficult to make a phone call, some services, such as ourselves, offer advice over the internet, which can be more discreet.\u201d If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

      "body": "<p>Another lost election, another Labour leadership contest. And thanks to Ed Miliband\u2019s contentious one-person-one-vote reforms, that inevitably puts the focus back on the party\u2019s members. The most honest objection to the rules introduced under the reforms is that the right to choose the leader should never have been bestowed on the members. Not because they\u2019re cranks or extremists, but because of the party\u2019s composition \u2013 by definition, to have the surplus time and energy for monthly meetings and the annual conference puts you in a position of privilege. And this is borne out by <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2017/10/tim-bale-inside-labours-massive-membership-base/\" title=\"\">the numbers</a>: the majority of members are middle class, their average age 53. Why should that self-selecting band have rights in a two-party political system that others do not?</p> <p>I think the counter-argument is stronger: that a functioning democracy needs levers of pluralism, identifiable mechanisms by which anyone can influence the makeup and decisions of its representatives. The alternative is the so-called professionalisation of politics, whereby a much smaller group simply determines what the country wants or needs with the help of polling, focus groups and things they hear on the buses they pretend to travel on. This is a clear and straightforward debate, and as such is usually shelved in favour of a series of caricatures.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that the party can\u2019t take power again until all Momentum members are stamped out is simply fanciful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most commonly, the party is portrayed as having been taken over by a pincer movement of young extremists and the Trotskyist or Stalinist old guard (it is strange to have to look up, yet again, how you\u2019re supposed to tell those apart). Shortly after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s victory in the 2016 challenge from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/owen-smith-who-is-the-man-challenging-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership\" title=\"\">Owen Smith</a>, a \u201ccentrist\u201d in my constituency Labour party described how the radicals who had been painstakingly rooted out in the 1980s had come back, like head lice \u2013 as if the hard left was always lying in wait for the host to be weakened. </p> <p>Even if we accept that 1980s militants all saw their chance and came rushing back, this does not go any way towards explaining the extent of the support for Corbyn. For the interpretation to hold, the militants would have to have not only re-entered the party en masse, but instantly persuaded the so-called soft left to share their agenda.</p> <p>In 2015 and again in 2016, Corbyn was the only left candidate on the slate. Members had taken their medicine, as they were routinely advised in the Miliband era: they accepted the idea that not opposing austerity, not attacking even corrupt businesses, not protecting public services, was the price of a fiscally responsible reputation, without which the party was sunk. The self-styled pragmatists had had their way, and sunk the ship anyway.</p> <p>So when Corbyn stood against an array of status quo candidates \u2013 more of the same with extra heart (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/yvette-cooper\" title=\"\">Yvette Cooper</a>), more of the same with extra toughness (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liz-kendall\" title=\"\">Liz Kendall</a>), more of the same with longer eyelashes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham</a>) \u2013 his victory should hardly have come as a surprise. A lot of the more lurid exaggerations about the changes to the party\u2019s membership were really just cover for the embarrassment of those who had looked at a party with the same soft-left values it had always held, and failed to predict an entirely predictable thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/labour-unity-leadership-race\">After years of division, Labour unity is now a real possibility | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which brings us to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/momentum\" title=\"\">Momentum</a>, which is bedevilled by similar myth-making. At around 40,000 members, the group is just under a tenth the size of the overall party \u2013 but a tenth would be ample if it were the revolutionary sect, hellbent on getting rid of opponents, that it\u2019s often portrayed as. There are certainly constituency parties where this picture is correct, where Momentum members did pore over the rule book trying to deselect their MP.</p> <p>But there are also Momentum groups which are essentially Labour-plus, social and intellectual movements whose members run book groups and club nights as well as attending meetings. They cooperate perfectly well with the rest of the party, since their differences are of taste, not ideology. The idea that the party can\u2019t take power again until these people are stamped out is simply fanciful. By what test would you eject them? \u201cYour food bank fundraiser quiz night had too many questions on grime\u201d?</p> <p>The view that the party\u2019s composition has to change before it can learn from its mistakes remains fairly niche. Instead, the distortions tend to act as signposts in the leadership contest, all pointing in wild directions: the claim that the members, defined by blind loyalty, will only accept the continuity candidate; or the members, guided by rigid principle, will only accept a woman; or they will only take a northerner. Not only are these precepts wrong, they are also boring, seeking to reduce to a flow chart of predetermined loyalties what is actually a contest of ideas.</p> <p>The drive to portray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rebecca-long-bailey\" title=\"\">Rebecca Long-Bailey</a> as the candidate of the authentic left, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jess-phillips\" title=\"\">Jess Phillips</a> as the true centre, is more about power blocs than politics \u2013 a move to retain power by the existing inner circle on one side, and retake it by the pragmatists of yesteryear on the other. But the other candidates (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\" title=\"\">Keir Starmer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/clive-lewis\" title=\"\">Clive Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/emily-thornberry\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">Lisa Nandy</a>) are all giving versions of modern leftwing analysis that are genuinely different, and have the potential to coexist and cross-pollinate \u2013 because they are about ideas, not control.</p> <p>That\u2019s the big distortion of this leadership election: the idea that it is dominated by bitter infighting and savage power play. In fact, having transparent debates about competing visions for the future, and then voting on them, is what keeps the party alive.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Another lost election, another Labour leadership contest. And thanks to Ed Miliband\u2019s contentious one-person-one-vote reforms, that inevitably puts the focus back on the party\u2019s members. The most honest objection to the rules introduced under the reforms is that the right to choose the leader should never have been bestowed on the members. Not because they\u2019re cranks or extremists, but because of the party\u2019s composition \u2013 by definition, to have the surplus time and energy for monthly meetings and the annual conference puts you in a position of privilege. And this is borne out by the numbers: the majority of members are middle class, their average age 53. Why should that self-selecting band have rights in a two-party political system that others do not? I think the counter-argument is stronger: that a functioning democracy needs levers of pluralism, identifiable mechanisms by which anyone can influence the makeup and decisions of its representatives. The alternative is the so-called professionalisation of politics, whereby a much smaller group simply determines what the country wants or needs with the help of polling, focus groups and things they hear on the buses they pretend to travel on. This is a clear and straightforward debate, and as such is usually shelved in favour of a series of caricatures. Most commonly, the party is portrayed as having been taken over by a pincer movement of young extremists and the Trotskyist or Stalinist old guard (it is strange to have to look up, yet again, how you\u2019re supposed to tell those apart). Shortly after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s victory in the 2016 challenge from Owen Smith, a \u201ccentrist\u201d in my constituency Labour party described how the radicals who had been painstakingly rooted out in the 1980s had come back, like head lice \u2013 as if the hard left was always lying in wait for the host to be weakened. Even if we accept that 1980s militants all saw their chance and came rushing back, this does not go any way towards explaining the extent of the support for Corbyn. For the interpretation to hold, the militants would have to have not only re-entered the party en masse, but instantly persuaded the so-called soft left to share their agenda. In 2015 and again in 2016, Corbyn was the only left candidate on the slate. Members had taken their medicine, as they were routinely advised in the Miliband era: they accepted the idea that not opposing austerity, not attacking even corrupt businesses, not protecting public services, was the price of a fiscally responsible reputation, without which the party was sunk. The self-styled pragmatists had had their way, and sunk the ship anyway. So when Corbyn stood against an array of status quo candidates \u2013 more of the same with extra heart (Yvette Cooper), more of the same with extra toughness (Liz Kendall), more of the same with longer eyelashes (Andy Burnham) \u2013 his victory should hardly have come as a surprise. A lot of the more lurid exaggerations about the changes to the party\u2019s membership were really just cover for the embarrassment of those who had looked at a party with the same soft-left values it had always held, and failed to predict an entirely predictable thing. Which brings us to Momentum, which is bedevilled by similar myth-making. At around 40,000 members, the group is just under a tenth the size of the overall party \u2013 but a tenth would be ample if it were the revolutionary sect, hellbent on getting rid of opponents, that it\u2019s often portrayed as. There are certainly constituency parties where this picture is correct, where Momentum members did pore over the rule book trying to deselect their MP. But there are also Momentum groups which are essentially Labour-plus, social and intellectual movements whose members run book groups and club nights as well as attending meetings. They cooperate perfectly well with the rest of the party, since their differences are of taste, not ideology. The idea that the party can\u2019t take power again until these people are stamped out is simply fanciful. By what test would you eject them? \u201cYour food bank fundraiser quiz night had too many questions on grime\u201d? The view that the party\u2019s composition has to change before it can learn from its mistakes remains fairly niche. Instead, the distortions tend to act as signposts in the leadership contest, all pointing in wild directions: the claim that the members, defined by blind loyalty, will only accept the continuity candidate; or the members, guided by rigid principle, will only accept a woman; or they will only take a northerner. Not only are these precepts wrong, they are also boring, seeking to reduce to a flow chart of predetermined loyalties what is actually a contest of ideas. The drive to portray Rebecca Long-Bailey as the candidate of the authentic left, and Jess Phillips as the true centre, is more about power blocs than politics \u2013 a move to retain power by the existing inner circle on one side, and retake it by the pragmatists of yesteryear on the other. But the other candidates (Keir Starmer, Clive Lewis, Emily Thornberry and Lisa Nandy) are all giving versions of modern leftwing analysis that are genuinely different, and have the potential to coexist and cross-pollinate \u2013 because they are about ideas, not control. That\u2019s the big distortion of this leadership election: the idea that it is dominated by bitter infighting and savage power play. In fact, having transparent debates about competing visions for the future, and then voting on them, is what keeps the party alive. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Caroline Stevens first had contact with the National Autistic Society in 1997 after calling its helpline. The information she acquired helped her to get a diagnosis for her son Jack, then just over two years old. Stevens joined a local NAS branch, run by volunteers. There, she learned about autism and found practical help and support from other parents following the diagnosis \u2013 a time when, she says, \u201cyou feel quite isolated and alone\u201d. Jack was diagnosed with autism, a learning disability, a sensory processing disorder and a sleep disorder. He cannot speak. She adds: \u201cIt was very difficult for him growing up, and we experienced a lot of the challenges that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/18/10-ways-to-help-the-parent-of-a-child-with-autism\" title=\"\">many families go through</a>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/12/scandalous-detention-learning-disabled-people-review\">The scandalous detention of learning disabled people won't be stopped by a review | Dan Scorer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Jack is 25 and Stevens is now the <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/media-centre/news/2019-06-28-new-ceo-announced.aspx\" title=\"\">NAS chief executive</a>. She arrived in post in November, just after the general election campaign had kicked off. The <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/media-centre/news/2019-11-29-general-election-manifestos.aspx\" title=\"\">three main parties\u2019 manifestos</a> all included specific mentions of autism. The Conservatives pledged to \u201cmake it easier for people with learning disabilities and autism to be discharged from hospital and improve how they are treated in law\u201d, and promised \u00a374m over three years for additional capacity in community care settings.</p> <p>Stevens says these are both a priority, given the countless media stories highlighting \u201cthe scandal of autistic people stuck inappropriately in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/17/secure-mental-health-unit-matthew-garnett-autism\" title=\"\">mental health hospitals</a>\u201d. The NAS will track where the new money is spent and push for increased funding across the entire social care system, she says. Reviewing mental health law, which makes it \u201ctoo easy\u201d to deprive autistic people of their liberty, is also crucial. Other Tory pledges include a new cross-government strategy for disabled people, and special educational needs funding. \u201cOur charity will be making sure that these are all taken forward in a way that can help transform autistic people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Stevens.</p> <p>Commitments made by the last Tory government include an autism awareness campaign, and a new autism strategy for England that will include children for the first time. The NAS expects publication of the strategy in the coming months.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to see a new all-age autism strategy that not only sets ambitious goals for improving support, but sets out an achievable \u2013 and funded \u2013 plan for reaching them. This is vital to create a society that works for autistic people.\u201d</p> <p>Stevens\u2019 role is the result of her decision to make supporting autistic people part of her professional as well as her personal life. Her son\u2019s \u201cvery high levels of support needs\u201d meant that she \u201chad to fight for pretty much all the support all the way through\u201d. She switched from hospital management to the voluntary sector, and later became chief executive of a pan-disability charity for children and young people. She realised just how many other people were struggling. \u201cWhat saddened and disappointed me was that, up and down the country, there are thousands and thousands of families struggling with the lack of services and support. It shouldn\u2019t be like this. What my family had been through gave me the fight and passion to try to change things.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Up and down the country, there are thousands of families struggling with the lack of services and support</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With almost 3,000 staff and <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer.aspx\" title=\"\">2,000 volunteers</a> across the UK, the NAS delivers a variety of services, including schools and residential supported living, to autistic people with complex support needs. The other part of its mission is to influence policy and change attitudes towards autism. Awareness of autism has \u201cincreased massively\u201d over the years, but, Stevens says, the NAS defines autism as \u201ca lifelong, developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to other people, and how they experience the world around them\u201d. She cites a recent NAS campaign to increase understanding of what it\u2019s like to be autistic, <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/campaign/tmi.aspx\" title=\"\">Too Much Information</a>, but admits that there is \u201cstill a long way to go ... there is a big job to be done about ensuring that professionals, as well as the general public, have a greater understanding of autism.\u201d</p> <p>The challenge was laid bare in a recent joint inquiry with the all-party parliamentary group on autism (APPGA), <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/campaign/not-enough.aspx\" title=\"\">The Autism Act: 10 Years On</a>, which looked at the impact of the landmark legislation for autistic adults in England. The overwhelming picture that emerged was \u201cone of deeply concerning unmet need\u201d, with the support available going backwards. Stevens explains: \u201c\u201cIf there is greater understanding around the needs and challenges of autistic people, then professionals will know and understand what services need to be in place as well.\u201d</p> <p>Only 21% of councils in England are fully complying with the legal duty to provide autism training to all health and care staff. Just prior to the general election, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/all-inpatients-with-learning-disability-or-autism-to-be-given-case-reviews\" title=\"\">government announced \u00a31.4m</a> to trial mandatory training for every NHS and social care worker prior to a wider rollout. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough, but it\u2019s a start,\u201d says Stevens. Rolling it out nationally would require more resources, she says, and there would need to be clarity on who would foot the costs.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just training that is crucial, but ensuring that services are tailored to meet autistic people\u2019s needs. What autistic people desperately need are more community-based services, such as day services to avoid social isolation, she explains. \u201cBeing stuck at home with nothing to do and no one to see will impact on a person\u2019s wellbeing, and may lead to a \u2018crisis point\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to intervene early.\u201d</p> <p>Research shows that almost eight in 10 autistic adults will <a href=\"https://www.autistica.org.uk/news/5-ways-the-government-can-transform-mental-health-in-autism\" title=\"\">experience mental health problems</a> during their lifetime. The lack of community-based mental health services see many end up in crisis, and a growing number are admitted to mental health hospitals, as it is the only form of care they can access. Often they get stuck there because of that very lack of community-based support. It is, says Stevens, a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d.</p> <p>Moreover, the definition of autism as a mental disorder within the Mental Health Act means that autistic people can be inappropriately detained in hospitals against their and their family\u2019s will, sometimes for years. A report by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/01/mps-call-for-mental-health-reforms-to-stop-horrific-detention-of-young-people\" title=\"\">published last month</a>, called for the legislation to be overhauled. The government then promised that all 2,250 inpatients with learning disabilities and autism in mental health hospitals will have their care reviewed within 12 months. Stevens says this should be happening anyway.</p> <p>The NHS long-term plan has a commitment to <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/nhs-long-term-plan-explained#mentalhealth\" title=\"\">improve community mental health support</a> and halve the number of autistic people and people with learning disabilities in inpatient settings by 2023-24. Achievable? \u201cIf there is a true commitment, then yes, but that needs to be funded and there needs to be action,\u201d says Stevens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/autistic-people-not-superheroes-not-tragic\">Autistic people are not all superheroes, but we\u2019re not all tragic, either | Ellen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the election is over, Stevens is clear there is an opportunity to hold all parties to account on making sure autism is a priority.

She adds: \u201cIt was very difficult for him growing up, and we experienced a lot of the challenges that many families go through.\u201d Now Jack is 25 and Stevens is now the NAS chief executive. She arrived in post in November, just after the general election campaign had kicked off. The three main parties\u2019 manifestos all included specific mentions of autism. The Conservatives pledged to \u201cmake it easier for people with learning disabilities and autism to be discharged from hospital and improve how they are treated in law\u201d, and promised \u00a374m over three years for additional capacity in community care settings. Stevens says these are both a priority, given the countless media stories highlighting \u201cthe scandal of autistic people stuck inappropriately in mental health hospitals\u201d. The NAS will track where the new money is spent and push for increased funding across the entire social care system, she says. Reviewing mental health law, which makes it \u201ctoo easy\u201d to deprive autistic people of their liberty, is also crucial. Other Tory pledges include a new cross-government strategy for disabled people, and special educational needs funding. \u201cOur charity will be making sure that these are all taken forward in a way that can help transform autistic people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Stevens. Commitments made by the last Tory government include an autism awareness campaign, and a new autism strategy for England that will include children for the first time. The NAS expects publication of the strategy in the coming months. \u201cWe want to see a new all-age autism strategy that not only sets ambitious goals for improving support, but sets out an achievable \u2013 and funded \u2013 plan for reaching them. This is vital to create a society that works for autistic people.\u201d Stevens\u2019 role is the result of her decision to make supporting autistic people part of her professional as well as her personal life. Her son\u2019s \u201cvery high levels of support needs\u201d meant that she \u201chad to fight for pretty much all the support all the way through\u201d. She switched from hospital management to the voluntary sector, and later became chief executive of a pan-disability charity for children and young people. She realised just how many other people were struggling. \u201cWhat saddened and disappointed me was that, up and down the country, there are thousands and thousands of families struggling with the lack of services and support. It shouldn\u2019t be like this. What my family had been through gave me the fight and passion to try to change things.\u201d With almost 3,000 staff and 2,000 volunteers across the UK, the NAS delivers a variety of services, including schools and residential supported living, to autistic people with complex support needs. The other part of its mission is to influence policy and change attitudes towards autism. Awareness of autism has \u201cincreased massively\u201d over the years, but, Stevens says, the NAS defines autism as \u201ca lifelong, developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to other people, and how they experience the world around them\u201d. She cites a recent NAS campaign to increase understanding of what it\u2019s like to be autistic, Too Much Information, but admits that there is \u201cstill a long way to go ... there is a big job to be done about ensuring that professionals, as well as the general public, have a greater understanding of autism.\u201d The challenge was laid bare in a recent joint inquiry with the all-party parliamentary group on autism (APPGA), The Autism Act: 10 Years On, which looked at the impact of the landmark legislation for autistic adults in England. The overwhelming picture that emerged was \u201cone of deeply concerning unmet need\u201d, with the support available going backwards. Stevens explains: \u201c\u201cIf there is greater understanding around the needs and challenges of autistic people, then professionals will know and understand what services need to be in place as well.\u201d Only 21% of councils in England are fully complying with the legal duty to provide autism training to all health and care staff. Just prior to the general election, the government announced \u00a31.4m to trial mandatory training for every NHS and social care worker prior to a wider rollout. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough, but it\u2019s a start,\u201d says Stevens. Rolling it out nationally would require more resources, she says, and there would need to be clarity on who would foot the costs. It\u2019s not just training that is crucial, but ensuring that services are tailored to meet autistic people\u2019s needs. What autistic people desperately need are more community-based services, such as day services to avoid social isolation, she explains. \u201cBeing stuck at home with nothing to do and no one to see will impact on a person\u2019s wellbeing, and may lead to a \u2018crisis point\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to intervene early.\u201d Research shows that almost eight in 10 autistic adults will experience mental health problems during their lifetime. The lack of community-based mental health services see many end up in crisis, and a growing number are admitted to mental health hospitals, as it is the only form of care they can access. Often they get stuck there because of that very lack of community-based support. It is, says Stevens, a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d. Moreover, the definition of autism as a mental disorder within the Mental Health Act means that autistic people can be inappropriately detained in hospitals against their and their family\u2019s will, sometimes for years. A report by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights, published last month, called for the legislation to be overhauled. The government then promised that all 2,250 inpatients with learning disabilities and autism in mental health hospitals will have their care reviewed within 12 months. Stevens says this should be happening anyway. The NHS long-term plan has a commitment to improve community mental health support and halve the number of autistic people and people with learning disabilities in inpatient settings by 2023-24. Achievable? \u201cIf there is a true commitment, then yes, but that needs to be funded and there needs to be action,\u201d says Stevens. Now the election is over, Stevens is clear there is an opportunity to hold all parties to account on making sure autism is a priority. Stevens\u2019 mission is clear: \u201cTo create a society that works for autistic people.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 50. Family: Married, three sons including Jack, who is autistic.

From her statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Firstly we urge the federal government to increase the disaster recovery payments to individuals from $1,000 to up to $3,000 for people who have been adversely affected by a major disaster and from $400 to $1,000 per child. These payments have not been increased since 2006. We are very concerned that the current payments are seriously inadequate, particularly for people on lower incomes and with fewer assets, family and friends to secure transport, alternative housing options and immediate recovery resources. </p> <p>Secondly, we recommend that the government allocate immediately an additional $30m in funding to food relief community sector organisations to respond to the surge in need which is likely to continue for many months. </p> <p>We welcome the decision to suspend debt recovery and mutual obligation arrangements for people receiving income support in bushfire-affected areas for two months. However, we must ensure this applies to volunteer firefighters who reside outside affected areas. We also call on the federal government to suspend the quarantining of income support payments through debit cards for people affected by these disasters, noting the challenges accessing Eftpos at this time.</p> <p>Importantly, key to our future response to disasters like these bushfires must be action on climate change.

But as always Australians will bounce back. Over the past 28 years, Australia has regularly experienced bushfires, drought, floods and cyclones. Some events have weighed on economic activity. But there has also been the recovery as Australians rebuild and attempt to resume some form of normality.</li> <li>The bushfires and drought will keep upward pressure on food prices.</li> <li>The bushfires and eastern Australian drought are occurring at a time when consumer and business spending is restrained. So the natural disasters could have a longer-term impact. The chances of recession have lifted. So the onus is on state and federal governments to respond together with the Reserve Bank.</li> <li>The Australian fires, the smoke and the drought have had significant international attention. And the natural disasters of fire and drought have had a much wider geographical impact on Australia than events in the past. As a result there could be short- to medium-term negative effects on tourism \u2013 especially as budding tourists add smoke haze to the list of factors they weigh up when deciding potential holiday destinations.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T05:06:21.035Z\">at 5.06am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e155d6e8f085eda5c1140f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T04:42:00.263Z\">4.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Victoria\u2019s emergency services minister, <strong>Lisa Neville</strong>,<strong> </strong>has confirmed the death of <strong>Matt Kavanagh.</strong></p> <p>She is expected to hold a press conference very soon. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T04:45:38.674Z\">at 4.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e155d1d8f087e8308e6a781\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T04:40:34.984Z\">4.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Third person added to Victorian fire death toll</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Daniel Andrews mentioned this accident earlier this week:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1214767545347014656\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Death toll in Victorian fires has risen to 3.

I would simply say a few things. One is that I\u2019d call upon all parties to exercise restraint. </p> <p>The actions of the United States have led to another response from Iran. This is potentially very dangerous indeed. </p> <p>And I<strong> don\u2019t want to see Australia drawn into a military conflict in the Middle East.</strong> </p> <p>And I think that the first priority, I agree with the prime minister in our discussion, the first priority should be ensuring that Australians are kept safe. </p> <p>The Australians are located very close to where the Americans are located in the area that\u2019s been targeted in Iraq. So they\u2019re just next door. And certainly, in terms of <strong>Angus Campbell</strong>, the head of the Australian Defence Force, the priority has been ensuring that Australians are kept safe.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T03:38:35.633Z\">at 3.38am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e154d0e8f087e8308e6a74e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-08T03:32:27.248Z\">3.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> was asked about Labor\u2019s position on coal during today\u2019s press conference:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we need is policies, not slogans.

      "bodyText": "With that sad news, we will wrap up the blog today. Conditions will worsen tomorrow in South Australia, and on Friday in New South Wales and Victoria, according to fire authorities. We\u2019ve written a full story on that here: Today: Victorian authorities confirmed that a third person had died. The emergency minister, Lisa Neville, told residents of the state\u2019s north to \u201cleave early\u201d ahead of Friday\u2019s worse conditions. The total area burnt across the country rose to 10.7m hectares \u2013 an area larger than Portugal. The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, busted myths around \u201cgreenies\u201d and hazard reduction burns \u2013 as misinformation spread online. Labor called for a national audit into an estimated billion animal deaths. We\u2019ll be back following developments tomorrow. Thanks for reading and stay safe. New figures have been released today by QFES that, sadly, brings the total area burned this fire season to 10.7m hectares nationwide. That\u2019s larger than Portugal or South Korea. It was previously 8.4m. A QFES official told Guardian Australia they had time to do \u201ca more comprehensive survey\u201d of burnt areas, now that fires there had died down over the past few days. Their new figures are that 2.5m have been burned in Queensland alone since 1 August. Fire danger warnings are out for South Australia. Six severe danger areas tomorrow. And by Thursday and Friday, smoke haze from the Victorian fires will likely reach Tasmania, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Residents of New South Wales may also have noticed poor air quality has descended across the state today. In Sydney, large parts of the city registered over 200 on NSW Health\u2019s air quality index, while Wollongong reached 458, Goulburn reached 435 and Albury reached 456. Over 200 is considered hazardous by NSW Health. And here\u2019s the Australian cricket captain Tim Paine and spinner Nathan Lyon meeting RFS volunteers in Wingello in the southern highlands. Hi all, Naaman here taking over the blog. Thanks again to Amy for her work today. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has called for a national ecological audit \u2013 conducted by all state and territory environment ministers \u2013 to ascertain how many animals have been killed in the fires. Estimates from the University of Sydney\u2019s Chris Dickman say a billion animals have died. According to Dickman, these calculations themselves are based on \u201chighly conservative estimates\u201d of animal populations in the affected areas \u2013 so could be higher. Albanese is also calling for more funding to the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, which studies bushfire prevention. I am going to leave you with Naaman Zhou for the remainder of the afternoon. Just to reiterate \u2013 fire conditions are set to return to dangerous levels from tomorrow. Please follow authorities\u2019 advice and, particularly if you are in the north-east of Victoria or within the region of the Kangaroo Island fire, please consider leaving now. Take care of you. Earlier, Labor suggested the nation\u2019s environment ministers get together to conduct a national audit of wildlife and environment lost in the bushfires. The Greens MP Sarah Hanson-Young has also suggested a \u201cfighting fund\u201d be established to help wildlife recover: We are facing half a billion animals lost from these fires right across the country and millions of hectares of habitat destroyed impacting survival and recovery of native species that are left. We need a fighting fund to restore the environment. The PM needs to commit proper funding to protect those animals that have survived and to restore their habitat. People are rightly asking, \u2018where is the environment minister?\u2019 The hundreds of volunteers fighting to save injured and homeless wildlife need to know what the Australian government is going to do to help them. It is vital for the tourism of the affected regions, whether it\u2019s Kangaroo Island, the Adelaide Hills, the south coast of NSW or East Gippsland, and it would be a jobs creator to do it. People I spoke to on KI want to invest in rebuilding their island but it\u2019s not just about bricks and mortar, it\u2019s also about the very thing people come to KI to see \u2013 the environment, the habitat of those animals and the pristine wilderness area. Once these fires are finally put out and people have started piecing their lives back together, we don\u2019t want the PM\u2019s focus to fall. These communities cannot keep bearing the brunt of the climate emergency. Australians want relief and a commitment to rebuild right now, but they also want political leaders to stand up and take action on climate change because we have to adapt, we have to mitigate and we have to be prepared to take those decisions that are going to not make climate change worse. The last thing we need is political leaders with their heads buried in the sand. This is the moment we need to use to take the necessary actions and we need to do it now. Further on from what we were saying about disaster payments being made tax-free, Josh Frydenberg has released this update: The Morrison government will ensure that disaster relief payments being made to individuals and businesses impacted by the devastating bushfires are tax exempt. This decision will ensure that every dollar that is paid out to affected individuals, businesses and primary producers goes to supporting them during these difficult times and to rebuilding their livelihoods. Notably, the exemption will extend to payments such as: Disaster Recovery Allowance payments made to individuals; and payments that would otherwise be taxable under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements, such as grants that may be made to small businesses and primary producers. This follows on from an announcement by the prime minister on 29 December 2019 that the payments being made to eligible Rural Fire Service volunteers will be free from tax. Legislation to give effect to these changes will be required as was the case to give effect to similar tax exemptions in relation to the north Queensland floods. The legislation will be introduced in the next sitting of parliament. This action comes on top of the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s (ATO) ongoing support, including the automatic deferral of lodgement and payment obligations for individuals and businesses in communities affected by the bushfires. Further information on the support being provided by the ATO can be found at ato.gov.au/naturaldisasters. Impacted individuals or businesses can also contact the ATO\u2019s Emergency Support Infoline on 1800 806 218. Because we could all do with a pick-me-up, here\u2019s some footage of a firefighter returning home to his family after almost two weeks away: The Asthma Council wants the government to change \u2013 and standardise the way we measure air quality, and invest in real-time reporting, given the hazardous air conditions across the country: What\u2019s deeply concerning is that all Australian states and territories have different approaches to sharing air quality information. There is no national requirement for real-time air quality reporting of the harmful PM2.5 fine particle pollutants found in bushfire smoke. Bushfire smoke fluctuates rapidly. Information and advice based on average concentrations of PM2.5 over a 24-hour period is not helpful. Side effects can be experienced as soon as pollution levels begin to increase \u2013 they do not wait 24 hours. ... There is no safe level of PM2.5. It is critical reporting data provides useful information to guide the serious decisions people and organisations need to make to protect public health. While especially dangerous, even life-threatening, to people with asthma and respiratory problems, PM2.5 impacts even people who previously did not have such health problems. The Australian Council of Social Service CEO, Cassandra Goldie, has asked the government to increase the individual disaster recovery payments. From her statement: Firstly we urge the federal government to increase the disaster recovery payments to individuals from $1,000 to up to $3,000 for people who have been adversely affected by a major disaster and from $400 to $1,000 per child. These payments have not been increased since 2006. We are very concerned that the current payments are seriously inadequate, particularly for people on lower incomes and with fewer assets, family and friends to secure transport, alternative housing options and immediate recovery resources. Secondly, we recommend that the government allocate immediately an additional $30m in funding to food relief community sector organisations to respond to the surge in need which is likely to continue for many months. We welcome the decision to suspend debt recovery and mutual obligation arrangements for people receiving income support in bushfire-affected areas for two months. However, we must ensure this applies to volunteer firefighters who reside outside affected areas. We also call on the federal government to suspend the quarantining of income support payments through debit cards for people affected by these disasters, noting the challenges accessing Eftpos at this time. Importantly, key to our future response to disasters like these bushfires must be action on climate change. Australia must strengthen its own response to the climate crisis, and take a global leadership role on climate change. Acoss has also established a \u2018how to help\u2019 guide, you\u2019ll find here. Lizzo is in Australia and has put herself to work helping volunteers in Victoria: \u201cI am just stunned and I would ask them to reconsider \u2013 there is a time for protests, and it is not this Friday,\u201d says Lisa Neville to protesters who plan to continue their climate protest on Friday. Neville says it is not about the issue, but because police are already stretched across fire-ravaged communities, and the state needs them to keep doing that and not be called back to Melbourne to monitor the protest. Andrew Crisp says authorities are also worried about new fires, with thunderstorms expected, which can also bring lightning risks. Matt Kavanagh was killed while working on preventing new fires from starting. On the day he died, he had extinguished seven unattended camp fires, preventing other blazes from taking hold. Across the other states: QUEENSLAND 19 bushfires across the state 2.5m hectares burnt 48 homes confirmed destroyed WESTERN AUSTRALIA 32 bushfires burning in the Goldfield-Esperance region, Wheatbelt, Pilbara, Perth region and south-east 1.7m hectares burnt One home confirmed destroyed TASMANIA 14 bushfires burning across the state\u2019s north, east and south More than 32,000 hectares burnt Two homes confirmed destroyed ACT No fires burning NORTHERN TERRITORY No bushfires burning Five homes confirmed destroyed Here is the situation on Wednesday afternoon, state by state: (via AAP) NSW 20 people dead 119 fires continue to burn with up to 50 uncontained Almost 5m hectares burned - equal to the metro areas of the five mainland state capitals 1,687 homes confirmed destroyed, more than 3300 outbuildings and 168 facilities razed VICTORIA Three people dead (including forest fire management firefighter, Matt Kavanagh) 12 bushfires burning in the Gippsland, north-east and alpine regions More than 1.2m hectares burnt More than 200 homes confirmed destroyed with total expected to rise SOUTH AUSTRALIA Three people dead Six fires burning on Kangaroo Island More than 274,000 hectares burnt 161 homes confirmed destroyed, along with 413 sheds and outhouses Just an update \u2013 Friday will bring the next big fire threat. If you are in a fire zone, authorities are recommending you leave now. Fire behavioural analysts are coming in to help Victorian authorities predict the path of the fire, given we have seen bushfires exceed the worst-case scenario modelling. Andrew Crisp, the Victorian emergency management chief, says that Victoria has asked for more help from the US: We are always planning for what the future looks like for us, so we have basically placed an order for another 140 people from North America. Again some remote and arduous firefighters, but also those who can work in the incident management teams. Again, we expect to see them arrive in the next one to two weeks, so we\u2019re always planning ahead in relation to what we are doing, in relation to the fires at the moment. Authorities are getting stronger in their messages to people at risk from the fires \u2013 they are telling people to get out ahead of Friday\u2019s worsening conditions. There are no mandatory evacuations as yet, but they could come. In the meantime, the advice is to go, as far ahead in advance of Friday as is possible. Lisa Neville: We will see conditions of extreme and severe, particularly in the north country and north-east of Victoria, and the north-east where we have going fires at the moment, and very high in East Gippsland. One of the differences that we are seeing compared to last week when we issued the evacuation order is that the humidity will be higher than it was last week. So, instead of being below 5, we are looking at around 15 and higher in some other areas, particularly some of the alpine areas. This absolutely makes a difference to the forest fire danger index, and that\u2019s why today they are very similar to conditions that we experienced Sunday a week ago, and that\u2019s why the message is the same as we issued then, that is people should leave those fire-impacted areas, the safest place to be is outside those areas and to be in built-up areas. For those who aren\u2019t choosing to leave, again the message is absolutely follow the warnings, follow the advice, sit on your Vic Emergency app, follow your local radio stations, get the most up-to-date information. That would also be for all Victorians, so we know that we are going to have another round of dry lightning come through, and with the northerly and with the strong southerly change, that can potentially see fast-moving fires, grass and forest in other parts of Victoria that are also very dry, so like the northern country, for example. So again, just really clearly for Victorians, those in the fire-affected areas, our strong advice is that the safest place to be is outside those fire-impacted areas, and you should leave and leave early before Friday conditions. Lisa Neville: Matt was a dedicated and respected member of Forest Fire Management Victoria for around 10 years and was on duty as part of our fire response on the day. He is being remembered for his friendly and welcoming nature, his passion for the environment, and nature, and his love of fly-fishing. Lisa Neville says the crash that claimed Matt Kavanagh, a married father of two, happened last Friday, but a police investigation has now confirmed it was a fire-related death. Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighter Matt Kavanagh was on duty when he and his colleague were involved in a two-vehicle crash on the Goulburn Valley Highway. Tragically the 43-year-old couldn\u2019t be revived and died at the scene, while his colleague was taken to hospital in a stable condition and has since been released. Our thoughts are with Matt\u2019s colleagues and family, including his wife and children \u2013 Jude, his wife, and Ruben and Kate, his children. This news has come as a huge shock to the entire emergency management community in the midst of ongoing fire. Staff are being supported through that process. The CBA\u2019s chief economist has had a look at the impact of the fires on the wider Australian community. Here are some of the takeaways: What are the implications? The extensive bushfires have extracted a horrible toll on lives and property. But as always Australians will bounce back. Over the past 28 years, Australia has regularly experienced bushfires, drought, floods and cyclones. Some events have weighed on economic activity. But there has also been the recovery as Australians rebuild and attempt to resume some form of normality. The bushfires and drought will keep upward pressure on food prices. The bushfires and eastern Australian drought are occurring at a time when consumer and business spending is restrained. So the natural disasters could have a longer-term impact. The chances of recession have lifted. So the onus is on state and federal governments to respond together with the Reserve Bank. The Australian fires, the smoke and the drought have had significant international attention. And the natural disasters of fire and drought have had a much wider geographical impact on Australia than events in the past. As a result there could be short- to medium-term negative effects on tourism \u2013 especially as budding tourists add smoke haze to the list of factors they weigh up when deciding potential holiday destinations. Victoria\u2019s emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, has confirmed the death of Matt Kavanagh. She is expected to hold a press conference very soon. Daniel Andrews mentioned this accident earlier this week: South Australian authorities are giving a warning to residents of Vivonne Bay on Kangaroo Island \u2013 it\u2019s a pre-emptive warning, in case the fire breaks its containment lines in tomorrow\u2019s more dangerous fire conditions. The fire is not headed there now, but authorities are worried it will head there very, very quickly if the fire gets past the control lines. Just a reminder that tomorrow will bring the start of dangerous fire conditions once again. We have had a brief reprieve in some areas, but temperatures in some parts are going to hit 40C again by Friday. On top of that, is a return of the winds. It is not expected to be as bad as what was seen on New Year\u2019s Day, but it\u2019s not great either. Air quality continues to be a problem across large regions of Australia: We are starting to get a look at Mallacoota. For those who missed it, the government is working on some legislative changes to ensure disaster relief payments are not taxed. Debt recovery has also been suspended for both Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office (for at least two months). Richard Marx has come up with a fundraiser of his own: Cher has also announced a donation: And this is what the opposition leader had to say about the Iraq situation: Look, these are very dangerous circumstances. I spoke to the prime minister this morning about the events that have occurred. It\u2019s unclear some of that detail and so we would expect to get a further detailed briefing today. I know the national security committee will be meeting tomorrow. And I\u2019ll be having a discussion with our shadow national security committee here in Adelaide tomorrow about the latest events. I would simply say a few things. One is that I\u2019d call upon all parties to exercise restraint. The actions of the United States have led to another response from Iran. This is potentially very dangerous indeed. And I don\u2019t want to see Australia drawn into a military conflict in the Middle East. And I think that the first priority, I agree with the prime minister in our discussion, the first priority should be ensuring that Australians are kept safe. The Australians are located very close to where the Americans are located in the area that\u2019s been targeted in Iraq. So they\u2019re just next door. And certainly, in terms of Angus Campbell, the head of the Australian Defence Force, the priority has been ensuring that Australians are kept safe. Anthony Albanese was asked about Labor\u2019s position on coal during today\u2019s press conference: What we need is policies, not slogans. And I\u2019ve been consistent about that. I continue to believe we need a strong climate change policy, not just a two-word slogan. And that is important. If you stop, just like if you stopped burning coal today in Australia immediately, then the lights that are running this centre would go off. Because we still rely upon coal-fire as well as renewable energy. Even here in South Australia that because of the former Labor government has led the way across the country. Labor will take strong action. But we won\u2019t also argue, as some would imply, that you can just flick a switch and change immediately. What you need to do is transition to a system whereby you have less emissions, you need to do that domestically. But we also need to engage internationally. There are still issues with getting services restored in fire zones. The Labor shadow cabinet will also meet tomorrow, in South Australia, to discuss \u201cmore constructive proposals\u201d on the bushfire crisis \u2013 the most recent Labor suggestion has been a natural asset \u2013 environment and wildlife \u2013 national audit. NSW police have released a list of those who have died in the bushfire season. Twenty people have lost their lives in NSW so far: A 77-year-old man at Coongbar on 9 October 2019 A 68-year-old woman at Coongbar on 9 October 2019 A 69-year-old woman at Diehard on 8 November 2019 An 85-year-old man at Diehard on 8 November 2019 A 63-year-old woman at Johns River on 8 November 2019 A 58-year-old man at Willawarrin on 8 November 2019 A 64-year-old man at South Arm on 9 November 2019 A 32-year-old man (RFS volunteer) at Buxton on 19 December 2019 A 35-year-old man (RFS volunteer) at Buxton on 19 December 2019 A 59-year-old man at Royal North Shore hospital on 29 December 2019, after sustaining injuries on 7 November 2019 at Yarrowitch A 28-year-old man (RFS volunteer) at Jingellic on 30 December 2019 A 63-year-old man at Wandella on 30 December 2019 A 29-year-old man at Wandella on 30 December 2019 A 70-year-old man at Yatte Yattah on 31 December 2019 Believed to be a 56-year-old man at Coolagolite on 31 December 2019 (not yet formally identified) A 72-year-old man at Belowra on 31 December 2019 A 75-year-old man at Yatte Yattah on 1 January 2019 A 62-year-old man at Sussex Inlet on 1 January 2020 A 47-year-old man at Batlow on 4 January 2020 A 71-year-old man at Nerrigundah, found on 6 January 2020 More US firefighters have arrived ahead of the dangerous conditions predicted in the fire zones tomorrow: Given we have been talking about tourism impacts on Kangaroo Island: It\u2019s a fairly quick press conference, as the prime minister will be returning to Canberra after the Iraq incident. Scott Morrison finishes with this: There\u2019s some more difficult weather coming up in front of us over the next few days here in South Australia, particularly over the next two days I\u2019m advised, and on the east coast, particularly on Friday. So I would just encourage everyone to follow those instructions, make sure you\u2019re in a place of safety, look after each other and let\u2019s stay focused on the job we\u2019ve got ahead and supporting each other to do just that job. Asked about penalties for arsonists, the prime minister says this: I\u2019m disappointed of the disgusting behaviour of seeing arsonists in a season like this, as is anyone in Australia. It just makes your skin crawl frankly. State governments have been taking that up and have been arresting people. In my own community, I want to thank the local police for arresting some behaviour, after residents tipped them off after seeing them \u2013 people acting suspiciously in bushland area. We can see the best of Australia in these times but also the worst. That includes arsonists, scammers and looters. What I will say is that\u2019s not Australia and that is certainly not the overwhelming comprehensive definition of Australia. What you see of the spirit of Australia is what I saw where those families I met with this morning, some of whom have lost their homes, some of whom have lost their properties, and have lost thousands and thousands of stock, but what they do, stand together, support each other and commit to rebuild. That\u2019s what we will build on. We will build on that spirit of Australians which is exemplified by all those amazing Australians going out there and doing what they\u2019re doing each and every day. Scott Morrison says the state and commonwealth relief and recovery packages are working well to complement each other: We both have different tasks. We can provide income support. We can provide support to state government infrastructure works. The state governments will be taking the lead on those infrastructure works. Our commitment also doesn\u2019t include the deployment of what you see around and about you here through the defence forces and other agencies. So this has been one of, if not the biggest responses by a federal government to a disaster of this nature we\u2019ve seen in this country and you can expect that to continue. Scott Morrison says the ADF reservists callout has gone well: I\u2019m very pleased with the level of integration between the reservists and the full-time complement of the defence forces and how they\u2019re integrating, particularly under local priorities and direction, whether it\u2019s here in South Australia or in NSW. We\u2019ve been in regular contact with Commissioner Fitzsimmons in NSW, for example. And in Victoria it\u2019s going extremely well. I was only there a few days ago in East Gippsland. I could see it for myself. I\u2019m very appreciative of the support coming out of Singapore, with the additional helicopters. There\u2019s more New Zealand support, which is turning up those helicopters. They are turning up \u2013 today, I understand General \u2013 but there\u2019s the engineers support coming out of New Zealand and that is all working effectively under the local priorities and direction. When ADF, particularly reservists, going into communities and setting up pop-ups together with Government Services Australia, that\u2019s been done in concert with local state police and others to ensure there\u2019s a very close working relationship. At the local level, that is, but also at the state level and, indeed, well, today obviously I\u2019ve been with the premier and had a lengthy conversation with the premier of NSW on the way here about events there as well. Asked again about Iraq, Scott Morrison says the priority is protecting Australians and the country\u2019s assets in the region. He says he spoke about the issue when talking to Donald Trump about the bushfires yesterday \u2013 and that Australia will \u201cwork continually closely with them\u201d. Well, the United States have taken the action that they, to address what\u2019s been intelligence they said they received, which was putting their interests at risk, and they have been clear about that. The Australian government said following that attack that the individual we\u2019re talking about here, as well as more broadly, there\u2019s been concerns about their operations in the region for some time. So the United States has taken that action. We will work continually closely with them. It was a matter I did discuss with the president yesterday when we spoke. Obviously we also talked extensively about the bushfire situation here. Authorities are working on getting the drinking water supply on Kangaroo Island restored \u2013 a water filtration and purification unit from Brisbane has been flown to the island to help with that. Major General Jake Ellwood has an ADF update: You would have seen yesterday that we had Choules undertake evacuation operations from Mallacoota. We have Adelaide based off Eden and it is preparing, if it hasn\u2019t already started to, disembark elements to go and assist inland. In terms of aircraft, you would note that we\u2019ve had an increase in aircraft. The Singaporeans have provided kindly two Chinooks that should be serviceable or working, I should say, from tomorrow. The New Zealand defence force has provided helicopters for support and also fixed-wing support and we have also brought additional helicopters down ourselves from Townsville, so that will have a significant and positive impact. In terms of our troops, they are the ones you will see on the ground, we are moving more and more into isolated communities, to make sure we have boots on the ground to understand what the needs are of the communities so we can either make sure we inform appropriate elements or, indeed, provide the support ourselves and I think over the coming days, that will pay dividends. I have directed we will have two elements that will be capable of air mobile operations, based out of NSW and also Victoria, to make sure that they can launch at very short notice to provide multidisciplinary teams, that can provide support or make assessments and then provide that support as it\u2019s required. Everyone is moving out hard. You would have seen the numbers in terms of reservists have increased significantly. We\u2019ve doubled our numbers, certainly, over a thousand. I must say, having yesterday been at Eden and Merimbula and having been here today, you can\u2019t help but be impressed with our emergency management services, volunteers, and, of course, our ADF are doing us proud as they always do. Donald Trump has responded to the missiles launched at a Iraq base housing US troops on social media. Iran has claimed responsibility. Labor is also calling for a national natural asset audit, to try and get an idea of just what we have lost in these fires, in terms of the environment and wildlife. From Terri Butler and Anthony Albanese: The Morrison government should convene a meeting of state and territory environment ministers and commence an Australian natural asset audit, amid estimates that up to one billion animals have perished in the nation\u2019s bushfire disaster. The government must also guarantee continued funding for the nation\u2019s Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, which will cease to exist from July next year because it does not conform to the Government\u2019s rewritten guidelines for CRCs, which favour commercial research. Australians love the bush. Many of us live in the bush and our precious wildlife is deeply ingrained in Australian sense of identity. With more than 8 million hectares burned so far this bushfire season, we must turn to land management specialists and scientists to assess the scale of this ecological disaster and advise governments on a national approach to recovery efforts. Anthony Albanese was also asked about any potential Australian involvement in Iraq or Iran \u2013 he says we should have nothing to do with it: The prime minister goes on to talk about those who are looking to cancel their holidays and want refunds: Can I also offer a request on behalf of tourism operators that have been affected: if you booked accommodation and you\u2019re now seeking a refund, can you cut them a break? That\u2019s in terms of, at the very least on the timing about when you might expect to receive a refund. These businesses have been hit very hard and their cash flow positions are not going to be in a position where they\u2019re going to be able to meet every request. I would particularly ask the international tourism trade industry to be mindful of that when they\u2019re dealing with customers. For Australians in particular, you want to help in these regions? Then cut these local tourism operators a break when it comes to what you might like to do. Even better: why not, if you\u2019re in a position to do so \u2013 I know not everyone is \u2013 but if you\u2019re in a position to do so, then why not even let them keep it or, indeed, arrange for another time when you can take it up and come back and visit, whether it\u2019s Kangaroo Island or anywhere else. They need that help at the moment. Scott Morrison has asked for people to be mindful of the impact on tourism operators: Australia is open, Australia is still a wonderful place to come and bring your family and enjoy your holidays. ... Even here on Kangaroo Island, where a third of the island has obviously been decimated \u2013 two-thirds of it is open and ready for business. It\u2019s important to keep the local economies vibrant at these times. So I would ask you, if you have already made those plans and otherwise can\u2019t change them, then by all means follow through, because I\u2019m sure the local tourism businesses, whether here in South Australia or other places where they\u2019re able to continue to take visitors, that you would proceed. Scott Morrison echoes the calls we have been hearing from NSW and Victoria about donations - goods are not needed, but cash is. Back to the fires, the prime minister says the two most impacted industries have been tourism and agriculture \u2013 and Kangaroo Island is an example where an area has been hit badly in both. Scott Morrison: I gave authority this morning, to do what was necessary and to take what actions and decisions were necessary to protect ADF personnel and diplomatic staff in Baghdad and this is something that I will be returning to Canberra later today and meeting both with the defence chiefs as well as our key ministers and there is the scheduled meeting for the NSC in the morning to take further decisions. Scott Morrison says he has been in contact with Angus Campbell, the ADF chief \u2013 and has confirmed all diplomatic and defence staff from Australia, currently in Baghdad, are safe. The National Security Committee will meet tomorrow morning to discuss the Iraq situation. The prime minister has begun his press conference. He\u2019ll speak about Kangaroo Island, the fire response generally, and also Iraq. Scott Morrison has promised a Kangaroo Island garlic farmer that he will place an order by the end of the day as community members share stories of the bushfires that have torn through the island community, destroying homes and livelihoods. Shane Leahy, a garlic farmer and Country Fire Service volunteer who has lost his home, told Morrison he was not looking for a \u201chandout\u201d, but told him the island community needed help to get back on their feet. Fires are still burning on the island, and authorities are on high alert as conditions are expected to worsen over the next few days. Leahy said he had been working 20 days\u2019 straight volunteering for the CFS and was now sleeping on a friend\u2019s floor. \u201cI was out on the western end of the island fighting the fires on Friday night, and I couldn\u2019t get back ... there was no saving my house. My whole property is gone. I have got one shed left,\u201d Leahy said. He is hoping garlic stored in the shed may still be saleable. \u201cAt the end of the day I have got to live, I have got no home,\u201d Leahy said. Morrison visited the sheep station of the Kelly family who lost a shearing shed his grandfather had built after the second world war, while his home suffered ember showers. Their home survived. Tourism operators asked Morrison to support a new tourism campaign, a call also being made by Mayo MP Rebekha Sharkie. \u201cWe need to start planning now \u2013 the best way for the regions to recover including Kangaroo Island and the Adelaide Hills is to get people visiting and spending money again,\u201d Sharkie said. \u201cIt will still be the best holiday of your life.\u201d Local tourism operator Chris Schumann told the PM he had been inundated with cancellations \u2013 including in the far-off months of April and May. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for people to cancel then,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, don\u2019t abandon us \u2013 we need your business. \u201cAnd ScoMo just said to me ... somewhere I\u2019m going to do a press conference and say hey, if you\u2019re asking for a refund from a small business doing accomodation or a tour operator for $500, give \u2018Em a break and suck it up.\u201d Morrison is now touring a defence staging station near Kingscote, which is housing the ninth brigade of reservists from Adelaide. He will give a press conference shortly. Victorian authorities are pleading with climate protesters to delay their protest action beyond Friday, given the heat spike which is expected \u2013 and with it, the dangerous fire conditions. From AAP: Victoria\u2019s environment minister has endorsed a police call for climate activists to abandon a planned protest on the state\u2019s next high fire danger day. The demonstration has been set down for Friday night in Melbourne\u2019s CBD in response to the bushfires which have blackened more than 1.2 million hectares of Victoria. Authorities on Wednesday urged Uni Students for Climate Justice organisers to call off the action, change the date or at least confine it to one spot. They say the protesters so far are not budging. Environment minister Lily D\u2019Ambrosio says people can protest but Friday is not the day given there is a heat spike expected and emergency services personnel are needed to help fight fires. \u201cPeople are entitled to protest, absolutely, but the timing is wrong,\u201d she told reporters while at the airport to greet North American firefighters coming to help. \u201cPeople are recovering, trying to recover, at the same time they\u2019re preparing for another spike event.\u201d The last thing emergency services need is people \u201cdeviated or distracted\u201d by the well-meaning but poorly timed protest, she added. While police are duty-bound to provide a well-sourced contingency for a public protest, Acting Assistant Commissioner Tim Hansen also said Friday is not a good time. \u201cThis is a distraction for us. We see frontline staff returning from the fire ground ... fatigued, that do need a break and this is now another operation we need to resource,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe are frustrated by this protest timing and we are also frustrated by the lack of flexibility by the protest organisers to work with us in trying to find a more suitable time. \u201cThese are unprecedented times for emergency services.\u201d Back in the Iraq action at the moment, there are no reports of US casualties, as yet. However there are reports of Iraqi casualties. Our Pacific neighbours continue to assist \u2013 Vanuatu has donated $250,000 to the NSW RFS. Our colleague Josh Taylor has looked at the causes of bushfires in the last financial year, according to the NSW RFS. You may notice that the number put down to arson is 1.3%. That information came from here, Arson happens, but it is not the overwhelming cause of these bushfires. Of the 180 or so legal actions NSW police have taken this fire season, just 24 are arson charges. The rest are for things like ignoring the total fire ban, using fireworks, angle grinders, improperly disposing of lit cigarettes \u2013 that sort of thing. And we say legal action, instead of arrests, because not all have been arrested. We have had quite a few questions about fundraisers today. This is a very good guide. We are expecting to hear from the prime minister very soon. Anthony Albanese is speaking in Adelaide, repeating that the bushfires are \u201cnot business as usual\u201d. \u201cThis is a national emergency,\u201d he said. He said the first priorities are saving lives, and protecting communities \u2013 but then the broader impacts have to be looked at: \u201cThis will have a very significant impact into the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also need to have proper assessments into whether this is the new normal. I hope that is not the case.\u201d The group pushing for a royal commission have been asked for more specifics about why they think it is necessary: Q: You say you need more resources. What specifically do you need? A: Leighton Drury notes the different kinds of technology across different organisations which don\u2019t work together efficiently: In Fire and Rescue NSW we\u2019ve got less professional firefighters now than we did in 2011. We\u2019d certainly like to see that addressed. Stewart Little: There needs to be funding from state and federal governments to recognise that firefighters\u2026 are frontline. We\u2019ve had budgets cut during many many years\u2026 We have to plan, we have to fund, we have to permanently plan. John Oliver says there isn\u2019t even a national radio protocol. Scale up in a different way, communicate in a different way: \u201cIf we can\u2019t get unified comms protocol across the country \u2026 what hope have we got on the fireground?\u201d [continued from previous post] Max Adlam, state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of South Australia: Agencies do work together really strongly. The metro fire service has a facility called strike teams ready to send out providing the resources are available. The beginning of this season there were no spare vehicles available. [Old vehicles are] not equipped with halo systems. There are concerns. Our people work very hard on the smell of what frankly is an oily rag. Stewart Little, general secretary, Public Service Association of NSW: The PSA and CPSU supports the call for a royal commission. We think that\u2019s the only way we can really cut through and look at three broad areas. Only a federal royal commission will look at the failure over numerous years to implement past recommendations from past inquests and royal commissions. There\u2019s been a complete failure federally to look at coordinating activity across various jurisdictions. Sure they\u2019re talking about it now \u2013 but why on earth weren\u2019t we talking about this at the beginning of the fire season? These are quotes from some of the representatives from firefighter unions calling for a royal commission. It\u2019s worth noting that there has been talk of royal commissions previously, and others pushing back on it because royal commissions don\u2019t solve anything if governments ignore the recommendations. Leighton Drury, state secretary, Fire Brigade Employees\u2019 Union (NSW): We have grave concerns about the resourcing and funding provided to these agencies. We\u2019re not equipped to fight these fires as we\u2019d like to. We treat this with the upmost seriousness and it\u2019s time for our government to do the same. John Oliver, state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of Queensland: We\u2019re calling for a RC into these fires. We need to properly examine the facets of what\u2019s occurred this summer. Why is this season different to the past? Only a RC can give us that. Coroners reports can go someway, but a thorough examination is needed [pre, during and post] fires. We can no longer rely on these reports [from previous inquiries] to provide unbiased reports to the decision makers. We need to look at the fires as they are, even if they were put out tomorrow. The next fire season is in nine months\u2019 time. We need to act quickly, and governments need to act on this very quickly. Queensland Emergency hardship assistance Up to $180 (person) and $900 (family) Essential services hardship assistance Up to $150 (person) and $750 (family) For those who lost power, gas, water or sewerage Essential household contents grant Up to $1,765 (singles) and $5,300 (couples and families) For those uninsured or unable to claim Structural assistance Up to $10,995 (singles) and $14,685 (couples and families For those uninsured or unable to claim Essential services safety and reconnection grant Up to $200 for safety inspections Up to $4,200 for repairs For those uninsured who pass an income assets test Disaster assistance loans Up to $250,000 for primary producers for up to 10 years To replace machinery, infrastructure and livestock Grants also available to small businesses and non-profits Tasmania Emergency assistance Up to $250 (adult), $125 (child) and $1,000 (family).

Natural disaster recovery relief Up $15,000 for primary producers, small businesses, sporting clubs and not-for-profits Scott Morrison has arrived at a fire-affected property in Kangaroo Island, near Stokes Bay in the north of the island. The property belongs to Madelyn and Simon Kelly, who are wool farmers. He is being joined by the SA premier, Steven Marshall, the SA senator Anne Ruston and the KI mayor, Michael Pengilly. Morrison said conditions on KI and across the country had been \u201cshocking and terrifying\u201d. He said he has seen \u201csolidarity\u201d in affected communities and a commitment. \u201cWe are going to rebuild ... and the platform we are going to build upon is you, because you built it in the first place,\u201d he told community members at the property. Sarah Hanson-Young visited the firezone on Kangaroo Island yesterday. She has called for help for the wildlife, as well as the community. Getting to the Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota has been challenging. There has been a mass evacuation for those who wanted to go, involving the ADF. Now the operation to take supplies to those who remain has begun in earnest. The prime minister has issued this statement after the attack on a base housing US troops in Iraq: The Government is closely monitoring the unfolding events in Iraq. The Prime Minister, Chief of the Defence Force and Ministers for Defence and Foreign Affairs are in frequent contact. The Prime Minister has directed the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) to take whatever actions are necessary to protect and defend our ADF and diplomatic personnel and keep Australians safe. The Prime Minister has contacted the Leader of the Opposition to brief him on the current situation. The National Security Committee of the Cabinet has been meeting to review this situation and take decisions as necessary since Saturday, is already scheduled to meet again for this purpose on Thursday and will be convened sooner should further information be confirmed requiring such a response, and will be done so in consultation with the CDF. To give you a better idea of what Kangaroo Island has faced, here is the latest photo gallery. Just a reminder, that these fires have affected one-third of the island \u2013 there is still much that has not been impacted. If you have a holiday planned for the area, just check before you head off. From the Kangaroo Island pool copy (given the limited space, one journalist is usually nominated to send out information for all media outlets to use. The same thing happens with the visuals): Prime Minister Scott Morrison learnt about Iran\u2019s attack on US forces stationed in Iraq while flying to South Australia today to visit bushfire-ravaged Kangaroo Island. Mr Morrison spoke to the Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne regarding the situation while on the flight. He also phoned Opposition leader Anthony Albanese. It\u2019s understood the Prime Minister will continue to receive briefings about the attack throughout the day. SA Premier Steven Marshall met Mr Morrison on Kangaroo Island this morning, where the two leaders will meet South Australians impacted by the fires today and announce $11 million in joint funding for recovery grants for farmers and small businesses. Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference should be held just after midday. And for those who missed Shane Fitzsimmons on the issue of hazard reduction burns this morning: A Greens member has emailed me to remind you that the Greens are in a coalition agreement with Labor in the ACT: A copy of the coalition agreement is available here. The fact that Greens are in government, with a Green MLA as Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability, has allowed the development of a comprehensive climate policy that stands in stark contrast with anything that has been produced by the federal government in recent years. (Just in relation to an earlier post.) Scott Morrison is touring Kangaroo Island with the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, as we speak. One of the key messages the KI community has been trying to send is to tourists, asking them not to cancel any planned holidays this season. While a third of the island has been impacted by fires, a lot has not. Kangaroo Island is Australia\u2019s third largest island \u2013 after Tasmania and Melville, if memory serves me \u2013 so there are still vast areas which have not been impacted and the community needs the support. Breaking news outside the bushfire crisis: rockets fired at US airbase in Iraq US security forces have confirmed multiple rockets have been fired at an airbase housing US and coalition troops in Iraq. Some have hit the base \u2013 there is no news of any casualties or injuries at this stage. That follows the US airstrike that killed Qassem Suleimani, the Iranian commander killed at the Baghdad airport on Friday. And the Commonwealth Bank has also announced its donation details: The Commonwealth Bank will donate $1 million towards bushfire disaster relief efforts, including $750,000 worth of grants to help support local communities and replace facilities lost in the fires, as well as a $250,000 donation to the Australian Red Cross. In addition, the bank has extended its Emergency Assistance Package \u2013 that provides support to personal and business customers affected by the bushfires \u2013 to all volunteer firefighters. The package includes loan restructuring and waiving of selected fees and charges. CBA\u2019s bushfire relief grants will provide: \u00b7 Up to $20,000 available to assist with the replacement and repair of lost or damaged community facilities due to bushfires. \u00b7 Community organisations, schools and local fire brigades will be able to register for support through www.commbank.com.au from Friday 10 January, with registrations open until Friday 14 February 2020. The Red Cross has also released more information on the \u201cAll In\u201d Australian retailer fundraiser. Over 45 of Australia\u2019s leading retailers with a combined network of 1,000+ stores have joined forces to provide 100% of profits from this Thursday 9th January to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund. As businesses who rely on the goodwill of their communities, the collection of local and international brands united proactively for the nation-wide initiative, seeing it as an obligation to step forward and support those that support them, collectively making a real difference. This initiative provides an opportunity for people in each state and territory, and at home through online donations, to get involved. The retailers and supporting partners are: Abrand, Afterpay, Artesands, Ben Sherman, Brixton, bond-eye swim, Cue, Culture Kings, Dashing Printing, Dr Denim, eBay, Faithful The Brand, Farage, General Pants, Grrrl, Globe, Hugo Boss, Hush Puppies, Kwik Kopy, Lacoste, Lee Jeans, Levis, Life Interiors, Local Supply, Misfit, M.J.

Ritchie Australia, Wrangler, XLarge. Ellen DeGeneres is the latest celebrity to launch a bushfire appeal. She is aiming to raise US$5m. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has released this statement from the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation: The ILSC has established an emergency response grant for any Indigenous corporation whose property has been directly affected by the recent bushfires. A grant of up to $20,000 will be available to assist Indigenous corporations to immediately secure and clean up damaged properties. The ILSC will also make available a grant to assist Indigenous land management groups and contractors assisting the vital recovery efforts with much needed equipment. All at the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation (ILSC) are deeply saddened by the bushfires that are currently devastating communities around the country, resulting in the tragic loss of human life, homes, businesses, wildlife and bushland. In response, the ILSC has established the 2020 Bushfire Emergency Response Grant for Indigenous corporations whose property has been directly affected by the recent bushfires. Eddie Fry, Chair of ILSC and Indigenous Business Australia (IBA), said a grant of up to $20,000 would provide immediate support for Indigenous corporations who have experienced the loss of or damage to property through the current bushfires. The RFS have released the latest impact figures: 1,687 homes destroyed 692 homes damaged More than 11,000 homes saved More than 4,000 outbuildings or facilities damaged or destroyed And 771 homes have been destroyed in only the past week (from 1 January). Delta Goodrem has released a charity song, called Let It Rain, and it\u2019s already shot straight to the top of the Australian iTunes charts. Mark Butler says Labor is hoping to reach a bipartisan position on climate change policies with the government. From AAP: Labor is promising more ambitious policies than the Coalition at the next election to tackle climate change after Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis. Opposition climate spokesman Mark Butler also wants the government to allow a debate on climate change in parliament when it returns in February. \u201cHopefully we could fashion a bipartisan position,\u201d he told ABC radio on Wednesday. Mr Butler said the bushfire crisis had raised the tempo of the debate around climate change in Australia and overseas. He said Labor\u2019s focus now was on the current emergency. \u201cThere will be a need for a very thorough inquiry into these events and also a full national debate about how we protect future generations around climate change impacts,\u201d Mr Butler said. \u201cWhat people can be assured of is that we will have a more ambitious climate change policy at the next election than the coalition.\u201d Labor leader Anthony Albanese recently toured Queensland coal country, throwing his support behind the industry. But Mr Butler said if the world was going to meet international carbon reductions targets, fossil fuel use would have to decline sharply. A group of volunteer and profession firefighting organisations will come together today to call for a royal commission into the bushfires: Leighton Drury, state secretary, Fire Brigade Employees\u2019 Union (NSW) John Oliver, state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of Queensland Lea Anderson, state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of Western Australia Max Adlam, state secretary, United Firefighters\u2019 Union of South Australia Stewart Little, general secretary, Public Service Association of NSW Mick Holton, president, NSW Volunteer Fire Fighters Association The Greens have also made noise about wanting a royal commission. Since 1939 there have been almost 20 major inquiries into bushfires in Australia. If there is misinformation to be spread, chances are a Trump will jump at it. Twenty-four people have been charged with deliberately lighting fires in NSW. The rest of the arrests are for defying the total fire ban \u2013 angle grinding, fireworks, etc. So far, none of the Victorian fires have been deliberately lit. No one is saying arson doesn\u2019t happen. But spreading false claims like this does nothing to fix any problems. Anthony Albanese was asked about hazard reduction burns this morning on Adelaide ABC radio. Here is what he had to say: Well, the question is do they have the resources to look at it has been the feedback that I\u2019ve had, and the particular circumstances as well. So, for example, when I was in Casino on the north coast of New South Wales, what the head of the Rural Fire Service there told me was that people who would normally be involved in hazard reduction in the middle of the year during the cooler months weren\u2019t able to because the fires began so early in places like Rappville. So, they were busy out there fighting fires, rather than engaged in hazard reduction. And there\u2019s no doubt that has had an impact. But the other thing that\u2019s had a massive impact, of course, is just the drying of the continent, the ongoing drought, that has had a huge impact. So, parts of tropical rainforest that have never burned before have burned for the first time. While we have focused on hazard reduction burns, there is also a conversation to have about Indigenous burning techniques: This is from an an article on the practices published on the Conversation: Traditional Aboriginal fire practices are based on local knowledge and spiritual connection to country. Before white settlement, Aboriginal people were a constant presence in the landscape, and traditionally burnt country by walking the land. This meant they could control the timing and spread of fire, as well as its ecological effects. By contrast, most modern fire programs are far less flexible and responsive. They usually take place on weekdays in specific seasons and weather conditions. Many fires are ignited from the air \u2013 especially those in remote areas where vast areas of burning is desired. This technique results in bigger, more intense fires than those conducted by Aboriginal people. Our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, has also alerted me to this fundraiser for First Nations people who have been impacted by the bushfires. Just a reminder, after NSW police said they were taking legal action against 183 people for fire-related offences \u2013 just 24 of those have been people charged with deliberately lighting bushfires. The rest are for disobeying the total fire ban \u2013 things like lighting fireworks, dropping lit cigarettes, that sort of thing. The smoke haze is back in Sydney. It\u2019s not only reached New Zealand \u2013 it has also made its way 10,000km away to Chile. Australian NBA players have come together to donate US$750,00 to the bushfire crisis \u2013 that works out to just over A$1m. This is happening in so many areas right now. The ADF has been deployed to help farmers deal with the widespread loss, including burying dead livestock. NSW RFS crews will assess the Blue Mountains from the air this morning, after last night\u2019s lightning strikes Another of those claims is that hazard reduction burns were stopped by the Greens and other environmental groups. Apart from the easily verifiable fact that the Greens are not in power anywhere in Australia, there is also fire authorities repeatedly telling us that hazard reduction burns were done, are becoming increasingly difficult to do because of shortened windows when it is safe, and these fires are so hot and enormous that they are burning through areas which had previously had fuel loads minimised by hazard reduction burns. Shane Fitzsimmons this morning: As a matter of fact, this season under the extremely drought-driven conditions, the depletion of moisture in the landscape, the vegetation is so dry, hazard reduction burns that are only two years old, we seeing the fires on these days skip through it. We are only seeing effective amelioration on fires that have been done in the last 12 months say, so it has a place and it\u2019s a valuable tool for day-to-day fires, normal seasons, but when you have got a tough season, awful fire weather conditions, so when you are running fires under severe, extreme or worse conditions, hazard reduction has little effect on fire spread. There is a lot of misinformation about the Australian fires being spread out there. A lot. Some of the most damaging is that the fires have all been deliberately lit. Christopher Knaus has examined how those claims are being spread: Bot and troll accounts are involved in a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d exaggerating the role of arson in Australia\u2019s bushfire disaster, social media analysis suggests. The bushfires burning across the nation have been accompanied by repeated suggestions of an arson epidemic or \u201carson emergency\u201d. The false claims are, in some cases, used to undermine the link between the current bushfires and the longer, more intense fire seasons brought about by climate change. Shane Fitzsimmons was also asked about hazard reduction burns. The NSW RFS commissioner said it was part of the mix, and worth a discussion, but that it was not a \u201cpanacea\u201d: Our priorities are life, property and then environment ranks third, so we have streamline processes and I can say in any given year, of all the burns that we have got ready to go, 70-80% are cleared environmentally ready to go, we are waiting for the window of opportunity. It\u2019s fair to say, resourcing is a challenge. So don\u2019t forget, as settled Australians, as Europeans, we are now living and working and occupying areas that used to freely burn. We can\u2019t light a burn and just let it run. Lighting a hazard reduction burn is complicated, resource-hungry, risky, and the minute we see a burn lit, I\u2019m inundated with claims for people wanting us to pay for the cloth on their greenhouse, the embers have landed on their properties, so there are so many ramifications that come from prescribed burning. It\u2019s a valuable tool, it\u2019s not a panacea. It\u2019s an emotive discussion, a complex environment and yes, absolutely, we should have a very healthy, frank, but factual debate about the pros and cons about what hazard reduction does and does not do. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, is also in South Australia today (Scott Morrison is headed to Kangaroo Island). He will hold a media conference in Adelaide at 11am local time. In NSW there are 117 fires still burning; 50 are not contained Lightning strikes in the Blue Mountains have authorities worried, with dangerous fire conditions expected tomorrow and Friday. In Victoria bushfires have begun to merge, becoming larger. At least 12 are still active. More than 6m hectares have been burned in those two states alone. In South Australia fire crews are facing a day of \u201cextreme\u201d fire danger. The Kangaroo Island fire is the most concerning at this stage, and is not contained. Some 160,000 hectares have burned there so far, with 56 homes destroyed. There were 116 livestock producers within the fire zone, with mass losses expected. There are reports that up to 1,000 beehives have also been destroyed. Both NSW and Victorian authorities have now asked people to stop donating goods, stressing that it is very generous and people are grateful but they have no way to store or distribute the food and other donations, including secondhand furniture. The NSW state director of the office of emergency management, Wendy Graham, says it is not overplaying it to say it is a \u201csecond disaster\u201d, and while people are incredibly grateful, they just can\u2019t cope with the additional logistical challenges at the moment. \u201cThe most important thing is that we provide help in the way that help is most needed,\u201d she told the ABC. \u201cWe are listening to communities at the moment, what we are hearing from them is that they no not need donated goods such as clothing and toys and furniture. They have nowhere to put these things at the moment. \u201cItems like that can become the next disaster for communities, as they fill up community spaces and community halls. \u201cThe most effective way that people can help right now is to donate money to those established charities. Money is so important for people at this point in time, because it gives people the choice to get what they need, when they need it. That is what is needed most.\u201d Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, has also said something similar over the past two days. Australia retailers, such as the Iconic, an online distributor, have banded together in an attempt to help. On Thursday 100% of profits from many Australian retailers will go to the bushfire recovery effort. The Iconic is also offering its warehouses and distribution network to help store and later spread out donations, as people once again have homes to move into. For more information on other retailers donating profits to the Red Cross disaster relief and recovery plan, as well as how to set up your own initiative and avoid scams, read Guardian Australia\u2019s guide to donating to Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis: The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, who yesterday went to a second funeral of one of his volunteers, Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, and spent time speaking to his family, including O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s 19-month-old daughter, Charlotte, was asked how he was going on ABC news this morning: We are all heartbroken. I don\u2019t know how anyone can\u2019t be moved or affected by such tragedy that\u2019s hit us here in New South Wales this year. Of course, to lose lives and including three firefighters, three firefighters with beautiful young families, such strong, young resilient women, with two of them having beautiful little children, a little boy and a little girl, and one that\u2019s due to have their first baby in May of this year, it\u2019s truly heartbreaking. We are mourning with their families because we are genuinely an RFS family and when grief strikes one of our own, we all feel it, we all hurt and, at the end of the day, whilst I see the men and women of the RFS and all their colleagues doing superhuman things every day this fire season, at the end of the day, they are human and their hearts break when we see such tragedy. Our focus is to be with them, their family and to ensure for those little children, for baby Charlotte, baby Harvey and this new one that is on the way, in May, we owe it to them to ensure that they know that their dads were selfless, their dads were doing something for nothing more in their community than gratitude and appreciation, making a difference. They absolutely died heroes in the most horrific of circumstances and we owe it to ensure that they always know that and they never forget it. The UK\u2019s Channel 4 has also gone on the road with NSW RFS crews. Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis remains huge news in the UK. And a missive from the field. Prince Charles has joined the Queen, and his children, in speaking publicly about the Australian bushfires. From the statetment on the PM\u2019s planned Kangaroo Island visit: The federal and South Australian government will provide more support to South Australian communities devastated by bushfires, as they look to rebuild and recover. Primary producers and small businesses on Kangaroo Island and in the Adelaide Hills can now access grants to help them get back on their feet. Prime minister Scott Morrison said assistance is being provided under the jointly funded Commonwealth-State Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA). \u201cSouth Australia, particularly the Kangaroo Island and Adelaide Hills communities, have faced devastating losses. The bushfire threat is not over yet, but we will be there, backing the communities every step of the way as they rebuild and recover,\u201d said the prime minister. \u201cThis funding will provide grants of up to $10,000 to impacted small businesses, and $15,000 to primary producers and farmers. This will give businesses and families the immediate assistance they need to begin rebuilding. \u201cWe have also deployed a force of 121 ADF engineers, logistics specialists and personnel to Kangaroo Island to help with immediate relief and clean-up.\u201d Good morning, You have Amy Remeikis with you again today. We enter Wednesday with concerns about the Blue Mountains after lightning strikes in the area. Fire authorities are keeping an eye on the region after the storms \u2013 lightning is an issue not just because of the immediate fire risk, but because it can cause fire to smoulder in tree roots and bases, then flare up when fire conditions become dangerous \u2013 which is what we are expecting later this week. Scott Morrison is on his way to Kangaroo Island. The Ravine bushfire is still burning and one-third of the island has been ravaged. A father and son died during the blaze and the impact to the community, and wildlife, has been immense. And there have been more big donations from celebrities \u2013 including Elton John, who last night pledged a million dollars to the fire recovery effort. We\u2019ll bring you all of the day\u2019s events, as they happen.",

      "bodyText": "It was hard to see Battlesteads hotel\u2019s green credentials in the dark, so first impressions meant I had to trust it was the beacon of sustainability it promised to be. It was a dreary, drizzly Friday evening and I\u2019d taken the bus from Hexham to the hotel in the Northumberland riverside village of Wark \u2013 the bus stops right outside. In checking bus times in Hexham for the 35-minute ride, I\u2019d already said the village\u2019s name wrong and had my pronunciation corrected. It\u2019s Wark, rhyming with dark, rather than walk. My room (number 20) was one of Battlesteads\u2019 five eco-lodges: timber-framed structures made from sustainable wood. The lodges are adjacent to the main hotel-restaurant (which dates from the 18th century), and two are wheelchair-accessible. The cavernous room has a super-kingsize bed and neutral decor but the delight is in the details. The hotel\u2019s hot water and (underfloor) heating system is carbon-neutral thanks to a biomass boiler fed by woodchip from just half a mile away. Hot tub/bath or rainfall shower? The spacious bathroom has both, along with toiletries from natural skincare company Pure Lakes, from Kendal. At the door is a small terrace, and a skylight (for stargazing) is a clever touch, with a button to open and close its blind. As well as having Hadrian\u2019s Wall heritage, this part of Northumberland is dark-sky country. The lack of light pollution means watching the night sky is high on the things-to-do list. The county\u2019s protected dark-sky area is the largest in Europe, covering nearly 580 sq miles, and Battlesteads adds its own neat twist with an on-site public observatory, whose ticketed events are hosted by Astro Ventures. There is a pretty walled garden outside the hotel\u2019s conservatory, and behind those walls two polytunnels that provide some of the fruit and vegetables served on a restaurant menu rich with invention and local produce. Next to the tunnels is a shipping container, installed last year, which is used to grow mushrooms year-round. Some of that fungi appeared soon, as breakfast came calling. One of the waitresses told me all the food waste goes into a kitchen wormery. I decided against verifying \u2013 and focused on the fat sausages of my fry-up. I had attempted to mirror Battlesteads\u2019 green approach by travelling car-free. I\u2019d taken a train to Newcastle, changed to a local train for Hexham and befriended the Tynedale Links 680 bus (day ticket \u00a35.30) for Saturday sightseeing transport. Frequency is limited (often a two-hour gap between buses) but I used this to focus on what to see and how long to stay. The 10.16am bus took me to Chollerford, from where it\u2019s a 10-minute walk to Chesters Roman Fort (adult \u00a37.20, 5-17s \u00a34.30, family 2+3 \u00a318.70). There, Roman ruins \u2013 including one of the best-preserved bath houses in the UK, and vestiges of Hadrian\u2019s Wall \u2013 fascinated me in a way that would have been alien to my schoolboy self. In the tearoom, Yvonne brought my coffee over and we chatted about sustainability. Yvonne is renovating a place \u201con the fells\u201d and talked of repairing her generator, harvesting rainwater and recycling plastic bottles to help bed-in tomato plants. The pay off for the effort? \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful around here. I take pictures of the sunrise and people ask, \u2018Where did you take that?\u2019 I say, \u2018I just opened my front door\u2019.\u201d From Chollerford I walked to Humshaugh in search of coffee and my next bus. The weather had changed from drizzle to deluge. With no cafe in sight and the village shop shut by midday, there was nowhere to wait near the bus stop, save for the village\u2019s red telephone box. The 680 arrived and I leapt out \u2013 sort-of Superman in reverse \u2013 and jumped aboard. Bellingham brought a late lunch at the Carriages Tea Room, which is in two repurposed railway carriages, before a three-mile circular walk to Hareshaw Linn waterfall. This site of special scientific interest (SSSI) is so designated for its rare ferns and lichen, as well as being a haven for red squirrels. Saturday\u2019s starless night was disappointing for me and around 20 others in the Battlesteads\u2019 Observatory (Dark Sky Discovery night, two hours, adult \u00a322.50, family \u00a355.50; minimum age 14). Still, lead astronomer and director of learning Roy Alexander and his young apprentice, Jacob, did a fine job educating us about the night sky, as well as providing info on apps and websites, and tips on stargazing even if you\u2019ve only got binoculars.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Revenge for Suleimani killing</h2> \n<p>Hello again from the Guardian morning briefing desk. Warren Murray here to put you in the middle of the news this Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Iran has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/trump-iran-suleimani-threats-retaliation\">launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles</a> at US and coalition military positions in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Tehran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. In what appeared to be a dreadful coincidence, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/iran-plane-crash-ukraine-boeing-180-tehran\">Ukrainian airliner has crashed</a> after taking off from the Iranian capital bound for Kiev \u2013 all on board, more than 160 people, were killed, according to the Red Crescent and Iranian emergency officials.</p> \n<p>Details of the plane crash are still emerging this morning but video circulating online appeared to show an aircraft descending while on fire, followed by a large explosion at ground level. The jetliner involved is understood to have been a Boeing 737-800, but not the \u201cMax\u201d type that has been grounded since two deadly crashes blamed on faulty software. The Ukrainian plane took off from Imam Khomeini airport in the Iranian capital.</p> \n<p>Earlier, amid the continuing US-Iran tensions, the Pentagon said Al Asad air base in Iraq\u2019s Anbar province, which hosts a US contingent, was hit at least six times, while at least one other base in the northern city of Erbil was targeted. Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), of which Suleimani was a member, issued a statement saying: \u201cThe brave soldiers of IRGC\u2019s aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on Al Asad military base in the name of martyr General Qassem Suleimani.\u201d The Iranian regime indicated it had \u201cconcluded\u201d the mission to retaliate, while Donald Trump tweeted that damage assessment was under way but \u201cAll is well!\u201d. Michael Safi writes that the limited nature of Iran\u2019s retaliation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/08/irans-assault-on-us-bases-in-iraq-might-satisfy-both-sides\">may be to the satisfaction of both sides</a>, with Tehran able to say it has avenged Suleimani\u2019s death and the US able to brush it off as a comparatively minor incident.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said before the strikes that non-essential UK personnel were being moved from Baghdad to Taji, about 19 miles (30km) to the north. The government says British warships, helicopters and several hundred military personnel are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/07/british-ships-put-on-standby-in-gulf-minister-tells-mps\">on standby for deployment to the Gulf</a> if needed to evacuate British forces or respond to any escalation.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Midweek catch-up</strong></p> \n<p>&gt; Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips have won applause for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/labour-leadership-plp-hustings-nandy-phillips-starmer-lewis-long-bailey-thornberry\">honesty about Labour\u2019s problems</a> at a leadership hustings where the six candidates to succeed Jeremy Corbyn set out their pitches to MPs. Rebecca Long-Bailey received more lukewarm support having earlier told ITV she thought Jeremy Corbyn scored \u201c10 out of 10\u201d as leader.</p> \n<p>&gt; There will be at least 3,150 jobs lost from UK high streets this week as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/07/high-street-crisis-deepens-as-nearly-4000-staff-lose-jobs-in-a-week\">Mothercare and Links of London disappear</a> with the closure of 94 stores. Other chains facing store closures or restructuring include HMV, Bonmarch\u00e9, Beales, Jessops, Debenhams and House of Fraser, as retailers struggle with high costs and competition from online shopping.</p> \n<p>&gt; The prisons ombudsman is investigating after a remand prisoner was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/investigation-prisoner-liridon-saliuka-found-dead-belmarsh\">found dead in his cell at HMP Belmarsh</a>. Liridon Saliuka, 29, was in custody charged with murder over a shooting at a London club. His family says Saliuka was left disabled by a car crash but was put into a cell without special provisions. He is the third prisoner to have died in Belmarsh within the past year.</p> \n<p>&gt; Barclays is being called upon to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/pension-funds-urge-barclays-to-stop-lending-to-fossil-fuel-firms\">stop offering loans to fossil fuel companies</a> by a group of 11 pension and investment funds managing more than \u00a3130bn in assets. The first ever shareholder climate resolution aimed at a UK bank will be voted on at its annual general meeting in May.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Tory line on Brexit farm standards \u2013 </strong>The government will today claim that Britain\u2019s standards on animal welfare and farming will be maintained after it leaves the EU \u2013 but is not expected to give promises on specific issues such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/08/theresa-villiers-speech-farmers-post-brexit-standards\">chlorinated chicken, hormone-fed beef and meat produced with the use of antibiotics</a>. The National Farmers\u2019 Union wants any post-Brexit trade deals to prevent imports of food that would be illegal for farmers to produce in the UK. Boris Johnson is due to meet the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for Brexit talks in Downing Street today.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Wage theft on the rise \u2013 </strong>Thousands of bosses are paying workers less than the minimum wage and getting away with it. Only one in eight is caught by government inspectors: an estimated 11,000 firms failing to pay the minimum wage in 2018-19 but only 1,456 were identified by HMRC, says the Resolution Foundation. There are fears an inflation-busting minimum wage rise in April may tempt more employers to short-change workers. About <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/08/hmrc-firms-paying-below-minimum-wage\">one in five workers aged over 24</a> was paid below the legal minimum in 2016, but that rose to one in four last year with about 365,000 people missing out. Employees of small firms such as hair salons and carwashes are the most vulnerable. In December 2018 the government shelved a scheme to name and shame employers caught ducking the minimum wage.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Sew cute \u2013 </strong>Australia\u2019s bushfires have sparked a global effort to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/australia-wildfires-animals-shelters-knitting\">knit, crochet, and sew pouches and shelters</a> for some of the animals affected by millions of hectares of land being burned out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25e329a89d43fe29741fec322582277a0f66b475\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25e329a89d43fe29741fec322582277a0f66b475/0_248_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flying fox bats in home-made wraps donated during the Australian bushfires.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying fox bats in home-made wraps donated during the Australian bushfires.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shoalhaven Bat Clinic and Sanctuary</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Australia-based Animal Rescue Craft Guild put out a call for these items on its Facebook group.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Revenge for Suleimani killing Hello again from the Guardian morning briefing desk. Warren Murray here to put you in the middle of the news this Wednesday. Iran has launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at US and coalition military positions in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Tehran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. In what appeared to be a dreadful coincidence, a Ukrainian airliner has crashed after taking off from the Iranian capital bound for Kiev \u2013 all on board, more than 160 people, were killed, according to the Red Crescent and Iranian emergency officials. Details of the plane crash are still emerging this morning but video circulating online appeared to show an aircraft descending while on fire, followed by a large explosion at ground level. The jetliner involved is understood to have been a Boeing 737-800, but not the \u201cMax\u201d type that has been grounded since two deadly crashes blamed on faulty software. The Ukrainian plane took off from Imam Khomeini airport in the Iranian capital. Earlier, amid the continuing US-Iran tensions, the Pentagon said Al Asad air base in Iraq\u2019s Anbar province, which hosts a US contingent, was hit at least six times, while at least one other base in the northern city of Erbil was targeted. Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), of which Suleimani was a member, issued a statement saying: \u201cThe brave soldiers of IRGC\u2019s aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on Al Asad military base in the name of martyr General Qassem Suleimani.\u201d The Iranian regime indicated it had \u201cconcluded\u201d the mission to retaliate, while Donald Trump tweeted that damage assessment was under way but \u201cAll is well!\u201d. Michael Safi writes that the limited nature of Iran\u2019s retaliation may be to the satisfaction of both sides, with Tehran able to say it has avenged Suleimani\u2019s death and the US able to brush it off as a comparatively minor incident. Britain\u2019s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said before the strikes that non-essential UK personnel were being moved from Baghdad to Taji, about 19 miles (30km) to the north. The government says British warships, helicopters and several hundred military personnel are on standby for deployment to the Gulf if needed to evacuate British forces or respond to any escalation. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips have won applause for their honesty about Labour\u2019s problems at a leadership hustings where the six candidates to succeed Jeremy Corbyn set out their pitches to MPs. Rebecca Long-Bailey received more lukewarm support having earlier told ITV she thought Jeremy Corbyn scored \u201c10 out of 10\u201d as leader. &gt; There will be at least 3,150 jobs lost from UK high streets this week as Mothercare and Links of London disappear with the closure of 94 stores. Other chains facing store closures or restructuring include HMV, Bonmarch\u00e9, Beales, Jessops, Debenhams and House of Fraser, as retailers struggle with high costs and competition from online shopping. &gt; The prisons ombudsman is investigating after a remand prisoner was found dead in his cell at HMP Belmarsh. Liridon Saliuka, 29, was in custody charged with murder over a shooting at a London club. His family says Saliuka was left disabled by a car crash but was put into a cell without special provisions. He is the third prisoner to have died in Belmarsh within the past year. &gt; Barclays is being called upon to stop offering loans to fossil fuel companies by a group of 11 pension and investment funds managing more than \u00a3130bn in assets. The first ever shareholder climate resolution aimed at a UK bank will be voted on at its annual general meeting in May. * * * Tory line on Brexit farm standards \u2013 The government will today claim that Britain\u2019s standards on animal welfare and farming will be maintained after it leaves the EU \u2013 but is not expected to give promises on specific issues such as chlorinated chicken, hormone-fed beef and meat produced with the use of antibiotics. The National Farmers\u2019 Union wants any post-Brexit trade deals to prevent imports of food that would be illegal for farmers to produce in the UK. Boris Johnson is due to meet the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for Brexit talks in Downing Street today. * * * Wage theft on the rise \u2013 Thousands of bosses are paying workers less than the minimum wage and getting away with it. Only one in eight is caught by government inspectors: an estimated 11,000 firms failing to pay the minimum wage in 2018-19 but only 1,456 were identified by HMRC, says the Resolution Foundation. There are fears an inflation-busting minimum wage rise in April may tempt more employers to short-change workers. About one in five workers aged over 24 was paid below the legal minimum in 2016, but that rose to one in four last year with about 365,000 people missing out. Employees of small firms such as hair salons and carwashes are the most vulnerable. In December 2018 the government shelved a scheme to name and shame employers caught ducking the minimum wage. * * * Sew cute \u2013 Australia\u2019s bushfires have sparked a global effort to knit, crochet, and sew pouches and shelters for some of the animals affected by millions of hectares of land being burned out. The Australia-based Animal Rescue Craft Guild put out a call for these items on its Facebook group. The effort has attracted donors across Europe, Asia, and more than 40 US states and territories.

Lunchtime read: Bald head, thick skin Society often associates femininity with long, flowing locks \u2013 but a growing number of women are choosing to celebrate their baldness. Sirin Kale meets some of those who have embraced hair loss. Sport Ben Stokes dedicated his match-winning performance in the second Test against South Africa to his stricken father, who kept tabs on England\u2019s series-levelling victory from his hospital bed in Johannesburg. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was scathing about Manchester United\u2019s first-half display in Tuesday\u2019s 3-1 home defeat by Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg, describing it as the worst this season. Stefanos Tsitsipas hurt his father in a remarkable mid-match meltdown during his clash with Australia\u2019s Nick Kyrgios at the ATP Cup. Margaret Court, whose views on marriage equality have polarised public opinion, will be recognised on the 50th anniversary of her 1970 calendar-year grand slam sweep at Melbourne Park but will not present the Australian Open trophy to this year\u2019s women\u2019s champion. And Liverpool\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9 has been named African Footballer of the Year for the first time after beating his teammate Mohamed Salah and Manchester City\u2019s Riyad Mahrez, while Barcelona and Nigeria\u2019s Asisat Oshoala was named as women\u2019s player of the year. Business Oil prices have risen while Asian stock markets fell after Iran\u2019s missile attacks on US military sites in Iraq. Brent crude futures, the benchmark for international oils, spiked more than $3 per barrel at one point. Tokyo\u2019s stock market benchmark fell nearly 2% and Hong Kong\u2019s was off nearly 1%. Shanghai, Sydney and south-east Asian markets also retreated. This morning the pound is worth \u20ac1.312 and $1.177 while the FTSE is down by 37 points \u2013 half a percent \u2013 at time of writing.

A group of 11 pension and investment funds managing more than \u00a3130bn worth of assets have filed a resolution calling for Barclays to set clear targets to phase out services to energy companies that fail to align with Paris climate goals. That includes lending to specific fossil fuel projects or for companies themselves, which include electricity and gas providers which fall foul of climate targets. The Paris agreement requires emissions to peak then fall rapidly to reach net-zero by 2050. The resolution, spearheaded by the campaign group ShareAction and signed by more than 100 additional individual shareholders, will be voted on at Barclays annual general meeting in May 2020. The Brunel Pension Partnership (BPP) \u2013 which manages \u00a330bn for local government pension schemes across counties such as Devon, Dorset, Oxfordshire, Somerset and Cornwall \u2013 was among the institutional investors backing the resolution.

      "body": "<p>When Bagia Arif Saputra was growing up in a university town near Jakarta, becoming a jihadist seemed a natural choice for young men like him, who were steeped in the teachings of Islamic fundamentalism. Less easy was reconciling this identity with his sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cI was living a double life,\u201d says Saputra. \u201cI would go to the campus mosque, try to focus on my prayers \u2026 and find myself checking out a guy and thinking, \u2018Nice ass\u2019. And then immediately, \u2018<em>Astaghfirullah </em>[God forgive me]!\u2019 So then I would have to redo my prayers. It was a vicious cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Saputra, now 34 and openly gay, recounts this serenely at the meditation centre he runs in the centre of the Indonesian capital. As a mindfulness expert who spent his formative years in student jihadist circles in conservative West Java, his life has combined two vastly different currents of modern Indonesia since its transition to democracy in 1998: the rise of religious piety and fundamentalism, and the explosion of a young, globalised middle-class.</p> <p>At the Golden Space meditation centre, in a high-rise apartment block, Saputra says he first attracted wider attention when he started appearing on the Indonesian lecture circuit as an \u201cex-closeted gay jihadist who found his dream job\u201d.</p> <p>The mere fact of openly identifying as gay in Indonesia, where in recent years the LGBTQ+ community has faced a rise in hateful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/22/why-lgbt-hatred-suddenly-spiked-in-indonesia\">political rhetoric </a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/08/indonesia-police-detain-51-men-in-raid-on-jakarta-gay-spa\">raids</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/14/indonesia-is-about-to-outlaw-homosexual-sex-can-we-stop-it\">potential criminalisation</a>, seemed remarkable.</p> <p>\u201cMy parents definitely cried and were upset with my \u2018choice\u2019,\u201d he says, recalling coming out to his family in June 2015, during Ramadan. \u201cBut they still love me and today we have a great relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Saputra grew up in Bandung, a university town three hours east of Jakarta that is known both for its lively cafe culture and as a hotbed of fundamentalism. He went to a <em>pesantren</em>, a traditional Muslim boarding school, and then to the Indonesia University of Education. </p> <p>In college, he felt adrift and was soon recruited to the Tarbiyah movement, the student wing of an Indonesian Islamist party modelled on the Muslim Brotherhood. This provided him with a sense of belonging.</p> <p>He adopted the mannerisms of Salafis, puritanical Muslims who seek to revive the traditions of Qur\u2019anic times: wearing ankle-length trousers and an untrimmed beard, refusing to shake hands with women, forgoing music and TV. At the time Indonesian Islamists were gripped by the Palestinian intifada and they stayed up late plotting to fight jihad alongside those they considered their Muslim brothers.</p> <p>\u201cI was ready to die,\u201d says Saputra. \u201cBecoming a jihadist seemed like an easy way to go straight to heaven.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the older boys were later recruited to Jemaah Islamiyah, the Indonesian affiliate of al-Qaida. </p> <p>But Saputra was becoming tormented by the clash between his fundamentalist peer group and his suppressed homosexuality. \u201cNo matter how hard I tried to pray the gay away, it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He eventually withdrew for a different reason. His parents were upset by his growing disinterest in school and he realised he had gone too far for even his pious Muslim family. At one point, he says, he had even reprimanded his mother for wearing a hijab that was too short. </p> <p>He left the group, graduated and headed to Jakarta, where he plunged into the underground gay scene.</p> <p>There, he spent his nights with lonely strangers and days on a carousel of corporate jobs. And he started calling himself an atheist.</p> <p>Then in February 2015 a friend gave him a week-long meditation course that changed his life. He studied with Umesh Nandwani, a Singapore-based meditation practitioner and Golden Space founder who, Saputra says, was one of the first people to recognise that he was gay.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he knew, but he unlocked something within me,\u201d Saputra says. </p> <p>Within four months of completing the course, he had become a dedicated practitioner himself \u2013 and had come out to most of the people in his life. Nandwani recruited him to open Golden Space Jakarta in late 2016 and today he oversees 15 trainers.</p> <p>\u201cMeditation is still something new for Indonesians,\u201d says Saputra. \u201cSome of them think it\u2019s a religious practice and is part of Hinduism or Buddhism. I have to explain to them that it\u2019s non-religious and that anyone can benefit from it.\u201d</p> <p>At least one in five Indonesians are now middle class, according to the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/12/04/indonesia-middle-class-vital-for-the-country-future\">World Bank</a>, and they are concentrated in Java and particularly in Jakarta. While meditation studios are still scarcer than in the holiday island of Bali, those in the capital are riding the wave of Jakarta\u2019s burgeoning wellness industry.</p> <p>Saputra, who met his partner of eight months at a meditation class, says that despite his own positive experiences since coming out, it is still not easy to be gay in Indonesia.</p> <p>\u201cMost of my gay friends here are not open, and with good reason. One of them had to undergo an exorcism when his parents found out,\u201d he says. Closeted people often come up to him after speaking engagements, from teenagers to married men, and confess that they are torn about their identity.</p> <p>\u201cI try to lead by example,\u201d he says. \u201cTo plant the seed that there is a possibility of being openly gay in Indonesia and having a good life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e9a22b752f9861ba9b1cce168045e09ad7bc58a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e9a22b752f9861ba9b1cce168045e09ad7bc58a/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bagia Arif Saputra (right), talking to his staff at the Golden Space studio in Jakarta, Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bagia Arif Saputra (right), talking to his staff at the Golden Space studio in Jakarta, Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Krithika Varagur</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After his flirtation with atheism, Saputra says he is once again a Muslim. \u201cI fast during Ramadan, but not out of fear.\u201d</p> <p>His specialty as a counsellor is anger management, because he has a lot of experience wrestling with that feeling. \u201cI carried so much anger within me: towards God for making me this way, towards my parents, towards myself,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cMeditation has helped me not to suppress this but to process it.\u201d</p> <p>Saputra believes it is anger that motivates religious fundamentalists too. \u201cThey are angry that the world has nothing to offer them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a coping mechanism.\u201d</p> <p>Whenever he sees news of occasional flares of terrorism in Indonesia, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/19/indonesia-blasts-surabaya-family-from-good-neighbours-suicide-bombers\">Surabaya suicide bombings</a> in 2018, he reflects on how easy it may be for such people to radicalise. </p> <p>\u201cThey probably thought it was the easiest path to heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cI certainly did.\u201d</p>",

It is hard to see how farming can feed us all even until 2050, let alone to the end of the century and beyond.</p> <p>Food production is ripping the living world apart. Fishing and farming are, by a long way, the <a href=\"https://ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment\" title=\"\">greatest cause of extinction</a> and loss of the diversity and abundance of wildlife. Farming is a major cause of climate breakdown, the biggest cause of <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/land-water/news-archive/news-detail/en/c/1032702/\" title=\"\">river pollution</a> and a hefty source of <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL068354\" title=\"\">air pollution</a>. Across vast tracts of the world\u2019s surface, it has replaced complex wild ecosystems with simplified human food chains. Industrial fishing is driving cascading ecological collapse in seas around the world. Eating is now a moral minefield, as almost everything we put in our mouths \u2013 from beef to avocados, cheese to chocolate, almonds to tortilla chips, salmon to peanut butter \u2013 has an insupportable environmental cost.</p> <p>But just as hope appeared to be evaporating, the new technologies I call farmfree food create astonishing possibilities to save both people and planet. Farmfree food will allow us to hand back vast areas of land and sea to nature, permitting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/16/britain-wild-nature-rewilding-ecosystems-heal-lives\" title=\"\">rewilding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/natural-world-climate-catastrophe-rewilding\" title=\"\">carbon drawdown</a> on a massive scale. It means an end to the exploitation of animals, an end to most deforestation, a massive reduction in the use of pesticides and fertiliser, the end of trawlers and longliners. It\u2019s our best hope of stopping what some have called the \u201csixth great extinction\u201d, but I prefer to call the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/09/polluters-climate-crisis-fossil-fuel\" title=\"\">great extermination</a>. And, if it\u2019s done right, it means cheap and abundant food for everyone.</p> <p>Research by the thinktank RethinkX suggests that proteins from precision fermentation will be around <a href=\"https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture\" title=\"\">10 times cheaper</a> than animal protein by 2035. The result, it says, will be the near-complete collapse of the livestock industry. The new food economy will \u201creplace an extravagantly inefficient system that requires enormous quantities of inputs and produces huge amounts of waste with one that is precise, targeted, and tractable\u201d. Using tiny areas of land, with a massively reduced requirement for water and nutrients, it \u201cpresents the greatest opportunity for environmental restoration in human history\u201d.</p> <p>Not only will food be cheaper, it will also be healthier. Because farmfree foods will be built up from simple ingredients, rather than broken down from complex ones, allergens, hard fats and other unhealthy components can be screened out. Meat will still be meat, though it will be grown in factories on <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00046/full\" title=\"\">collagen scaffolds</a>, rather than in the bodies of animals. Starch will still be starch, fats will still be fats. But food is likely to be better, cheaper and much less damaging to the living planet.</p> <p>It might seem odd for someone who has spent his life calling for political change to enthuse about a technological shift. But nowhere on Earth can I see sensible farm policies developing. Governments provide an astonishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/16/1m-a-minute-the-farming-subsidies-destroying-the-world\" title=\"\">\u00a3560bn a year</a> in farm subsidies, and almost all of them are perverse and destructive, driving deforestation, pollution and the killing of wildlife. Research by the Food and Land Use Coalition found that only 1% of the money is used to protect the living world. It failed to find \u201cany examples of governments using their fiscal instruments to directly support the expansion of supply of healthier and more nutritious food.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is the mainstream debate about farming taking us anywhere, except towards further catastrophe. There\u2019s a widespread belief that the problem is intensive farming, and the answer is extensification (producing less food per hectare). It\u2019s true that intensive farming is highly damaging, but extensive farming is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971732123X\" title=\"\">even worse</a>. Many people are rightly concerned about urban sprawl. But agricultural sprawl \u2013 which covers a much wider area \u2013 is a far greater threat to the natural world. Every hectare of land used by farming is a hectare not used for wildlife and complex living systems.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0138-5\" title=\"\">paper in Nature</a> suggests that, per kilo of food produced, extensive farming causes greater greenhouse gas emissions, soil loss, water use and nitrogen and phosphate pollution than intensive farming. If everyone ate pasture-fed meat, we would need several new planets on which to produce it.</p> <p>Farmfree production promises a far more stable and reliable food supply that can be grown anywhere, even in countries without farmland. It could be crucial to ending world hunger. But there is a hitch: a clash between consumer and producer interests. Many millions of people, working in farming and food processing, will eventually lose their jobs. Because the new processes are so efficient, the employment they create won\u2019t match the employment they destroy.</p> <p>RethinkX envisages an extremely rapid \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rethinkx.com/press-release/2019/9/16/new-report-major-disruption-in-food-and-agriculture-in-next-decade\" title=\"\">death spiral</a>\u201d in the livestock industry. Only a few components, such as the milk proteins casein and whey, need to be produced through fermentation for profit margins across an entire sector to collapse. Dairy farming in the United States, it claims, will be \u201call but bankrupt by 2030\u201d. It believes that the American beef industry\u2019s revenues will fall by 90% by 2035.</p> <p>While I doubt the collapse will be quite that fast, in one respect the thinktank underestimates the scale of the transformation. It fails to mention the extraordinary shift taking place in feedstock production to produce alternatives to plant products, of the kind pioneered in Helsinki. This is likely to hit arable farming as hard as cultured milk and meat production will hit livestock farming. Solar Foods thinks its products<strong> </strong>could reach cost parity with the world\u2019s cheapest form of protein (soya from South America) within five years. Instead of pumping ever more subsidies into a dying industry, governments should be investing in helping farmers into other forms of employment, while providing relief funds for those who will suddenly lose their livelihoods.</p> <p>Another hazard is the potential concentration of the farmfree food industry. We should strongly oppose the patenting of key technologies, to ensure the widest possible distribution of ownership. If governments regulate this properly, they could break the hegemony of the massive companies that now <a href=\"https://www.econexus.info/sites/econexus/files/Agropoly_Econexus_BerneDeclaration.pdf\" title=\"\">control global food commodities</a>. If they don\u2019t, they could reinforce it. In this sector, as in all others, we need strong anti-trust laws.

Williams has had trichotillomania, a condition that causes her to pull out her hair compulsively, since she was nine \u2013 and her original name was Balde. Well, it wasn\u2019t ideal.</p> <p>A 63-year-old picture framer from Warwickshire, Williams believes that her trichotillomania was triggered by the stress of her mother leaving the family home. She would lie awake at night and tug out great handfuls of hair, before rolling it up into a ball and hiding it behind the bed.

The British TV presenter and 90s lads\u2019 mags regular Gail Porter was diagnosed with alopecia in her 30s and has talked about her experience openly. After winning gold at the London Olympics in 2012, the cyclist Joanna Rowsell Shand, who also has alopecia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/15/joanna-rowsell-cyclist-alopecia-olympic-world-champion\" title=\"\">appeared on the podium jubilant and bald</a>.</p> <p>Lake, Porter and Rowsell Shand are high-profile advocates for the growing number of women choosing to accept their baldness, rather than hiding or disguising it. \u201cWigs have been a massive hindrance,\u201d says Alice Austin, a 32-year-old social worker from Nottingham. She started losing her hair due to alopecia when she was in primary school. By nine, Austin\u2019s hair had fallen out so much that she started wearing wigs to school. \u201cThey were these horrendously thick NHS wigs,\u201d she remembers. \u201cThe kids would call me \u2018Wiggy\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In secondary school, a boy pulled off Austin\u2019s wig as she was walking up a flight of stairs.

Last year, for the first time, she didn\u2019t renew her NHS wig prescription.</p> <p>Female hair loss can happen for a variety of reasons. \u201cThe most common reason is a disturbance in the hair cycle,\u201d says Dr David Fenton, a London-based dermatologist and spokesman for the British Association of Dermatologists. \u201cMore follicles enter the resting phase as a reaction to something that\u2019s happened in your life, whether it\u2019s fever, weight loss, illness, stress or thyroid dysfunction.\u201d This condition is called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/14/should-i-worry-about-my-hair-loss\" title=\"\">telogen effluvium</a>. \u201cAs long as you can identify the reason for telogen effluvium, it usually grows back,\u201d says Fenton. \u201cOccasionally, it will precipitate the female equivalent of genetic hair loss, which will require long-term therapy to prevent you losing more hair.\u201d</p> <p>Women can also experience hair loss due to hormone changes after the menopause, or if they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/polycystic-ovary-syndrome\" title=\"\">polycystic ovarian syndrome</a>. In this instance, doctors may prescribe antiandrogen contraceptives, which block the excessive production of male sex hormones in the body, which is known to cause hair loss.

      "bodyText": "Barbara Williams didn\u2019t get married just to change her name \u2013 of course not. But the opportunity to have a new surname was certainly an attractive proposition. Williams has had trichotillomania, a condition that causes her to pull out her hair compulsively, since she was nine \u2013 and her original name was Balde. Well, it wasn\u2019t ideal. A 63-year-old picture framer from Warwickshire, Williams believes that her trichotillomania was triggered by the stress of her mother leaving the family home. She would lie awake at night and tug out great handfuls of hair, before rolling it up into a ball and hiding it behind the bed. By her 30s, she was totally bald. \u201cIt was just awful,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even watch shampoo adverts on the television. There would be a horrible feeling in my chest.\u201d She wore wigs, but found them hot and uncomfortable. Then, when she turned 50, Williams decided: enough. She would be open with people about her condition and they could take her as they found her. \u201cI felt dirty and like I would be rejected,\u201d she says. \u201cIn fact, when I started telling people, it was a fantastic relief, like a great weight had been taken off my shoulders.\u201d Williams is far from the only woman to embrace her baldness.

This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/19/us-beekeepers-lost-40-of-honeybee-colonies-over-past-year-survey-finds\">is more than one-third</a> of commercial US bee colonies, the highest number since the annual survey started in the mid-2000s.</p> <p>Beekeepers attributed the high mortality rate to pesticide exposure, diseases from parasites and habitat loss. However, environmentalists and organic beekeepers maintain that the real culprit is something more systemic: America\u2019s reliance on industrial agriculture methods, especially those used by the almond industry, which demands a large-scale mechanization of one of nature\u2019s most delicate natural processes.</p> <p>Environmental advocates argue that the huge, commercially driven proliferation of the European honeybees used on almond farms is itself undermining the ecosystem for all bees. Honeybees out-compete diverse native bee species for forage, and threaten the endangered species that are already struggling to survive climate change. Environmentalists argue a better solution is to transform the way large-scale agriculture is carried out in the US.</p> <p>Like all bees, honeybees thrive in a biodiverse landscape. But California\u2019s almond industry places them in a monoculture where growers expect the bees to be predictably productive year after year.</p> <p>Commercial honeybees are considered livestock by the US Department of Agriculture because of the creature\u2019s vital role in food production. But no other class of livestock comes close to the scorched-earth circumstances that commercial honeybees face. More bees die every year in the US than all other fish and animals raised for slaughter combined.</p> <p>\u201cThe high mortality rate creates a sad business model for beekeepers,\u201d says Nate Donley, a senior scientist for the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s like sending the bees to war.

In 2000, almond orchards occupied 500,000 acres. By 2018 that had more than doubled \u2013 almond groves in the Central Valley now blanket an area the size of Delaware, producing 2.3bn lb (1m tonnes) of almonds annually sold around the world.</p> <p>The average American eats 2lb (900g) of almonds every year, more than in any other country. US almond milk sales have grown 250% over the past five years to reach $1.2bn, over four times that of any other plant-based milk, <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2018/a-showdown-in-the-us-milk-aisle-continued-at-the-end-of-july/\">according to a 2018 Nielsen report</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see a cap on growth at this point, especially with the incredible versatility of almonds in foods,\u201d says Richard Waycott, president and CEO of the Almond Board of California, a not-for-profit advocacy organization representing the majority of farmers.</p> <p>But these enormous orchards can\u2019t function without bees.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that long ago that beekeeping was mostly a boutique pursuit of the gentleman apiarist. When European immigrants introduced their own version of agriculture to North America, they also imported the art of beekeeping, along with boxes of <em>Apis mellifera</em>, the domesticated European honeybee.</p> <p>During the 19th and early 20th centuries, beekeepers earned a modest living selling beeswax and honey. But in the late 20th century there was a titanic shift, exemplified by the career of Dennis Arp.</p> <p>Arp, 67, got into beekeeping nearly four decades ago when he established his Mountain Top Honey company in Flagstaff, Arizona. A commanding presence with biceps toned from hoisting heavy bee boxes, Arp is the sort of diligent beekeeper who spends his days driving between apiary sites, and his nights studying online forums, reading articles on the latest mite treatment.</p> <p>When cheap imported honey began cutting into Arp\u2019s profits in the 1980s, he decided to send some of his hives with a beekeeper friend to pollinate almonds in California. A decade later he struck up a deal of his own with an almond grower in California\u2019s Kern county. With that strategic move, Arp joined the growing ranks of migratory beekeepers in the US who still sell honey but mostly travel the country from one pollination site to the next with stacks of bee boxes in tow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F37e569bd316d7134b9b92a7296676e1f643834cf%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5760_3840&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd44ea94e95adcd656c1329011eedcb00be1f34fb%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5437_3625&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"dennis arp works on hives\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F37e569bd316d7134b9b92a7296676e1f643834cf%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5760_3840&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd44ea94e95adcd656c1329011eedcb00be1f34fb%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5437_3625&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">dennis arp works on hives</a> <figcaption><em>Left:</em> Dennis Arp works his hives outside Rye. <em>Right:</em> A colony of honeybees hard at work for Mountain Top Honey Company outside Rye.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the early 1980s, when Arp was just selling honey, he would lose about 5% of his hives per year to disease or weather conditions. Around 2000, Arp\u2019s bees started dying in greater numbers.</p> <p>First, he experienced a nearly 100% loss of his hives from an infestation of tracheal mites. Then he had to cope with the intrusion of Africanized \u201ckiller\u201d bees. And finally, what he still considers the bane of his business, a parasitic mite called <em>Varroa destructor</em> literally sucked the life out of his bees. The mite feeds on the bee\u2019s plump body, destroying the insect\u2019s immune system and other vital functions. If Arp doesn\u2019t apply regular chemical treatments for the mites, his colonies will die.</p> <p>Now Arp finds himself in a vicious circle: he is constantly battling to keep enough bees alive to meet the requirements of his almond contract. But if he was not pollinating almonds, maybe his bees would be healthier.</p> <p>This year Arp\u2019s bees, like more than two-thirds of the United States\u2019 commercial honeybee population, will spend February in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/california-san-joaquin-valley-porterville-pollution-poverty\">toxic chemical soup</a> of California\u2019s Central Valley, fertilizing almonds one blossom at a time.</p> <p>Pesticides are used for all kinds of crops across the state, but the almond, <a href=\"https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/pur17rep/17sum.htm#almond\">at 35m</a><a href=\"https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/pur17rep/17sum.htm#almond\"> lb a year</a>, is doused with greater absolute quantities than any other. One of the most widely applied pesticides is the herbicide glyphosate (AKA Roundup), which is a staple of large-scale almond growers and has been shown to be lethal to bees as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/13/monsanto-cancer-trial-bayer-roundup-couple\">cause cancer</a> in humans. (The maker, Bayer-owned Monsanto, denies the cancer link when people use Roundup at the prescribed dosage. So far this year three US courts have found in favour of glyphosate users who developed forms of lymphoma; thousands more cases are pending.)</p> <p>On top of the threat of pesticides, almond pollination is uniquely demanding for bees because colonies are aroused from winter dormancy about one to two months earlier than is natural. The sheer quantity of hives required far exceeds that of other crops \u2013 apples, America\u2019s second-largest pollination crop, use only one-tenth the number of bees. And the bees are concentrated in one geographic region at the same time, exponentially increasing the risk of spreading sickness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86eaee394761e8196ad4e8f03434e53d688a26d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86eaee394761e8196ad4e8f03434e53d688a26d2/0_0_3008_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An almond tree blooms, near Visalia, in California.

It is like letting your bees go into a singles bar and then they have unprotected sex.\u201d</p> <p>The almond business has been good to Arp \u2013 last February, for instance, he installed 1,500 of his hives in one grower\u2019s orchard at $200 per hive \u2013 so he is reluctant to make a direct connection between the constant health challenges with his bees and the time spent every spring in the almond groves. \u201cThe bees like working on the almonds,\u201d says Arp. \u201cBut it obviously exposes them to risks.\u201d</p> <p>Now he routinely loses 30% or more of his bees a year, mirroring national statistics. In any other industry, the death of a third of your workforce would cause an international outcry \u2013 but this staggering loss is now considered the normal cost of doing business.</p> <p>\u201cThe bees in the almond groves are being exploited and disrespected,\u201d says Patrick Pynes, an organic beekeeper who teaches environmental studies at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. \u201cThey are in severe decline because our human relationship to them has become so destructive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"58e5a9880e073f79bf585f2493f4c24917293442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58e5a9880e073f79bf585f2493f4c24917293442/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beekeeper Dennis Arp and his son Adam work their hives outside Rye, Arizona on May 8, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arp and his son Adam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin O\u2019Hara/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The high price of growth</strong></h2> <p>When the phenomenon called <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/pollinator-health.aspx\">colony </a><a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/pollinator-health.aspx\">collapse </a><a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/pollinator-health.aspx\">disorder</a> was first identified in 2006, after a record number of honeybees mysteriously disappeared or died outside their hives, it was linked to a variety of factors including loss of habitat and climate change. But the primary culprit was pesticides. Researchers found that a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids was especially lethal to bees.</p> <p>Last May, the EPA pulled a dozen \u201cneonics\u201d from the market <a href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2018/pesticides-01-04-2018.php\">following a successful lawsuit</a> brought by beekeepers and environmental groups. <br><br>But there are many chemicals that are not labeled as bee toxic, even though they can make bees sick and weaken their immune systems. While bees may survive the pollination season, they may not last the winter or may take back substances that gradually poison the entire colony.</p> <p>Those on the almond growers\u2019 side acknowledge there is a huge problem. \u201cThe bee mortality rate is too high and is unacceptable,\u201d says the entomologist Bob Curtis, a pollination consultant for the Almond Board of California. \u201cIt is only because of the hard work and creativity of beekeepers that [almond growers] have gotten the bees they need.\u201d</p> <p>The almond board\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.almonds.com/pollination\">\u201cbest practice\u201d guidelines</a> encourage beekeepers to spend as little time in California\u2019s Central Valley as possible. Honeybees can travel up to three miles in search of varied forage, so even if the almond grower is doing everything right to protect a pollination investment, the cotton or grape farmer down the road may be spraying bee-toxic chemicals on crops.</p> <p>Even as almond production has steadily ramped up for decades, the number of commercial hives in the US has remained at a<a href=\"https://www.abfnet.org/page/PollinatorFacts\"> steady 2.7m</a><a href=\"https://www.abfnet.org/page/PollinatorFacts\"> colonies</a> since the early 2000s.

Arp has spent approximately $50,000 in the past year buying new hives to compensate for the 35% colony loss he experienced last year. He also spends at least $50,000 a year on mite treatments, not to mention other more aggressive measures the industry is taking just to maintain the status quo.<strong> </strong>These include splitting robust hives in half, introducing mail-order queens to new hives and fattening bees on corn syrup or on simulated pollen substances called \u201cpollen patties\u201d.</p> <p>Experts say that simply working around the pesticide problem isn\u2019t enough and that farming itself must be changed from the ground up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46e43d5a3bce1b7fa8e8527e3165a25ce51b1af3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46e43d5a3bce1b7fa8e8527e3165a25ce51b1af3/0_0_5433_3622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A smoker deters bees while Adam and Dennis Arp work on the hives outside Rye, Arizona on May 8, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A smoker deters bees while Adam and Dennis Arp work on the hives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin O\u2019Hara/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The search for a solution</strong></h2> <p>Hope is being found in a new certification program that, similar to \u201corganic\u201d or \u201cfair trade\u201d labels, will help consumers choose products that have been made with bee-friendly methods.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://beebettercertified.org\">\u201cBee Better\u201d certification program</a>, launched in 2017 by the not-for-profit Xerces Society, introduces biodiversity into almond groves to naturally control pests and nourish honey bees.

This shouldn\u2019t be happening to someone like Arp, a beekeeper with decades of experience. But his story is not unique. Commercial beekeepers who send their hives to the almond farms are seeing their bees die in record numbers, and nothing they do seems to stop the decline. A recent survey of commercial beekeepers showed that 50 billion bees \u2013 more than seven times the world\u2019s human population \u2013 were wiped out in a few months during winter 2018-19. This is more than one-third of commercial US bee colonies, the highest number since the annual survey started in the mid-2000s. Beekeepers attributed the high mortality rate to pesticide exposure, diseases from parasites and habitat loss. However, environmentalists and organic beekeepers maintain that the real culprit is something more systemic: America\u2019s reliance on industrial agriculture methods, especially those used by the almond industry, which demands a large-scale mechanization of one of nature\u2019s most delicate natural processes. Environmental advocates argue that the huge, commercially driven proliferation of the European honeybees used on almond farms is itself undermining the ecosystem for all bees. Honeybees out-compete diverse native bee species for forage, and threaten the endangered species that are already struggling to survive climate change. Environmentalists argue a better solution is to transform the way large-scale agriculture is carried out in the US. Like all bees, honeybees thrive in a biodiverse landscape. But California\u2019s almond industry places them in a monoculture where growers expect the bees to be predictably productive year after year. Commercial honeybees are considered livestock by the US Department of Agriculture because of the creature\u2019s vital role in food production. But no other class of livestock comes close to the scorched-earth circumstances that commercial honeybees face. More bees die every year in the US than all other fish and animals raised for slaughter combined. \u201cThe high mortality rate creates a sad business model for beekeepers,\u201d says Nate Donley, a senior scientist for the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s like sending the bees to war. Many don\u2019t come back.\u201d Nuts for almonds California\u2019s $11bn (\u00a38.4bn) almond industry has grown at an extraordinary rate. In 2000, almond orchards occupied 500,000 acres. By 2018 that had more than doubled \u2013 almond groves in the Central Valley now blanket an area the size of Delaware, producing 2.3bn lb (1m tonnes) of almonds annually sold around the world. The average American eats 2lb (900g) of almonds every year, more than in any other country. US almond milk sales have grown 250% over the past five years to reach $1.2bn, over four times that of any other plant-based milk, according to a 2018 Nielsen report. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a cap on growth at this point, especially with the incredible versatility of almonds in foods,\u201d says Richard Waycott, president and CEO of the Almond Board of California, a not-for-profit advocacy organization representing the majority of farmers. But these enormous orchards can\u2019t function without bees. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that beekeeping was mostly a boutique pursuit of the gentleman apiarist. When European immigrants introduced their own version of agriculture to North America, they also imported the art of beekeeping, along with boxes of Apis mellifera, the domesticated European honeybee. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, beekeepers earned a modest living selling beeswax and honey. But in the late 20th century there was a titanic shift, exemplified by the career of Dennis Arp. Arp, 67, got into beekeeping nearly four decades ago when he established his Mountain Top Honey company in Flagstaff, Arizona. A commanding presence with biceps toned from hoisting heavy bee boxes, Arp is the sort of diligent beekeeper who spends his days driving between apiary sites, and his nights studying online forums, reading articles on the latest mite treatment. When cheap imported honey began cutting into Arp\u2019s profits in the 1980s, he decided to send some of his hives with a beekeeper friend to pollinate almonds in California. A decade later he struck up a deal of his own with an almond grower in California\u2019s Kern county. With that strategic move, Arp joined the growing ranks of migratory beekeepers in the US who still sell honey but mostly travel the country from one pollination site to the next with stacks of bee boxes in tow. In the early 1980s, when Arp was just selling honey, he would lose about 5% of his hives per year to disease or weather conditions. Around 2000, Arp\u2019s bees started dying in greater numbers. First, he experienced a nearly 100% loss of his hives from an infestation of tracheal mites. Then he had to cope with the intrusion of Africanized \u201ckiller\u201d bees. And finally, what he still considers the bane of his business, a parasitic mite called Varroa destructor literally sucked the life out of his bees. The mite feeds on the bee\u2019s plump body, destroying the insect\u2019s immune system and other vital functions. If Arp doesn\u2019t apply regular chemical treatments for the mites, his colonies will die. Now Arp finds himself in a vicious circle: he is constantly battling to keep enough bees alive to meet the requirements of his almond contract. But if he was not pollinating almonds, maybe his bees would be healthier. This year Arp\u2019s bees, like more than two-thirds of the United States\u2019 commercial honeybee population, will spend February in the toxic chemical soup of California\u2019s Central Valley, fertilizing almonds one blossom at a time. Pesticides are used for all kinds of crops across the state, but the almond, at 35m lb a year, is doused with greater absolute quantities than any other. One of the most widely applied pesticides is the herbicide glyphosate (AKA Roundup), which is a staple of large-scale almond growers and has been shown to be lethal to bees as well as cause cancer in humans. (The maker, Bayer-owned Monsanto, denies the cancer link when people use Roundup at the prescribed dosage. So far this year three US courts have found in favour of glyphosate users who developed forms of lymphoma; thousands more cases are pending.) On top of the threat of pesticides, almond pollination is uniquely demanding for bees because colonies are aroused from winter dormancy about one to two months earlier than is natural. The sheer quantity of hives required far exceeds that of other crops \u2013 apples, America\u2019s second-largest pollination crop, use only one-tenth the number of bees. And the bees are concentrated in one geographic region at the same time, exponentially increasing the risk of spreading sickness. \u201cBees are exposed to all kinds of diseases in California,\u201d says Arp. \u201cThere can be hundreds of thousands of hives from multiple beekeepers in one staging area. It is like letting your bees go into a singles bar and then they have unprotected sex.\u201d The almond business has been good to Arp \u2013 last February, for instance, he installed 1,500 of his hives in one grower\u2019s orchard at $200 per hive \u2013 so he is reluctant to make a direct connection between the constant health challenges with his bees and the time spent every spring in the almond groves. \u201cThe bees like working on the almonds,\u201d says Arp. \u201cBut it obviously exposes them to risks.\u201d Now he routinely loses 30% or more of his bees a year, mirroring national statistics. In any other industry, the death of a third of your workforce would cause an international outcry \u2013 but this staggering loss is now considered the normal cost of doing business. \u201cThe bees in the almond groves are being exploited and disrespected,\u201d says Patrick Pynes, an organic beekeeper who teaches environmental studies at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. \u201cThey are in severe decline because our human relationship to them has become so destructive.\u201d The high price of growth When the phenomenon called colony collapse disorder was first identified in 2006, after a record number of honeybees mysteriously disappeared or died outside their hives, it was linked to a variety of factors including loss of habitat and climate change. But the primary culprit was pesticides. Researchers found that a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids was especially lethal to bees. Last May, the EPA pulled a dozen \u201cneonics\u201d from the market following a successful lawsuit brought by beekeepers and environmental groups. But there are many chemicals that are not labeled as bee toxic, even though they can make bees sick and weaken their immune systems. While bees may survive the pollination season, they may not last the winter or may take back substances that gradually poison the entire colony. Those on the almond growers\u2019 side acknowledge there is a huge problem. \u201cThe bee mortality rate is too high and is unacceptable,\u201d says the entomologist Bob Curtis, a pollination consultant for the Almond Board of California. \u201cIt is only because of the hard work and creativity of beekeepers that [almond growers] have gotten the bees they need.\u201d The almond board\u2019s \u201cbest practice\u201d guidelines encourage beekeepers to spend as little time in California\u2019s Central Valley as possible. Honeybees can travel up to three miles in search of varied forage, so even if the almond grower is doing everything right to protect a pollination investment, the cotton or grape farmer down the road may be spraying bee-toxic chemicals on crops. Even as almond production has steadily ramped up for decades, the number of commercial hives in the US has remained at a steady 2.7m colonies since the early 2000s. With all the challenges beekeepers face, just maintaining the bare minimum is a struggle. One coping strategy pursued by the almond industry has been to breed almond varieties that require only one hive per acre to pollinate, instead of two. And last January, a pollinator protection law went into effect in California as part of the state\u2019s \u201cBee Where\u201d initiative. For this program, beekeepers are required to register the location of their hives with the county\u2019s agricultural commissioner and farmers must notify the commissioner in advance of any plans to spray pesticides. Even so, the costs beekeepers incur trying to keep their bees alive are constantly rising. Arp has spent approximately $50,000 in the past year buying new hives to compensate for the 35% colony loss he experienced last year. He also spends at least $50,000 a year on mite treatments, not to mention other more aggressive measures the industry is taking just to maintain the status quo. These include splitting robust hives in half, introducing mail-order queens to new hives and fattening bees on corn syrup or on simulated pollen substances called \u201cpollen patties\u201d. Experts say that simply working around the pesticide problem isn\u2019t enough and that farming itself must be changed from the ground up. The search for a solution Hope is being found in a new certification program that, similar to \u201corganic\u201d or \u201cfair trade\u201d labels, will help consumers choose products that have been made with bee-friendly methods. The \u201cBee Better\u201d certification program, launched in 2017 by the not-for-profit Xerces Society, introduces biodiversity into almond groves to naturally control pests and nourish honey bees. Xerces is working with almond growers to plant California wildflowers, mustard and clover in between the rows of trees and native flowering hedges along the perimeter of the orchard \u2013 a kind of eco-friendly fence to keep bees in the orchard. The program scored a victory when H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream became the first food company to carry products with the Bee Better seal. The company\u2019s bee-friendly vanilla milk chocolate almond bar was rolled out in December at Costco, Sam\u2019s Club and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, with three more bee-friendly almond ice cream flavors to be available in early 2020. Letting nature take its course is nothing new for 81-year old Glenn Anderson. He is the first and still one of the few organic almond growers in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley. His 40-year-old orchard is small \u2013 just 20 acres \u2013 and has always been chemical free. \u201cWe don\u2019t have pests; we have biodiversity,\u201d says Anderson, who primarily sells directly to individual customers through his Anderson Almonds company. Unlike large industrial almond farms that strip the orchard ground bare to more efficiently treat for insects and fungi, Anderson allows a rich understory to grow, which naturally nourishes the soil and strengthens the trees. Anderson hires a \u201cbeekeeper hobbyist\u201d from northern California every spring to install about 20 hives in his orchard. \u201cWe have the opposite of colony collapse at my farm,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cMy beekeeper brings weak hives down that he wants to recharge on my property.\u201d Anderson says the tradeoff for not using pesticides is that his annual crop yield is lower \u2013 typically about 10,000 pounds \u2013 and he keeps his orchard small in order to manage its wildness. \u201cI\u2019m averse to an expansion model,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit me much.\u201d And as for industrial-grown almonds? \u201cThey taste like cardboard,\u201d he says. Back in Arizona, Dennis Arp and his son Adam are just trying to make it through the next few months with as many healthy bees as possible. There are days when the costs seem overwhelming, and Arp wonders if he should hang up his honey-stained bee suit. But beekeeping is what he knows best, and he wants to pass the business on to his son. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we will pull it off yet,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we will make it work.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 and 10 January 2020 to clarify how the almond industry is breeding nuts that require fewer hives-per-acre to pollinate. The piece has also been updated to include Monsanto\u2019s stance on glyphosate and cancer, and to note that commercially driven proliferation of the European honeybees is itself undermining diversity among US bee species.",

Fearing eviction, Christianah approached Hammersmith and Fulham council and met with Laurie Shirley, its tenancy sustainment and landlord support officer.</p> <p>Shirley sees many residents threatened with losing their home because low wages and zero-hours contracts make it impossible to pay the high rents in the west London borough, especially for single mothers, who the housing charity Shelter has identified as being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45800186\" title=\"\">disproportionately affected by rising homelessness</a>. \u201cBalancing work and childcare can be difficult for any parent \u2013 add to that wildly unaffordable private rents and the chronic shortage of social homes and it\u2019s no surprise so many are struggling to keep a roof over their children\u2019s heads,\u201d says Shelter chief executive, Polly Neate.</p> <p>Shirley believes training to get a foot on a career ladder is vital to help provide stability. So she <a href=\"https://beam.org/\" title=\"\">referred Christianah to Beam</a>, a charity whose digital platform helps people who have experienced homelessness to crowdfund for the training and qualifications they need to start their career. </p> <p>Beam helped <a href=\"https://beam.org/campaigns/christianah-dental-nurse\" title=\"\">Christianah set up a crowdfunding page</a> containing her story, photos and a budget breakdown of the total costs the training would set her back. Paying for childcare was the main expenditure, dwarfing the \u00a31,775 fees for the dental nurse diploma. Then there was a first aid course and hepatitis B vaccinations to pay for. In total, Beam calculated that she needed to raise \u00a34,557. Christianah admits it was daunting to share details of her life with complete strangers online. \u201cI\u2019m quite a private person. The main reason I did it was because I thought I may be able to help someone else in my position who didn\u2019t know where to turn,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f13e20dd1cd99f4908e10297898e18f6ec8b061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f13e20dd1cd99f4908e10297898e18f6ec8b061/0_1375_3992_2394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beam founder, Alex Stephany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I get contacted by people from all over the world who feel very disempowered and want to help homeless people.\u2019 Beam founder, Alex Stephany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first, she says she was worried no one would help and checked her campaign page everyday. Shirley got the ball rolling with a \u00a310 donation and posted words of encouragement for other would-be supporters: \u201cChristianah had so much drive and ambition. I am so happy that she is on the path to upskill herself. Well done and good luck.\u201d It took just over a month for Christianah to hit her target of \u00a34,557, thanks to 223 supporters.</p> <p>Since the end of 2017, more than 200 people have <a href=\"https://beam.org/transparency\" title=\"\">crowdfunded enough financial support</a> through Beam to become trainee healthcare assistants, electricians, plumbers, and beauticians among other jobs, and will eventually earn an average salary of \u00a328k. Many courses are day release from an entry-level job, so participants have to find employment as well as raise funds. Christianah fired off her CV to local dental surgeries and secured work as a dental assistant in a practice in Chelsea.</p> <p>But not all people referred to Beam are ready for jobs. Beam founder, Alex Stephany, says that only one in five are initially able to make this transition to work. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to set up people to fail, but we direct them to other services. For example, there was one chap who engaged with Alcoholics Anonymous and when he was clean he came back to us and got his training and now works on a construction site.\u201d</p> <p>The charity has contracts with four local authorities and partners with 31 charities in London. Hammersmith and Fulham was the first council in Britain to work with Beam. It has the <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_releases/articles/280,000_people_in_england_are_homeless,_with_thousands_more_at_risk\" title=\"\">17th highest number of homeless people</a> in England \u2013 totalling more than 3,000. Sue Fennimore, the council\u2019s deputy leader, says it\u2019s not a panacea to building more affordable homes, but fits into a much wider homelessness strategy. \u201cWe have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/28/housing-crisis-houses-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">a dreadful housing crisis</a>.

After all, Christianah does have a flat. But, as she points out: \u201cI was homeless and could be again. You can get into bad situations and don\u2019t always have the support networks. With a bit of education and skills we can get good jobs, pay taxes and give back to society.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://beam.org/about\" title=\"\">Stephany</a> says Beam hopes to help one person a day in London in 2020 (tripling its 2019 numbers) and he is keen to talk to other cities in the UK and worldwide about replicating the model. \u201cI get contacted by people from all over the world \u2013 just last week, people from South Africa, and a few cities in the US and Europe \u2013 who feel very disempowered and want to help homeless people, and by people who want to use the service.

Shirley sees many residents threatened with losing their home because low wages and zero-hours contracts make it impossible to pay the high rents in the west London borough, especially for single mothers, who the housing charity Shelter has identified as being disproportionately affected by rising homelessness. \u201cBalancing work and childcare can be difficult for any parent \u2013 add to that wildly unaffordable private rents and the chronic shortage of social homes and it\u2019s no surprise so many are struggling to keep a roof over their children\u2019s heads,\u201d says Shelter chief executive, Polly Neate. Shirley believes training to get a foot on a career ladder is vital to help provide stability. So she referred Christianah to Beam, a charity whose digital platform helps people who have experienced homelessness to crowdfund for the training and qualifications they need to start their career. Beam helped Christianah set up a crowdfunding page containing her story, photos and a budget breakdown of the total costs the training would set her back. Paying for childcare was the main expenditure, dwarfing the \u00a31,775 fees for the dental nurse diploma. Then there was a first aid course and hepatitis B vaccinations to pay for. In total, Beam calculated that she needed to raise \u00a34,557. Christianah admits it was daunting to share details of her life with complete strangers online. \u201cI\u2019m quite a private person. The main reason I did it was because I thought I may be able to help someone else in my position who didn\u2019t know where to turn,\u201d she says. At first, she says she was worried no one would help and checked her campaign page everyday. Shirley got the ball rolling with a \u00a310 donation and posted words of encouragement for other would-be supporters: \u201cChristianah had so much drive and ambition. I am so happy that she is on the path to upskill herself. Well done and good luck.\u201d It took just over a month for Christianah to hit her target of \u00a34,557, thanks to 223 supporters. Since the end of 2017, more than 200 people have crowdfunded enough financial support through Beam to become trainee healthcare assistants, electricians, plumbers, and beauticians among other jobs, and will eventually earn an average salary of \u00a328k. Many courses are day release from an entry-level job, so participants have to find employment as well as raise funds. Christianah fired off her CV to local dental surgeries and secured work as a dental assistant in a practice in Chelsea. But not all people referred to Beam are ready for jobs. Beam founder, Alex Stephany, says that only one in five are initially able to make this transition to work. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to set up people to fail, but we direct them to other services. For example, there was one chap who engaged with Alcoholics Anonymous and when he was clean he came back to us and got his training and now works on a construction site.\u201d The charity has contracts with four local authorities and partners with 31 charities in London. Hammersmith and Fulham was the first council in Britain to work with Beam. It has the 17th highest number of homeless people in England \u2013 totalling more than 3,000. Sue Fennimore, the council\u2019s deputy leader, says it\u2019s not a panacea to building more affordable homes, but fits into a much wider homelessness strategy. \u201cWe have a dreadful housing crisis. But we need to look at every single barrier. Helping people into a sustainable career is what some of those who have experienced homelessness need.\u201d Although Beam only works in the capital now, its 4,489 supporters are drawn from across the country and have raised a total of more than \u00a3660,000. Joanna Panton and her husband, Ian, live in Exeter. They heard about Beam after seeing a man on TV who had been helped to become a crane rigger. \u201cI like the idea of lots of people chipping in to make a long-lasting difference to a homeless person\u2019s future,\u201d says Joanna, who gives \u00a325 a month. \u201cI feel bad about seeing people on the street but I don\u2019t give them money. I want to know more about them and to make a meaningful difference and that doesn\u2019t seem possible as a chance encounter.\u201d For the 67-year-old, posting messages of support are as important as the money. \u201cWe admire you both and wish you every success,\u201d she wrote to Christianah and fellow dental nurse trainee Sara. Beam may not seem the obvious charity to support to end homelessness. After all, Christianah does have a flat. But, as she points out: \u201cI was homeless and could be again. You can get into bad situations and don\u2019t always have the support networks. With a bit of education and skills we can get good jobs, pay taxes and give back to society.\u201d Stephany says Beam hopes to help one person a day in London in 2020 (tripling its 2019 numbers) and he is keen to talk to other cities in the UK and worldwide about replicating the model. \u201cI get contacted by people from all over the world \u2013 just last week, people from South Africa, and a few cities in the US and Europe \u2013 who feel very disempowered and want to help homeless people, and by people who want to use the service. But we need a physical presence to make it work. This year we will bring a focus to improving our processes and scaleability beyond London.\u201d Meanwhile, the charity\u2019s approach is garnering numerous accolades, including as overall winner of this year\u2019s Tech4Good awards and the best financial inclusion organisation in Europe from MIT. Back in Hammersmith, Christianah says she would like to meet her supporters face to face to say thank you. Moreover, once she has finished her course, she wants to become a Beam supporter herself. She says: \u201cI don\u2019t really like asking people for help. So it would be like paying back.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Oil prices surged on Wednesday after an Iranian missile attack on US and coalition military bases in Iraq that sparked fears of all-out war between Iran and America. European and US benchmark prices were up as much as 4% in the immediate aftermath of the attack, with the price of Brent crude busting through the US$70 mark. Prices of both Brent and another key benchmark blend, West Texas Intermediate, fell back as markets digested news of the attacks, but remained more than 1% higher than on Tuesday. The rises added to oil prices already elevated by market jitters over the US assassination of top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Fears of war have also hit stock markets across Asia, with the Australian exchange falling around 1% during trade on Wednesday before recovering most of its losses after Iranian officials played down the prospect of further attacks on US interests. The international tensions add to existing economic fears in Australia, which is battling deadly and expensive bushfires that experts say risk making consistently weak consumer spending even worse. Investors have also poured into traditional safe haven gold, with the price of an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of the precious metal adding 3% on Wednesday on top of strong increases last week. Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missile attacks on air bases in Al Assad and Erbil on Wednesday \u201cin the name of martyr General Qassem Suleimani\u201d, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said. On the orders of president Donald Trump, US forces used a drone to assassinate Suleimani near the Baghdad airport on Friday. While much of the ASX recovered losses on Wednesday afternoon, Australian flag carrier Qantas was down almost 3.4%. Many Qantas-branded flights are code-shares with Emirates, which is based in Dubai \u2013 just across the Persian Gulf from Iran. The US Federal Aviation Authority has banned American airlines from flying to the region but the ruling does not bind Australian operators. \u201cEach airline makes its own judgment,\u201d Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She said broader effects included air pollution, which has affected 30% of the population, and would cause \u201creduced worker productivity, increased health spending, and lower crop yields\u201d, as well as road closures and the cost to insurers.</p> \n<p>As of Monday, more than 8,200 claims worth about $644m had been lodged, according to Insurance Council of Australia data.</p> \n<p>The ratings agency S&amp;P said the claims were likely to crimp the profitability of insurers and lead to rises in premiums.</p> \n<p>Ell said indirect damage to the economy would be \u201csignificant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe devastating social impacts of the fires mean that already-fragile consumer confidence will take an added hit,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Australian consumer was already shying away from discretionary spending and the widespread air pollution and devastation are further deterrents.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the odds of the Reserve Bank cutting official rates from the already record low level of 0.75% to 0.5% when its board meets on 4 February were already high.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/should-fossil-fuels-pay-for-australias-new-bushfire-reality-it-is-the-industry-most-responsible\">Should fossil fuels pay for Australia's new bushfire reality?

      "bodyText": "The economic damage from the bushfires devastating Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard is likely to exceed the record $4.4bn set by 2009\u2019s Black Saturday blazes, Moody\u2019s Analytics has said. The Moody\u2019s economist Katrina Ell said the fires would further cripple Australia\u2019s already anaemic consumer confidence, increasing the chances of a rate cut next month, as well as causing damage to the economy through increased air pollution and direct harm to industries such as farming and tourism. She said the risk of damage to the broader economy, outside areas ravaged by fire, was increased because the bushfire season still had months to run. So far the fires have charred at least 8.4m hectares across the whole country, compared with the 450,000 ha affected by Black Saturday. The 2009 fires, which ripped through relatively densely populated rural areas north of Melbourne, killed 173 people and almost completely destroyed the town of Marysville. So far, 25 people are known to have died in this season\u2019s fires, which have also done severe damage to many towns, including Cobargo and Mogo on the NSW south coast, and Mallacoota in the far south-east of Victoria. Ell said that in the past bushfires had tended only to hurt the local economies directly in the path of the flames. \u201cBut the risk of there being broader macroeconomic spillovers this season are high given the scale of the fires, as well as the fact that it is still early in the bushfire season and the existing fires are yet to be contained,\u201d she said. She said the direct effect on local industries came on top of the pain of Australia\u2019s lengthy drought. \u201cDamage to fresh produce will put upward pressure on consumer prices, given that most fresh fruit and vegetables consumed at home are sourced locally,\u201d she said. She said tourism had also taken a \u201csignificant hit\u201d during what is normally peak season. Tourism bodies say it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild. \u201cVisitor numbers are significantly down in summer hot spots as smoke haze and uncertainty about safety keep local and international travellers away,\u201d she said. She said broader effects included air pollution, which has affected 30% of the population, and would cause \u201creduced worker productivity, increased health spending, and lower crop yields\u201d, as well as road closures and the cost to insurers. As of Monday, more than 8,200 claims worth about $644m had been lodged, according to Insurance Council of Australia data. The ratings agency S&amp;P said the claims were likely to crimp the profitability of insurers and lead to rises in premiums. Ell said indirect damage to the economy would be \u201csignificant\u201d. \u201cThe devastating social impacts of the fires mean that already-fragile consumer confidence will take an added hit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Australian consumer was already shying away from discretionary spending and the widespread air pollution and devastation are further deterrents.\u201d She said the odds of the Reserve Bank cutting official rates from the already record low level of 0.75% to 0.5% when its board meets on 4 February were already high. \u201cThe fires increase those odds,\u201d she said. But she said direct spending by governments on the recovery effort would probably be more effective. \u201cFiscal measures can target the particular areas concerned, whereas monetary policy has a blunt impact,\u201d she said. The Morrison government has so far pledged $2bn in fire relief \u2013 although the money will flow over two years \u2013 and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have weakened their previously rock-solid commitment to returning the budget to surplus. \u201cThis potentially gives the government more flexibility to support the rebuild efforts and the broader economy,\u201d Ell said. She said rebuilding efforts usually helped offset the damage caused by fires. \u201cBut in this circumstance, rebuilding could be delayed for months, since many fires are ongoing, and this is only the start of the usual bushfire season. \u201cIt could be some months before efforts move from fire containment to rebuilding.\u201d The economic impact has been particularly severe on Kangaroo Island, off the coast of South Australia, where tourists have been evacuated, farms devastated and timber plantations burned. On Wednesday, Kangaroo Island Plantation Timber told the stock exchange about 90% of its timber had been affected by the fire, which has burned the western third of the island.",

It\u2019s really pleasing that the patients are now getting to a point of recovery where they could leave hospital.\u201d Burns surgeons brought in from the US and Australia, as well as around New Zealand, meant some of Middlemore\u2019s overworked staff were able to spend Christmas with their families, and the hospital was preparing to repatriate some of White Island\u2019s victims to their families in the northern hemisphere. \u201cThe problem is the visitors injured are from a long way away \u2013 getting to the northern hemisphere is 24 hours and they need medical escorts and teams,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to ensure they\u2019re well enough to travel in commercial flights, but also there are many family groups and couples here, so it\u2019s about keeping families together as well because it\u2019s the family support which is really important in terms of recovery.\u201d Watson said his team would be busy with White Island victims for at least the next two months, with medical transfers hoped to begin at the end of January. The burns ward was still at capacity, but New Zealanders remained generous even a month on, stopping by with food, games and electronic equipment for Whakaari patients and staff treating them. Donor skin purchased from the US and Australia was used as a temporary skin graft and functioned as a kind of live \u201cdressing\u201d, Watson said. This was now being replaced by victims\u2019 own skin, but was a slow process as skin had to be given time to grow and the operations were delicate and complex. Thirteen White Island victims repatriated in December remain in burns units in Australian hospitals.",

It will be installed at the city\u2019s historic West Hoe Pier.</p> <p>Antunes, who represented Portugal at the 2019 Venice Biennale, has created a stained glass window in a church that has been converted into an art space and also has a sculpture exhibition.</p> <p>Nigel Hurst, head of contemporary arts at the Box, said the two commission show was a \u201cstatement of intent\u201d for the museum. \u201cThis is hugely important, in terms of the growth of the city,\u201d said Hurst.</p> <p>\u201cMore artists are choosing to live in the south-west because of the prohibitive costs of living in London, so we need a programme that brings the historic collection to life for modern audiences, and also provides a high-quality contemporary offering.\u201d</p> <p>Gormley said: \u201cI am delighted by the site and honoured that this work has been commissioned by Plymouth to look out over the sea that has played such an important part in forming the outward-looking character of these islands.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b907cb6d5ea57a9da1e3022942e58df78cf6e689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b907cb6d5ea57a9da1e3022942e58df78cf6e689/0_1194_3672_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The fused glass window for St Luke\u2019s Church 2 by Leonor Antunes, which is part of the Box in Plymouth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fused glass window for St Luke\u2019s Church 2 by Leonor Antunes, which is part of the Box in Plymouth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c/o Leonor Antunes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Box is the flagship building for the <a href=\"https://www.mayflower400uk.org/about/\">Mayflower 400 commemorations</a>, which will celebrate the anniversary of the pilgrims\u2019 voyage from Plymouth to Massachusetts in 1620. It combines the original city museum, art gallery and central library buildings and restores St Luke\u2019s Church, where Antunes\u2019 work will sit.</p> <p>Antunes, who has been commissioned to create a new public art installation, said her stained glass window, which was inspired by a section of the 1726 book Insects of Surinam by the pioneering naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian, \u201ccelebrates female craftmanship and exploration\u201d.</p> <p>She told the Guardian the window was an \u201cinteresting challenge\u201d and she worked with a Swiss company to create the pane that will permanently sit in St Luke\u2019s Church.</p> <p>\u201cThe nature of the space is changed and it is no longer a church. It\u2019s becoming a gallery space, and being able to do something new was incredibly exciting,\u201d said Antunes. \u201cIt is also a chance to create something that speaks to the city and its relationship to the coast and the water and this idea of exchange.\u201d</p> <p>In 2019, the Box announced that a collection of 19th-century wooden figureheads from British naval warships would be suspended from its ceiling after being restored. The 14 figureheads, which were badly water-damaged, include a two tonne <a href=\"http://figureheads.ukmcs.org.uk/hms-royal-william/\">figure of William IV</a> carved in Devonport, Plymouth in 1833.</p> <p>There is no official opening date for the Box, but it is expected to open in spring this year, according to Hurst, who said the museum would help to create a \u201cpermanent legacy\u201d in the city.</p>",

      "bodyText": "New works by Antony Gormley and Portuguese contemporary artist Leonor Antunes have been announced as the inaugural commissions at the Box, the new \u00a340m museum and heritage space in Plymouth that will open this spring. Gormley\u2019s LOOK II is an \u201canthropomorphic cast iron sculpture\u201d that features 22 iron blocks made into a twice-lifesize figure. It will be installed at the city\u2019s historic West Hoe Pier. Antunes, who represented Portugal at the 2019 Venice Biennale, has created a stained glass window in a church that has been converted into an art space and also has a sculpture exhibition. Nigel Hurst, head of contemporary arts at the Box, said the two commission show was a \u201cstatement of intent\u201d for the museum. \u201cThis is hugely important, in terms of the growth of the city,\u201d said Hurst. \u201cMore artists are choosing to live in the south-west because of the prohibitive costs of living in London, so we need a programme that brings the historic collection to life for modern audiences, and also provides a high-quality contemporary offering.\u201d Gormley said: \u201cI am delighted by the site and honoured that this work has been commissioned by Plymouth to look out over the sea that has played such an important part in forming the outward-looking character of these islands.\u201d The Box is the flagship building for the Mayflower 400 commemorations, which will celebrate the anniversary of the pilgrims\u2019 voyage from Plymouth to Massachusetts in 1620. It combines the original city museum, art gallery and central library buildings and restores St Luke\u2019s Church, where Antunes\u2019 work will sit. Antunes, who has been commissioned to create a new public art installation, said her stained glass window, which was inspired by a section of the 1726 book Insects of Surinam by the pioneering naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian, \u201ccelebrates female craftmanship and exploration\u201d. She told the Guardian the window was an \u201cinteresting challenge\u201d and she worked with a Swiss company to create the pane that will permanently sit in St Luke\u2019s Church. \u201cThe nature of the space is changed and it is no longer a church. It\u2019s becoming a gallery space, and being able to do something new was incredibly exciting,\u201d said Antunes. \u201cIt is also a chance to create something that speaks to the city and its relationship to the coast and the water and this idea of exchange.\u201d In 2019, the Box announced that a collection of 19th-century wooden figureheads from British naval warships would be suspended from its ceiling after being restored. The 14 figureheads, which were badly water-damaged, include a two tonne figure of William IV carved in Devonport, Plymouth in 1833. There is no official opening date for the Box, but it is expected to open in spring this year, according to Hurst, who said the museum would help to create a \u201cpermanent legacy\u201d in the city.",
