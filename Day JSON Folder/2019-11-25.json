But the denials came as a new report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warned the Chinese Communist party is using the country\u2019s civilian universities to advance its military technology, and countries that collaborate with some institutions risk undermining their own national security. In response to allegations, first published in Nine newspapers, of a complex Chinese espionage network in Australia, including a plan to plant 32-year-old Liberal party member Bo \u201cNick\u201d Zhao in parliament as a pro-Beijing member, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the claims were a fabrication. \u201cSome Australian politicians, institutions and media have been highly tense on China-related issues. They seem to have reached a state of hysteria and extreme nervousness. Stories like \u2018Chinese espionage\u2019 or \u2018China\u2019s infiltration in Australia\u2019, with however bizarre plots and eye-catching details, are nothing but lies,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t interfere in other countries\u2019 internal affairs. We develop friendly cooperation with Australia and other countries based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. We have not interfered and are never interested in interfering in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs.\u201d Zhao died in a hotel room in March this year, weeks after telling Asio he\u2019d been approached to run for parliament. Geng said the alleged spy at the centre of the revelations, Wang Liqiang, who is claiming to defect and is seeking asylum in Australia, was a fugitive suspected of fraud and was travelling on forged documents. \u201cHowever, some Australian media and people are still clinging to their wrong position, quoting a person who is a criminal suspect and has zero credibility, hyping up so-called \u2018China threat\u2019 or \u2018Chinese espionage\u2019 and making smear campaigns that only turned out to be an unbelievably awkward farce.\u201d Wang denies all of the allegations made against him. As China denied all foreign interference, the report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute argued Chinese interference in other countries was significantly advanced. Alex Joske, author of Aspi\u2019s China Defence Universities Tracker, said the Chinese government\u2019s strategy of \u201cmilitary-civil fusion\u201d was designed to harness research innovation in Chinese universities to accelerate military development and maximise the country\u2019s hard power \u2013 and created dilemmas for when other countries attempt research collaboration. Aspi\u2019s tracker, released Monday, is designed as a tool for governments, universities and other organisations around world to assess the risks of cooperating with Chinese institutions. Ninety-two institutions in the database, including 20 civilian universities, have been placed in the very high risk category. Twenty-three civilian universities have been placed in the high risk category. The tracker finds at least 15 civilian universities have been implicated in cyberattacks, illegal exports or espionage. China\u2019s defence industry conglomerates are supervising agencies of nine universities and have sent thousands of their employees to train abroad. \u201cThis is the result of a really high-level policy, personally supervised by president Xi Jinping, seeking to exploit civilian resources and to break down barriers between the military and civilian universities so that all of the research and innovation within the universities can be capitalised by the military,\u201d Joske said. Joske said many of the 160 defence-focused laboratories disguised their military ties but were funded and supervised by the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cMany of these defence labs obscure their defence links in official translations of their names. National defence science and technology key laboratories often simply call themselves \u2018national key laboratories\u2019.\u201d The release of the tracker comes less than a fortnight after the education minister Dan Tehan released new foreign interference guidelines for Australian universities, which include additional responsibilities around governance, due diligence towards research collaborations and staff appointments, and greater protections from cyberattack. Joske said the guidelines were a \u201creally valuable starting point\u201d, but the sheer scale of China\u2019s research investment, the opaque nature of the ultimate controlling body and the swiftness with which new centres were opening made assessing new collaborations difficult. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing risk that collaboration with PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] universities can be leveraged by the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) or security agencies for surveillance, human rights abuses or military purposes. \u201cUniversities and governments remain unable to effectively manage risks that come with growing collaboration with PRC entities.

But Albanese said it was important that public discussion of the issues be \u201csober\u201d and not rancorous.</p> <p>Voters most likely to think Australia is not doing enough to deal with the risk of climate change are under 34, and support Labor or the Greens \u2013 although the latest Guardian Essential survey indicates that 46% of Coalition voters in the sample share this view.</p> <p>The poll indicates that 61% of the sample believes that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. That level of support is consistent with readings taken in March this year and October of last year. While that view is supported by 74% of Labor voters in the sample and 89% of Greens voters, it is supported by just under half of Coalition voters, 47%.</p> <p>Just over a quarter of the sample (28%) says people aren\u2019t witnessing climate change, they are witnessing a normal fluctuation in the Earth\u2019s climate. Perceptions are different depending on the age of voters. People aged 18-34 are most likely to accept anthropogenic climate change (74%) and voters over 55 are least likely to (50%).</p> <p>A separate poll of 25,000 Australians aged 15 to 19, released on Tuesday, shows a sharp rise in concern for the environment and climate change in both cities and regional areas.</p> <p>As part of the 18th annual <a href=\"https://www.missionaustralia.com.au/what-we-do/research-impact-policy-advocacy/youth-survey\">Mission Australia youth survey</a>, people were asked to name the three most important issues for Australia. Behind mental health, the environment was ranked the second most important issue, chosen by 34% of young people, with more than half of those citing climate change. In 2018, the environment was ranked eighth, nominated by just 9% of young people.</p> <p>The chief executive of Mission Australia, James Toomey, said young people were feeling disenfranchised and this was driving them to find other ways to be heard \u201csuch as climate strikes.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe growing public dialogue and experience of issues, such as extreme weather events and drought, are clearly affecting young people\u2019s view of the world.\u201d</p> <h2>Bushfires and climate change</h2> <p>Essential said the proportion of people who think it is likely that the bushfires are linked to climate change, but that it is inappropriate to publicly raise this issue during disasters, has remained fairly constant over time. In this fortnight\u2019s poll, 17% of the sample express that view while 14% had that opinion in 2013.</p> <p>Morrison defended the Coalition\u2019s record on climate action during question time on Monday. He contended that Australia was in that group of countries which is \u201cbeating, the commitments that we have made to the world, and we will continue to do that\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is doing its bit when it comes to dealing with climate change,\u201d the prime minister said. But he said the government had no intention of adopting \u201creckless targets supported by the Greens and the Labor party\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister said it was an \u201coutright lie\u201d to argue that if the Coalition had adopted higher emissions reduction targets then the bushfires would not have happened.</p> <p>While Australia has committed under the Paris agreement to reduce emissions, pollution has risen consistently since the Coalition repealed the carbon price shortly after winning government in 2013.</p> <p>In an interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/nov/23/malcolm-turnbull-speaks-out-on-news-corp-and-climate-denial-australian-politics-live-podcast\">with Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast last week</a>, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull cut across Morrison\u2019s regular protestations that enough is being done by noting that Australia would struggle to meet its Paris emissions target without rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Turnbull also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/23/malcolm-turnbull-says-liberals-struggles-with-climate-denial-are-hurting-australia\">said the Liberal party\u2019s continuing failure to develop a coherent climate and energy policy</a> was costing the country much-needed new investment in power generation.</p> <p>There has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/jun/07/opinion-polls-fail-federal-election-australian-politics-live-podcast\">controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling</a>, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory on 18 May.

While Scott Morrison has accepted the link between climate change and natural disasters, the prime minister has argued \u2013 including in parliament on Monday during a statement on the bushfires \u2013 that it is not appropriate to get into that debate while a disaster is in progress. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, responded to Morrison\u2019s comments on Monday by arguing Australia does not have the luxury of time to defer important discussions. But Albanese said it was important that public discussion of the issues be \u201csober\u201d and not rancorous. Voters most likely to think Australia is not doing enough to deal with the risk of climate change are under 34, and support Labor or the Greens \u2013 although the latest Guardian Essential survey indicates that 46% of Coalition voters in the sample share this view. The poll indicates that 61% of the sample believes that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. That level of support is consistent with readings taken in March this year and October of last year. While that view is supported by 74% of Labor voters in the sample and 89% of Greens voters, it is supported by just under half of Coalition voters, 47%. Just over a quarter of the sample (28%) says people aren\u2019t witnessing climate change, they are witnessing a normal fluctuation in the Earth\u2019s climate. Perceptions are different depending on the age of voters. People aged 18-34 are most likely to accept anthropogenic climate change (74%) and voters over 55 are least likely to (50%). A separate poll of 25,000 Australians aged 15 to 19, released on Tuesday, shows a sharp rise in concern for the environment and climate change in both cities and regional areas. As part of the 18th annual Mission Australia youth survey, people were asked to name the three most important issues for Australia. Behind mental health, the environment was ranked the second most important issue, chosen by 34% of young people, with more than half of those citing climate change. In 2018, the environment was ranked eighth, nominated by just 9% of young people. The chief executive of Mission Australia, James Toomey, said young people were feeling disenfranchised and this was driving them to find other ways to be heard \u201csuch as climate strikes.\u201d He said: \u201cThe growing public dialogue and experience of issues, such as extreme weather events and drought, are clearly affecting young people\u2019s view of the world.\u201d Bushfires and climate change Essential said the proportion of people who think it is likely that the bushfires are linked to climate change, but that it is inappropriate to publicly raise this issue during disasters, has remained fairly constant over time. In this fortnight\u2019s poll, 17% of the sample express that view while 14% had that opinion in 2013. Morrison defended the Coalition\u2019s record on climate action during question time on Monday. He contended that Australia was in that group of countries which is \u201cbeating, the commitments that we have made to the world, and we will continue to do that\u201d. \u201cAustralia is doing its bit when it comes to dealing with climate change,\u201d the prime minister said. But he said the government had no intention of adopting \u201creckless targets supported by the Greens and the Labor party\u201d. The prime minister said it was an \u201coutright lie\u201d to argue that if the Coalition had adopted higher emissions reduction targets then the bushfires would not have happened. While Australia has committed under the Paris agreement to reduce emissions, pollution has risen consistently since the Coalition repealed the carbon price shortly after winning government in 2013. In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast last week, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull cut across Morrison\u2019s regular protestations that enough is being done by noting that Australia would struggle to meet its Paris emissions target without rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Turnbull also said the Liberal party\u2019s continuing failure to develop a coherent climate and energy policy was costing the country much-needed new investment in power generation. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory on 18 May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%.",

It is immersive, yes, but that overused word does not quite convey the paradoxical alienation that is being created: the distance, the pure strangeness. The two men\u2019s experiences are bizarre and shocking, but a poignant and then tragic sympathy is finally dredged up from the mud of their ordeal. 1917 is Mendes\u2019s most purely ambitious and passionate picture since his misunderstood and underappreciated Jarhead of 2005. It\u2019s bold, thrilling film-making. \u2022 1917 is released in the US on 25 December, in Australia on 7 January 2020 and in the UK on 10 January 2020.",

The second one, I think our defenders should have defended that better. Too many stood and watched it. Overall it was a difficult evening for us. Second half we opened ourselves up of course, and when you do that you always run the gauntlet, but we had a few opportunities ourselves as well.</p> <p>I felt we should have held on to the ball, created a bit more, and had a bit more possession than what we did. We surrendered it too quickly in the first half. That\u2019s what we said at half-time. If we\u2019d got a goal it might have been interesting.

We\u2019ve just played Man City and Liverpool at home, and we were competitive in both games. From fifth down there\u2019s only Burnley that\u2019s won five games. It\u2019s so tight from five own.

Here are Bruce\u2019s memories:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was one of the most unsavoury times of my career. I thought it was a ball to begin with, it was a big old thing. How the fan got it into the stadium I don\u2019t know. It didn\u2019t miss be my much. The fans can throw some things, but a cabbage? I went the next day so I didn\u2019t have time to get angry about it. \u201cI got criticised [by Villa fans], but for 18 months only Manchester City scored more goals than us ... they\u2019re a difficult lot. Great club, great support with great history, but it was in a mess. </p> <p>It was arguably my most difficult job, even more difficult than this. We didn\u2019t know if we were going to get paid in May and June. It was practically close to the wall. It never got that far but there was a threat at the end of the month that we couldn\u2019t pay the wages. It was the worst and probably the most difficult six weeks after the play-off game, it was unrivalled from where we were. To be fair to the chief executive at the time he had kept it quiet for three or four months. We were aware we couldn\u2019t bring anyone in but financially we didn\u2019t realise the enormity of it until he got the sack. It was a really difficult time. Then...the new owners came in and everything changed very, very quickly. If they hadn\u2019t come in so quickly I would have feared for a great club the way it was, because we were practically bust. </p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u2019s Dean Smith on the cabbage, and Bruce in general:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I thought it was a disgrace. You don\u2019t want to see that in the ground. I said that at the time. I said when I took the job that I have an awful lot of respect for what he has done in management but, more importantly, for how he is as a man as well. This season, if you look at Newcastle at the start, there were a lot of questions about the club and where it was going. But Steve has gone in and done what he does best - got them organised. They\u2019ve got pace and power up front. They are winning games - they\u2019ve won the last couple - and they beat Manchester United at home as well. They are in a good run of form at the moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s our match preview. In team news news, Jack Grealish is expected to return after a month out with a calf injury while Tom Heaton and Bjorn Engels are also fit to play for Villa. As for Newcastle, Ciaran Clark was due to undergo a late fitness test, while Florian Lejeune is ready to come back after a seven-month lay-off and Fabian Schar is also ready to rock after a three-match absence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/aston-villa-newcastle-match-preview-premier-league\">Aston Villa v Newcastle United: match preview</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T18:40:23.544Z\">at 6.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! Steve Bruce has his post-match chat: In the first half in particular we didn\u2019t do enough, certainly with or without the ball, and of course two free kicks. Whether they are free kicks, looked a bit soft to me. Look, Conor\u2019s very good, I\u2019ve seen it many times, and he\u2019s got the accuracy and puts enough power on to score. The second one, I think our defenders should have defended that better. Too many stood and watched it. Overall it was a difficult evening for us. Second half we opened ourselves up of course, and when you do that you always run the gauntlet, but we had a few opportunities ourselves as well. I felt we should have held on to the ball, created a bit more, and had a bit more possession than what we did. We surrendered it too quickly in the first half. That\u2019s what we said at half-time. If we\u2019d got a goal it might have been interesting. With the standards that we\u2019ve set in the past few weeks, we weren\u2019t there in the first period. We\u2019ve been done by two set pieces. On Sky, Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher are almost coming to blows as they discuss Aston Villa\u2019s second goal. Should Hourihane\u2019s delivery have been cut out before it reached the six-yard box? Neville says yes, Carragher says the ball was too good. There\u2019s a lot of head-shaking going on. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from Villa Park: This was a fruitless return here for Steve Bruce, whose Newcastle side arrived here in promising form but left soundly beaten. Conor Hourihane opened the scoring in the first half for Aston Villa before creating a goal for Anwar El Ghazi four minutes later as the hosts claimed a deserved and important victory after three successive defeats. Much more here: Dean Smith has a chat, first about Jack Grealish, who has just told us that he\u2019d prefer to play as a No8, rather than the wideish 10 he played tonight: He\u2019s been productive when he\u2019s played higher up the pitch. He draws fouls for us, people don\u2019t want to tackle him. There\u2019s times I will play him as an 8, because he makes lung-busting runs from there, him and John McGinn complement each other really well. Jack\u2019s got a really good relationship with Conor Hourihane so when Jack does have a bit of a drift Conor sticks in that hole behind where Jack\u2019s left. It\u2019s a really tough league. We\u2019ve just played Man City and Liverpool at home, and we were competitive in both games. From fifth down there\u2019s only Burnley that\u2019s won five games. It\u2019s so tight from five own. You\u2019ve got to put little runs of results together, be tough to beat, and probably the most pleasing thing about tonight was the clean sheet. Because we haven\u2019t had too many of them this season, and they\u2019re the ones that will get you results. Villa\u2019s next five games include trips to Manchester United, Chelsea and Sheffield United, and home games against Leicester and (some version of) Liverpool (in the Carabao Cup). So, in short, good to get a few points in the bank. Aston Villa have only kept three clean sheets this season, and they\u2019ve all been live on Sky. That is statistically unlikely. A more than decent game for the neutral, even if both of the goals came from set pieces and there weren\u2019t a lot of clear opportunities from open play. Aston Villa have an excellent midfield and it\u2019s a pleasure to see the ball go through them; Newcastle have Saint-Maximin, who\u2019s fun in his way and could at any moment start to actually contribute to actual goals, and a defence shoddy enough to make something interesting likely at some point. 90+4 mins: It wasn\u2019t! There\u2019s nearly another minute added on, which gives Villa time for one more attack, and McGinn one more shot. It\u2019s tipped wide, and that is that! 90+3 mins: Villa counter, and McGinn sidefoots wide. There are three seconds of stoppage time to play,, so that\u2019s probably that. 90+1 mins: Henri Lansbury replaces Hourihane. We\u2019re in the first of three minutes of stoppage time. 90 mins: It looked to me like Willems had a bit of a stamp on Grealish there. On first viewing it looked deliberate, but nobody else thought so, so I\u2019m probably wrong. 88 mins: The game is rather petering out now, with Newcastle apparently having come to the conclusion that they are definitely going to lose. 86 mins: Hourihane hammers a volley into near-earth orbit. 83 mins: An overhit Newcastle pass gives Villa a bonus free corner. \u201cYou\u2019re really bad\u201d sing the home fans, or words to that effect. 80 mins: Wesley is booked for a foul on Willems. Shelvey lifts the ball to Carroll, who flicks it on, but nobody in a black and white shirt is near enough to benefit, and Villa clear. 80 mins: Saint-Maximin absolutely leathers a cross from the right, which Atsu throws himself at gamely, but can\u2019t control. 79 mins: A final Newcastle change sees Christian Atsu replace the largely invisible Almiron. 77 mins: What a miss! Grealish passes to Hourihane, scampering down the left, whose low, first-time cross presents Wesley with an easy finish from just inside the six-yard box. He sidefoots straight at Dubravka, with the goal yawning! 76 mins: Grealish tries three times to feed McGinn to his right. Twice a defender gets in the way but eventually he succeeds, and McGinn has a shot that Dubravka saves and holds. 74 mins: Carroll is doing his job: winning the high balls, flicking them on. He wins a high ball and flicks it on, but two team-mates are offside. And here\u2019s Grealish on his shin pads: 72 mins: Newcastle toss the ball up to Carroll, who nods down to Joelinton, who blasts a shot way high. That\u2019ll be his last contribution to the evening, as Dwight Gayle replaces him. 69 mins: Shots at both ends! Grealish takes one, which rolls low straight at Dubravka, and Carroll has the other, blasted chest-high straight at Heaton. 68 mins: Play restarts, Joelinton now with cotton wool up both nostrils and in his mouth. 66 mins: Joelinton and Hourihane compete for a header. Hourihane wins the ball, Jouelinton gets an arm in the face, and the physios are on. 63 mins: Some of Villa\u2019s build-up play has been really very good. Grealish, teed up by El Ghazi, curls another shot high. Newcastle fling on a big man up front, bringing on Andy Carroll for Dummett. 60 mins: Nearly an own-goal! Saint-Maximin crosses from the left and Konsa wildly mishits his volleyed clearance, sending the ball spinning just wide of the near post! 59 mins: Space suddenly opens up in front of Hayden, and he has a free shot from the edge of the area that flies straight at Heaton. 58 mins: Grealish curls a left-footer wide from just inside the penalty area. These have been 13-and-a-bit very fun minutes, since the break. Chaotic, but fun. 56 mins: Newcastle\u2019s post-interval whirlwhind appears to have blown itself out. They haven\u2019t been out of their half for five minutes, and Villa have another corner. And then another. 53 mins: What a chance! From Grealish\u2019s corner, Konsa pummels a header goalwards but Dubravka beeats it away! 52 mins: Now Villa have a corner, after some fine keep-ball around the Newcastle area involving Grealish, Targett and McGinn. 50 mins: Now Joelinton tackles Douglas Luiz, who just doesn\u2019t see him coming. Where was this Newcastle in the opening half? 49 mins: Shelvey sprints 20 yards to dispossess Mings with a sliding tackle, leading to a half-chance for Joelinton on the edge of the area, but his shot deflects wide. 47 mins: A fine start to the second period for Newcastle, and after about 70 seconds Saint-Maximin curls in an excellent shot from 25 yards, which Heaton fingertips round the post! 46 mins: Peeeeep! The second half has begun! Jack Grealish in full. What proportion of his shins are those shin pads protecting? Hardly any, that\u2019s what. They\u2019re barely more use than a Newcastle defensive wall. 45+3 mins: Peep peep peeeeeep! Aston Villa deservedly lead at half-time. There haven\u2019t been very many actual goalscoring chances other than the actual goals, but it\u2019s been a half of two halves. In the first, Newcastle lacked ambition. In the second, they lacked quality. 45+1 mins: There will be about two minutes of stoppage time. 45 mins: Saint-Maximin loses the ball and Villa break. El Ghazi runs through again, but McGinn overhits his pass. There were aching chasms in Newcastle\u2019s defence there. 44 mins: Then Villa break, but El Ghazi is offside when he\u2019s played through. 43 mins: Top save from Heaton! The corner is curled onto the head of Fernandez, who heads down but too close to the keeper, who flings his arms to his left to turn it away! 42 mins: They have started to come out of their shell, though. Just then then had three people inside Aston Villa\u2019s penalty area. The ball didn\u2019t join them, but they do get a corner. 38 mins: Newcastle have got this all wrong so far. The 10 men behind the ball approach was worrying, the hack Grealish whenever he\u2019s in the vicinity of the area tactic was just a few extra hundreds and thousands of idiocy atop an already silly cake. One free-kick goal for Hourihane, and one free-kick assist! Dummett just stops running as it curls into the six-yard box. Behind him, El Ghazi doesn\u2019t. 35 mins: Grealish gets near the Newcastle penalty area again, and he\u2019s brought down again. Fernandez is booked. And in it flies! Hourihane taps the free kick to Grealish, who tees him up. Those extra couple of feet allow Hourihane to curl the ball around the static wall and just inside the post! 30 mins: McGinn lifts the ball over the Newcastle defence towards Grealish. It would have been difficult for him to control it, but Yedlin shoves him from behind and now he\u2019s got a tasty free-kick-based shooting chance. 29 mins: Douglas Luiz has another shot from outside the area. This one looked to be dipping just under the bar, or perhaps into it, until Dubravka fingertipped it over. 28 mins: It\u2019s hard to tell whether Shelvey deliberately shot, or just crossed badly. Either way, Heaton catches. 27 mins: Saint-Maximin takes on Guilbert, but both run past the ball. They turn back and grapple with each other in their desperation to reach it first. Both look equally culpable to me, but the referee gives Newcastle a dangerous free-kick scenario, out on the left. 25 mins: After that promising start, Newcastle have settled in and sat back. They are playing like they\u2019re 2-1 up with two minutes to play. 24 mins: Joelinton goes on a run now, but he gets no help from any of his team-mates and eventually falls over. 22 mins: Targett plays on, apparently after being sick on the pitch. 21 mins: Targett is receiving medical attention. He seems to have something stuck in his throat. \u201cGreetings from California, where it\u2019s the lunch hour,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a place near my work that is showing this match because I like watching Newcastle\u2019s Saint-Maximin play. He\u2019s skilled, crafty, and has an all-around impish way of playing that makes for pure entertainment. And his name is delightful as well.\u201d He is indeed a lot of fun, particularly I feel if he doesn\u2019t actually play for the team you support, in which case I fear he might be wildly frustrating. 19 mins: Suddenly Saint-Maximin springs out of defence! He hares with the ball from his own half into the heart of Aston Villa\u2019s, frightens the living daylights out of three defenders and then passes to Almiron, who miscontrols. Saint-Maximin does a dramatic total strop, flinging arms all over the place. 18 mins: Another decent ball into the box from Targett. This time he finds Douglas Luiz, but Willems tracks his run and gets a foot in the way of his shot. 15 mins: Saint-Maximin, the furthest back of the nine-man backline Newcastle appear to be fielding at the moment, does a useless clearing header, but gets away with it. 13 mins: Chance for Villa! From the throw-in they attack. Grealish\u2019s dummy gives Targett space on the left to consider his options, and he fires in a delicious low cross that El Ghazi looks destined to turn in, but doesn\u2019t turn in. 12 mins: Villa have the ball in defence. They pass it right, they pass it back to the left, they pass it back to the right. There is no space in front of them whatsoever, and eventually they just try a random pass, which goes off Willems and out for a throw-in. 9 mins: Grealish is fine. His socks are rolled most of the way down to his boots, and thus almost all of his shins are uncovered and there\u2019s no sign of any shin pads. Presumably he is wearing some, because he has to, but they must be extremely small and useless. 7 mins: Joelinton goes in a bit high on Grealish. The Newcastle player immediately apologises; the Villa player immediately starts limping, and then goes down. The referee meanwhile sees nothing wrong with it, and waves play on. 4 mins: Almiron has a shot now. It\u2019s high and wide, but this is all very promising, with both sides throwing people forward. 3 mins: Newcastle try to play the ball out of defence, but the home team don\u2019t give them any time or space, and after trying on the left, trying through Dubravka and trying on the right, they eventually give it away, and Douglas Luiz has a shot that deflects wide. 1 min: They\u2019re off! Newcastle get the game started, and Saint-Maximin\u2019s early cross bounces harmlessly through to Heaton. And out they come! Kick-off but moments away now. The players are in the tunnel! It\u2019s a very large tunnel, Villa Park\u2019s, and very claret-coloured. \u201cYou\u2019re not fooling anyone here,\u201d says John Palethorpe. \u201cWe all want a link to the Dyer/Bowyer fight during one of the more hilarious Newcastle v Villa Games.\u201d Yeah, OK, fair enough. Dean Smith has had a chat, firstly about the return of Jack Grealish: It makes a big difference, because he\u2019s a top player and when you\u2019ve got top players in your team you\u2019ve got better chances of winning football games. You can always try to improve. The aim of the game is to score goals, so you need to create chances, but the downside of that is you maybe leave yourselves a bit more open. But our last performance here against Liverpool, we were very unfortunate to lose that game, it was a terrific performance and we need the same again tonight. And Steve Bruce also has a word, about returning to a former club: I had the privilege to manage the club for a couple of years. It didn\u2019t quite go the way we wanted but I\u2019ve been in football a long time, so you understand that\u2019s what happens. But of course when you get the sack you want to come back and haunt a few. But look, I had a tremendous time here but if we could win, that would obviously be great. Less than 20 minutes until kick-off. Hands up if you\u2019re excited! In only one of the last seven games between these teams has either of them scored more than one goal. That was the last, a 2-0 home win for Newcastle in February 2017. The last three meetings at Villa Park ended 1-1, 0-0 and 0-0. None of this is very promising. Here\u2019s proof that some Villa v Newcastle games are fun: The team news is in! Tom Heaton, Conor Hourihane and Jack Grealish are in for Vila, Ciaran Clark passes his fitness test for Newcastle: Aston Villa: Heaton, Guilbert, Konsa, Mings, Targett, McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Hourihane, El Ghazi, Wesley, Grealish. Subs: Lansbury, Nakamba, Trezeguet, Nyland, Kodjia, Elmohamady, Hause. Newcastle: Dubravka, Fernandez, Clark, Dummett, Yedlin, Hayden, Shelvey, Willems, Almiron, Saint-Maximin, Joelinton. Subs: Schar, Carroll, Gayle, Krafth, Darlow, Atsu, Matthew Longstaff. Referee: Lee Mason. Hello world! It\u2019s the Steve Bruce derby, and the Newcastle manager\u2019s first return to Villa Park since this cabbage was thrown at him during a 3-3 draw against Preston last October in what turned out to be his last game in the Villa Park dugout. There has inevitably been a lot of talk about cabbages these past few days. Here are Bruce\u2019s memories: It was one of the most unsavoury times of my career. I thought it was a ball to begin with, it was a big old thing. How the fan got it into the stadium I don\u2019t know. It didn\u2019t miss be my much. The fans can throw some things, but a cabbage? I went the next day so I didn\u2019t have time to get angry about it. \u201cI got criticised [by Villa fans], but for 18 months only Manchester City scored more goals than us ... they\u2019re a difficult lot. Great club, great support with great history, but it was in a mess. It was arguably my most difficult job, even more difficult than this. We didn\u2019t know if we were going to get paid in May and June. It was practically close to the wall. It never got that far but there was a threat at the end of the month that we couldn\u2019t pay the wages. It was the worst and probably the most difficult six weeks after the play-off game, it was unrivalled from where we were. To be fair to the chief executive at the time he had kept it quiet for three or four months. We were aware we couldn\u2019t bring anyone in but financially we didn\u2019t realise the enormity of it until he got the sack. It was a really difficult time. Then...the new owners came in and everything changed very, very quickly. If they hadn\u2019t come in so quickly I would have feared for a great club the way it was, because we were practically bust. And here\u2019s Dean Smith on the cabbage, and Bruce in general: I thought it was a disgrace. You don\u2019t want to see that in the ground. I said that at the time. I said when I took the job that I have an awful lot of respect for what he has done in management but, more importantly, for how he is as a man as well. This season, if you look at Newcastle at the start, there were a lot of questions about the club and where it was going. But Steve has gone in and done what he does best - got them organised. They\u2019ve got pace and power up front. They are winning games - they\u2019ve won the last couple - and they beat Manchester United at home as well. They are in a good run of form at the moment. Here\u2019s our match preview. In team news news, Jack Grealish is expected to return after a month out with a calf injury while Tom Heaton and Bjorn Engels are also fit to play for Villa. As for Newcastle, Ciaran Clark was due to undergo a late fitness test, while Florian Lejeune is ready to come back after a seven-month lay-off and Fabian Schar is also ready to rock after a three-match absence.",

At least no one threw a cabbage at him unlike, infamously, on the day before he was sacked by Villa in October 2018 after a two-year reign that he has described as \u201cone of the most unsavoury times of my career\u201d, even though results were never as dire as the treatment of him suggested.</p> <p>The win was as deserved for Villa as it was encouraging after a run of three defeats. Conor Hourihane, signed for Villa by Bruce three years ago and reintroduced by Smith to the starting lineup after being omitted for the past three matches, opened the scoring in the 32nd minute before setting up Anwar El Ghazi for the second goal four minutes later. \u201cFor \u00a31m he\u2019s not too bad,\u201d said Bruce wryly of the Irish midfielder.</p> <p>Although Villa looked shaky a few times in the second half when Newcastle ran at them, the visitors were too weak in midfield and ragged in attack to do that often.

      "bodyText": "Villa Park remains a joyless place for Steve Bruce. On his first return since being barracked out of the job as Aston Villa manager two years ago, he saw his latest team, who had been in decent form, perform so badly that Newcastle fans may now get on his back. Again. Villa fans, meanwhile, have mostly moved on to hailing Bruce\u2019s successor, with Dean Smith asked to wave to them even before the end of this convincing \u2013 and important \u2013 victory. Bruce, admittedly, was invited to do the same but was in no mood to satisfy fans he had previously found so hard to please. At least no one threw a cabbage at him unlike, infamously, on the day before he was sacked by Villa in October 2018 after a two-year reign that he has described as \u201cone of the most unsavoury times of my career\u201d, even though results were never as dire as the treatment of him suggested. The win was as deserved for Villa as it was encouraging after a run of three defeats. Conor Hourihane, signed for Villa by Bruce three years ago and reintroduced by Smith to the starting lineup after being omitted for the past three matches, opened the scoring in the 32nd minute before setting up Anwar El Ghazi for the second goal four minutes later. \u201cFor \u00a31m he\u2019s not too bad,\u201d said Bruce wryly of the Irish midfielder. Although Villa looked shaky a few times in the second half when Newcastle ran at them, the visitors were too weak in midfield and ragged in attack to do that often. Villa would have won by an even higher margin if not for Newcastle\u2019s goalkeeper, Martin D\u00fabravka, and some scruffy finishing. Villa had been vulnerable to counterattacks in their previous match, a defeat at Wolves, and Newcastle troubled them with one in the third minute. Joelinton led the charge before the chronically wayward Miguel Almir\u00f3n finished in all-too-familiar style, wafting a shot way off target from 20 yards. Newcastle did not threaten again until just before the break, by which time they were 2-0 down. \u201cWhat was disappointing was that we were too passive with the ball and without, especially in the first half,\u201d said Bruce. Villa, by contrast, were vibrant, continually probing as they dominated possession. Newcastle initially defended well and it took a moment of delicious subtlety from Jack Grealish to create the first opening, the forward dummying a pass by John McGinn into the path of Matt Targett, whose probing low cross from the left practically pleaded with a forward to tap it home. El Ghazi did not react sharply enough to do so. Villa\u2019s relentless passing eventually worked chinks in the visitors\u2019 defence. Douglas Luiz forced a fine save from D\u00fabravka with a wicked curling shot from 20 yards on the half-hour after a tee-up by Grealish. One minute later the goalkeeper had to pick the ball out of his net after DeAndre Yedlin barged into Grealish at the edge of the area. Hourihane rolled the free-kick short to Grealish in order to improve the shooting angle and then curled a wonderful shot around the wall and in at the near post. Four minutes later Grealish won another free-kick. Hourihane, owner of a cultured left foot, sent a gorgeous ball across the face of Newcastle\u2019s goal and El Ghazi \u2013 perfectly alert this time \u2013 gave his markers the slip to finish from inside the six-yard box. Heaton made sure Villa got to the interval with their two-goal lead intact, turning a header by Federico Fern\u00e1ndez over the bar after a corner. Newcastle briefly hinted at a comeback at the start of the second half but Tom Heaton tipped a fine shot by Allan Saint-Maxim round the post. For a while Villa became jittery but they still created the better chances, with Wesley twice denied from close range by D\u00fabravka. Bruce replaced one of his three centre-backs with Andy Carroll and switched to a 4-4-2 formation. The striker soon showed his menace by chesting down a cross by Yedlin and firing a ferocious volley goalwards from 16 yards. Heaton held it well. After that Newcastle never hinted at a comeback on what proved an unhappy return for Bruce.",

      "bodyText": "The Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer has resigned and chairman Lindsay Maxsted will step down early following the money-laundering scandal involving allegations the bank failed to stop transactions with the Philippines involving child exploitation. Hartzer will be paid $2.69m for doing nothing for the next 12 months while serving out his notice period, the bank said in an announcement to the ASX on Tuesday morning. He will not get a short-term bonus this year and will lose any long-term bonuses that have not already vested, Westpac said. Pressure had been mounting on Hartzer and Maxsted to quit since last Wednesday, when the financial intelligence agency Austrac launched legal action accusing the bank of more than 23m breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws over more than $11bn in transactions. The most damaging allegations revolved around Westpac\u2019s alleged failure to monitor customers sending money to the Philippines and other locations in south east Asia in a way consistent with child exploitation. Austrac\u2019s allegations sparked investigations from the federal police, the corporate regulator and the prudential regulator, the announcement of a potential class action, a warning of a possible ratings downgrade from Moody\u2019s and pushed Westpac\u2019s share price down four days running. Hartzer, who last week promised he would stay and \u201cfix\u201d the problem, will finish next Monday and chief financial officer Peter King will become acting chief executive, Westpac said. \u201cAs CEO I accept that I am ultimately accountable for everything that happens at the bank,\u201d Hartzer said. \u201cAnd it is clear that we have fallen well short of what the community expects of us, and we expect of ourselves.\u201d Maxsted, who has been on the Westpac board since 2008 and chairman since 2011, said he would \u201cbring forward his retirement as chairman to the first half of 2020\u201d. Ewen Crouch, who has been on the board since 2013, will not seek re-appointment at the company\u2019s annual meeting on 12 December. Crouch was listed on the AGM notice paper as up for re-election alongside Nerida Caesar, who has been on the board for two years, and Peter Marriott, who has served six years. Westpac will also abandon a motion calling for shareholders to approve long-term bonuses for management. The moves come after a week of steadily increasing pressure from politicians, including a threat from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, that the board could be disqualified. The bank held crisis meetings with major investors on Monday. Class action shareholder lawsuits are also likely, with law firm Phi Finney McDonald first to announce it was investigating the bank on Monday. Hartzer is reported to have told staff during a meeting on Monday that the crisis was \u201cnot an Enron or Lehman Brothers\u201d and was not resonating with ordinary Australians. \u201cFor people in mainstream Australia going about their daily lives, this is not a major issue so we don\u2019t need to overcook this,\u201d he was quoted as saying in the Australian.

And a repetition of myopia on which ultimately lands us with a poor and deteriorating relationship on multiple things that really matter, economically and strategically,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The pressure to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d will mean that if returned as prime minister, Johnson will soon make \u201ca lot of concessions\u201d to secure his deal.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we are under time pressure and known to be desperate to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/02/word-of-the-week-steven-poole-vassal\">\u2018escape vassalage\u2019</a> by the end of 2020 \u2026 the EU side just sees a huge open goal opportunity and repeats its playbook from the article 50 process,\u201d Rogers added.</p> <p>He argues that the UK could get a basic free trade agreement by the end of 2020, which he calls \u201ca very thin, Canada minus minus deal\u201d in reference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/can-uk-get-brexit-super-canada-plus-trade-deal-with-eu-by-end-of-2020\">to the Conservatives\u2019 preferred model</a>. But he also said the two sides risk heading to \u201ca no-trade deal\u201d in the short to medium term and \u201ca very difficult relationship after that\u201d.</p> <p>Rogers, who held senior roles in No 10, the Treasury and the European commission, skewered claims made by Johnson and frontline cabinet ministers such as the chancellor, Sajid Javid, that trade talks with the EU would be fairly simple because both sides are starting from a position of regulatory alignment.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact of \u2018being aligned on day one after exit\u2019 does not make the negotiation of a trade deal easier,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThe only relevant question is where you aim to be on day two, day 200 or day 2,000.\u201d</p> <p>In a passage Johnson might envy as a former newspaper columnist, Rogers said there would be \u201cno escape from ball-achingly technical and lengthy negotiations\u201d on the small print of free-trade deals. He is equally blunt about the claims of unnamed former UK trade ministers on the ease of trade talks: \u201cOne can only watch and marvel at what planet they inhabit.\u201d</p> <p>The former ambassador did not spare Jeremy Corbyn, although he gave less attention to the Labour leader. Rogers gives a withering verdict on Corbyn\u2019s neutral stance on any second referendum, as well as his pledge to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d within six months of taking office. The Labour position \u201cfrankly deserves the Brussels eye-rolling it duly gets\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/nov/22/target-seats-2019-general-election-interactive\">Top target seats in the 2019 general election \u2013\u00a0interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also said remainers who wanted to wind the clock back were in \u201cdenial\u201d about EU thinking.</p> <p>In keeping with previous lectures, Rogers accused the EU of failing to think through the strategic consequences of its relationship with the UK.</p> <p>EU politicians have long insisted that the UK must make up its own mind about what kind of post-Brexit relationship it wants.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is sowing the seeds of \u201cthe biggest crisis of Brexit to date\u201d, Britain\u2019s former envoy to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said in a scathing verdict on the government\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic amateurism\u201d. Less than three weeks before polling day, the man who resigned as the UK\u2019s EU ambassador in January 2017 said Johnson was repeating Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrategy errors\u201d and would soon find himself \u201cunwisely\u201d boxed in by his campaign promises. When he launched the Conservative party manifesto on Sunday, Johnson repeated his promise not to extend an 11-month transition period that kicks in if the UK leaves the EU with the withdrawal agreement on 31 January 2020. Negotiating a trade deal with the EU in an unprecedentedly quick time is the centrepiece of the prime minister\u2019s misleading pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. In a lecture at Glasgow university on Monday night, Rogers, who resigned following a Tory backlash over his reports that an EU trade deal might take a decade, said \u201cthe biggest crisis of Brexit to date\u201d was \u201cvirtually inevitable\u201d in late 2020. \u201cIn practice, this prime minister is, for all his talk of getting Brexit done, now basically replicating the strategy errors of 2016 and 2017, which brought his predecessor down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is diplomatic amateurism dressed up domestically as boldness and decisiveness.\u201d While the UK could get a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d trade deal by the end of 2020, Rogers said it would exclude the UK services industry and give the EU leverage over fishing rights in British waters. \u201cIt all points to a repetition of exactly the syndrome we have suffered for the last three [years]. And a repetition of myopia on which ultimately lands us with a poor and deteriorating relationship on multiple things that really matter, economically and strategically,\u201d he said. The pressure to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d will mean that if returned as prime minister, Johnson will soon make \u201ca lot of concessions\u201d to secure his deal. \u201cBecause we are under time pressure and known to be desperate to \u2018escape vassalage\u2019 by the end of 2020 \u2026 the EU side just sees a huge open goal opportunity and repeats its playbook from the article 50 process,\u201d Rogers added. He argues that the UK could get a basic free trade agreement by the end of 2020, which he calls \u201ca very thin, Canada minus minus deal\u201d in reference to the Conservatives\u2019 preferred model. But he also said the two sides risk heading to \u201ca no-trade deal\u201d in the short to medium term and \u201ca very difficult relationship after that\u201d. Rogers, who held senior roles in No 10, the Treasury and the European commission, skewered claims made by Johnson and frontline cabinet ministers such as the chancellor, Sajid Javid, that trade talks with the EU would be fairly simple because both sides are starting from a position of regulatory alignment. \u201cThe fact of \u2018being aligned on day one after exit\u2019 does not make the negotiation of a trade deal easier,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThe only relevant question is where you aim to be on day two, day 200 or day 2,000.\u201d In a passage Johnson might envy as a former newspaper columnist, Rogers said there would be \u201cno escape from ball-achingly technical and lengthy negotiations\u201d on the small print of free-trade deals. He is equally blunt about the claims of unnamed former UK trade ministers on the ease of trade talks: \u201cOne can only watch and marvel at what planet they inhabit.\u201d The former ambassador did not spare Jeremy Corbyn, although he gave less attention to the Labour leader. Rogers gives a withering verdict on Corbyn\u2019s neutral stance on any second referendum, as well as his pledge to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d within six months of taking office. The Labour position \u201cfrankly deserves the Brussels eye-rolling it duly gets\u201d. He also said remainers who wanted to wind the clock back were in \u201cdenial\u201d about EU thinking. In keeping with previous lectures, Rogers accused the EU of failing to think through the strategic consequences of its relationship with the UK. EU politicians have long insisted that the UK must make up its own mind about what kind of post-Brexit relationship it wants. Rogers said the EU was being too simplistic, by failing to have a collective preference about a relationship that \u201chugely matters\u201d to them. \u201cBrexit could have represented \u2013 could surely still represent \u2013 something of an opportunity to think about differentiated integration,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the EU to think more clearly and strategically about its future relations with the UK, because they can get a lot worse than this yet.\u201d",

Preparations are being made for a curtailed process that cuts down on ceremony, in case Johnson is the new prime minister and wants to push ahead with a second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas recess. The election is due to happen on 12 December and the results will emerge through the early hours of Friday 13 December. Parliament will then resume on Tuesday 16 December and then there would be the election of the new Speaker and several days of new MPs being sworn in. A Queen\u2019s speech would need to take place after that to allow legislation to be brought forward, with the first and second readings of the Brexit bill possibly happening that week or into the week of Christmas. A government spokesman said: \u201cThe new parliament will be summoned to meet on Tuesday 17 December, when the business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members.

Twelve months after, our parents got divorced. That was a difficult time. And then my brother moved away from home shortly after. We did everything together, so that was quite hard for me. For a year or so I had lots of anxiety but that came out when I was playing tennis.</p> <p>\u201cTennis is an escape for me in some ways. All of these things are bottled up.

That\u2019s why it is important to me.\u201d</p> <p>Murray has very rarely discussed such a traumatic part of his childhood and few people have asked. On Monday he said he refused to open up about it for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cAs things were getting worse and stuff, it started to look like it was coming towards the end of playing. I was trying to explain why this was so difficult for me. I guess she was trying to understand why.

It would be quite nice to get to 50,\u201d he said. He did not then.</p> <p>The greatest triumph of his career is that he will return to Australia in January with hope renewed.</p>",

Twelve months after, our parents got divorced. That was a difficult time. And then my brother moved away from home shortly after. We did everything together, so that was quite hard for me. For a year or so I had lots of anxiety but that came out when I was playing tennis. \u201cTennis is an escape for me in some ways. All of these things are bottled up. We don\u2019t talk about these things. I show my personality on court. Tennis allows me to be that child. That\u2019s why it is important to me.\u201d Murray has very rarely discussed such a traumatic part of his childhood and few people have asked. On Monday he said he refused to open up about it for a long time. \u201cAs things were getting worse and stuff, it started to look like it was coming towards the end of playing. I was trying to explain why this was so difficult for me. I guess she was trying to understand why. She was there with us in Miami and I was like: \u2018Look, I am not talking to you about this to your face.\u2019 One, I feel a bit embarrassed about it. And two, I have not really spoken to anyone that much about it ever. So, that was kind of how that came about.\u201d Before he announced his career seemed to be coming to an end at the Australian Open this year, Murray frantically agonised over whether he was making the right decision by speaking out. It was only after he told the world that he was able to relax and enjoy what could have been the final tournament of his career. During one of his final training sessions before his defeat by Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round, he thought back to old matches in Melbourne: \u201cForty-eight matches I won here in Australia. It would be quite nice to get to 50,\u201d he said. He did not then. The greatest triumph of his career is that he will return to Australia in January with hope renewed.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has defended his multibillion pound general election spending pledge on public services, arguing it would bring the UK into line with other industrial countries, including France and Germany. After the launch of the Conservative manifesto on Sunday it emerged that for every one pound Boris Johnson has committed to spending, Jeremy Corbyn would spend \u00a328. \u201cAt the end of all of our proposals \u2013 every single one carried out \u2013 we will still be spending less on public services than France or Germany. We won\u2019t even be at their levels. It will move us into the middle ranking of the spending of industrial countries,\u201d the Labour leader said at a campaign event at West Nottinghamshire College in Kirkby-in-Ashfield. Corbyn is promising widespread investment in public services at almost \u00a383bn a year, including \u00a35bn each for schools and early years and \u00a310.8bn on social-care spending in an effort to reverse some of the impact of austerity. The party is also pledging payouts for women affected by the rise in the state-pension age with a \u00a358bn spending commitment over five years. \u201cWe cannot go on underfunding education and not see the price. We cannot go on not investing in housing and not see the price. We cannot go on underfunding health and social care and not see the price,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cYes people are being strained by the price of austerity through poverty and homelessness. The middle class, middle-aged, also pay because they are having to support their kids through university. But if we care as a society, an inclusive society, we have to be prepared to invest to achieve.\u201d According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, France, Italy, Sweden, Greece and Germany all dedicate more of their GDP to public spending on social goods than the UK at rates of between 25 and 31%. This includes investment in health, old age, incapacity-related benefits, family, work programmes, unemployment and housing. The UK spends 21% of its GDP on public services, which is slightly more than the US at 19%, according to worldwide data collected in 2016.

      "bodyText": "A Conservative candidate who is pictured in the party\u2019s manifesto as an NHS nurse standing for parliament is currently suspended from practising as a midwife, the Guardian can reveal. Natalie Neale, who is taking on the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, in Leicester South, was barred from practising as a registered midwife for 18 months in August under an interim order by the Nursing and Midwifery Council while it investigates an unspecified allegation against her. Under the order, she must immediately inform any organisation employing her as nurse that she is subject to a condition of practice order. Separately, Neale lost a claim for wrongful dismissal earlier this year after she walked out of her role as a clinical advisor for the private health provider Care UK in 2017, when it was running services for West Midlands ambulance service. The tribunal judge in the case, Christopher Gaskell, dismissed her evidence as both \u201cinconsistent\u201d and \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and found she \u201ccynically failed to cooperate with the investigation\u201d into a grievance she made about her duties. A related claim for disability discrimination, relating to a back injury sustained by Neale during training for a black belt in Thai boxing, was dismissed as \u201cmisconceived and totally without merit\u201d. The disclosures raise questions over how Neale was selected to fight the Leicester South seat, and why she featured so prominently in the manifesto. A picture of her, wearing an NHS lanyard, appears on page 11 in a section outlining the party\u2019s dubious claim it will deliver 50,000 more nurses.

The song spread quickly in a country where discontent is growing: 50% of all respondents in a recent survey said they wanted to see rapid political change, the highest rate in the Arab world. Mounir, a former serviceman, told the court he had been drunk when he recorded the video criticising the police, and said officers had mistreated him when they stopped him at a checkpoint earlier that same evening. Police say the charges are unrelated to the song, pointing out the other two rappers involved have not been arrested. \u201cThis trial has nothing to do with freedom of expression.

But discontent has continued to boil, fuelled by rampant corruption and worsening economic conditions, and small protest movements have started again, this time spreading to regional areas as well as cities. Analysts say the government has sought to keep a lid on unrest by increasingly cracking down on dissent and demonstrations in the past two years, including by arresting rappers who express popular grievances. The 2011 protests gave prominence to another rapper, Mouad Belrhouate, who was jailed for two years, then sought political asylum in Belgium.

I can\u2019t make excuses for last season and I am tired of trying. I know it wasn\u2019t good enough. But I have showed my level and the route I\u2019ve taken [from League One at MK Dons] \u2013 you have to be mentally strong. I know where I want to go and I know what I want to achieve as a player. Nothing is going to stop me.\u201d Mourinho spoke about how details and moments can make all the difference, such as when his three best penalty takers at Real Madrid \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo, Kak\u00e1 and Sergio Ramos \u2013 each missed in the 2012 Champions League semi-final shootout defeat by Bayern Munich. \u201cThat was the strongest Real Madrid of the past 15 or 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were the best team [in the Champions League]. We didn\u2019t win it.\u201d Pochettino\u2019s Spurs were on the right side of some fine margins in their run to last season\u2019s Champions League final when, in Mourinho\u2019s words, they almost \u201clanded on the moon\u201d, only to lose to Liverpool. \u201cTo arrive in the final is an incredible achievement but it\u2019s not history,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory is winning.\u201d",

But a couple of years ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/26/its-the-climate-not-immigration-that-keeps-australians-awake-at-night\">we began to grow impatient</a> about the government\u2019s management of the immigration program, impatient in particular about overcrowding in our cities.

Chinese state media have sought to discredit Wang as a convicted \u201cfraudster\u201d, liar and a fake after he revealed his role within Chinese intelligence and his bid for Australia\u2019s protection on Saturday in the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers. Wang is staying in an undisclosed location in Sydney. He is in the country on a tourist visa and has applied for asylum. Australia Environmentalists say a Victorian government plan to preserve old growth forest may instead open up protected areas. The government\u2019s promise to protect 90,000 hectares of old growth forest comes just weeks after it announced a major transition plan for Victoria\u2019s timber industry. Private health insurance will continue its death spiral unless exorbitant specialist bills are reined in, a Grattan Institute report has found. Alan Jones\u2019s 2GB breakfast show has lost hundreds of advertisers since he suggested Scott Morrison shove a sock down Jacinda Ardern\u2019s throat, according to activist groups. The world The UK has urged China to give UN observers \u201cimmediate and unfettered access\u201d to detention camps in Xinjiang, where more than a million people from the Uighur community and other Muslim minorities are being held without trial. Seven people have died as violent storms swept through parts of France, Greece and Italy at the weekend, causing flash floods, landslides and the collapse of an overpass. A UK funeral firm described customers as \u201cgazelles\u201d to be hunted, whistleblowers have told the Guardian. Workers at a UK call centre have been subjecting elderly people to dozens of calls a week to sell them expensive funeral packages, according to former staff. China\u2019s government has issued a warning in response to a stunning landslide victory for pro-democracy candidates in the Hong Kong elections by emphasising that the city will always be ruled from Beijing. Recommended reads It\u2019s the climate, not immigration, that keeps Australians awake at night, writes David Marr. \u201cSomething happened in 2017. Australia is second only to Canada in welcoming immigration on a large scale. Our faith in the benefits of accepting newcomers of all faiths and races is rock solid. But a couple of years ago we began to grow impatient about the government\u2019s management of the immigration program, impatient in particular about overcrowding in our cities. This is the verdict of the Scanlon Foundation\u2019s 2019 Mapping Social Cohesion report, published on Tuesday.\u201d \u201cAustralia has now not had a three-year period of above-average growth for more than a decade. One major concern is the massive drop in the growth of productivity,\u201d writes Greg Jericho. \u201cIt seems almost impossible, but the past three years have seen worse productivity growth than occurred in 2007-08 under the WorkChoices regime. It\u2019s quite astonishing that while this is happening the treasurer could argue less than a week ago that, \u2018When it comes to the Australian economy, we have our fundamentals in a pretty good place.\u2019\u201d Listen David Dungay Jr\u2019s family say they\u2019re still searching for justice. Last week the Dungay family heard from the coroner when he handed down his findings into the death of the 26-year-old. This week, in the final episode of Breathless, the family wants you to hear from David one last time. We go through the coroner\u2019s report and hear the phone calls David made to his sister and mother less than an hour before he died. If you want to follow the story from the beginning you can start with episode one, where we first meet David\u2019s family. Sport The W-league\u2019s plans to formalise an Australian-US accord comes a risk \u2013 to the wellbeing of the game\u2019s greatest assets, writes Samantha Lewis. Rugby Australia\u2019s negotiation of its next broadcast deal has got off to a shaky start with Foxtel reportedly threatening to cut ties with the sport, but the future of the game in the country will depend on the outcome of the agreement, writes Brett Harris. The Wallabies have emerged from a challenging year with a significantly stronger connection to their fanbase, according to new research, while the Matildas remain Australia\u2019s most relatable national sports team. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that \u201ca man who allegedly tried to install a Chinese agent into federal parliament made a multi-million dollar offer to take control of a company based in the CSIRO\u2019s building\u201d and speaks to Australian paramedics earning $100,000 in overtime, who say they are \u201cdangerously overworked\u201d. \u201cWestpac CEO Brian Hartzer told his executives on Monday that the bank\u2019s pedophile money scandal was \u2018not an Enron or Lehman Brothers\u2019,\u201d the Australian reports. And today\u2019s Herald Sun reports on evidence presented before Victoria\u2019s anti-corruption body Ibac: \u201cA multi-millionaire developer and a former Casey mayor discussed the idea of \u2018a few heavy guys\u2019 beating up a rival councillor, secret phone recordings reveal.\u201d Coming up The Reserve Bank\u2019s deputy governor, Guy Debelle, will give the keynote address at the Australian Council of Social Services conference. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 An 82-year-old bodybuilder beat up a 28-year-old man who tried to break into her home in Rochester, New York. Willie Murphy said she had jumped on the intruder, poured shampoo on his face and hit him with a broom. She even tried to drag him out of the house but he was too big. By the time police and emergency workers arrived, she said: \u201cI had really did a number on that man \u2026 I think he was happy when he went in the ambulance.\u201d Sign up If you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.",

      "bodyText": "The number of hospital beds has fallen to its lowest level ever, despite the head of the NHS warning that bed closures have gone too far. The health service in England has cut so many beds in recent years that it has just 127,225 left to cope with the rising demand for care, which will intensify as winter starts to bite. In total, 17,230 beds have been cut from the 144,455 that existed in April-June 2010, the period when the coalition Conservative/Liberal Democrat government took office and imposed a nine-year funding squeeze on the NHS, even though critics cautioned against it because of growing pressures on the service. The 127,225 figure is the smallest number of beds available in acute hospitals, maternity centres and units specialising in the care of patients with mental health problems and learning disabilities since records began in 1987/88. The figures have emerged in the middle of an election campaign in which the NHS has proved to be a dominant issue, with the parties trading promises on funding and measures to tackle widespread understaffing. The disclosure \u2013 uncovered by a Labour analysis of official bed numbers from NHS Digital \u2013 triggered warnings from medical bodies that the loss of so many beds would damage the quality of care patients receive and leave hospitals even more \u201cjammed\u201d than they are already. It came amid growing signs that hospitals will struggle this winter, such as ambulances queuing outside A&amp;E units for long periods to bring in patients and outbreaks of the winter vomiting bug norovirus forcing wards to be closed and patients moved. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, blamed the ongoing drop in beds for the huge spike in the number of patients forced to wait sometimes more than 12 hours after a decision to admit them before they can get a bed. \u201cThese Tory bed cuts are a total disgrace. Under the Tories, hospital beds have plummeted to the lowest levels on record while thousands, like 90-year-old war veteran Brian Fish, are forced to endure the indignity of 10 hours on a hospital trolley because there aren\u2019t enough hospital beds,\u201d said Ashworth. Dr Sue Crosland, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the loss of beds made it harder for hospital staff to provide proper care. \u201cBed reduction and fast turnover is a major risk to patients across the NHS, with hospital-acquired infection rates increased by over-occupancy and quick turnarounds,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen bed occupancy is very high the chain of movement becomes jammed, like a motorway with lots of traffic. \u201cThis leads to a reduction in the quality of overall care and results in compromises such as cleaning spaces between patients and increased risk of emergency readmission.\u201d The number of beds in general and acute hospitals has fallen from 110,568 in April-June 2010 to 100,406 in the same period this year. The number of mental health beds has dropped by more than 5,000 over that time from 23,515 to 18,179 despite the ongoing scandal of patients being sent hundreds of miles from home because no bed is available locally. The continuing fall has occurred despite Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, telling service chiefs in June that bed cuts should stop because they were leaving hospitals unable to cope with the number of people who need to be admitted. Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s consultants committee, said: \u201cIt is extremely worrying that despite the BMA\u2019s warning of a year ago that 10,000 extra beds were needed, the numbers of hospital beds had actually fallen to a new record low. \u201cThese figures show the seriousness of the situation confronting patients this winter and can only add to the day-to-day struggles faced by our NHS frontline staff.\u201d Health experts said that bed occupancy rates should not exceed 85% in order to ensure patient safety and quality of care.

All the players targeted except for Pjanic, who is Bosnian, are black. Balotelli rejoined Serie A after three years in the French league. He has scored two goals in seven matches but has not been able to spark Brescia, with Grosso challenging the former Manchester City and Liverpool forward to show more \u201cdetermination and enthusiasm\u201d to regain his place. \u201cI bought Balotelli because I thought he could add something to the squad,\u201d Cellino said. \u201cBut due to overexposure we\u2019ve made him become a weakness. If we continue to talk about Balotelli, we\u2019ll be hurting both him and ourselves.\u201d",

Stuart Hall predicted it with mugging in the 70s \u2013 there\u2019s hysteria around young black people and that eventually provokes an over-reaction like this.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to pull the film came after 100 young people were embroiled in a brawl at the Star City leisure complex on Saturday night in Birmingham. Six teenagers, including a 13-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy, were arrested. West Midlands police said the decision to stop screening the film was not based on official advice. Vue later said there had been 25 \u201csignificant incidents\u201d involving screenings of Blue Story at 16 of its cinemas.</p> <p>Following the criticism, Showcase said on Monday night that it was reinstating the film \u201csupported with increased security protocols\u201d.</p> <p>Maurice McLeod, social commentator and former director of Media Diversified, called the decision to pull the film \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d and hard to not see as \u201cracially tinged\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that this film is so exciting that a group of black kids will start stabbing each other is just insulting,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of films or TV shows that are much more violent, like Game of Thrones, but it\u2019s understood that people who watch those films are sophisticated enough to not act on it. But that\u2019s not the perception with culture consumed by young black people.\u201d</p> <p>Nwonka said this was the latest case of a black British film having problems with censorship. Pressure, the first ever black British film, directed by Horace Ove was plagued with distribution issues in the mid 70s because of its depiction of racism in London, he said. Likewise, Franco Rosso\u2019s Babylon in 1980 had issues with its certification because its content \u2013 a gritty story of life in south London among young reggae fans \u2013 was deemed to be too controversial.</p> <p>More recently, Nwonka said gang dramas such as Bullet Boy and Top Boy have had issues securing permits to shoot in certain areas of London. \u201cAuthorities have often seen black urban film as having some sort of potential to influence black people in a negative way. The decision is rooted in the idea that black people are unable to distinguish between fiction and reality,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Zak Ov\u00e9, the artist, curator and son of Pressure director Horace Ov\u00e9, said that the furore surrounding Blue Story has taken attention away from the fact the director Rapman (real name Andrew Onwubolu) had been able to forge a successful film career while operating completely outside of the mainstream. \u201cThe film has attracted its own core crowd virally and they want to see themselves and their lives personified by film-makers who are part of their world. It\u2019s sad this has been pulled from cinemas .\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday Onwubolu tweeted saying the film was \u201cabout love, not violence\u201d and that he hoped the blame for the disorder was \u201cplaced with the individuals and not an indictment of the film itself\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cSending love to all those involved in yesterday\u2019s violence at Star City in Birmingham. It\u2019s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.\u201d</p> <p>Vue said the decision was \u201cnot taken lightly or without careful consideration\u201d and denied accusations it was based on \u201cbiased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself\u201d. It said Blue Story is a \u201cfantastic film \u2026 that has the opportunity to change lives\u201d and that it hoped the message of the film would not get lost.</p> <p>\u201cDespite a range of precautionary measures in place, including increased security, removal of late-night showings and reduced screenings of the film, the decision to withdraw Blue Story in its entirety was made on Saturday evening on grounds of safety alone,\u201d Vue said.</p> <p>Showcase was approached for comment.</p> <p>BFI said it was saddened \u201cfor anyone negatively impacted by the incidents at the weekend\u201d and it was \u201ca shame that this has overshadowed what we believe is an important piece of work with a very positive message.\u201d</p> <p>It added: \u201cRapman is an exceptional storyteller who has connected with audiences in cinemas with Blue Story \u2013 it\u2019s a film people want to see as the excellent box office performance at the weekend demonstrates. This is a filmmaker who has real cultural value \u2013 in fact his online work Shiro\u2019s Story is in the BFI National Archive, and we were delighted to host a preview of Blue Story last week at BFI Southbank, where it will be screening for the next few weeks.\u201d</p>",

But that\u2019s not the perception with culture consumed by young black people.\u201d Nwonka said this was the latest case of a black British film having problems with censorship. Pressure, the first ever black British film, directed by Horace Ove was plagued with distribution issues in the mid 70s because of its depiction of racism in London, he said. Likewise, Franco Rosso\u2019s Babylon in 1980 had issues with its certification because its content \u2013 a gritty story of life in south London among young reggae fans \u2013 was deemed to be too controversial. More recently, Nwonka said gang dramas such as Bullet Boy and Top Boy have had issues securing permits to shoot in certain areas of London. \u201cAuthorities have often seen black urban film as having some sort of potential to influence black people in a negative way. The decision is rooted in the idea that black people are unable to distinguish between fiction and reality,\u201d he said. Zak Ov\u00e9, the artist, curator and son of Pressure director Horace Ov\u00e9, said that the furore surrounding Blue Story has taken attention away from the fact the director Rapman (real name Andrew Onwubolu) had been able to forge a successful film career while operating completely outside of the mainstream. \u201cThe film has attracted its own core crowd virally and they want to see themselves and their lives personified by film-makers who are part of their world. It\u2019s sad this has been pulled from cinemas .\u201d On Saturday Onwubolu tweeted saying the film was \u201cabout love, not violence\u201d and that he hoped the blame for the disorder was \u201cplaced with the individuals and not an indictment of the film itself\u201d. He added: \u201cSending love to all those involved in yesterday\u2019s violence at Star City in Birmingham. It\u2019s truly unfortunate that a small group of people can ruin things for everybody. I pray that we can all learn to live with love and treat each other with tolerance and respect.\u201d Vue said the decision was \u201cnot taken lightly or without careful consideration\u201d and denied accusations it was based on \u201cbiased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself\u201d. It said Blue Story is a \u201cfantastic film \u2026 that has the opportunity to change lives\u201d and that it hoped the message of the film would not get lost. \u201cDespite a range of precautionary measures in place, including increased security, removal of late-night showings and reduced screenings of the film, the decision to withdraw Blue Story in its entirety was made on Saturday evening on grounds of safety alone,\u201d Vue said. Showcase was approached for comment. BFI said it was saddened \u201cfor anyone negatively impacted by the incidents at the weekend\u201d and it was \u201ca shame that this has overshadowed what we believe is an important piece of work with a very positive message.\u201d It added: \u201cRapman is an exceptional storyteller who has connected with audiences in cinemas with Blue Story \u2013 it\u2019s a film people want to see as the excellent box office performance at the weekend demonstrates. This is a filmmaker who has real cultural value \u2013 in fact his online work Shiro\u2019s Story is in the BFI National Archive, and we were delighted to host a preview of Blue Story last week at BFI Southbank, where it will be screening for the next few weeks.\u201d",

Four years \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/timeline-of-trouble-how-the-tsb-it-meltdown-unfolded\">one large-scale IT calamity</a> \u2013 later, TSB looks more like a case of the Spanish owner trying to minimise the pain from a mistaken acquisition.</p> <p>Rather than trying to take chunks out of the opposition, TSB now merely aims to \u201crestore\u201d competitiveness via a new three-year plan. Some 86 branches, or 15% of the current tally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/25/tsb-close-branches-jobs-bank-it-meltdown\">will be closed</a>. Cost will be cut to force operating ratios into vaguely normal territory. Net lending will be increased by 5% a year to return TSB\u2019s share of the market to a level enjoyed before 2017. And \u00a3120m will be invested in digital services, the area where the bank\u2019s reputation for competence was whacked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/timeline-of-trouble-how-the-tsb-it-meltdown-unfolded\">last year\u2019s botched IT upgrade</a>.</p> <p>The medicine is conventional and there isn\u2019t a viable alternative to gradual self-improvement. But even a successful execution of a three-year programme is designed only to produce a return on equity in 2022 of 7%, less than the bank\u2019s cost of capital. Lloyds, Barclays et al will not be quaking in fear. They prefer \u201cchallenger\u201d banks that merely aspire to be less challenged themselves.</p> <p>Sabadell is committed to owning TSB \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, thinks the TSB chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, and there\u2019s no reason to doubt her. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a queue of would-be buyers obviously hammering at the door.</p> <h2>Neon-lit power play</h2> <p>Is it naughty of National Grid and SSE to play games with their holding company structures in response to Labour\u2019s plan to renationalise parts of their business? Well, it looks shifty not to tell the shareholders unprompted \u2013 the Sunday Times at the weekend revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/24/power-firms-move-ownership-offshore-to-protect-against-labour-renationalisation\">the various shuffles to Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Switzerland</a>.</p> <p>But such manoeuvres were also predictable. Boards would be berated by their shareholders if they did nothing. The tactic is not about frustrating nationalisation; rather, the aim is to ensure compensation at a fair price via an action in a foreign court if necessary.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, cannot be surprised by developments since his repeated claim about nationalisation prices being \u201cset by parliament\u201d was a neon-lit warning. If he\u2019s determined to pay less than the regulated value of the assets, it\u2019s not obvious how he would avoid time-consuming legal challenges.</p>",

Four years \u2013 and one large-scale IT calamity \u2013 later, TSB looks more like a case of the Spanish owner trying to minimise the pain from a mistaken acquisition. Rather than trying to take chunks out of the opposition, TSB now merely aims to \u201crestore\u201d competitiveness via a new three-year plan. Some 86 branches, or 15% of the current tally, will be closed. Cost will be cut to force operating ratios into vaguely normal territory. Net lending will be increased by 5% a year to return TSB\u2019s share of the market to a level enjoyed before 2017. And \u00a3120m will be invested in digital services, the area where the bank\u2019s reputation for competence was whacked by last year\u2019s botched IT upgrade. The medicine is conventional and there isn\u2019t a viable alternative to gradual self-improvement. But even a successful execution of a three-year programme is designed only to produce a return on equity in 2022 of 7%, less than the bank\u2019s cost of capital. Lloyds, Barclays et al will not be quaking in fear. They prefer \u201cchallenger\u201d banks that merely aspire to be less challenged themselves. Sabadell is committed to owning TSB \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, thinks the TSB chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, and there\u2019s no reason to doubt her. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a queue of would-be buyers obviously hammering at the door. Neon-lit power play Is it naughty of National Grid and SSE to play games with their holding company structures in response to Labour\u2019s plan to renationalise parts of their business? Well, it looks shifty not to tell the shareholders unprompted \u2013 the Sunday Times at the weekend revealed the various shuffles to Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Switzerland. But such manoeuvres were also predictable. Boards would be berated by their shareholders if they did nothing. The tactic is not about frustrating nationalisation; rather, the aim is to ensure compensation at a fair price via an action in a foreign court if necessary. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, cannot be surprised by developments since his repeated claim about nationalisation prices being \u201cset by parliament\u201d was a neon-lit warning. If he\u2019s determined to pay less than the regulated value of the assets, it\u2019s not obvious how he would avoid time-consuming legal challenges.",

He was particularly critical of Boris Johnson, saying that he had no chance of negotiating a Canada-style trade deal with the EU before the end of next year and that if Johnson was telling the truth about not being willing to extend the Brexit transition (admittedly, quite a big if, given Johnson\u2019s record when it comes to Brexit extensions), then a no-deal Brexit was the \u201cprobable outcome\u201d. Blair said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it and if they mean their manifesto commitment to no extension past 2020, it is the probable outcome.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blair implied people should vote tactically for remain candidates. But he did not formally endorse any non-Labour candidates, and he confirmed that he would be voting Labour himself. Alastair Campbell, his former spin doctor, was expelled from Labour for saying he voted Lib Dem in the European elections, but Blair sounded determined to stay a member of the party so that he can participate in the debate about its post-Corbyn future that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddbab268f080fd59fb16d6a#block-5ddbab268f080fd59fb16d6a\">he suggested might start quite soon.</a></p> <h2>Lib Dems say Johnson\u2019s record of lying makes him unfit PM</h2> <p>The Liberal Democrats have sought to make Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws an election issue, with Chuka Umunna, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, saying Johnson\u2019s record of lying and using racist and bigoted language <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddbc68e8f083aa6d578ab26#block-5ddbc68e8f083aa6d578ab26\">makes him unfit to be PM.</a> Umunna used the argument in a speech in which he argued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/chuka-umunna-attacks-boris-johnson-for-following-the-trump-playbook\">a win for Johnson would be victory for Trump-style, rightwing nationalist populism.</a> The reception Johnson has received on some visits, and the response he encountered on Question Time on Friday, suggest that for some voters his integrity is a critical election issue. But that does not necessarily mean the Lib Dems, or anyone else, will be able to use arguments like this to shift opinion within the next two and a half weeks. Andrew Gimson, author of a biography of Johnson, has argued that attacks on Johnson\u2019s probity are likely to fail because <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2019/11/johnsons-critics-will-get-nowhere-by-calling-him-a-liar.html\">\u201cvoters can allow \u2013 or not \u2013 for a candidate\u2019s frailties</a>, and may prefer to be led by a prime minister who does not pose as a pillar of rectitude.\u201d</p> <h2>Johnson shrugs off criticism of nurses pledge</h2> <p>Boris Johnson has dismissed criticism that his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses is bogus because this figure includes staff being retained,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddc03238f087b800b620dd7#block-5ddc03238f087b800b620dd7\"> saying without government action there would be 50,000 fewer nurses. </a>Speaking at the launch of the Welsh Conservative election manifesto, he claimed that Wales was closer to China than New Zealand is.

Alastair Campbell, his former spin doctor, was expelled from Labour for saying he voted Lib Dem in the European elections, but Blair sounded determined to stay a member of the party so that he can participate in the debate about its post-Corbyn future that he suggested might start quite soon. Lib Dems say Johnson\u2019s record of lying makes him unfit PM The Liberal Democrats have sought to make Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws an election issue, with Chuka Umunna, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, saying Johnson\u2019s record of lying and using racist and bigoted language makes him unfit to be PM. Umunna used the argument in a speech in which he argued a win for Johnson would be victory for Trump-style, rightwing nationalist populism. The reception Johnson has received on some visits, and the response he encountered on Question Time on Friday, suggest that for some voters his integrity is a critical election issue. But that does not necessarily mean the Lib Dems, or anyone else, will be able to use arguments like this to shift opinion within the next two and a half weeks. Andrew Gimson, author of a biography of Johnson, has argued that attacks on Johnson\u2019s probity are likely to fail because \u201cvoters can allow \u2013 or not \u2013 for a candidate\u2019s frailties, and may prefer to be led by a prime minister who does not pose as a pillar of rectitude.\u201d Johnson shrugs off criticism of nurses pledge Boris Johnson has dismissed criticism that his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses is bogus because this figure includes staff being retained, saying without government action there would be 50,000 fewer nurses. Speaking at the launch of the Welsh Conservative election manifesto, he claimed that Wales was closer to China than New Zealand is. Showing uncharacteristic concern for factual accuracy when making an outlandish claim in an off-the-cuff speech, he asked someone to check that this was true. He was told it was true. However, as various people have pointed out on Twitter, he was missing the point. Rather, he was missing two points. Meanwhile A poll for ITV and Cardiff University has shown Labour up nine points in Wales since the start of the month. Over the same period the Conservatives are up four points, the poll suggests. The government has announced plans for a slimmed-down Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December, as Boris Johnson has said he would want to push through his Brexit bill as soon as possible if he wins a majority. Stormzy is among a number of musicians to throw his support behind the Labour party and called on people to register to vote to \u201cend austerity, rebuild our communities and take back the means to change our lives for the better\u201d. He did so in a letter to the Guardian which you can read here. The leader of Welsh Labour has backed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to remain neutral in any fresh referendum campaign even though the party in Wales has pledged to fight for remain. And the BBC has claimed it made a \u201cmistake\u201d in editing a clip where it cut out an audience laughing at Boris Johnson, insisting the decision was made due to time constraints rather than political bias Sign up here to receive Andrew Sparrow\u2019s election briefing direct to your email inbox every weekday.

Shareholders in July objected to the shock revelation of a \u00a3605m tax bill from Belgian authorities, as well as the delay in appointing an auditor. In October the company finally appointed a new auditor, more than a month after an acrimonious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/sports-direct-appoints-new-auditor-split-grant-thornton-rsm\">split with Grant Thornton over delayed accounts</a>.</p> <p>In May the company said it would use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/08/house-of-fraser-up-to-seven-stores-to-become-luxury-mini-chains\">the Frasers </a>name to rebrand some House of Fraser stores as a new luxury mini-chain selling more expensive labels.

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct International, which has attracted criticism from politicians and investors over working conditions and its approach to business, has announced plans to rebrand itself as Frasers Group. The retail group, which has a market value of \u00a31.8bn, said it was seeking to elevate its image beyond the sportswear through which the billionaire chief executive made his fortune. Shareholders will vote on the name change at a general meeting in London on 16 December. The company requires 75% of the votes cast at the meeting to change the name, but Ashley owns 65% of the shares. The unusual move for a FTSE 250 company comes after Ashley led a year-long buying spree of struggling retailers, most notably House of Fraser in a \u00a390m deal. Other retailers bought in the last 18 months by Sports Direct include Evans Cycles, Sofa.com and Game Digital. Ashley also attempted takeovers of Debenhams, another stalwart British department store chain, and Findel, the online retail and education group, as well as considering bids for the cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, the clothes retailer LK Bennett and the toy shop chain Hamleys. The Sports Direct chain of shops will not be renamed, but the move to change the group name to Frasers follows a string of scandals over working conditions at Sports Direct, as well the company\u2019s unusual corporate governance arrangements. Nearly a third of investors independent of Ashley voted against him continuing as chief executive in September. Shareholders in July objected to the shock revelation of a \u00a3605m tax bill from Belgian authorities, as well as the delay in appointing an auditor. In October the company finally appointed a new auditor, more than a month after an acrimonious split with Grant Thornton over delayed accounts. In May the company said it would use the Frasers name to rebrand some House of Fraser stores as a new luxury mini-chain selling more expensive labels. Ashley has expressed regret at taking over House of Fraser. In July, he described some of the problems at House of Fraser as \u201cnothing short of terminal in nature\u201d and gave it a rating of one out of five. It made a \u00a354.6m operating loss in its last financial year, \u00a34.6m more than expected by analysts. In a letter to shareholders, David Daly, Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive chair, wrote that the name change reflected the group\u2019s desire to \u201celevate [the] retail proposition across all channels\u201d. He added: \u201cIt demonstrates the transformation of the company over recent years into the holder of a diversified portfolio of sports, fitness, fashion and lifestyle fascias.\u201d The change of name will not affect shareholder rights, and the company said existing share certificates would remain valid.",

The discrepancy was spotted by Nick Flaks, a resident of Brighton, while watching the lunchtime news: \u201cI rewatched both clips, and found the editing department had cut about 1.5 seconds of laughing on the topic of trust and instead gave the appearance that Johnson was being clapped at, cheered and supported by the audience instead of being ridiculed.\u201d Flaks, however, quickly located the original Question Time footage using the BBC\u2019s iPlayer catch-up service and produced a short clip using his iPad\u2019s video editing software and uploaded it to Twitter.

A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThis clip from the BBC\u2019s Question Time special, which was played in full on the News at Ten on Friday evening and on other outlets, was shortened for timing reasons on Saturday\u2019s lunchtime bulletin, to edit out a repetitious phrase from Boris Johnson. \u201cHowever, in doing so we also edited out laughter from the audience. Although there was absolutely no intention to mislead, we accept that this was a mistake on our part, as it didn\u2019t reflect the full reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s answer. We did not alter the soundtrack or image in any way apart from this edit, contrary to some claims on social media.\u201d",

In a statement the commission said it would not comment on the details of the leak, but insisted it would continue to raise the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang with Chinese government officials.</p> <p>\u201cWe have consistently spoken out against the existence of political re-education camps, widespread surveillance and restrictions of freedom of religion or belief against Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\u201cWe as the European Union continue to expect China to uphold its international obligations and to respect human rights, including when it comes to the rights of persons belonging to minorities, especially in Xinjiang but also in Tibet, and we will continue to affirm those positions in this context in particular.\u201d</p> <p>In July, 22 countries at the UNs\u2019 top human rights body took the unusual step of issuing an <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/07/10/un-unprecedented-joint-call-china-end-xinjiang-abuses\">joint statement</a> calling for China to end its arbitrary detentions and other violations against the rights of Muslims in the north-west border region of Xinjiang.</p> <p>Signatories included the UK, Australia, Canada and a number of European countries. The statement urged China to allow \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to the region independent international observers, including Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights.</p> <p>Chinese authorities deny they run detention camps and say the \u201cvocational education and training centres\u201d are part of a focused crackdown on extremism and terrorists.</p> <p>However, the China cables point to the ruling party setting out a blueprint for human rights violations.</p> <p>Reports of a crackdown first emerged two years ago, as hundreds of thousands of muslims in Xinjiang were rounded up into secretive, newly built and heavily guarded compounds.</p> <p>Xi Jinping\u2019s government took action following a rise in terrorist attacks. In 2009, nearly 200 people, most of them Han Chinese, died during riots in the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi.

      "bodyText": "The UK has urged China to give United Nations observers \u201cimmediate and unfettered access\u201d to detention camps in Xinjiang, where more than a million people from the Uighur community and other muslim minorities are being held without trial. The call from the Foreign Office was in response to the China cables, a leak of classified documents from within the Communist party which appear to provide the first official confirmation that the camps were designed by Beijing as brainwashing internment centres. The documents describe how inmates are to be cut off from their families for at least a year and held behind multiple layers of security to undergo ideological transformation. The leak prompted the Foreign Office to demand \u201can end to the indiscriminate and disproportionate restrictions on the cultural and religious freedoms of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.\u201d A spokesperson added. \u201cThe UK continues to call on China to allow UN observers immediate and unfettered access to the region.\u201d In Brussels, the European commission condemned the use of \u201cpolitical re-education camps\u201d. In a statement the commission said it would not comment on the details of the leak, but insisted it would continue to raise the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang with Chinese government officials. \u201cWe have consistently spoken out against the existence of political re-education camps, widespread surveillance and restrictions of freedom of religion or belief against Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe as the European Union continue to expect China to uphold its international obligations and to respect human rights, including when it comes to the rights of persons belonging to minorities, especially in Xinjiang but also in Tibet, and we will continue to affirm those positions in this context in particular.\u201d In July, 22 countries at the UNs\u2019 top human rights body took the unusual step of issuing an joint statement calling for China to end its arbitrary detentions and other violations against the rights of Muslims in the north-west border region of Xinjiang. Signatories included the UK, Australia, Canada and a number of European countries. The statement urged China to allow \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to the region independent international observers, including Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights. Chinese authorities deny they run detention camps and say the \u201cvocational education and training centres\u201d are part of a focused crackdown on extremism and terrorists. However, the China cables point to the ruling party setting out a blueprint for human rights violations. Reports of a crackdown first emerged two years ago, as hundreds of thousands of muslims in Xinjiang were rounded up into secretive, newly built and heavily guarded compounds. Xi Jinping\u2019s government took action following a rise in terrorist attacks. In 2009, nearly 200 people, most of them Han Chinese, died during riots in the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi. Dozens more were then killed and hundreds injured over the following years. The China cables contain dozens of pages of orders covering the setting up of the camps and the establishment of a vast digital surveillance operation being used to identify new detainees. In a single week in June 2017, the digital platform flagged up 24,412 \u201csuspicious\u201d individuals in one part of southern Xinjiang alone. Of these, more than 15,000 were sent to re-education camps, and a further 706 were jailed. The cables reveal camps must adhere to a strict system of total physical and mental control, with multiple layers of locks on dormitories, corridors, floors and buildings. Inmates could be held indefinitely \u2013 but must serve at least a year in the camps before they can even be considered for \u201ccompletion\u201d, or release. Weekly phone calls and a monthly video call with relatives are their only contact with the outside world, and they can be suspended as punishment. Control of every aspect of their lives is so comprehensive that they have to be assigned a specific place not only in dormitories and classrooms, but even in the lunchtime queue. Obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and shared with the Guardian and 16 other media partners, the documents have been independently assessed by experts who have concluded they are authentic. China\u2019s embassy in London has dismissed the documents as \u201cpure fabrication and fake news\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are no such documents or orders for the so-called \u2018detention camps\u2019. Vocational education and training centres have been established for the prevention of terrorism.\u201d The full response can be read here.",

Blair said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it and if they mean their manifesto commitment to no extension past 2020, it is the probable outcome. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Blair implied that people should vote tactically for remain candidates. But he did not formally endorse any non-Labour candidates, and he confirmed that he would be voting Labour himself. Alastair Campbell, his former spin doctor, was expelled for Labour for saying he voted Lib Dem in the European elections, but Blair sounded determined to stay a member of the party so that he can participate in the debate about its post-Corbyn future that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddbab268f080fd59fb16d6a#block-5ddbab268f080fd59fb16d6a\">he suggested might start quite soon.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Liberal Democrats have sought to make Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws an election issue, with Chuka Umunna, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, saying that </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddbc68e8f083aa6d578ab26#block-5ddbc68e8f083aa6d578ab26\"><strong>Johnson\u2019s record of lying and using racist and bigoted language makes him unfit to be PM.</strong> </a>Umunna used the argument in a speech in which he argued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/chuka-umunna-attacks-boris-johnson-for-following-the-trump-playbook\">a win for Johnson would be victory for Trump-style, rightwing nationalist populism.</a> The reception Johnson has received on some visits, and the response he encountered on Question Time on Friday, suggest that for some voters his integrity is a critical election issue. But that does not necessarily mean that the Lib Dems, or anyone else, will be able to use arguments like this to shift opinion within the next two and a half weeks. <strong>Andrew Gimson</strong>, author of biography of Johnson, has argued that attacks on Johnson\u2019s probity are likely to fail because<a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2019/11/johnsons-critics-will-get-nowhere-by-calling-him-a-liar.html\"> \u201cvoters can allow \u2013 or not \u2013 for a candidate\u2019s frailties, and may prefer to be led by a prime minister who does not pose as a pillar of rectitude\u201d.</a> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has dismissed criticism that his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses is bogus because this figure includes staff being retained,</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddc03238f087b800b620dd7#block-5ddc03238f087b800b620dd7\"> saying without government action there would be 50,000 fewer nurses.</a> </strong>Speaking at the launch of the Welsh Conservative election manifesto, he claimed that Wales was closer to China than New Zealand is.

That is a breakthrough.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The prime minister also insisted that new, profitable markets would open up for Welsh farmers after Brexit. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will make sure we open up new markets for Welsh lamb. Why should New Zealand be supplying huge quantities of lamb to China when as far as I know Wales is closer to Chinas than New Zealand is?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He then got a Tory supporter in the audience to google whether Wales was in fact close to China.</p> \n  <p>Many farmers are terrified that a hard Brexit will lead to soaring tariffs. Johnson said: \u201cPeople are yearning, aching to get Brexit done.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He described incompetently shearing a sheep at the Royal Wales Winter Show but said as the ewe looked up at him with \u201cimploring eyes\u201d he consoled himself with the idea that at least he wasn\u2019t fleecing the country, as he said Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would if they got into power.</p> \n  <p>Johnson said the Tories would protect Welsh steel workers and would tackle congestion at the notorious Brynglas Tunnels on the M4 in south Wales, which he compared to the blocked up nostrils of a Welsh dragon.</p> \n  <p>He rejected the notion that the Tories should be ashamed of the impact austerity has had on Wales, arguing the Conservatives had to run the economy sensibly following Labour mismanagement, but said Wales could look forward to an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Earlier the Tory leader at the Welsh assembly, Paul Davies, described the Labour-led Welsh government as a \u201cCorbynite\u201d one and attacked its record on health and education.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3627943dc3a8ca0a9bac003e1f4d3b0798b20fcf\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3627943dc3a8ca0a9bac003e1f4d3b0798b20fcf/0_71_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at the launch of the Conservative party Welsh manifesto in Wrexham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at the launch of the Conservative party Welsh manifesto in Wrexham.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddbfb448f080fd59fb170ac\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T16:35:29.158Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tactical voting could cut Johnson's majority to zero, says Gina Miller</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the light of what happened in recent elections many of those active in politics are wary of relying too much on opinion polls.

In a statement she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>People are getting despondent when they read the headlines forgetting that in 2017, the 15% lead was supposed to translate to a 100+ seat majority for Mrs May.

The chapter on how Churchill crafted his own image is a good example. Here is an extract on Churchill\u2019s approach to photo opportunities.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All his life [Churchill] had been a showman, an extrovert, theatrical, comical: there is a photo of him dressed for a fancy-dress ball at Sandhurst \u2013 meticulously made up, with carefully applied white face paint, as Pierrot the Clown.</p> \n   <p>He knew how to project his personality, and the war called for someone who could create an image of himself \u2013 decisive, combative, but also cheery and encouraging \u2013 in the minds of the people ...</p> \n   <p>With his ludicrous hats and rompers and cigars and excess alcohol, he contrived physically to represent the central idea of his own political philosophy: the inalienable right of the British people to live their lives in freedom, to do their own thing.</p> \n   <p>You only had to look at Churchill, and see the vital difference between his way of life and the ghastly seriousness and uniformity and pomposity of the Nazis. Never forget: Hitler was a teetotaller, a deformity that accounts for much misery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson wrote that in 2014, long before he ever imagined he would be fighting an election campaign against Jeremy Corbyn, who also happens to be teetotal. But so is Johnson himself at the moment; he claims to have given up alcohol until Brexit is delivered.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7abebcc93c75a58945d9416ecd6a6826bf651eab\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7abebcc93c75a58945d9416ecd6a6826bf651eab/0_218_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson posing with sheep at Royal Welsh Winter Fair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson posing with sheep at Royal Welsh Winter Fair.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T16:13:52.879Z\">at 4.13pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddbf1618f087b800b620d19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T15:24:07.488Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> is giving a speech in Wales.

Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the manifesto was so empty that it would be thin for a budget let alone a multi-year programme for government. It means Johnson would undoubtedly come up with other plans for taxes, social care, and other big issues that are not in the manifesto. But in reality, a lot of a new Tory government\u2019s time is still going to be spent on sorting out Brexit, including aiming for a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What plans have the Conservative party to eliminate people\u2019s reliance on food banks and when will they be gone?

Anonymous, Lancashire</em></p> \n  <p>Not really. There is the so-called triple lock that guarantees that the basic state pension will rise by a minimum of either 2.5%, the rate of inflation or average earnings growth, whichever is largest. But there is not much else and no pledge to restore free TV licences for over-75s.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What\u2019s happened to the national insurance threshold increase promised by Johnson? William, Portugal</em></p> \n  <p>This was promised in the Tory manifesto. The party is saying it will raise it to \u00a39,500 next year \u2013 amounting to a tax cut of around \u00a385 per household. A longer term raising of the threshold to \u00a312,500 is planned amounting to \u00a3500 but there is no word on when this will actually happen.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why couldn\u2019t Boris give a straight answer to the Guardian\u2019s question regarding factcheck? Jay, 47, Hertfordshire</em></p> \n  <p>It can only mean he does not want to criticise the Tory fake fact-check stunt because he knows very well what the problem was and accusations are.

Speaking at the launch of his party\u2019s manifesto at a further education college in Wrexham, Drakeford said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I believe that when the history of our times is written, this general election will stand as a moment of profound and lasting change \u2013 a time when our nation, our economy, our public services and our planet set out on a different course.</p> \n   <p>The destructive policies of the UK Conservative government have left our communities damaged, our economy one of the most unequal in Europe and the UK ill-prepared for the climate emergency it now faces. This election is the chance to put that right.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Drakeford said that many of the radical policies that the UK Labour party wanted to introduce in England had already been implemented in Wales, such as free prescriptions; free school breakfasts, free hospital parking, the abolition of right to buy, keeping guards on trains and banning fracking.</p> \n  <p>He said UK Labour\u2019s plans to end austerity would mean a \u00a33.4bn increase to Wales\u2019 annual budget. The party promised to revive the stalled Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project, work with people on the island of Anglesey to \u201cmaximise its potential for new nuclear energy\u201d and invest in railways.</p> \n  <p>On Brexit, Drakeford made it clear that the Welsh Labour government would campaign \u201cunapologetically, unreservedly and enthusiastically to remain\u201d. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Three years on from the 2016 EU referendum we understand so much more about how Wales is uniquely exposed to a hardline Boris Johnson Brexit, about the devastation it would do to our manufacturing industry, about the protections it would shear from working people. About the damage it would do to individuals, business and communities the length and the breadth of Wales.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He ended his speech by quoting Aneurin Bevan, who said: \u201cPrivate charity can never be a substitute for organised justice.\u201d Drakeford added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That is, at root, the choice at stake in this election. A future where those whose needs are greatest will have to rely on the cold charity of Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg.</p> \n   <p>Or our view of a kinder, stronger and more sustainable UK under Labour where our people, our nation and our planet is strengthened through fairness, equality and respect.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14eb4e2c79b2ff3c5f805bf71600d70ff8b84f4f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14eb4e2c79b2ff3c5f805bf71600d70ff8b84f4f/0_170_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Drakeford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Drakeford.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T12:56:50.151Z\">at 12.56pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddbcba68f080fd59fb16e9f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T12:43:57.638Z\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 says Johnson to hold Queen's speech on Thursday 19 December if re-elected</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has announced plans for a slimmed down Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December, as Boris Johnson has said he would want to push through his Brexit bill as soon as possible if he wins a majority.</p> \n  <p>Preparations are being made for a curtailed process that cuts down on ceremony, in case Johnson is the new prime minister and wants to push ahead with a second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas recess.</p> \n  <p>The election is due to happen on 12 December and the results will emerge through the early hours of Friday 13 December.</p> \n  <p>Parliament will then resume on Tuesday 16 December and then there would be the election of the new Speaker and several days of new MPs being sworn in.</p> \n  <p>A Queen\u2019s speech would need to take place after that to allow legislation to brought forward, with the first and second readings of the Brexit bill possibly happening that week.</p> \n  <p>A government spokesman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The new parliament will be summoned to meet on Tuesday 17 December, when the business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members.</p> \n   <p>Should this prime minister return, the state opening of parliament and the Queen\u2019s speech will follow on Thursday 19 December.</p> \n   <p>The state opening of parliament will take place with reduced ceremonial elements, as was the case following the early general election in 2017.</p> \n   <p>This is due both to the early general election and the proximity of the state opening to Christmas.</p> \n   <p>If there is a change of government following the election it is anticipated that the Queen\u2019s speech would be in January on a more usual timetable; but this would be a matter for the incoming administration.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56fdc453d9e727401b8d6a31f50f09aaf48ea325\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56fdc453d9e727401b8d6a31f50f09aaf48ea325/1773_50_3464_2078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddbc97a8f087b800b620b52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T12:39:30.107Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Where will the 50,000 nurses come from?

That leaves 18,500 who are not new nurses but nurses would otherwise have left and have been retained in the profession by various incentives. The Tories argue improving retention rates is a way of boosting nurse numbers but Labour say the headline 50,000 figure is fake.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Much has been made of increases to public spending to the tune of \u00a32.9bn including 50,000 nurses. With no increases in taxes or national insurance who will this be paid for? Gareth Jenkins, </em><em>Pwllheli</em><em>, north Wales</em></p> \n  <p>The biggest tranche of cash for this comes from a decision to postpone a cut in corporation tax, which Johnson claims will raise \u00a36bn. Tories have in the past argued corporation tax cuts don\u2019t cost any money but Johnson has acknowledged this is not really the case.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Can you really trust them to deliver any of this \u2013 even the ones that appear to be socially responsible like extra nurses?

This is what Umunna said in response to the question from my colleague<strong> Peter Walker</strong> about whether he thought Boris Johnson was fit to be prime minister. Umunna replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am worried that you can say and do the things that Boris Johnson has done and for people to simply dismiss it as a factor that is priced in in this general election. I am alarmed that somebody can spew out the range of prejudice that has flowed from his mouth during his time in public office, and lie again and again and again, and it should not be an issue in a general election. It should be an issue in a general election when you are talking about giving somebody the keys to No 10 for another five years.</p> \n   <p>And so, clearly, I do not believe he is fit to be prime minister. And if you look at the things he has said and done in his behaviour, which follows the Donald Trump playbook, that should disqualify him from being able to be in office in my view. And it is a perfectly legitimate point for us to be making in this general election campaign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Umunna did not give examples of Johnson lying in his examples, but <a href=\"https://boris-johnson-lies.com/\">there is at least one website </a>devoted to false and misleading things Johnson has said.

But the demise of Change UK may have killed that off as an aspiration for the foreseeable future, and one of the interesting features of the Q&amp;A was Blair\u2019s confirmation that he wants to stay in the Labour party to contribute to the debate he expects it to be having about its post-Corbyn future after the election.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from the speech and Q&amp;A.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Blair accused both the Conservatives and Labour of peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d to voters in the election campaign.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddb9bee8f087b800b62099e#block-5ddb9bee8f087b800b62099e\"> 9.17am</a>.)

When it was put to him that strengthening protections for tenants might make landlords less willing to rent, he said that in Germany regulation of this market was stronger, but the size of the rental market was also much bigger.</p> \n  <p>Healey was also asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/labour-fifty-eight-billion-pound-pledge-women-pension-age-trap\">why Labour was now committed to spending \u00a358bn compensating women who lost out from the sharp increase in the state pension age. </a>This plan was not in Labour\u2019s manifesto, and the cost was not included in the costings document that was published alongside the manifesto. Labour says it will raise the \u00a358bn from borrowing.</p> \n  <p>When it was put to Healey that this plan contravened Labour\u2019s promise to borrow only to invest, he said this was not normal government spending.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair, the former prime minister and the last Labour leader to win a general election, has given a withering assessment of both main parties in his first significant intervention of the campaign. Describing British politics as chaotic, crazy and \u201cutterly dysfunctional\u201d, he said that both main parties were \u201cpeddling fantasies\u201d, and that he did not want either of them to form a majority government. He was particularly critical of Boris Johnson, saying that he had no chance of negotiating a Canada-style trade deal with the EU before the end of next year and that if Johnson was telling the truth about not being willing to extend the Brexit transition (admittedly, quite a big if, given Johnson\u2019s record when it comes to Brexit extensions), then a no-deal Brexit was the \u201cprobable outcome\u201d. Blair said: No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it and if they mean their manifesto commitment to no extension past 2020, it is the probable outcome. Blair implied that people should vote tactically for remain candidates. But he did not formally endorse any non-Labour candidates, and he confirmed that he would be voting Labour himself. Alastair Campbell, his former spin doctor, was expelled for Labour for saying he voted Lib Dem in the European elections, but Blair sounded determined to stay a member of the party so that he can participate in the debate about its post-Corbyn future that he suggested might start quite soon. The Liberal Democrats have sought to make Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws an election issue, with Chuka Umunna, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, saying that Johnson\u2019s record of lying and using racist and bigoted language makes him unfit to be PM. Umunna used the argument in a speech in which he argued a win for Johnson would be victory for Trump-style, rightwing nationalist populism. The reception Johnson has received on some visits, and the response he encountered on Question Time on Friday, suggest that for some voters his integrity is a critical election issue. But that does not necessarily mean that the Lib Dems, or anyone else, will be able to use arguments like this to shift opinion within the next two and a half weeks. Andrew Gimson, author of biography of Johnson, has argued that attacks on Johnson\u2019s probity are likely to fail because \u201cvoters can allow \u2013 or not \u2013 for a candidate\u2019s frailties, and may prefer to be led by a prime minister who does not pose as a pillar of rectitude\u201d. Boris Johnson has dismissed criticism that his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses is bogus because this figure includes staff being retained, saying without government action there would be 50,000 fewer nurses. Speaking at the launch of the Welsh Conservative election manifesto, he claimed that Wales was closer to China than New Zealand is. Showing uncharacteristic concern for factual accuracy when making an outlandish claim in an off-the-cuff speech, he asked someone to check that this was true. He was told it was true. However, as various people have pointed out on Twitter, he was missing the point. Rather, he was missing two points. A poll for ITV and Cardiff University has shown Labour up nine points in Wales since the start of the month. Over the same period the Conservatives are up four points, the poll suggests. The government has announced plans for a slimmed-down Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December, as Boris Johnson has said he would want to push through his Brexit bill as soon as possible if he wins a majority. Stormzy has thrown his support behind the Labour party and called on people to register to vote to \u201cend austerity, rebuild our communities and take back the means to change our lives for the better\u201d. He did so in a letter to the Guardian which you can read here. That\u2019s all from us for tonight. Thanks for the comments. The Scottish Greens have proposed controls over executive pay, a four-day working week and trials of a universal basic income, arguing that wealth inequality increases climate emissions. Although it is thin on detail, the party\u2019s Westminster manifesto proposes a pay cap to limit salaries for public sector chief executives to 10 times that of the lowest paid, and moves to cap executive pay in the private sector; a new wealth tax on the richest !% and a land value tax to replace council tax. It says: Our vision is to ensure everyone earns enough to allow us to phase in a four-day working week, shifting our society away from excessive working hours and towards one that values community action, caring and learning. The Scottish Greens, who are independent of the Green party in England and Wales, are a co-signatory of the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d championed by its sister party but there are subtle differences in approach. The Scottish Greens are pressing for North Sea oil fields to be shut down, but they do not share the Green party\u2019s call for carbon emissions target of net zero by 2030. Instead their manifesto adopts the less ambitious stance the Scottish Greens took at Holyrood calling for an 80% cut by 2030. The Greens in England and Wales want to introduce a universal basic income of \u00a389 a week for adults; the Scottish party only wants further trials to see if it works. Devolution of significant areas in domestic policy to Holyrood, including over education, transport, health and the environment, strips out many policies an English party would set out in detail for a Westminster election. But on many headline UK-level topics \u2013 backing remain if there is a second EU referendum, introducing proportional representation for Westminster and abolishing the Lords - the two parties\u2019 stances are the same. While the Scottish Greens benefit from PR in Scottish parliament elections, holding six seats at Holyrood, unlike the English Greens the Scottish party has never had an MP elected. The latest Westminster polls in Scotland suggest that will not change on 12 December: the Scottish Greens are polling at around 4% nationwide. Boris Johnson was challenged about his claim that a Conservative government would deliver 50,000 more nurses as he launched the Welsh Tories\u2019 manifesto at Wrexham racecourse. Asked by reporters if the pledge was nothing more than sleight of hand, he said: Let me absolutely clear these are 50,000 more nurses. If we weren\u2019t doing this we would have 50,000 fewer nurses. A pledge in the UK Tory manifesto to recruit 50,000 nurses on Sunday unravelled as it became clear that many of these would not actually be new but would include those who had been retained. In Wrexham Johnson said: The risk is that if we hadn\u2019t taken the action we are taking then those nurses who would otherwise not have been retained will be retrained. That is a breakthrough. The prime minister also insisted that new, profitable markets would open up for Welsh farmers after Brexit. He said: We will make sure we open up new markets for Welsh lamb. Why should New Zealand be supplying huge quantities of lamb to China when as far as I know Wales is closer to Chinas than New Zealand is? He then got a Tory supporter in the audience to google whether Wales was in fact close to China. Many farmers are terrified that a hard Brexit will lead to soaring tariffs. Johnson said: \u201cPeople are yearning, aching to get Brexit done.\u201d He described incompetently shearing a sheep at the Royal Wales Winter Show but said as the ewe looked up at him with \u201cimploring eyes\u201d he consoled himself with the idea that at least he wasn\u2019t fleecing the country, as he said Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would if they got into power. Johnson said the Tories would protect Welsh steel workers and would tackle congestion at the notorious Brynglas Tunnels on the M4 in south Wales, which he compared to the blocked up nostrils of a Welsh dragon. He rejected the notion that the Tories should be ashamed of the impact austerity has had on Wales, arguing the Conservatives had to run the economy sensibly following Labour mismanagement, but said Wales could look forward to an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d. Earlier the Tory leader at the Welsh assembly, Paul Davies, described the Labour-led Welsh government as a \u201cCorbynite\u201d one and attacked its record on health and education. In the light of what happened in recent elections many of those active in politics are wary of relying too much on opinion polls. But it was hard for opposition parties to read yesterday\u2019s papers without some sense of despair. The Observer reported on a poll giving the Tories a 19-point lead. The Sunday Times in its splash (paywall) reported on a Datapraxis analysis, based on 270,000 voter interviews by YouGov, suggesting \u201cthe Conservatives are on course to win 349 seats, enough for a majority of 48.\u201d But today Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner who is running a tactical voting campaign, Remain United, has urged fellow remainers not to despair. In a statement she said: People are getting despondent when they read the headlines forgetting that in 2017, the 15% lead was supposed to translate to a 100+ seat majority for Mrs May. Remain United\u2019s data points to a Boris Johnson majority of 70 seats, but this could shrink to zero with pro-remain smart tactical voting, as it did in 2017. Remain United has a website giving advice on how to vote tactically on a constituency by constituency basis. It is here. Its recommendations get updated as new polling figures come in. To make life complicated, this is one of at least five websites giving advice on tactical voting. The others include. The People\u2019s Vote one The Best for Britain one The tactical.vote one The tacticalvote one If this makes it all sound confusing, the blogger Jon Worth has written a useful post explaining where these five sites differ in their recommendations and offering further guidance. Tactical.vote also has the equivalent of a price comparison website - a table explaining what all five sites recommend on a constituency by constituency basis. Tomorrow is the deadline for registering to vote. If you are not registered, there are details of how to do it here. Here\u2019s John Lennon, from beyond the grave, joining those saying it\u2019s a good idea. Boris Johnson is not giving many formal speeches during the election campaign, and he is not spending much time either taking questions from journalists. But he is frequently posing for pictures, often giving the impression that he is clowning around, and he was at it again today, at the Royal Welsh Winter Show. There is a video version too. For an understanding of why Johnson thinks all this matters, it is worth reading the closest thing he has ever written to an autobiography \u2013 his book about Winston Churchill, called The Churchill Factor. It is not the most insightful book about Churchill, but Johnson clearly identifies with the great war leader and there are many passages in the book that read as self-referential. The chapter on how Churchill crafted his own image is a good example. Here is an extract on Churchill\u2019s approach to photo opportunities. All his life [Churchill] had been a showman, an extrovert, theatrical, comical: there is a photo of him dressed for a fancy-dress ball at Sandhurst \u2013 meticulously made up, with carefully applied white face paint, as Pierrot the Clown. He knew how to project his personality, and the war called for someone who could create an image of himself \u2013 decisive, combative, but also cheery and encouraging \u2013 in the minds of the people ... With his ludicrous hats and rompers and cigars and excess alcohol, he contrived physically to represent the central idea of his own political philosophy: the inalienable right of the British people to live their lives in freedom, to do their own thing. You only had to look at Churchill, and see the vital difference between his way of life and the ghastly seriousness and uniformity and pomposity of the Nazis. Never forget: Hitler was a teetotaller, a deformity that accounts for much misery. Johnson wrote that in 2014, long before he ever imagined he would be fighting an election campaign against Jeremy Corbyn, who also happens to be teetotal. But so is Johnson himself at the moment; he claims to have given up alcohol until Brexit is delivered. Boris Johnson is giving a speech in Wales. It is mostly a standard stump speech, but Johnson has just said that Wales is closer to China than New Zealand is. Expressing an uncharacteristic concern for factual accuracy, he asked someone in the audience to check that this claim was actually true. It was, he was told. He was making a point about export opportunities after Brexit. After a few minutes, Sky News abandoned their live coverage, so if there were any more gems, I\u2019ve missed them. But a colleague is at the event and will be sending me some copy later. Ian Taylor, who was Conservative MP for Esher and Walton until 2010 and who was a prominent pro-European in the party, is backing the Lib Dem candidate in his old constituency, Monica Harding, and not his Tory successor, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary. Taylor has explained why in an open letter to his old constituents. He says a hung parliament could lead to a second referendum, and that that could lead to a remain vote, which he says would be best for the country. Harding has welcomed Taylor\u2019s endorsement. Raab had a majority of more than 23,000 at the last election. But yesterday a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) claimed that he was one of seven prominent Tory Brexiters at risk of losing their seats, according to one polling analysis. The Scottish Greens have said it would be a mistake for a Scottish independence referendum to be delayed until after a Brexit transition period. As PA Media reports, speaking at the party\u2019s manifesto launch in Glasgow, co-leader Patrick Harvie said a second independence referendum should take in 2020 if Brexit goes ahead in January. Explaining his position, which is the same as the SNP\u2019s on the timing of a second independence referendum, Harvie said: If [Brexit] isn\u2019t stopped, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to say that on that timescale, that transition timescale when every other country in Europe has a say on our future, when the UK has a say on our future, Scotland should also have a say in its own future. If Scotland was to vote for independence within that timescale, then you have the option of ensuring that our transition to EU membership as an independent country can be smoothed. I think it would be a mistake to leave it until after that transition period had ended. So it\u2019s an entirely reasonable ask. I do think, however, and I want to stress this, Brexit can be stopped, should be stopped and we absolutely commit to ensuring that Green voices will advocate for the public to have the final say on any withdrawal agreement that any UK government wants to promote. Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed date for the Queen\u2019s speech (see 12.43pm) would fall on the day the monarch usually departs for her festive break at Sandringham, the Press Association reports. The Queen, 93, often travels to her Norfolk estate on the Thursday before Christmas, having hosted a family lunch for the royals at Buckingham Palace that week. This is from Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader seeking re-election in Chingford and Woodford Green. His Labour opponent, Faiza Shaheen, has condemned the attack. Next up will be the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart. She will be answering any questions you may have about the Labour party\u2019s manifesto, campaign and policies at 12.30pm on Wednesday. You can ask your question via our form here. Q: Does the manifesto mention whether the Conservatives support reform of the Gender Recognition Act to allow self-identification of gender \u2013 as the Lib Dems and Labour do? By the way what happened to the results of the 2018 consultation on this reform? Anonymous, London Johnson\u2019s government has downgraded reform of the Gender Recognition Act as a priority, although it denies that it has been dropped altogether. There is no mention of either transgender rights or self-identification in the manifesto. Q: Boris\u2019s agreement: when do we see it and can parliament scrutinise, amend and agree it \u2013 or will they? Mike Humphrey, retired, Glasgow The new withdrawal agreement and political declaration is published here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration. If Boris Johnson is returned with a majority, he will attempt to rush some or all of it through parliament after a Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December. MPs will probably have limited time to debate it but all Tory candidates have signed up to supporting the text as it stands so would be certain to vote it through at the earliest opportunity. Q: Have they outlined any details of how their Australian-style points-based immigration policy will work. Robert Greasley, 63, retired police officer, Volkringhausen, Germany In the party\u2019s manifesto, the document said the new system would prioritise those who 1) Have a good grasp of English 2) Have been law-abiding citizens in their own countries 3) Have good education and qualifications. It also said \u201cmost people coming into the country will need a clear job offer\u201d. It does not explain how it would work to bring over family members to live in the UK, but says it would equalise the system for EU and non-EU citizens so the best guess is that the rules applying to the rest of the world would apply to family members from the EU. Q: Do they intend to maintain the marriage allowance? That is the \u00a3250 from the transferable tax allowance if one partner has income below the tax threshold? D, Wales The Conservatives made no mention of the marriage tax allowance, suggesting they would maintain it but changes can be made at any fiscal event. Both Labour and the Lib Dems have said they would axe it. Q: There has been no or little mention of Leveson two? Has this been dropped by all the parties? Anonymous, Pudsey The Tories have said they will drop Leveson two and \u201crepeal section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2014, which seeks to coerce the press\u201d. That is the clause that would force newspapers to pay both sides\u2019 costs when losing or winning defamation and privacy cases if they have not signed up to a royal charter-approved regulator. Labour says it would \u201caddress misconduct and the unresolved failures of corporate governance raised by the second stage of the abandoned Leveson inquiry\u201d. Q: Would it be of any use in the outside toilet, either for wiping, or blocking the door draughts? Chris, 71, retired headmaster, Bury St Edmunds It is quite a shiny document, so not great for absorption. But might be more useful under a door or propping up a table leg. Only 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the Tory manifesto. Send them into us here. Q: Is there five-years\u2019 worth of action in there? Is there a perception about where the Tories intend on going, as a country? Anonymous, SW Scotland Definitely not \u2013 although the manifesto does commit to repealing the Fixed-term Parliamenta Act, so it might not be five years until the next election. Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the manifesto was so empty that it would be thin for a budget let alone a multi-year programme for government. It means Johnson would undoubtedly come up with other plans for taxes, social care, and other big issues that are not in the manifesto. But in reality, a lot of a new Tory government\u2019s time is still going to be spent on sorting out Brexit, including aiming for a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020. Q: What plans have the Conservative party to eliminate people\u2019s reliance on food banks and when will they be gone? Anonymous, retired civil servant, East Yorkshire There is no mention of food banks or eliminating their use in the Tory manifesto. The prime minister was asked about this by an audience member at Friday night\u2019s Question Time debate. He said: \u201cOf course we want to deal with not just the expression of poverty but also the causes of poverty. And that means dealing with educational standing. It means spreading ambition and hope around the country by investing in education and investing in social services.\u201d Q: Does the Tory manifesto promise to address the Waspi women\u2019s pension issue and if so what measures are envisaged and at what cost? Anonymous, Carlisle No there is no promise to the Waspi women in the manifesto, unlike Labour\u2019s promise to compensate them with \u00a358bn for the rise in their pension age. Boris Johnson has said: \u201cWe have looked at it and looked at it and I would love to magic you a solution but it is very expensive to come up with the solution that you want.\u201d And this is what Jeremy Corbyn said in response to Tony Blair\u2019s claim that Labour and the Conservatives are both peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d. (See 11.27am.) Corbyn replied: I simply invite all those who are looking at it to recognise what we have put forward is a sensible, costed plan of how we can improve public services and life opportunities in this country, and develop an economy for the futures at the same time as meeting our net zero requirements for environmental sustainability. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in Derbyshire this morning when asked if his \u00a358bn promise to pay compensation to the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women meant Labour was breaking its promise to borrow only to invest. He replied: It\u2019s a moral debt we owe to these women and, had the court case gone the other way, or another court case goes against the government, the government would have to pay, the government is obliged to pay ... What we\u2019re saying is we will pay it. Here are some more of your questions answered: Q: Has the Tory manifesto been clearly costed and when will it be released for public scrutiny? I would like to read it as I don\u2019t trust the accuracy and completeness of media coverage, or sadly promises made by our current prime minister, as he has proven time and again that he lacks integrity. Anonymous, Eastbourne It is available here: https://vote.conservatives.com/our-plan Q: Has it been independently costed? Anonymous, London The Tory manifesto has been costed but not independently. Q: On BBC Question Time, Boris Johnson appeared to be wearing a \u2018hearing aid\u2019 in his right ear. If he was, presumably this was so that someone could speak to him, perhaps give him the answers. Do you know anything about this? Or was it fake news? Robert, Retired NHS surgeon, Dungannon I\u2019m afraid this was a false rumour. Johnson has a slightly unusual looking right ear that sometimes reflects the light in an odd way. There was definitely no earpiece. Some of you have been sending in your questions about the Tory manifesto. I will be answering them until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: As the proposed increase in national insurance allowance will not be of benefit to pensioners, are there any tax incentives to encourage older people to vote for the Conservatives? Anonymous, Lancashire Not really. There is the so-called triple lock that guarantees that the basic state pension will rise by a minimum of either 2.5%, the rate of inflation or average earnings growth, whichever is largest. But there is not much else and no pledge to restore free TV licences for over-75s. Q: What\u2019s happened to the national insurance threshold increase promised by Johnson? William, Portugal This was promised in the Tory manifesto. The party is saying it will raise it to \u00a39,500 next year \u2013 amounting to a tax cut of around \u00a385 per household. A longer term raising of the threshold to \u00a312,500 is planned amounting to \u00a3500 but there is no word on when this will actually happen. Q: Why couldn\u2019t Boris give a straight answer to the Guardian\u2019s question regarding factcheck? Jay, 47, Hertfordshire It can only mean he does not want to criticise the Tory fake fact-check stunt because he knows very well what the problem was and accusations are. He was asked a similar question off-camera last week, so it was obfuscation to say that he hadn\u2019t been paying attention. The Welsh Labour leader and first minister, Mark Drakeford, has described this as the most important general election since 1945. Speaking at the launch of his party\u2019s manifesto at a further education college in Wrexham, Drakeford said: I believe that when the history of our times is written, this general election will stand as a moment of profound and lasting change \u2013 a time when our nation, our economy, our public services and our planet set out on a different course. The destructive policies of the UK Conservative government have left our communities damaged, our economy one of the most unequal in Europe and the UK ill-prepared for the climate emergency it now faces. This election is the chance to put that right. Drakeford said that many of the radical policies that the UK Labour party wanted to introduce in England had already been implemented in Wales, such as free prescriptions; free school breakfasts, free hospital parking, the abolition of right to buy, keeping guards on trains and banning fracking. He said UK Labour\u2019s plans to end austerity would mean a \u00a33.4bn increase to Wales\u2019 annual budget. The party promised to revive the stalled Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project, work with people on the island of Anglesey to \u201cmaximise its potential for new nuclear energy\u201d and invest in railways. On Brexit, Drakeford made it clear that the Welsh Labour government would campaign \u201cunapologetically, unreservedly and enthusiastically to remain\u201d. He said: Three years on from the 2016 EU referendum we understand so much more about how Wales is uniquely exposed to a hardline Boris Johnson Brexit, about the devastation it would do to our manufacturing industry, about the protections it would shear from working people. About the damage it would do to individuals, business and communities the length and the breadth of Wales. He ended his speech by quoting Aneurin Bevan, who said: \u201cPrivate charity can never be a substitute for organised justice.\u201d Drakeford added: That is, at root, the choice at stake in this election. A future where those whose needs are greatest will have to rely on the cold charity of Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg. Or our view of a kinder, stronger and more sustainable UK under Labour where our people, our nation and our planet is strengthened through fairness, equality and respect. The government has announced plans for a slimmed down Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December, as Boris Johnson has said he would want to push through his Brexit bill as soon as possible if he wins a majority. Preparations are being made for a curtailed process that cuts down on ceremony, in case Johnson is the new prime minister and wants to push ahead with a second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas recess. The election is due to happen on 12 December and the results will emerge through the early hours of Friday 13 December. Parliament will then resume on Tuesday 16 December and then there would be the election of the new Speaker and several days of new MPs being sworn in. A Queen\u2019s speech would need to take place after that to allow legislation to brought forward, with the first and second readings of the Brexit bill possibly happening that week. A government spokesman said: The new parliament will be summoned to meet on Tuesday 17 December, when the business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members. Should this prime minister return, the state opening of parliament and the Queen\u2019s speech will follow on Thursday 19 December. The state opening of parliament will take place with reduced ceremonial elements, as was the case following the early general election in 2017. This is due both to the early general election and the proximity of the state opening to Christmas. If there is a change of government following the election it is anticipated that the Queen\u2019s speech would be in January on a more usual timetable; but this would be a matter for the incoming administration. Q: Where will the 50,000 nurses come from? Robert Footman, Hong Kong Boris Johnson\u2019s nurse numbers are as follows: 12,500 from abroad, 14,000 from the undergraduate route and 5,000 nurse apprentices. That leaves 18,500 who are not new nurses but nurses would otherwise have left and have been retained in the profession by various incentives. The Tories argue improving retention rates is a way of boosting nurse numbers but Labour say the headline 50,000 figure is fake. Q: Much has been made of increases to public spending to the tune of \u00a32.9bn including 50,000 nurses. With no increases in taxes or national insurance who will this be paid for? Gareth Jenkins, Pwllheli, north Wales The biggest tranche of cash for this comes from a decision to postpone a cut in corporation tax, which Johnson claims will raise \u00a36bn. Tories have in the past argued corporation tax cuts don\u2019t cost any money but Johnson has acknowledged this is not really the case. Q: Can you really trust them to deliver any of this \u2013 even the ones that appear to be socially responsible like extra nurses? Brian Robinson, 65, Bristol That is something voters are going to have to grapple with. But Johnson\u2019s record on keeping pledges has not been great even in his short time as prime minister (leaving the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d by 31 October, tax cuts for higher earners). I\u2019m Rowena Mason, deputy political editor of the Guardian, and will be answering your questions about the Tory manifesto today. I have written about Westminster politics for eight years, covering three elections and two referendums. During this election, I have been tracking the Tories since Boris Johnson\u2019s first stump speech in Birmingham and was at the party\u2019s manifesto launch in Telford on Sunday. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. The Chuka Umunna Q&amp;A is now over. This is what Umunna said in response to the question from my colleague Peter Walker about whether he thought Boris Johnson was fit to be prime minister. Umunna replied: I am worried that you can say and do the things that Boris Johnson has done and for people to simply dismiss it as a factor that is priced in in this general election. I am alarmed that somebody can spew out the range of prejudice that has flowed from his mouth during his time in public office, and lie again and again and again, and it should not be an issue in a general election. It should be an issue in a general election when you are talking about giving somebody the keys to No 10 for another five years. And so, clearly, I do not believe he is fit to be prime minister. And if you look at the things he has said and done in his behaviour, which follows the Donald Trump playbook, that should disqualify him from being able to be in office in my view. And it is a perfectly legitimate point for us to be making in this general election campaign. Umunna did not give examples of Johnson lying in his examples, but there is at least one website devoted to false and misleading things Johnson has said. For examples of Johnson\u2019s displaying prejudice, the BBC\u2019s Fiona Bruce came out with a list on Question Time on Friday. Q: Do you believe your friend Tony Blair when he says he will not be voting for you personally? (See 11.27am.) Do you think he is telling the truth? Umunna says he did not see the Blair speech. He says he accepts Blair\u2019s point about how Blair is in a special position personally. But Umunna says he thinks Blair was saying other people in the Cities of London and Westminster would be voting for him. Q: Have you been surprised by the extent to which the Lib Dem vote is being squeezed? No, says Umunna. He says this is his first election as a Lib Dem. But older hands in the party tell him they are not surprised. Umunna says he thinks there will be more tactical voting during this election than in any election since 1997. Q: You did not mention revoking article 50. Have the Lib Dems abandoned this as a plan? No, says Umunna. He says it is still the case that, if they won a majority of MPs, they would revoke article 50. But the party is also campaigning for a people\u2019s vote. And, unlike Labour, all Lib Dem MPs would be campaigning for remain. Chuka Umunna is now taking questions at the end of his speech. Q: Was it a mistake for the Lib Dems to start the campaign by saying that Jo Swinson could end up being PM? Umunna says he does not accept that. It is the Lib Dems\u2019 job to fight every seat with the intention of trying to win. It would be strange if they said anything else, he says. He says it will be for the voters to decide how many MPs the Lib Dems get. Q: Do you think Boris Johnson is fit to be PM? Umunna says he is worried that Johnson can do what he does, and it is treated as if it is \u201cpriced in\u201d. He says he is worried that Johnson can \u201clie again and again and again\u201d, and spew out racist language in his career, and that this is not a general election issue. Here are some of the main lines from Chuka Umunna\u2019s speech, from the text released by the Lib Dems in advance. Umunna, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, said Britain could become a \u201cvassal state\u201d of the US under Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. He said: From my own contacts with the US government, it is clear a high price will be demanded and close alignment with US rules and regulation demanded \u2013 we risk becoming a vassal state of the US if Boris Johnson gets a majority. Leave the EU and the UK under Johnson will become President Trump\u2019s poodle. That is what is at stake at this election. Umunna said Johnson was as populist and rightwing as Donald Trump. He said: In his words and deeds [Trump] has been unafraid to engage in bigoted, racist, sexist, and Islamophobic behaviour, lie and break the law. All the same criticisms apply to the UK\u2019s prime minister who is following the Trump playbook and has become part of this global network of populist, right-wing, authoritarian nationalists. Giving Johnson a majority is to give carte blanche to this type of politics in the UK \u2013 something which should worry us all. Umunna confirmed the Liberal Democrats were committed to spending 2% of GDP on defence. As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Today at 12.30pm, the deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, will answer your questions about the Tory manifesto, campaign and policies, just how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you. You can ask your question via our form here. Chuka Umunna, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, is giving a speech on foreign policy. There is a live feed here. Tony Blair was critical of both main parties in his speech and Q&amp;A this morning. That probably won\u2019t worry the respective party leaderships very much; Tory Brexiters and Labour Corbynites are both united in their scorn for Blair and much of what he represents, and they tend to believe that any criticism from the former PM ends up being counterproductive. Maybe with some audiences it is, but Blair can still present a political argument with a clarity that very few others can match. At one point quite recently it was assumed that Blair was hoping a new centrist party might emerge to challenge Labour. But the demise of Change UK may have killed that off as an aspiration for the foreseeable future, and one of the interesting features of the Q&amp;A was Blair\u2019s confirmation that he wants to stay in the Labour party to contribute to the debate he expects it to be having about its post-Corbyn future after the election. Here are the main points from the speech and Q&amp;A. Blair accused both the Conservatives and Labour of peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d to voters in the election campaign. (See 9.17am.) He also said in that Q&amp;A that as a result he did not think it would be good for the country for either main party to win a majority. Both as majority governments pose a risk. It\u2019s just that the chances I think of Labour doing that are - if the polls are right - negligible ... I don\u2019t think a majority government of either side is a good thing. He said there was no chance of Boris Johnson being able to negotiate a Canada-style trade deal with the EU before the end of next year. Johnson claims that this will be possible, and he says he will not extend the Brexit transition period. But Blair said a trade deal within this timeframe would only be acceptable if the UK agreed to stay aligned to the single market \u2013 an option Johnson has ruled out. (See 9.21am.) Blair said trade talks with the EU could in fact go on for years under the Tories. (See 9.22am.) This is an argument that Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon have also been making forcefully. He said a no-deal Brexit was now a \u201cprobable outcome\u201d if Johnson was telling the truth about not being willing to extend the Brexit transition. (See 8.57am.) In the Q&amp;A he also said he did not think Tory Brexiters understood how damaging a no-deal Brexit would be. He said: Within the Conservative cabinet there are people who are ardent Brexiters. They are perfectly content if Britain goes out without a deal and trades on WTO terms. Now, I think a lot of them have no idea what WTO terms really mean. And, by the way, when you talk to people in the WTO about what it means, you can see \u2013 it\u2019s a risk no serious person would take with the country\u2019s economy. He described what Labour was proposing as \u201ca revolution\u201d and implied its promises were unrealistic. (See 9.23am.) He implied that he backed tactical voting against Brexiter candidates. In his speech he said: We should look at this election seat by seat. There is one general election but 650 mini-elections and each one matters. There are good, solid mainstream, independent-minded MPs and candidates in both parties. Like many, I have been campaigning for great Labour candidates because we know parliament will be poorer without them. I am sure the same is true of the Conservative party and there are those who were expelled for their moderation also standing. The Lib Dems can\u2019t form a government; but they can play an important role in who does govern. And in his Q&amp;A he said: There will be constituencies in which the Labour party has no chance of winning and in those constituencies - if I wasn\u2019t me as it were and I was just an ordinary or a floating voter - in those constituencies yeah I\u2019d want to [vote tactically]. But he said he would be voting Labour himself - even though he understood why people in his constituency, the Cities of London and Westminster, would be voting for the Lib Dem candidate Chuka Umunna. Blair said as a former party leader he was in a special category, and he implied that he thought it was important to remain as a party member (he would get thrown out if he publicly backed a candidate from another party) because he wanted to have a say in the party\u2019s post-Corbyn future. He said: I\u2019ve said why I\u2019ve got to vote Labour - one thing, by the way, there will be an enormous debate I feel coming in the Labour party at a certain point and it\u2019s important \u2013 I\u2019m in a particular position, there\u2019s one of me. But I can understand why the people I know in the same constituency as me who will be voting for Chuka Umunna. He said that he thought the chances of an outright Labour majority were \u201cnegligible\u201d. He said British politics was chaotic, crazy and \u201cutterly dysfunctional\u201d. He said this could end up causing \u201cserious economic and social damage\u201d to the UK. (See 9.08am.) He said Britain needed to \u201cup the quality\u201d of its political discourse. In the Q&amp;A he said: One of the things, when this election is over, alongside everything is, is we\u2019ve got to up the quality of political discourse because, if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to end up with these populist waves. And what does populism do in the end? Essentially, it rides the anger. And it\u2019s actually born of pessimism. Because when you\u2019re pessimistic, you look for people to blame. On a visit to Derbyshire this morning Jeremy Corbyn met a group of Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaigners to promote the Labour plan to spend \u00a358bn to compensate them. He told them: I\u2019m very proud that we\u2019ve got that clearly in our manifesto and I\u2019ll be very proud to go into government and say: \u2018This is the policy on which we\u2019ve been elected and this is the policy that will now be carried out to right the wrong and the injustice that\u2019s been done to all of you.\u2019 I will do absolutely everything I can to make sure we win the election on December 12 and put that pledge into practice. People understand the injustice that\u2019s been done to you and the need for the country as a whole to accept the moral responsibility for putting it right. Blair is wrapping up now. He says, whatever happens, Britain is a great country. He recalls a visit to an African country recently. The president told him he was sorry for what was happening in Britain. Q: Is it getting harder and harder to stay optimistic. What are the chances this will go your way? Blair says he is naturally optimistic. But he is not sure he still is. He is worried, he says. Some days he thinks this problem will blow itself out. Other days he thinks the problems are really deep. I\u2019m clinging to optimism. But we need to think deeply as a country, he says. He says he does not think the country can go on like this for long without \u201csevere damage\u201d. People are less deferential, which is good. And they want a say, which is good. But people have to share responsibility. When this is over, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to up the quality of political discourse\u201d, he says. He says what populism does is \u201cride the anger\u201d. He says he is passionate about technology because he thinks that is an essential part of what a modern political agenda looks like. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. Q: Where is Labour facing the most difficulties? Blair says it is probably in the seats with electorates seen as working class. He says his successor in Sedgefield is facing a tough election. But when he was MP there, the Labour vote was very solid. He says when he first used to canvass there in 1983, based on his experience in London, he would knock on doors and ask people if he could count on their vote for Labour. He says people used to be offended by that; they would think he was questioning their loyalty to Labour. He says in some ways it is good that people are not as tribal as they used to be. But it has created problems for Labour, he says. Q: Is Jeremy Corbyn a fit and proper person to become prime minister? Blair says he will choose his words carefully. His differences with Corbyn are well documented, and his views have not changed. But he thinks there is a \u201cpretty negligible\u201d chance of Corbyn winning a majority. Q: You make a distinction between extremists and moderates. Where do the SNP fit in? Blair says he does not agree with the Scottish National party on Scottish independence, but he does not see them as extremists. UPDATE: Here is Blair\u2019s reply in full. I don\u2019t think campaigning for an independent Scotland is extreme. I just don\u2019t agree with it. I think the United Kingdom is stronger if we\u2019re all together, I think Scotland is better off inside the UK. But, you know, Brexit has put it back on the table again. This part of the other problem, I\u2019m afraid, is that you\u2019ve got a situation with Northern Ireland which is very tricky if the Johnson deal goes forward. You\u2019ve got a situation where obviously the Scottish nationalists now have an additional dimension to their argument. I still don\u2019t agree with it, but, you know, they\u2019re going to be saying: \u2018You\u2019ve allowed Northern Ireland to stay inside the single market, why aren\u2019t we allowed to, we also voted heavily against Brexit?\u2019 Q: What are the prospects of a trade deal with the US? Blair says trade deals are like \u201creform\u201d. Politicians always say they are in favour of both. But when it comes to the details, that is a different matter. He says anything happening in UK-US trade talks would impact on trade talks with the EU. And he says, any trade deal would have to pass Congress. He suggests he does not think that is likely. I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath on a United States trade deal. I think it\u2019s going to be really difficult. Blair is now taking questions from the audience. Q: Do you think a government of national unity is still possible? Yes, says Blair. He thinks that is a possibility. Q: If the Tories get a majority, will you give up fighting Brexit? Blair says, if the Tories get a majority and the UK leaves on 31 January, we are going to have to make it work. But he says at that point there will still be an argument to be had about Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. Blair says some in the Tory cabinet would support a WTO Brexit (ie, a no-deal Brexit, with the UK trading on World Trade Organisation terms). He says he does not think they understand what it would be like. He has spoken to the WTO about this, he says. He says no serious person would advocate this for the UK. More from the Blair Q&amp;A - from the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul and HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh Tony Blair is now taking questions from Alex Threlfall from Reuters. Blair said that he would be voting Labour at the election. He said the Lib Dem Chuka Umunna is a candidate in the constituency where he lives (Cities of London and Westminster). Blair said he understood why people might want to vote for Umunna, but he said his position as a former Labour leader meant that he was in a special position. He implied that he thought it was important for him to remain in the Labour party (he would be thrown out if he publicly backed a candidate for another party) because he wanted a say in what would happen to the party next. Blair ended his speech by saying he expects the next parliament to agree to a second referendum at some point. Once we acknowledge all the above, and vote accordingly, yes untying the knot will take longer. The new parliament will be obliged to let the country decide Brexit on its merits, in a referendum, whether in the light of what we now know, we want to proceed with exit from Europe and if so, on what basis. And then we will have a fresh election to decide who governs. This is counterintuitive. It will be resisted with all the force that the extremes can muster \u2013 extremes whose narrative runs through much of our present politics and media, reinforced by the scourge of social media, but the alternative is a choice between two risks whose consequences we live with for a long time. He also said he hoped that at some point in the future someone would rebuild \u201cthe sensible mainstream\u201d in British politics. This is a moment to set aside the fatigue; to understand we\u2019re taking a decision not just about a government but about a future. So, we should think deeply. Then, at some later point, and not too later, we must set about the urgent task of reconstructing the sensible mainstream of British politics. Otherwise, this laboratory experiment in populism running riot will end very badly for our nation. Blair said he had been campaigning for \u201cgreat Labour candidates\u201d. There are good, solid mainstream, independent-minded MPs and candidates in both parties. Like many, I have been campaigning for great Labour candidates because we know parliament will be poorer without them. I am sure the same is true of the Conservative party and there are those who were expelled for their moderation also standing. Blair also criticised Labour\u2019s platform. The Labour party manifesto is heralded by its leadership as the most radical ever. This is true. It promises a revolution; and if implemented it would indeed amount to one. I won\u2019t go through the list of spending pledges, but they\u2019re combined with renationalisation, repeal of union laws, new taxes on business, taking parts of a company\u2019s shareholding into government mandated funds, a stack of new corporate and private sector regulation, and virtually every demand that any pressure group has ever submitted chucked in for good measure. The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end. Meanwhile we have a policy debate devoid of rational analysis of the real challenges facing modern developed countries: the technological revolution; reform of the public realm as well as investment in it; and the rising power of China which is the biggest geo-political shift of modern western history. Blair highlighted further problems with a Canada-style trade deal. On Canada, I learnt two things. First, the Europeans, faced now with a Johnson government, regard the Canada deal as a problematic analogy for the British deal. Trade with Britain is roughly six times that with Canada and whereas Canada is the other side of a large ocean, Britain is next door, geographically and physically linked. They are not going to allow a Brexiteer-led British government to establish a competitor with access to their market but undermining their rules. Second, despite being agreed 18 months ago, the Canada deal is not yet ratified and indeed is now facing considerable problems in various European legislatures. Should any of them block such ratification, the deal falls. The risk is obvious once this is understood. We will be back in the exact, same argument as we had over Ireland. One side of the Conservative party will be demanding we leave without a deal if Europe refuses the access we want; the other will be wanting to compromise to get that access. This could last for years. Starting with the Conservatives, Blair argues that there is no chance of Boris Johnson being able to negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020, as he claims. Brexit isn\u2019t over on 12 December, nor even on 31 January next year. We immediately begin the new phase of Brexit negotiation. Only this time, we are negotiating the future relationship of Britain with Europe, not simply the Irish border question, and without the leverage which comes from still being a member of the EU, since, legally, we will have left the union and are in the transition period supposed to last up to the end of 2020. What has become apparent in the last weeks, is that this negotiation has no chance of being concluded in that transition period. None. Except in circumstances where, as Boris Johnson effectively did in respect of Northern Ireland, we concede that Britain stays in the trading system of Europe, the single market. It is belief that this might happen which motivated Nigel Farage to threaten to stand against the Conservative party. But more likely is that a Conservative government will be obliged to go for the hard Brexit, ie, a third-country FTA [free trade agreement], like Canada, with divergence around tax, regulation and trade. This is what ministers who are pro-Brexit are already saying and the position Boris Johnson recently praised in the US. If this is so, this negotiation is going to be horrible. I have spoken to many people in Europe over the past few weeks. Not a single person believes that there is any prospect of Britain reaching agreement with Europe on this timeline if its position is divergence on rule-making. On the contrary, they assert that Europe would be vigilant to ensure there was no \u2018unfair competition\u2019, particularly around tax and regulation. Blair says both main parties in the election are peddling fantasies. The truth is: the public aren\u2019t convinced either main party deserve to win this election outright. They\u2019re peddling two sets of fantasies; and both, as majority governments, pose a risk it would be unwise for the country to take. Blair says there is \u201cunprecedented volatility\u201d in the electorate. The result is an election where, despite the headline polls, there is unprecedented volatility and indecision, born both of uncertainty in the electorate as to what they want, and uncertainty as to how on earth they get it. Blair says populism has become a feature of British politics, on the right and on the left. In June 2016 Britain was a \u201creasonably successful and influential power\u201d, he says. Now \u201cwe\u2019re a mess\u201d, he says. Our politics is utterly dysfunctional. As proof, in the latest instalment of such dysfunction, we have a Brexit general election; and in December to boot. Blair repeats an argument he has made many times before \u2013 that it was a mistake to use a general election to resolve Brexit. (He would have preferred a second referendum.) He says both main parties are campaigning on the basis that the alternative would be worse. The Conservatives calculate that they can force people to elect them, despite worry over Brexit, because Jeremy Corbyn is the alternative. The Labour party leadership calculate they can combine traditional Labour support around issues like the NHS, with remain voters who hate Brexit, despite fear about the Labour Leader. In other words, both parties want to win on the basis that whatever your dislike of what they\u2019re offering, the alternative is worse. And not forgetting the Lib Dems who, because of all this, thought they could turn a general election into a byelection. Tony Blair is starting his speech at the Reuters Newsmaker event now. He says British politics is crazy and chaotic. Britain is home to a unique political experiment. We are testing \u2013 hopefully not to destruction \u2013 whether it is possible for a major developed nation to turn its politics into chaos and survive without serious economic and social damage to its essential fabric. Round the world where political leaders are gathered, there is often a conversation about whose politics is crazier. I agree that right now the competition is fierce. But I still believe British politics is unfortunately ahead of the pack. Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, is about to make his first proper intervention during the election campaign in a speech at a Reuters Newsmaker event. According to extracts released in advance, he will say that Boris Johnson\u2019s claim about being able to get Brexit done by the end of January is a \u201cfantasy\u201d. He will say: The Conservative party say vote Tory and Brexit will be done; it will be over. They even add \u2013 do it and we can get back to dealing with the important issues. The cheek is quite breathtaking. So, having visited this debacle upon us, which has distracted us from those big issues for over three years, they now use the distraction as a reason for doing Brexit, not abandoning it. But it appeals. It is, however, a fantasy. Brexit isn\u2019t over on 12 December, nor even on 31 January next year. We immediately begin the new phase of Brexit negotiation. Blair will also say that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is back on the table because Johnson says he would not agree to extending the Brexit transition beyond the end of next year. Many trade experts think agreeing a UK-EU trade deal before then will not be possible. Blair will say: Yet though Brexit is a distraction, it is also the vital determinant of the nation\u2019s future. It remains the single most important decision since 1945. Because of its effect on the economy, it impacts every one of the non-Brexit promises the parties are making. Doing it matters. How it is done matters. And exhaustion is not the frame of mind in which to do it. No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it. When people hear the phrase no deal, they often think we just mean failure to agree; which in Brexiteer language means we haven\u2019t surrendered. What it really means is throwing our economy off a cliff and hoping it finds a parachute on the way down. It is a risk no responsible leader would take. Yet we may be about to empower a leader \u2013 Boris Johnson \u2013 to take such a risk. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, has just been on the Today programme talking about Labour\u2019s plans to protect renters. Echoing arguments he used in his earlier interview (see 7.39am), he said that this was a market that was \u201cclearly failing\u201d and that tighter rules were required. When it was put to him that strengthening protections for tenants might make landlords less willing to rent, he said that in Germany regulation of this market was stronger, but the size of the rental market was also much bigger. Healey was also asked why Labour was now committed to spending \u00a358bn compensating women who lost out from the sharp increase in the state pension age. This plan was not in Labour\u2019s manifesto, and the cost was not included in the costings document that was published alongside the manifesto. Labour says it will raise the \u00a358bn from borrowing. When it was put to Healey that this plan contravened Labour\u2019s promise to borrow only to invest, he said this was not normal government spending. It was a \u201cone-off compensation payment\u201d, he said. He said even if the Conservatives won the election, they might end up having to pay compensation like this if they lose a legal challenge. UPDATE: A reader has been in touch to say that there is a reference in the Labour manifesto (pdf) to compensating the Waspi women. That\u2019s true. What was not in the manifesto was the scale of the commitment, or the cost. For the record, this is what the manifesto says: Under the Tories, 400,000 pensioners have been pushed into poverty and a generation of women born in the 1950s have had their pension age changed without fair notification. This betrayal left millions of women with no time to make alternative plans \u2013 with sometimes devastating personal consequences. Labour recognises this injustice, and will work with these women to design a system of recompense for the losses and insecurity they have suffered. Nicky Morgan has defended the Conservative manifesto for what critics have termed a lack of ambition and content, saying voters wanted to see \u201crealistic policies\u201d. The culture secretary was sent out on the important post-manifesto launch broadcast round, even though she is herself not standing as an MP. Morgan said last month she was not contesting her Loughborough seat again for family reasons. Asked on BBC1\u2019s Breakfast programme about the seemingly limited approach of the manifesto, she said: I think what people do want to see from the parties, on the doorstep, is realistic policies \u2013 identifying what their priorities are but also being realistic and responsible about how we are going to pay for it. She defended Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to avoid difficult and potentially politically tricky decisions on long-term social care, saying a consensus approach was needed. \u201cSocial care is a long-term issue that could only be resolved by getting different parties together to reach a consensus on how that happens,\u201d she said. She did, however, readily concede that the 50,000 \u201cnew\u201d nurses initially billed in the manifesto included elements such as better retention of existing staff. Morgan said the number would be reached over 10 years \u2013 some reports said her Tory party handlers meant her to say five years. She said: \u201cThe commitment is 50,000 more nurses. By the end of 10 years there will be 50,000 more nurses in the NHS than there are now. And you\u2019re absolutely right to say this will happen in a variety of different ways.\u201d Amid reports of a major U-turn, she added that the Tories \u201cgot rid\u201d of the nursing bursary because it was putting a cap on the places available for people wanting to go into the profession. What we\u2019re bringing back, or introducing, is a maintenance grant. People understand we will make changes. And I know, as a minister, you make a decision and then actually you see what happens, you actually make the decision, you then have to rework that or to do something a bit different to deal with that issue. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has described the \u201cthe lack of significant policy action\u201d within the Conservative manifesto as \u201cremarkable\u201d and would \u201cbake in\u201d the day-to-day budget cuts of the last decade. Questioned over whether she thought the IFS analysis was damning, the outgoing parliamentarian said: The IFS also confirm there is more money going into public spending and I think they say the age of austerity is over. People want realistic promises identifying what their priorities are. But also being responsible about how we are going to pay for it. So yes, there is a stark contrast between the Conservative position of managing our economy well, setting out clearly how we are going to pay for things, and the Labour party position which is just we\u2019ll spray money around. On Labour\u2019s promise to give backdated pension payments to almost 4 million women, Morgan said: \u201cIts a very difficult situation, but its also very expensive to resolve. There isn\u2019t the money available.\u201d The Conservative party has pledged to allocate an extra \u00a31bn in funding each year for the ailing social care sector while guaranteeing that no one should have to sell their home to pay for care. In its manifesto, the party pledges to \u201cbuild a cross-party consensus\u201d on how it should be funded in the long term. However, Sally Warren, the director of policy at the King\u2019s Fund, has said the pledge is \u201ca couple of billion pounds short a year\u201d of what the sector needs. The former director of social care policy at the Department of Health told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: The money we\u2019ve seen from the Conservatives yesterday is not going to be enough to continue to meet demographic pressures as our population ages over the next five years. So the money isn\u2019t enough and all the money would be doing would be to continue funding the current system, and that current system is widely seen to be very unfair for people who need to use it, and it has been struggling to be able to have enough funding to deliver high quality care. We do need a fundamental reform of the system. The Conservatives have been promising a green paper for more than two and a half years. That green paper could have started a process of seeking consensus and they haven\u2019t yet published such green paper. On how big the gap between the Tories\u2019 promise and the amount needed to help the sector, Warren added: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a couple of billion pounds short a year.\u201d Meanwhile, Andrew Dilnot, former chair of the Commission on Funding of Care and Support, has said he believes cross-party legislation on social care \u201ccan be done\u201d. Also speaking to the Today programme, he said: \u201cI think the main difficulty here is that politicians, for reasons I don\u2019t fully understand, just have found it hard to get something across the line here.\u201d He added that since 1997 all parties have found it hard to get social care legislation through. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that there is enough energy around this now and that there is a real commitment to getting a cross-party consensus \u2026 As I say, I think that can be done, it does just require political will.\u201d But he sounded a note of caution: \u201cUntil we find a better way of getting money to local authorities for this, we will have a challenge.\u201d There\u2019s further reaction to Labour\u2019s proposals, as outlined earlier by the party\u2019s shadow housing minister, John Healey . Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: For decades renters have had to live with the fear of being evicted from their home for no reason, with damaging consequences particularly for families with children and the elderly. This election marks a major step forward in the battle to secure basic protections for those who rent, as Labour and the Conservatives have made clear that they will scrap this outrageous practice, and give renters the security and stability they deserve.\u201d However, the Residential Landlords Association has claimed Labour\u2019s plans would cause \u201ca serious rental housing crisis\u201d. David Smith, policy director for the landlords\u2019 organisation, said: These proposals have not been thought through. We have been at the forefront of wanting to drive criminal landlords out of the market, but to place such ill-thought out burdens on the majority of good landlords would lead to a serious rental housing crisis, which would only hurt tenants as they struggle to find a place to live. The sector does not need new obligations, but better enforcement of those that already exist. We hope that should Labour come to power they will work with us to bring in proposals that would better protect tenants against criminal landlords whilst still encouraging good landlords to invest in the supply that is needed to meet demand. Meanwhile, the Residential Landlords Association has welcomed the Conservative party\u2019s housing policy proposals. Its policy director, David Smith, said: We agree that the system for repossessing properties is in need of reform and support the Conservatives\u2019 proposals to [strengthen] the possession rights of good landlords. It is vital that the reforms are got right. At present it can take over five months for a landlord to repossess a property through the courts in legitimate circumstances. We will be keen to work with ministers to establish a new system of repossession rights and the establishment of a dedicated housing court to ensure good landlords and tenants can secure justice swiftly in the minority of cases where something goes wrong. It is disappointing that there is no mention of reversing some of the tax changes hitting landlords which have resulted in a drop in investment in the market making it more difficult for tenants to find the housing they want. Longer tenancies for tenants will be meaningless without landlords entering and staying in the market long term. You can read more on the Tories\u2019 policies here: People buying fridge freezers have greater consumer rights than private renters, Labour\u2019s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has said as he promises more rights for renters. The party is proposing independent yearly checks on properties, inspecting things such as gas, electricity and damp, along with the introduction of rent increases capped at inflation as part of a charter of rights for private renters The Residential Landlords Association have warned it could drive their members out of the business, but Healey said the purpose of the reforms and introduction of \u201ctougher sanctions\u201d was to drive bad landlords out of the business. He told BBC Breakfast: For too long, certainly over the past decade, the government has allowed rogue landlords to flourish and so its time to make the market fairer for renters and for the government to act. Questioned over whether Labour would overcomplicate the market, Healey said: We have more rights as consumers when we rent a car or buy a fridge-freezer, we have more protections as consumers in other markets. When one-in-four rental properties in this country aren\u2019t even decent, they\u2019re damp, in disrepair, some are unsafe, these are standards we can\u2019t allow to go on for longer. This is about making all properties and all landlords operate to the standards that most already do. They are standards which are commonplace in other countries. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to do this. Healey added that Labour\u2019s plans to compensate millions of women who lost out on years of state pensions would be a \u201cone-off compensation payment\u201d paid for from government contingency funds. \u201cThis rights a historic injustice,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had been planning for retirement and had it disrupted at no notice.\u201d The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has criticised Labour\u2019s promise to compensate more than 3 million women who lost out on years of state pension payments when their retirement age was raised after the party announced the plan late on Saturday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Paul Johnson said the policy\u2019s estimated cost of \u00a358bn is \u201ca very, very large sum of money indeed\u201d and claimed Labour would need higher tax rises than those already slated to cover it. I think there are two interesting things about that \u2013 one is the sheer scale of it, and of course it immediately breaks the promises they made in their manifesto just last week only to borrow to invest. So, they would need even more than their \u00a380bn tax rises if they wanted to cover that. The other, I suppose, is just a statement of priorities or decisive lack of priorities, because there\u2019s so much money for so many things, but they\u2019re not finding money, for example, to reverse the welfare cuts for genuinely poor people of working wage. Whilst some of these Waspi women really have suffered hardship as a result of not realising that this pension age increase is happening, although it was announced back in the early 1990s, many of them are actually quite well off. Larry Elliott has this assessment of the Conservative manifesto. Take no chances. Make no mistakes. Maintain strict message discipline. Like a football team two up with 20 minutes to play, the Conservatives think the only way they can lose the election is if they throw it away. The contrast between the manifesto launched by Boris Johnson and Labour\u2019s last week was marked. Behind in the polls and with only three weeks to go before election day, Jeremy Corbyn has gambled that voters are ready for radicalism. In sporting terms, he has thrown on three strikers as subs and sent his centre half up from the back in the hope of getting back in the game. The prime minister, by contrast, is seeking to run down the clock until 12 December, relying on the fact that his \u201cget Brexit done\u201d line has cut through. Things started to go pear-shaped for Theresa May in 2017 when her manifesto plans for social care were dubbed a \u201cdementia tax\u201d. This time, the Conservatives have said the answer is to build a long-term, cross-party consensus. Johnson\u2019s pitch throughout the campaign has been that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will unleash a wave of pent-up investment and, by ending the uncertainty, lead to faster economic growth. But there is no guarantee that this will happen, particularly since even if Brexit does go ahead on 31 January, the rest of 2020 will be spent trying to conclude a trade deal with the EU before the transition period ends. The forecasts for growth and borrowing that will be provided by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility for the budget that will take place once the election is over will not make pretty reading. So while Johnson was upbeat at the manifesto launch, the document itself was a much more cautious affair. The papers on the Tory manifesto Jeremy Corbyn will be in the East Midlands today talking about the housing crisis, as Labour prepares to announce a plan to compel property developers to meet the costs of building at least 50,000 discounted homes as part of a package of measures to help renters and first-time buyers. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has drawn up proposals to allow local authorities to use the planning process to force developers to build a certain number of properties to be earmarked for local first-time buyers. These would be sold at a discount of up to 50% on the local market rate, with the size of the reduction dependent on the gap between earnings and house prices in the local area \u2013 and the local authority could choose to target them at key workers such as nurses or teachers. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s politics news. Yesterday the Tories launched their election manifesto. You\u2019d be forgiven for having missed it, indeed that might have been the point, coming out, as it did, on a Sunday afternoon, but we\u2019ve got a full wrap of what it contained and reaction to it. John Crace suggests the Conservatives may have been employing a \u201ctake out the trash day\u201d strategy, by launching their manifesto on a Sunday, \u201ca day when almost everyone would either be watching football, Sir David Attenborough or Countryfile\u201d. Crace writes the Tories managed to deliver \u201ca manifesto with almost nothing in it\u201d. The plan is conspicuous for its lack of eye-catching policies, with Larry Elliott writing that Johnson is \u201cseeking to run down the clock\u201d with a \u201ccautious, tepid manifesto\u201d. One thing it does tell us is the stark difference between the public spending plans outlined by the two parties, with Johnson promising to fork out \u00a32.9bn more a year against the \u00a383bn outlined by Jeremy Corbyn. Among the headline promises is that the Conservatives would deliver 50,000 nurses, a line that we have factchecked and found somewhat wanting.",

The Disney film made $358 (\u00a3277m) in its first three days of cinema release in 37 countries including the US, China and the UK. The second chapter of the film, centred on sisters Elsa and Anna, beat the box office record set in June by Toy Story 4, which opened to $240.9m worldwide and was made by Disney-owned studio Pixar. The film also surpassed the first Frozen film, which made $110.6m on its opening weekend in 2013. Frozen, which spawned musical hits such as Let it Go, went on to gross $1.27bn making it the biggest animated film of all time. \u201cWe are definitely thrilled,\u201d said Cathleen Taff, Disney\u2019s president of theatrical distribution. \u201cIt is not easy to follow up the original Frozen.

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe term \u2018cricket tragic\u2019 is often heard in Australia. I consider myself to be more of a cricket melodramatic \u2013 basically a tragic, but with the occasional bout of euphoria thrown in.\u201d These are not words you might expect to read on an <a href=\"https://blogs.fco.gov.uk/tonybrennan/2015/08/12/hows-that/\" title=\"\">official web page</a> of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). But then the author of those words, my friend Tony Brennan, who has died aged 53 after suffering from cancer, was an unexpected kind of diplomat.</p> <p>A career that took in senior posts on three continents \u2013 deputy high commissioner in Australia, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Sudan, and adviser (on secondment) in the office of the Czech president, among other important roles \u2013 never suppressed his warmth and generosity, nor ruled out the pursuit of other passions: comedy and, indeed, cricket.</p> <p>Tony was born in London, to Australian parents, Kevin Brennan, an actor, and his wife, Edna (nee Pearce, and known as Eddie). His older brother, Martin, had been born three years earlier. After school at Latymer Upper in west London, in 1985 Tony went to Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied maths \u2013 some of the time.</p> <p>There he became a driving (if unassuming) force in the emergence of a new generation of comedians and performers, launching a comedy club, the <a href=\"https://www.oxfordrevue.org/\" title=\"\">Oxford Revue Workshop</a>, in the cellar of the Oxford Union modelled not on the exclusive society feel of Footlights but on the more progressive clubs that had been growing in London for the previous decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8db23b5d0c852adb9961d40a4ec27186941940b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8db23b5d0c852adb9961d40a4ec27186941940b/0_4_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Brennan keeping wicket for his team, the Dik Diks \u2013 named after the deer-like creature \u2013 in Kenya.

A Masai tribesman is batting</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Artists such as Armando Iannucci, David Schneider, Richard Herring, Stewart Lee, Sally Phillips, Emma Kennedy and Al Murray all made their first regular appearances there and benefited from the energy and imagination Tony displayed during the 1980s. People involved made friends that were to last a lifetime in the supportive atmosphere Tony subtly engineered.</p> <p>After a brief period working for the technology group IBM and two stints for Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), Tony joined the FCO in 1994. In Prague, working as first secretary in the British embassy, he met Marketa Mullerova, whom he was to marry in 2005. Their son, Nico, was born in Australia in 2013.</p> <p>While head of the FCO\u2019s Zimbabwe section (2002-04), Tony was in the right place at the right time to help the international cricketer <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/49606960\" title=\"\">Henry Olonga</a> escape the threat of arrest and reach safety in the UK.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe term \u2018cricket tragic\u2019 is often heard in Australia. I consider myself to be more of a cricket melodramatic \u2013 basically a tragic, but with the occasional bout of euphoria thrown in.\u201d These are not words you might expect to read on an official web page of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). But then the author of those words, my friend Tony Brennan, who has died aged 53 after suffering from cancer, was an unexpected kind of diplomat. A career that took in senior posts on three continents \u2013 deputy high commissioner in Australia, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Sudan, and adviser (on secondment) in the office of the Czech president, among other important roles \u2013 never suppressed his warmth and generosity, nor ruled out the pursuit of other passions: comedy and, indeed, cricket. Tony was born in London, to Australian parents, Kevin Brennan, an actor, and his wife, Edna (nee Pearce, and known as Eddie). His older brother, Martin, had been born three years earlier. After school at Latymer Upper in west London, in 1985 Tony went to Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied maths \u2013 some of the time. There he became a driving (if unassuming) force in the emergence of a new generation of comedians and performers, launching a comedy club, the Oxford Revue Workshop, in the cellar of the Oxford Union modelled not on the exclusive society feel of Footlights but on the more progressive clubs that had been growing in London for the previous decade. Artists such as Armando Iannucci, David Schneider, Richard Herring, Stewart Lee, Sally Phillips, Emma Kennedy and Al Murray all made their first regular appearances there and benefited from the energy and imagination Tony displayed during the 1980s. People involved made friends that were to last a lifetime in the supportive atmosphere Tony subtly engineered. After a brief period working for the technology group IBM and two stints for Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), Tony joined the FCO in 1994. In Prague, working as first secretary in the British embassy, he met Marketa Mullerova, whom he was to marry in 2005. Their son, Nico, was born in Australia in 2013. While head of the FCO\u2019s Zimbabwe section (2002-04), Tony was in the right place at the right time to help the international cricketer Henry Olonga escape the threat of arrest and reach safety in the UK. They played cricket together in due course and attended each other\u2019s weddings. In Australia Tony was first diagnosed with the uveal melanoma that was ultimately to prove fatal. Even here, though, the potential for comedy could not be denied. As he observed to the surgeon who was about to remove the affected eye, admiring the instruments on display in the operating theatre: \u201cBe careful, you could have someone\u2019s eye out with that lot.\u201d He had been performing as a standup while in Canberra. Tony had been due to take up the post of ambassador to Slovakia this autumn. According to his former FCO colleague Tom Fletcher: \u201cTony would say that he would never make the world\u2019s greatest cricketer, comedian or diplomat. But I have no doubt that he was the world\u2019s greatest cricket-playing comedian diplomat.\u201d He is survived by Marketa and Nico, and by Eddie, Martin and his nieces, Hannah, Lauren and Caitlin.",

In an age when we no longer like billionaires, the queen\u2019s net worth is \u00a320bn. If the old are to be blamed for Brexit, they also support the monarchy, which, according to YouGov polls, only 41% of 18-to-24-year-olds do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/monarchy-is-corrupt-bring-down-house-of-windsor-royal-wedding\">\u2018Essentially, the monarchy is corrupt\u2019 \u2013 will republicanism survive Harry and Meghan?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Power tends to shapeshift and if a new country is struggling to be born out of this election and the broken political system that has produced it, then at some point dots need to be joined.

At one stage, I went to lots of meetings about republicanism and dry constitutional shakedowns and I was patronised by experts who told me Diana\u2019s disruption was not the right kind: she was disturbing the narrative by not accepting its rules, that Charles could have an affair. The way to get rid of the monarchy had to be highbrow and political; it should never be personal. Or, actually, cultural. By then we were all ready to embrace Blairite meritocracy, at a time, ironically, when social mobility had stalled. The tabloid press was locked into a symbiotic relationship with the royals, which meant the monarchy had to operate absolutely as an embodiment of virtue/vice and as a soap opera of dysfunction. What it cannot survive now is indifference. So here is Prince Andrew, essentially dethroned. His sin was not his inhumanity, but giving an interview about his inhumanity. Remember that when you start defending his mother. Meanwhile, Meghan has been treated as a villain for combining princessiness with stardom and being biracial. If the monarchy is supposed to represent this deeply divided country, its representatives are failing dismally, unless you count owning half of Scotland. In an age when we no longer like billionaires, the queen\u2019s net worth is \u00a320bn. If the old are to be blamed for Brexit, they also support the monarchy, which, according to YouGov polls, only 41% of 18-to-24-year-olds do. Power tends to shapeshift and if a new country is struggling to be born out of this election and the broken political system that has produced it, then at some point dots need to be joined. Andrew was not one bad apple. He comes from an orchard that produces them. The undeserving rich. When the Queen goes we could decide to grow up, become a mature democracy and move into a world that is truly post-empire. The pretence of a United Kingdom could give way to something truly great. We could, finally, get up off our knees.",

      "bodyText": "Ed Douglas is correct to observe that the impact that burning has on how quickly water runs off the moors is contested (Country diary, 22 November). Anti-shooting activists claim, without merit, that grouse moors are responsible for flooding. Flooding expert Prof Jeremy Purseglove is on record saying there is \u201cno direct evidence that grouse moor management causes flooding\u201d and that \u201covergrazing and a lack of trees in the catchments are a much greater problem\u201d. While it is true that the government gave grants to moorland managers to cut thousands of kilometres of drainage ditches (to improve sheep grazing) across the north of England, which will have had negative consequences for flooding, this was not a particular issue in the Peak District where the River Don originates. Moorland Association members have worked with Moors for the Future Partnership and others to re-profile eroding gulleys, re-vegetate the bare peat and reintroduce sphagnum moss \u2013 the \u201cking of the bog\u201d \u2013 to the moors after it was killed off due to historical atmospheric pollution. Sphagnum moss protects the underlying peat, slows the flow, filters the water and holds 20 times its own weight in water, reducing the risk of flooding. However, in order to inoculate the peat with Sphagnum moss we have to clear some of the thick surface vegetation, on limited occasions through carefully controlled burning. A presumptive ban on all burning thus has the potential to hinder our members\u2019 efforts to prevent flooding and also the ability to mitigate the damage from wildfire, another catastrophic environmental disaster. Not, therefore, \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d as Mr Douglas suggests.

      "bodyText": "The head of the world\u2019s chemical weapons watchdog has defended its conclusion that chlorine was used in an attack in Syria in April 2018, after a whistleblower alleged the report misrepresented some of the facts amid Russian claims that the watchdog is being politicised by the west. WikiLeaks at the weekend published an email from a member of the fact-finding team that investigated the attack which accused the body of altering the original findings of investigators to make evidence of a chemical attack seem more conclusive. After the attack on 7 April 2018 in the suburb of Damascus, the US, France and Britain launched missile attacks on suspected chemical weapons facilities run by President Bashar al Assad\u2019s army. Russia and Assad have always denied a chemical attack occurred, saying it was probably staged by UK intelligence. Alexander Shulgin, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) at its annual forum in the Hague, said the official report into the attack was \u201cdistorting reality\u201d. The OPCW director general, Fernando Arias, defended the report, telling member countries: \u201cthe nature of any thorough inquiry for individuals in a team to express subjective views.

Annabel Goldie, the defence minister, said the UK also had full confidence in the hardworking women and men of the OPCW technical secretariat, adding Britain was confident they \u201cwould continue to work professionally thoroughly and impartially.\u201d Shulgin, citing an email from a member of the investigating team dated June 2018 and an earlier document, questioned the conclusion by the OPCW in March 2019 that chlorine was used in Douma. The leaked email by an investigator described as \u201cAlex\u201d and quoted by WikiLeaks expresses the \u201cgravest concern\u201d, saying the OPCW report \u201cmisrepresents the facts\u201d, contains \u201cunintended bias\u201d and simplifies conclusions. The email says the published OPCW report into the attack changed the language on the levels of chlorine allegedly found compared with what investigators had originally wrote. It also questions whether or not the chemical came from barrels found at the scene, and whether those barrels had been dropped from the air \u2013 which would indicate Assad\u2019s forces \u2013 or placed there manually there \u2013 which would indicate it was staged by Syrian rebels.

We were very invested in the movie; it spoke to everyone in the room.

In response, Vue and Showcase cinemas have withdrawn the film. </p> <p>My first thought when I heard this was: \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d The film never suggests that being in a gang is a good idea. In its tragic depiction of the loss of innocence and the trauma inflicted on communities, Blue Story is told with an energy and clarity that spring from the personal experience of the director, Andrew Onwubolu \u2013 AKA Rapman. Banning it is at best an overreaction and at worst a dismissal of its core message: that while it\u2019s incredibly easy for good kids to lose their way and fall into a needless eye-for-an-eye cycle of violence and retaliation, and extremely hard to get out, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.</p> <p>As police investigate the awful incident in Birmingham, I can only echo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealRapman/status/1198644630008598529/photo/1\" title=\"\">Rapman\u2019s measured reaction</a> in hoping that blame is ultimately placed with the individuals. At the time of writing, West Midlands police have not established any connection with the film, nor did they recommend a ban, details woefully glossed over in much of the media coverage. Four out of the five people so far arrested (now bailed) are too young to have got into a 15-rated film, and it remains unclear how and why the fight broke out and what they were there to watch. It therefore makes little sense that Vue decided there was a causal link to Blue Story. It needs to seriously ask why it was quick to make one.</p> <p>More than anything, I\u2019m gutted for the creators. It is hard to overstate how important a moment this is for black British film-making. The film\u2019s release should have been a celebration. It is a shame that this incident not only cut opening box office figures, but is now dominating the narrative.</p> <p>There has long been a dearth of homegrown representation on the big screen to help us make sense of our violent times. That this unfortunate incident coincided with Blue Story\u2019s opening weekend demonstrates, in the most compelling way possible (albeit with distressing irony), precisely why people need to see it.</p>",

It is hard to overstate how important a moment this is for black British film-making. The film\u2019s release should have been a celebration. It is a shame that this incident not only cut opening box office figures, but is now dominating the narrative. There has long been a dearth of homegrown representation on the big screen to help us make sense of our violent times. That this unfortunate incident coincided with Blue Story\u2019s opening weekend demonstrates, in the most compelling way possible (albeit with distressing irony), precisely why people need to see it.",

      "body": "<p>Campaign groups have urged regulators to protect music and sports fans from the threat of rip-off prices after eBay agreed to sell StubHub, its ticketing business, to the Swiss ticket reseller Viagogo in a $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) deal.</p> <p>Viagogo has been criticized for driving up ticket prices for top-selling shows and sports events. Hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/16/hamilton-west-end-tickets-found-on-resale-sites-viagogo-despite-anti-tout-measures\">tickets for the musical Hamilton</a> opened for sale in London in 2017, Viagogo was advertising tickets for resale at between \u00a3999 ($1,300) and \u00a32,500 ($3,200) each.</p> <p>The consumer campaign group Which? said UK fans should be alarmed at the prospect of consolidation in the secondary ticketing industry.</p> <p>\u201cViagogo has a long history of ripping off music and sports fans,\u201d said Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which? \u201cSo any move to increase its grip on the secondary ticketing sector is likely to be a worry for consumers. The regulator should closely examine this deal and the impact it could have on competition in the sector to ensure consumers do not lose out.\u201d</p> <p>FanFair Alliance, a group backed by the management of bands including Arctic Monkeys and Mumford &amp; Sons, said it would be flagging the deal to regulators and politicians in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThis feels like a desperate move from both parties. However, news of this acquisition should be a major concern for both audiences and music businesses,\u201d said Adam Webb, campaign manager at FanFair Alliance. \u201cFanFair will be writing to UK regulators and politicians today, and we reiterate our advice to music fans to avoid these sites.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, an investigation by the Guardian revealed that Viagogo was among resale sites exploiting alliances with powerful and prolific ticket touts able to harvest thousands of tickets at the expense of fans.</p> <p>It has since provoked outrage among fans, campaigners and British politicians over some of its business practices. These include profiting from the resale of tickets to charity events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/05/viagogo-refusal-speak-mps-in-house-commons-gross-discourtesy\">failing to attend</a> two evidence sessions held by MPs, advertising seats despite the risk that buyers might be turned away at the door and failing to provide sufficient detail about what consumers are buying and who they are buying from.</p> <p>Google blocked Viagogo from appearing in paid-for search results worldwide earlier this year, in the light of a series of regulatory investigations into the company\u2019s treatment of consumers in several countries. The ban has resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/06/number-of-viagogo-customers-dives-after-google-ad-ban\">significant fall in traffic to the website</a>.</p> <p>Ebay, the online marketplace, has owned StubHub since 2007 when it bought the business for $310m. StubHub was founded in San Francisco in 2000 by Eric Baker \u2013 the founder and CEO of Viagogo \u2013 and Jeff Fluhr.</p> <p>Speaking on Monday, Baker said it had been a longstanding wish to unite both companies, adding that the deal would benefit fans.</p> <p>\u201cBuyers will have a wider choice of tickets, and sellers will have a wider network of buyers,\u201d he said. \u201cBringing these two companies together creates a win-win for fans \u2013 more choice and better pricing.</p> <p>\u201cIt has long been my wish to unite the two companies. I am so proud of how StubHub has grown over the years and excited about the possibilities for our shared future.\u201d</p> <p>New York\u2019s attorney general has also criticized StubHub and its rivals. In a 2016 report he labelled ticket reselling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/new-york-ebay-stubhub-broadway-ticket-scam\">\u201crigged game\u201d </a>where professional brokers use \u201cbots\u201d to snap up thousands of tickets illegally, then mark up prices by an average of 49%, and as much as 7,000%. In one example cited by the attorney general, a scalper bought more than 1,000 tickets in less than a minute for one U2 show at Madison Square Garden. StubHub said at the time it had a \u201clong history\u201d of working with the New York attorney general\u2019s office on \u201cspecific issues as they arise\u201d.</p> <p>StubHub is the largest resale ticket marketplace in the US, with about $1.1bn in net transaction revenue in 2018, according to eBay filings. Viagogo, a private company, is larger outside the US.</p> <p>Katie O\u2019Leary, campaign lead of consumer group Face-value Alliance for Ticketing, called the deal \u201calarming\u201d and said it would give the combined entity \u201can even greater stronghold in the secondary ticketing market\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cViagogo claim this will create a \u2018win-win for fans\u2019, but further consolidation in the secondary ticketing market would most likely restrict competition, and further negatively impact fans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope that regulators will have consumers\u2019 best interests at heart when considering this deal, and consider not only the question of Viagogo\u2019s increased dominance but also whether they can be considered a fit and proper owner.\u201d</p> <p>The Swiss-based company has been targeted by the Competition and Market Authority, which ordered it to display clearer information about the face value of its tickets sold on its website and threatened to bring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/04/cma-seeks-to-find-viagogo-in-contempt-of-court\">contempt of court proceedings.</a> However, the competition watchdog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/sep/05/watchdog-drops-viagogo-legal-case-after-changes-on-resale-site\">recently suspended the court proceedings</a>, saying the company had made changes that addressed concerns the site was flouting laws designed to protect UK consumers.</p> <p>The deal comes nearly a year after eBay came under pressure from activist investors to hive off some of its businesses.</p> <p>In January, activist investors Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value had urged eBay to sell its ticket sales business and eBay Classifieds Group as part of a plan that could double the company\u2019s value.</p> <p>Following the activist investors\u2019 request, eBay made changes to its board of directors in March. It announced a review of its StubHub and eBay Classifieds businesses as part of an agreement with activist investors to avert a proxy contest.</p> <p>Shares of eBay were up nearly 3% at $36.02 in early trade on Monday.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this story</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Campaign groups have urged regulators to protect music and sports fans from the threat of rip-off prices after eBay agreed to sell StubHub, its ticketing business, to the Swiss ticket reseller Viagogo in a $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) deal. Viagogo has been criticized for driving up ticket prices for top-selling shows and sports events. Hours after tickets for the musical Hamilton opened for sale in London in 2017, Viagogo was advertising tickets for resale at between \u00a3999 ($1,300) and \u00a32,500 ($3,200) each. The consumer campaign group Which? said UK fans should be alarmed at the prospect of consolidation in the secondary ticketing industry. \u201cViagogo has a long history of ripping off music and sports fans,\u201d said Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which? \u201cSo any move to increase its grip on the secondary ticketing sector is likely to be a worry for consumers. The regulator should closely examine this deal and the impact it could have on competition in the sector to ensure consumers do not lose out.\u201d FanFair Alliance, a group backed by the management of bands including Arctic Monkeys and Mumford &amp; Sons, said it would be flagging the deal to regulators and politicians in the UK. \u201cThis feels like a desperate move from both parties. However, news of this acquisition should be a major concern for both audiences and music businesses,\u201d said Adam Webb, campaign manager at FanFair Alliance. \u201cFanFair will be writing to UK regulators and politicians today, and we reiterate our advice to music fans to avoid these sites.\u201d In 2016, an investigation by the Guardian revealed that Viagogo was among resale sites exploiting alliances with powerful and prolific ticket touts able to harvest thousands of tickets at the expense of fans. It has since provoked outrage among fans, campaigners and British politicians over some of its business practices. These include profiting from the resale of tickets to charity events, failing to attend two evidence sessions held by MPs, advertising seats despite the risk that buyers might be turned away at the door and failing to provide sufficient detail about what consumers are buying and who they are buying from. Google blocked Viagogo from appearing in paid-for search results worldwide earlier this year, in the light of a series of regulatory investigations into the company\u2019s treatment of consumers in several countries. The ban has resulted in a significant fall in traffic to the website. Ebay, the online marketplace, has owned StubHub since 2007 when it bought the business for $310m. StubHub was founded in San Francisco in 2000 by Eric Baker \u2013 the founder and CEO of Viagogo \u2013 and Jeff Fluhr. Speaking on Monday, Baker said it had been a longstanding wish to unite both companies, adding that the deal would benefit fans. \u201cBuyers will have a wider choice of tickets, and sellers will have a wider network of buyers,\u201d he said. \u201cBringing these two companies together creates a win-win for fans \u2013 more choice and better pricing. \u201cIt has long been my wish to unite the two companies. I am so proud of how StubHub has grown over the years and excited about the possibilities for our shared future.\u201d New York\u2019s attorney general has also criticized StubHub and its rivals. In a 2016 report he labelled ticket reselling a \u201crigged game\u201d where professional brokers use \u201cbots\u201d to snap up thousands of tickets illegally, then mark up prices by an average of 49%, and as much as 7,000%. In one example cited by the attorney general, a scalper bought more than 1,000 tickets in less than a minute for one U2 show at Madison Square Garden. StubHub said at the time it had a \u201clong history\u201d of working with the New York attorney general\u2019s office on \u201cspecific issues as they arise\u201d. StubHub is the largest resale ticket marketplace in the US, with about $1.1bn in net transaction revenue in 2018, according to eBay filings. Viagogo, a private company, is larger outside the US. Katie O\u2019Leary, campaign lead of consumer group Face-value Alliance for Ticketing, called the deal \u201calarming\u201d and said it would give the combined entity \u201can even greater stronghold in the secondary ticketing market\u201d. \u201cViagogo claim this will create a \u2018win-win for fans\u2019, but further consolidation in the secondary ticketing market would most likely restrict competition, and further negatively impact fans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope that regulators will have consumers\u2019 best interests at heart when considering this deal, and consider not only the question of Viagogo\u2019s increased dominance but also whether they can be considered a fit and proper owner.\u201d The Swiss-based company has been targeted by the Competition and Market Authority, which ordered it to display clearer information about the face value of its tickets sold on its website and threatened to bring contempt of court proceedings. However, the competition watchdog recently suspended the court proceedings, saying the company had made changes that addressed concerns the site was flouting laws designed to protect UK consumers. The deal comes nearly a year after eBay came under pressure from activist investors to hive off some of its businesses. In January, activist investors Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value had urged eBay to sell its ticket sales business and eBay Classifieds Group as part of a plan that could double the company\u2019s value. Following the activist investors\u2019 request, eBay made changes to its board of directors in March. It announced a review of its StubHub and eBay Classifieds businesses as part of an agreement with activist investors to avert a proxy contest. Shares of eBay were up nearly 3% at $36.02 in early trade on Monday. Reuters contributed to this story",

      "body": "<p>Rugby Australia\u2019s negotiation of its next broadcast deal has got off to a shaky start with Foxtel reportedly threatening to cut ties with the sport, but the future of the game in this country will depend on the outcome of the new agreement. The outcome will make or break rugby in Australia, which is in danger of becoming a minor sport if administrators cannot secure a lucrative deal with Foxtel or rivals Optus.</p> <p>The last four years have been a nightmare for Australian rugby with the axing of the Western Force, the sacking of Israel Folau and the lack of on-field success for both the Wallabies and Super Rugby teams, culminating in an unsuccessful World Cup campaign in Japan. RA must negotiate an improved broadcast deal to ensure the viability of the code for the next five years. A bad deal would be another body blow from which the game may not recover.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/25/rugby-australia-melbourne-bledisloe-cup-host\">Melbourne to host Bledisloe Cup opener with Sydney stadiums out of action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is imperative that RA secures a significant increase in broadcast revenue, not just to keep up with the rising costs of administering and growing the game, but to contend with two key issues that threaten its status as a major sport.</p> <p>Rugby Australia has to find more money \u2013 much more \u2013 to keep key Wallabies from the clutches of rich clubs in Europe and Japan. Eight members of the Wallabies 2019 World Cup squad \u2013 Rory Arnold, Adam Coleman, Sekope Kepu, David Pocock, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Samu Kerevi and Christian Lealiifano \u2013 are heading overseas, while Nic White was selected from English club Exeter, but will return to Australia next year. Some of these players \u2013 such as Arnold, Coleman and Kerevi \u2013&#xa0;are in the prime of their careers, but will be lost to Australian rugby.</p> <p>RA also needs to strike a deal that will financially compensate Super Rugby franchises, who will lose up to 20% of their gate-takings following a reduction in the number of teams after next year. Super Rugby is a precarious business and the loss of two home games per season will place a huge financial burden on teams that are already struggling.</p> <p>So news of Foxtel\u2019s withdrawal of its offer of $20m a year would have been a major concern for rugby administrators. Of course, it may well be a negotiating tactic from Foxtel. Then again, maybe not. Earlier in the year Foxtel announced it would \u201ccut spending on non-marquee sporting content\u201d after posting a loss of $417m.</p> <p>Foxtel has been Australian rugby\u2019s principal broadcast partner since the game went professional in 1995. The Rugby Championship (previously the Tri Nations) and Super Rugby were created by Fox Sports for Fox Sports and the pay TV provider has always been very jealous of its exclusivity. The Wallabies are shown on free-to-air TV because of anti-siphoning regulations, but Super Rugby is purely a pay TV product.</p> <p>But there is another player in the game. Optus is reportedly interested in Australian rugby\u2019s broadcast rights with an offer of $30m a year. If RA called Foxtel\u2019s bluff \u2013 assuming they were bluffing \u2013 and struck a deal with Optus, they could potentially secure a more lucrative deal, which would possibly solve many problems. But there would be an element of risk in changing broadcast partners. Optus seems to have recovered from the Fifa World Cup debacle, but at least with Foxtel rugby knows what it is getting.</p> <p>Optus would potentially pay more for rugby\u2019s broadcast rights because it would attract subscribers from Foxtel, damaging their rival. But switching to Optus could also disenfranchise rugby fans who already subscribe to Foxtel and do not wish to change providers.</p> <p>No matter how much Australia\u2019s broadcast rights increase they will never match the broadcast revenue of European rugby or the corporate power of Japanese rugby. The trick for Australian rugby is to retain as many required and aspiring Wallabies as possible to maintain the competitiveness of the national and Super Rugby teams \u2013 and in an ultra-competitive global player market that requires money. Lots of it.</p> <p>If RA fails to deliver a financial windfall from the next broadcast deal, it will have to consider lowering the 60 Test threshold for overseas-based players to be eligible for the Wallabies to around 30 or even 25 caps. Or make an exemption for required overseas-based players.</p> <p>Either way, Super Rugby would be severely damaged by any flood of Test standard players to overseas clubs and that in turn could have an adverse effect on the Wallabies.

      "bodyText": "Rugby Australia\u2019s negotiation of its next broadcast deal has got off to a shaky start with Foxtel reportedly threatening to cut ties with the sport, but the future of the game in this country will depend on the outcome of the new agreement. The outcome will make or break rugby in Australia, which is in danger of becoming a minor sport if administrators cannot secure a lucrative deal with Foxtel or rivals Optus. The last four years have been a nightmare for Australian rugby with the axing of the Western Force, the sacking of Israel Folau and the lack of on-field success for both the Wallabies and Super Rugby teams, culminating in an unsuccessful World Cup campaign in Japan. RA must negotiate an improved broadcast deal to ensure the viability of the code for the next five years. A bad deal would be another body blow from which the game may not recover. It is imperative that RA secures a significant increase in broadcast revenue, not just to keep up with the rising costs of administering and growing the game, but to contend with two key issues that threaten its status as a major sport. Rugby Australia has to find more money \u2013 much more \u2013 to keep key Wallabies from the clutches of rich clubs in Europe and Japan. Eight members of the Wallabies 2019 World Cup squad \u2013 Rory Arnold, Adam Coleman, Sekope Kepu, David Pocock, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Samu Kerevi and Christian Lealiifano \u2013 are heading overseas, while Nic White was selected from English club Exeter, but will return to Australia next year. Some of these players \u2013 such as Arnold, Coleman and Kerevi \u2013 are in the prime of their careers, but will be lost to Australian rugby. RA also needs to strike a deal that will financially compensate Super Rugby franchises, who will lose up to 20% of their gate-takings following a reduction in the number of teams after next year. Super Rugby is a precarious business and the loss of two home games per season will place a huge financial burden on teams that are already struggling. So news of Foxtel\u2019s withdrawal of its offer of $20m a year would have been a major concern for rugby administrators. Of course, it may well be a negotiating tactic from Foxtel. Then again, maybe not. Earlier in the year Foxtel announced it would \u201ccut spending on non-marquee sporting content\u201d after posting a loss of $417m. Foxtel has been Australian rugby\u2019s principal broadcast partner since the game went professional in 1995. The Rugby Championship (previously the Tri Nations) and Super Rugby were created by Fox Sports for Fox Sports and the pay TV provider has always been very jealous of its exclusivity. The Wallabies are shown on free-to-air TV because of anti-siphoning regulations, but Super Rugby is purely a pay TV product. But there is another player in the game. Optus is reportedly interested in Australian rugby\u2019s broadcast rights with an offer of $30m a year. If RA called Foxtel\u2019s bluff \u2013 assuming they were bluffing \u2013 and struck a deal with Optus, they could potentially secure a more lucrative deal, which would possibly solve many problems. But there would be an element of risk in changing broadcast partners. Optus seems to have recovered from the Fifa World Cup debacle, but at least with Foxtel rugby knows what it is getting. Optus would potentially pay more for rugby\u2019s broadcast rights because it would attract subscribers from Foxtel, damaging their rival. But switching to Optus could also disenfranchise rugby fans who already subscribe to Foxtel and do not wish to change providers. No matter how much Australia\u2019s broadcast rights increase they will never match the broadcast revenue of European rugby or the corporate power of Japanese rugby. The trick for Australian rugby is to retain as many required and aspiring Wallabies as possible to maintain the competitiveness of the national and Super Rugby teams \u2013 and in an ultra-competitive global player market that requires money. Lots of it. If RA fails to deliver a financial windfall from the next broadcast deal, it will have to consider lowering the 60 Test threshold for overseas-based players to be eligible for the Wallabies to around 30 or even 25 caps. Or make an exemption for required overseas-based players. Either way, Super Rugby would be severely damaged by any flood of Test standard players to overseas clubs and that in turn could have an adverse effect on the Wallabies. But it is not just the future of the Wallabies and Super Rugby that are at stake, it\u2019s the whole game in this country from the grassroots to the elite level that is threatened. If RA wants to maintain rugby as a major sport, they need to play hardball with the broadcasters and secure the best possible deal before it\u2019s too late.",

      "bodyText": "A comprehensive review by PricewaterhouseCoopers of the Australian economy and business challenges for 2020 has found that businesses underpay workers by around $1.35bn each year. It found a major cause is the decline of unionism, which has meant policing wages is now largely left in the hands of Fair Work Australia. PwC also argues that 2020 is set to be another year of slow growth, with the falling rate of productivity growth a major concern coupled with an inability to shift to a low-emissions economy. Wage theft seems to be so commonplace in the hospitality industry that it would seem remiss for it not to be included as part of the judging of MasterChef, but the report by PwC details just how large the problem is across the entire economy. PwC\u2019s Australia Matters report estimates \u201cthere is in the order of $1.35bn in underpayments per year\u201d. The industries that see the biggest level of underpayment of worker entitlements are construction ($320m), healthcare and social assistance ($220m), accommodation and food services ($190m) and retail ($180m). PwC estimates that this accounts for around \u201c21% of the workforce in the selected industries, or 13% of the total Australian workforce\u201d. Little wonder that PwC suggest worker underpayment is \u201cone of the key risks facing businesses today\u201d and that businesses need to be asking themselves what are they doing to fix it. While PwC suggests the complexity of the industrial relation system is a factor, it argues \u201ccomplexity will not be accepted as an excuse for underpayment of entitlements. The onus is on employers to keep track of \u2013 and correctly apply \u2013 all the rules\u201d. A large reason it sees for the growth of underpayment is an underinvestment in payroll systems and processes and that \u201cthe decline of union presence in Australian workplaces has led to a decline in the policing of employee entitlements specific to particular industries\u201d. PwC notes that \u201cthe interpretation and operation of industry-specific entitlements often carry a long history\u201d. Who could have guessed removing people who are across the details of the industrial relations system being involved in the oversight of wages payment would see an increase in underpayment? It\u2019s almost like it was one of the aims of the LNP anti-union policy ... But while underpayment of workers is seen as a major issues for business on a micro level, on a broader level there are a number of challenges, according to PwC. Chief among these is that we continue to be in the new normal of slow growth. Since 1978, Australia GDP has grown each year on a per capita basis by an average of 1.7%, and yet over the past three years we have averaged less than half of that \u2013 at 0.8%. And we have now not had a three-year period of above average growth for over a decade. And we are not unique \u2013 the US, UK, Canada and the OECD as a whole have all experienced growth over the past 10 years below what was previously taken as normal: In Australia a major concern is the massive drop in the growth of productivity. It seems almost impossible, but the past three years have seen worse productivity growth than occurred in 2007-08 under the WorkChoices regime. In fact the past three years have been the second-worst period of productivity growth ever recorded \u2013 only the 1990s recession saw a worse time: It\u2019s quite astonishing that while this is happening the treasurer could argue less than a week ago that \u201cwhen it comes to the Australian economy, we have our fundamentals in a pretty good place\u201d. There is little more fundamental to an economy than productivity. And right now, not only is it not \u201cpretty good\u201d, it is as bad as it has ever been. One issue PwC highlights is our lack of investment \u2013 especially in research and development \u2013 the very things that should drive productivity. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And a major issue in this space is our energy industry and the government\u2019s absolute shmemozzle of a policy on climate change. PwC argues \u201cto support the future direction of the economy, we need a consistent and strategic approach to Australia\u2019s energy future so we can collectively maximise the opportunity this presents\u201d, and it notes PwC\u2019s Low Carbon Economy Index 2019 shows just how slowly Australia is shifting to a low-emissions economy. It found that in 2018 \u201cAustralia has a decarbonisation rate of 1.8% and comes in at 13th place on the global index [the G20 nations], behind Germany (top performer with a rate of 6.5%), and behind regional powers China (3.9%) and Japan (3%)\u201d. This accords with the medium-term trend that the fall in Australia\u2019s carbon intensity since 2013 is among the lower half of OECD nations: The impact of energy-policy intransigence on investment is something former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull highlighted in a recent podcast with Katharine Murphy and Lenore Taylor. He suggested he had been told by foreign CEOs that \u201ccompanies were avoiding Australia because of the lack of policy and because of political risk\u201d. The links between climate change policy and investment are only going to grow, and in an economy struggling with low productivity and an outlook for lower growth in the future the problems from the government\u2019s failure to establish a low-emissions framework will only become more acute. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes cooking dinner is just never going to happen: too busy, too hot, too hard, too much. Let precooked prawns and some quick veggie blanching come to the rescue for something with a bit more \u201cwow\u201d than salad. Grand aioli is a lovely French way of eating that we totally embrace in my house. You can whizz up the garlicky mayonnaise following the recipe below, or make prep even quicker by buying some high-quality aioli from the deli. The aioli is the hero that all the bits get dipped in, to create a grazing board that is perfect for a quick yet proper dinner. It also works for snacks with friends, a long festive lunch or feeding a hoard. Prawns, grand aioli and rainbow vegetable board Prep 15 mins Cook 10 mins Serves 2 greedy people Use as many or as few vegetables and salad leaves as you care to prep. Creamy taramasalata is a great complimentary flavour, acting as an interlude to the bitey aioli, you can also skip it or go lighter with a fresh tzatziki. I use a quirky but efficient method to blanche veggies. Heat water in a deep, wide fry pan with the lid on, until it is boiling rapidly. The water needs to be really salty, then it seasons slightly as you go. Each vegetable type is blanched separately, one after another, as I trim stalks and cut, so they cook uniformly. Beans and asparagus take two minutes, broccoli and flatbeans about three minutes, and small carrots about five minutes. The key is to scoop them out before they are cooked through and then lay them straight on to a clean tea towel, were the residual heat continues to cook them slightly as they cool. I\u2019d much rather all my veggies crunchy than soft. On occasion, if we just can\u2019t wait, we just eat them all raw. 500g whole cooked Australian prawns (about 200g to 250g a person).

      "bodyText": "Environment groups have raised doubts about the Victorian government\u2019s promise to protect 90,000 hectares of old growth forest, just weeks after the Andrews government announced a major transition plan for Victoria\u2019s timber industry. Six organisations, including The Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth and Environment Victoria, have expressed fears that the government will open up some areas currently mapped as old growth to logging. In a letter to the premier, Daniel Andrews, and the environment minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, the groups have called on the government to clarify how it plans to implement its promises, which include an immediate ban on old growth logging. Current maps used for native timber harvesting identify areas of old growth forest that are off limits to logging, but the groups fear some of these areas may be opened up under a new verification system. The government is developing a tool that would be used by VicForests to verify in the field what is and is not old growth. The groups say the existing models should instead be used to immediately protect all patches of forest mapped as old growth. Amelia Young, the Wilderness Society\u2019s Victorian campaigns manager, said they were concerned the government\u2019s field verification plan would leave some areas currently identified as old growth vulnerable. She said the groups were also concerned that old growth that falls outside of the existing mapped areas could \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe government must immediately confirm which 90,000 hectares of modelled old growth it is protecting from logging,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s only necessary to verify what is and isn\u2019t old growth in areas the government intends to log to make sure it is effectively banning old growth logging as promised.\u201d The concerns have similarities to those raised in NSW earlier this year about remapping of old growth forest that had been proposed by the NSW government. \u201cThere is no need \u2013 indeed it is not practically feasible \u2013 to field-verify 90,000 hectares of mapped modelled old growth; it simply just requires immediate protection, in line with the promise,\u201d the organisations say in their letter. Ed Hill, the spokesman for Friends of the Earth and the Goongerah Environment Centre, said the lack of detail from the government since its announcement had caused concern. \u201cIt\u2019s just astonishing that the government would announce a ban on old growth logging and have no clear answer on how they will implement it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve told Victorians that 90,000 hectares of old growth will be protected and they can\u2019t tell Victorians how that\u2019s going to happen.

      "bodyText": "The Wallabies have emerged from a challenging year both on and off the field with a significantly stronger connection to their fanbase, according to new research, while the Matildas remain Australia\u2019s most relatable national sports team. Rugby Australia\u2019s strong stance on Israel Folau, whose contract was terminated in the wake of his anti-gay social media posts earlier this year, contributed to a significant improvement in the men\u2019s side\u2019s BenchMark score \u2013 a ranking devised to gauge the respect, enjoyment, trust, pride and bond held by those familiar with Australian sports teams. In the attribute \u201ctaking an authentic stand on important issues\u201d, the Wallabies rose from 35th out of 62 teams to second in the latest survey conducted by True North Research. Under coach Michael Cheika, the team struggled on the pitch all year and could get no further than the quarter-finals at the recent Rugby World Cup in Japan, but they still managed to grow their supporter base among women and those aged between 16 and 24. The Wallabies came in sixth overall on the ladder, while Sam Kerr\u2019s Matildas held onto their position at the top, six months on from the last release, despite their own disappointing on-field results that included a penalty shootout defeat to Norway which eliminated them from the World Cup at the last-16 stage. On an individual level, captain Kerr scored highly and continues to be a major force driving connection to the team. \u201cThe Matildas\u2019 heartbreaking early exit at the World Cup hasn\u2019t made Australians any less committed to backing them,\u201d the True North Research director, Georgie Maynard, said. \u201cWe all shared their disappointment, but we also buy into their resolve to come back stronger. Australians\u2019 support for the Matildas is resilient, and as fans, we want them to turn it around.\u201d Australia\u2019s women\u2019s rugby sevens team, which topped the ladder in the original survey 12 months ago, were second this time around with the Socceroos third. The Wallaroos, the women\u2019s rugby union team, were ranked fourth. The men\u2019s national Test cricket team, itself attempting to slowly rebuild a reputation severely damaged by last year\u2019s ball-tampering scandal, continued to rise up the rankings, having propped up the ladder six months after the infamous events of Cape Town. Tim Paine\u2019s team now sits seventh, behind the Wallabies and the men\u2019s Twenty20 team in fifth. Basketball\u2019s Opals, rugby league\u2019s Kangaroos and netball\u2019s Diamonds round out the top 10 but conspicuous by their absence are the all-conquering women\u2019s cricket side, led by Meg Lanning and featuring stars such as Alyssa Healy and Ellyse Perry. They came in 11th. Domestic winter sports teams were also surveyed, with Geelong rating the highest of all AFL clubs, just ahead of Hawthorn, and Melbourne Storm retaining top spot in the NRL. Parramatta Eels and Manly Sea Eagles, two teams that struggled in last year\u2019s results, saw significant improvement. \u201cThe new Bankwest Stadium has helped the Eels create an aura around the team and their inclusive approach, bringing in their community has had a big impact,\u201d Maynard said. \u201cThe return of Des Hasler as coach of Manly and his visionary leadership, alongside the team\u2019s resilience have been key drivers of the improvement to Manly\u2019s score.\u201d Of the representative teams, the men\u2019s State of Origin teams came out worst in terms of emotional connection, with the Maroons propping up the table behind the Blues, while Cronulla, Gold Coast and Penrith ranked worst for NRL teams. Another Gold Coast team, the Suns, were the bottom-ranked AFL club, behind North Melbourne, while Collingwood were eighth of eight Super Netball teams. Those six clubs were the only to register a \u201cbelow par\u201d score.",

And that produces headlines.</p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve got I think the most rigorous way of surveying. We actually do it in two different modes \u2013 by telephone and by self-administration \u2013 and what that is showing is much more a picture of \u2018steady as she goes\u2019 rather than dramatic decline.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The education line cuts across the immigration debate like a mighty trench</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They shift a little, and the shifts have lately been gloomy, but year in and year out the steady findings of the Scanlon surveys define Australia:</p> <ul> <li><p>90% of us have a sense of belonging to this place.</p></li> <li><p>87% are proud of the Australian way of life.</p></li> <li><p>85% agree multiculturalism has been good for Australia.</p></li> <li><p>84% report having a happy 2019.</p></li> <li><p>80% welcome resettlement in Australia of refugees assessed abroad.</p></li> <li><p>79% oppose selecting immigrants by race.</p></li> <li><p>73% believe Australia is a land of economic opportunity where, in the long run, hard work brings a better life.</p></li> <li><p>71% believe globalisation is good for the country.</p></li> <li><p>68% believe accepting immigrants from many different countries makes Australia stronger.</p></li> <li><p>62% are optimistic about Australia\u2019s future.</p></li> </ul> <p><br>Then there\u2019s the darker side:</p> <ul> <li><p>61% of Australians disapprove of asylum seekers making their way here by boat.</p></li> <li><p>47% of us have little or no concern about the treatment we mete out to asylum seekers in PNG and Nauru.</p></li> <li><p>40% in 2019 admit negative or very negative feelings towards Muslims.</p></li> </ul> <p>The level of hostility to Muslims was masked until a couple of years ago, when the Scanlon Foundation began parallel tracking its research. Telephone interviews over the years showed 21% to 25% of us hostile to Islam. But these figures essentially double when surveys are completed in private and online.</p> <p>The gap between the two sets of results shows us to be a polite people. We hesitate to admit personal unhappiness or gloom for the future of the country. We clearly don\u2019t enjoy confessing to strangers that we\u2019re in financial trouble. A little of our optimism about the impact of mass immigration evaporates online. We\u2019re even shy of confessing to strangers that we don\u2019t much like Christians \u2013 only 4% would own up to that on the telephone in 2019, but 14% said so clearly online.</p> <p>Markus argues that while our sunny picture of the country darkens a little when we answer in private, those Australians most hostile to race speak loud and clear however they are surveyed.</p> <p>\u201cThe views of the hardcore negative types are pretty constant irrespective of the surveys,\u201d says Markus. \u201cAnd often it\u2019s around 10% of the population. Now it would be a worry if self-completion surveys then showed it wasn\u2019t 10% but it was 20% to 25%. But it\u2019s actually pretty constant.\u201d</p> <p>So who are the most hostile to immigration?</p> <p>Easy answer: One Nation voters. The 2019 report shows One Nation voters are profoundly pessimistic about Australia\u2019s future; loath globalisation; don\u2019t give a rats about the environment; are scathing about the motives of government; dismiss multiculturalism; are fiercely hostile to Muslims; couldn\u2019t care less how harshly we treat asylum seekers; and are the only group in the survey \u2013 young and old, rich and poor, city and country \u2013 where most still hanker for the old White Australia policy of selecting migrants by race and religion.</p> <h2>What divides us?</h2> <p>How important here is the city/country divide?</p> <p>Not at all on the importance of climate change. Wherever we live in cities or the bush, we agree that after the economy, the climate is the single biggest problem facing Australia today. But on immigration, the gap between city and country widens significantly.</p> <p>The 2019 survey found that outside the capital cities there was an 8% drop in support for multiculturalism; a 4% rise in those wanting immigrants selected by race and religion; a 6% fall in those concerned about the treatment of refugees; and, though the bush is where migrants don\u2019t settle and governments are desperate to send them, a nine-point jump to 49% of those who believe Australia\u2019s immigration intake is too large.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fundamentals are sound, even as about one in 10 of us continue to rage against this new Australia of many faiths and many cultures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this is not the most dramatic divide revealed in the Scanlon surveys over the years. The education line cuts across the immigration debate like a mighty trench:</p> <ul> <li><p>Only 27% of university graduates say Australia takes too many immigrants, but for those who never finished high school the figure is 70%.</p></li> <li><p>Nearly 90% of graduates applaud multiculturalism but only 61% of those who never finished school.</p></li> <li><p>Among graduates, 58% worry we treat refugees too harshly, but their fears are shared by only 32% of who never finished school.</p></li> <li><p>While a rump of 14% of graduates still wish immigrants could be chosen by race, support for the old White Australia position more than doubles to 35% who never finished school.</p></li> </ul> <p>Western Australia emerges from the survey as a fascinating puzzle: wildly optimistic about the future of the nation, peculiarly trusting in government, little perturbed by climate change and not particularly worried about the size of the immigration intake. But of all mainlanders, West Australians are most keen to select immigrants by race and are, by a long shot, the most hard-hearted about Australia\u2019s treatment of refugees.</p> <p>Nothing Canberra has done to its prisoners in PNG and Nauru in the past couple of years has budged the national 50:50 split between the indifferent and the sympathisers. Markus says: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rock solid.\u201d</p> <p>But when these figures are broken down by political alignment, Markus sees signs of movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da499e5c45670756e2a8d275cea3c0949e7586c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da499e5c45670756e2a8d275cea3c0949e7586c5/0_244_5505_3303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ALP Senator Kristina Keneally address a rally support of a Tamil asylum seeker family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ALP Senator Kristina Keneally during a September rally in support of a Tamil asylum seeker family. Markus says refugee policy is \u2018huge problem for Labor\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thirty per cent of the Liberal constituency say Australia is being too harsh, compared with 87% of Greens. The 2019 figure for refugee sympathisers in Labor ranks is 61%.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a huge problem for Labor,\u201d says Markus \u201cbecause the government with its constituency can keep doing what it\u2019s been doing, but it really wedges Labor.\u201d</p> <p>Are Christians notably more compassionate? Certainly not Anglicans. In 2019 only 39% of them could muster some sympathy for the asylum seekers Australia is putting through the mill out in the Pacific. Markus doesn\u2019t blame their God. He says gently: \u201cConservative old Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Though not quite so bleak, the figures for the other faiths put paid to the notion that the churches are mighty reservoirs of sympathy for refugees. On the subject of the Pacific solution, Catholics come in slightly under the national split, with only 46% of them reporting some or a great deal of concern for what Australia is doing to refugees.</p> <p>That\u2019s typical. On issues such as the size of the immigration intake, support for multiculturalism, a hankering for the right to pick migrants by race and confidence that immigrants improve our society by introducing new ideas and cultures, the churches don\u2019t put the attitudes of the rest of the community to shame. At best they merely mirror them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/16/behrouz-boochani-manus-says-simply-i-did-my-best\">Behrouz Boochani, brutalised but not beaten by Manus, says simply: 'I did my best'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Markus ran some figures for Guardian Australia which show that on nearly all questions asked in the survey \u2013 including concern for climate change \u2013 the progressive horse to back is those who nominate No Religion.</p> <p>Overall, Markus is a grim optimist. Reports of discrimination are too high, but not for the moment growing higher. The fundamentals are sound, even as about one in 10 of us continue to rage against this new Australia of many faiths and many cultures. It\u2019s in the government\u2019s hands whether we continue to support what is in world terms very high support for large scale immigration.</p> <p>Markus is at pains to emphasise that multiculturalism backed by almost all of us is a two-way street. \u201cThey\u2019re saying we recognise that diversity is good, that diversity has made us a better country. You get very high levels endorsing the notion that immigration improves society by bringing new ideas and cultures.</p> <p>\u201cBut on the other hand, it\u2019s two-way because the expectation is that immigrants will, over time, be more like us. It\u2019s not an endorsement of pluralism. It\u2019s an endorsement of a two-way change and obviously in that change the immigrants are changing more than the host society.\u201d</p> <p>But we\u2019re all changing? \u201cYes.

Then there\u2019s the darker side: 61% of Australians disapprove of asylum seekers making their way here by boat. 47% of us have little or no concern about the treatment we mete out to asylum seekers in PNG and Nauru. 40% in 2019 admit negative or very negative feelings towards Muslims. The level of hostility to Muslims was masked until a couple of years ago, when the Scanlon Foundation began parallel tracking its research. Telephone interviews over the years showed 21% to 25% of us hostile to Islam. But these figures essentially double when surveys are completed in private and online. The gap between the two sets of results shows us to be a polite people. We hesitate to admit personal unhappiness or gloom for the future of the country. We clearly don\u2019t enjoy confessing to strangers that we\u2019re in financial trouble. A little of our optimism about the impact of mass immigration evaporates online. We\u2019re even shy of confessing to strangers that we don\u2019t much like Christians \u2013 only 4% would own up to that on the telephone in 2019, but 14% said so clearly online. Markus argues that while our sunny picture of the country darkens a little when we answer in private, those Australians most hostile to race speak loud and clear however they are surveyed. \u201cThe views of the hardcore negative types are pretty constant irrespective of the surveys,\u201d says Markus. \u201cAnd often it\u2019s around 10% of the population. Now it would be a worry if self-completion surveys then showed it wasn\u2019t 10% but it was 20% to 25%. But it\u2019s actually pretty constant.\u201d So who are the most hostile to immigration? Easy answer: One Nation voters. The 2019 report shows One Nation voters are profoundly pessimistic about Australia\u2019s future; loath globalisation; don\u2019t give a rats about the environment; are scathing about the motives of government; dismiss multiculturalism; are fiercely hostile to Muslims; couldn\u2019t care less how harshly we treat asylum seekers; and are the only group in the survey \u2013 young and old, rich and poor, city and country \u2013 where most still hanker for the old White Australia policy of selecting migrants by race and religion. What divides us? How important here is the city/country divide? Not at all on the importance of climate change. Wherever we live in cities or the bush, we agree that after the economy, the climate is the single biggest problem facing Australia today. But on immigration, the gap between city and country widens significantly. The 2019 survey found that outside the capital cities there was an 8% drop in support for multiculturalism; a 4% rise in those wanting immigrants selected by race and religion; a 6% fall in those concerned about the treatment of refugees; and, though the bush is where migrants don\u2019t settle and governments are desperate to send them, a nine-point jump to 49% of those who believe Australia\u2019s immigration intake is too large. But this is not the most dramatic divide revealed in the Scanlon surveys over the years. The education line cuts across the immigration debate like a mighty trench: Only 27% of university graduates say Australia takes too many immigrants, but for those who never finished high school the figure is 70%. Nearly 90% of graduates applaud multiculturalism but only 61% of those who never finished school. Among graduates, 58% worry we treat refugees too harshly, but their fears are shared by only 32% of who never finished school. While a rump of 14% of graduates still wish immigrants could be chosen by race, support for the old White Australia position more than doubles to 35% who never finished school. Western Australia emerges from the survey as a fascinating puzzle: wildly optimistic about the future of the nation, peculiarly trusting in government, little perturbed by climate change and not particularly worried about the size of the immigration intake. But of all mainlanders, West Australians are most keen to select immigrants by race and are, by a long shot, the most hard-hearted about Australia\u2019s treatment of refugees. Nothing Canberra has done to its prisoners in PNG and Nauru in the past couple of years has budged the national 50:50 split between the indifferent and the sympathisers. Markus says: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rock solid.\u201d But when these figures are broken down by political alignment, Markus sees signs of movement. Thirty per cent of the Liberal constituency say Australia is being too harsh, compared with 87% of Greens. The 2019 figure for refugee sympathisers in Labor ranks is 61%. \u201cIt is a huge problem for Labor,\u201d says Markus \u201cbecause the government with its constituency can keep doing what it\u2019s been doing, but it really wedges Labor.\u201d Are Christians notably more compassionate? Certainly not Anglicans. In 2019 only 39% of them could muster some sympathy for the asylum seekers Australia is putting through the mill out in the Pacific. Markus doesn\u2019t blame their God. He says gently: \u201cConservative old Australia.\u201d Though not quite so bleak, the figures for the other faiths put paid to the notion that the churches are mighty reservoirs of sympathy for refugees. On the subject of the Pacific solution, Catholics come in slightly under the national split, with only 46% of them reporting some or a great deal of concern for what Australia is doing to refugees. That\u2019s typical. On issues such as the size of the immigration intake, support for multiculturalism, a hankering for the right to pick migrants by race and confidence that immigrants improve our society by introducing new ideas and cultures, the churches don\u2019t put the attitudes of the rest of the community to shame. At best they merely mirror them. Markus ran some figures for Guardian Australia which show that on nearly all questions asked in the survey \u2013 including concern for climate change \u2013 the progressive horse to back is those who nominate No Religion. Overall, Markus is a grim optimist. Reports of discrimination are too high, but not for the moment growing higher. The fundamentals are sound, even as about one in 10 of us continue to rage against this new Australia of many faiths and many cultures. It\u2019s in the government\u2019s hands whether we continue to support what is in world terms very high support for large scale immigration. Markus is at pains to emphasise that multiculturalism backed by almost all of us is a two-way street. \u201cThey\u2019re saying we recognise that diversity is good, that diversity has made us a better country. You get very high levels endorsing the notion that immigration improves society by bringing new ideas and cultures. \u201cBut on the other hand, it\u2019s two-way because the expectation is that immigrants will, over time, be more like us. It\u2019s not an endorsement of pluralism. It\u2019s an endorsement of a two-way change and obviously in that change the immigrants are changing more than the host society.\u201d But we\u2019re all changing? \u201cYes. We\u2019re moving. But they\u2019re moving more.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian minders of the Chinese defector Wang Liqiang have been urged to \u201cdouble up\u201d protection duties as experts raise significant fears about his safety. Chinese state media have sought to discredit Wang as a convicted \u201cfraudster\u201d, liar and a fake after he publicly revealed his role within Chinese intelligence and his bid for Australia\u2019s protection on Saturday in the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers. The Chinese government released a notice from the Shanghai public security bureau stating it was investigating him for fraud, and released an online court record suggesting a fraud conviction was recorded in 2016. Wang\u2019s lawyer in Australia, George Newhouse, told Guardian Australia: \u201cHe denies those allegations.\u201d Wang is staying in an undisclosed location in Sydney. He is in the country on a tourist visa and has formally applied for asylum. Guardian Australia has been told he holds significant concerns for his own and his family\u2019s safety. One of the experts who helped investigate Wang\u2019s claims, Alex Joske of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said there was reason to doubt the allegations aired by the Chinese government about his fraud conviction. He said it was clear from the Chinese police statements that Wang was now \u201ca target\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019d be a target of the Chinese government and we can see from the allegations that the Chinese government has made, those accusations from the police, that they are trying to go after him,\u201d Joske said. John Blaxland, a security and intelligence expert at the Australian National University, said the extraordinary revelations of China\u2019s actions, if accurate, were unlike anything Australia has seen \u201cin a generation\u201d. He said significant protective precautions must be taken to guard Wang against retribution. \u201cIf I was his minders, I would be looking to double up on protection duties,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd he must have minders. I\u2019m assuming that someone is looking out for him and there are some protective measures in place. There\u2019s a lot of egg being thrown around and it\u2019s stuck on a lot of people\u2019s faces.\u201d Asked about what was being done to keep Wang safe, prime minister Scott Morrison said simply that the public could \u201cexpect the same protections to apply to anyone who is living in our country, whether on a visa or any other arrangement\u201d. \u201cWell he\u2019s in Australia. He\u2019s in Australia. And we have the rule of law in Australia,\u201d Morrison said. The concerns for Wang come after the death of Bo \u201cNick\u201d Zhao in a Melbourne hotel room in March \u2013 which passed almost unnoticed at the time. Nine newspapers reported allegations on Monday that Zhao had been approached by Chinese businessmen in Melbourne to run for federal parliament, effectively as an agent of Beijing. Zhao, a 32-year-old car dealer who had run into financial difficulties, was found dead by a cleaner in a hotel room in Glen Waverley on 3 March this year. Former colleagues remember him as quiet but determined. Yvan Lieutier, who worked with Zhao through a Heidelberg car dealership for five months, told the Guardian he was a \u201cvery quiet\u201d young man, but one who was \u201cwas pretty ambitious for his age\u201d. He was approached to run for parliament in early 2019, and reported the approach to Asio several weeks before his death. A cause of death has not been established and Victoria police have referred Zhao\u2019s death to the coroner. Police said: \u201cLocal police prepared a report for the coroner in relation to the death of a 31-year-old man in Glen Waverley on 3 March 2019. As this matter is currently before the coroner, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d The Victorian coroner\u2019s court confirmed that its investigation into Zhao\u2019s death was \u201copen and ongoing\u201d but that no decision had been taken on if, or when, a public hearing might be held. Blaxland said the reports of Chinese influence, if accurate, were \u201cgrave\u201d. \u201cIf what we are reading is correct, then we face a challenge the likes of which we have not seen in a generation,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut having said that, I think it\u2019s very important to not respond in a shrill manner. To be level-headed but to view our interests holistically and with the long term in mind.\u201d Australia, he said, was caught between the competing interests of its economic and national security relationships. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to reconcile the two,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen manifest in the last few days is exactly just why it\u2019s so hard to reconcile them, because they are working in opposite purposes.\u201d He said Australia\u2019s response to China should be made through diplomatic channels, via the foreign investment review board, and through its advocacy with partner countries on Huawei. Chongyi Feng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, said Wang\u2019s claims required further investigation by Australian intelligence authorities. \u201cThe claim by Mr Wang confirms many things that have been reported and discussed over the last two years,\u201d Feng said. \u201cIt is crystal clear that the Australian government and public should have done more and should do more to address Chinese interference. We already have effective new laws [targeting foreign interference], but those laws should be implemented with greater vigour.\u201d Zhao\u2019s death needed \u201cto be investigated very thoroughly,\u201d he said. Feng said he believed political concerns over Australia\u2019s economic relationship with China were the most significant factor in an unwillingness to push back harder against Beijing. \u201cThe intelligence officials of Australia understand what is happening, but \u2026 political leaders need to do more to address this, even if those actions might offend the Beijing authorities and may cause some commercial loss or lost business deals. Australia should put human rights and democracy before commercial interests.\u201d Asio\u2019s director general, Mike Burgess, said his agency \u201cwas previously aware of matters that have been reported ... and has been actively investigating them. \u201cGiven that the matter in question is subject to a coronial inquiry, and as not to prejudice our investigations, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\u201d Burgess said allegations of foreign interference were treated seriously, and that hostile foreign powers posed a significant threat to Australia. \u201cAs the director general of security, I am committed to protecting Australia\u2019s democracy and sovereignty,\u201d he said. \u201cHostile foreign intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security. Asio will continue to confront and counter foreign interference and espionage in Australia.\u201d Wang has claimed in media interviews that he is a spy seeking to defect to Australia, and willing to reveal secrets of Chinese efforts to infiltrate and influence Australia\u2019s political system. He alleged, too that he had engaged in espionage activities in Hong Kong, including helping to organise the October 2015 kidnapping of Lee Bo, the owner of Causeway Bay Bookshop, who was targeted by Beijing for allegedly distributing dissident materials. Wang said Beijing covertly controls listed companies to finance intelligence operations, including surveilling dissidents, co-opting media organisations, and running \u201ccyber armies\u201d to shift political opinion.",

Glasgow North East is a key Labour-SNP marginal, which has twice changed hands in the last two general elections. It has some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, with amongst the lowest life expectancy rates. Given how popular the SNP is in Scotland overall, this seat is a key test of whether Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity platform can cut through. If you live in Glasgow North East, can you tell us what will decide your vote? We\u2019d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. How happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? Are you thinking of switching your vote? Perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. We\u2019d also like to know how you are following this election, whether through traditional media such as TV and newspapers or online news sites or social media. Do you belong to local Facebook or WhatsApp groups? How to contribute We want to hear from people who live in Glasgow North East about the issues that matter to them in the upcoming election.

The project was brought to him by star and producer Ruffalo, a longtime environmental activist who has used the film\u2019s publicity tour to speak at length about the catastrophic effects of chemical pollution caused by the likes of DuPont, Monsanto and other giant corporations. Dark Waters has been called routine by some, but it is also clearly a passion project for its makers, with Ruffalo and Haynes the latest in a long line of Hollywood heavyweights to tackle real life corporate maleficence in the hopes of shaping public discourse and effecting actual political change.</p> <p>To that end, they\u2019re already making some people nervous: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/dupont-movie-very-damaging-fermium-says-after-sneak-preview\">a recent report</a> from a Wall Street analyst who watched Dark Waters described a scenario wherein the film, should it prove a big enough hit with audiences, causes DuPont\u2019s stock price to drop.

In an appropriate bit of self-fulfilling prophecy, this speculation already caused DuPont shares to take a 2.7% hit the week before release.</p> <p>Observers are quick to note previous examples of Hollywood expos\u00e9s of large corporations, specifically Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Oscar darling Erin Brockovich, which dramatized its titular heroine\u2019s crusade against PG&amp;E for a similar case of water poisoning, as well as Mike Nichols\u2019 Silkwood, about the late whistleblower Karen Silkwood\u2019s attempts to prove energy company Kerr-McGee\u2019s liability for poisoning members of its workforce (herself included).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d45cd221870220d22969414b398143ccd4a8d577\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d45cd221870220d22969414b398143ccd4a8d577/0_0_2932_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In both examples, the companies at the center of the movies did indeed come under renewed scrutiny, although it\u2019s hard to prove they saw any repercussions other than sustained PR headaches.

The films acted less as urgent calls to action than reminders of the long, hard slog required to hold big business accountable.</p> <p>Such is likely to be the case with Dark Waters. Any hope that DuPont might be made to suffer further setbacks as a result of renewed attention might be sadly misplaced. Immediately ahead of the film\u2019s release, the company\u2019s stock was actually on the rise, thanks to Deutsche Bank adding it as a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/analyst-calls-of-the-day-virgin-galactic-dupont-nintendo-more.html\">Catalyst Call Buy</a>, with the reasoning that the film is likely to \u201cadd clarity and remove overhang from the stock\u201d. This is indicative of the amoral operation of Wall Street as a whole, which similarly saw the company\u2019s stock rise upon it agreeing to the massive settlement in 2017. This is to say nothing of the unlikelihood of Dark Waters catching on with audiences the way Brockovich or Silkwood did. Those movies came out during a very different time for both movies and politics, and while Dark Waters\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/dark-waters-off-to-swimming-start-at-indie-box-office-mark-ruffalo/\">limited first weekend box office is solid</a>, the notion that a muted adult drama about an environmental scandal from several years back could capture the zeitgeist and hold it long enough to cause an industry titan like DuPont any long lasting damage is questionable.</p> <p>Much in the same way movies have been shown to influence people\u2019s politics without necessarily leading to quantifiable political change, dramatic films that tackle big business head on may well shape their public image \u2013 consider how much we associate Hearst Communications with Citizen Kane, Facebook with The Social Network, or, for that matter, the name DuPont with the grim business at the center of Foxcatcher \u2013 without necessarily forcing them to change their business practices or affecting their bottom line.</p> <p>On the other hand, documentaries have shown a far greater propensity for not only influencing public perception of individual companies, but also bringing about actual ground-level change. The examples are readily available: Michael Moore\u2019s Bowling for Columbine convinced Kmart to halt its sale of handguns, while Morgan Spurlock\u2019s Super Size Me forced McDonald\u2019s to acknowledge the film\u2019s charges in television ads before ultimately discontinuing its \u201cSuper-Size\u201d portions and introducing healthier menu options.

It alleges that the money was actually a fee demanded by Qatar in exchange for investing \u00a34bn in the bank as part of an \u00a311bn emergency fundraising drive at the height of the financial crisis.</p> <p>The fees effectively meant Qatar was able to purchase Barclays shares at a heavily discounted price.</p> <p>Jenkins told the jury on Monday that he first met Qatar\u2019s leader at a dinner in Sardinia in July 2007, to which he had been invited by his wife\u2019s friend.</p> <p>He said he struck up a conversation with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani about Qatar\u2019s stake in Sainsbury\u2019s, which had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/15/supermarkets.money\">recently increased to 25%</a>, and the pair later made plans to meet abroad.</p> <p>In the months that followed, the court heard that Sheikh Hamad invited Jenkins to the south of France, Qatar\u2019s capital Doha, and then met with the banking boss in Los Angeles over the Christmas holidays.</p> <p>Jenkins\u2019 lawyer, John Kelsey-Fry QC, asked whether Barclays colleagues were right to characterise the relationship with Sheik Hamad as \u201cextremely close\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe were close. We spoke frequently. We could pass time [speaking] \u2026 socially or on business,\u201d Jenkins said.</p> <p>Jenkins said Sheikh Hamad had also expressed interest the banking sector, which was starting to suffer during the 2008 global credit crunch.</p> <p>\u201cWe were talking about taking advantage of falling share prices of banks, generally,\u201d Jenkins said.</p> <p>By February 2008, Jenkins said he was aware that Barclays was going to need emergency cash of its own and was asked by the bank\u2019s former finance director Christopher Lucas whether Qatar would be interested in taking part.</p> <p>Jenkins said that there were \u201cextensive discussions\u201d with the Qataris ahead of the first funding round in June 2008.</p> <p>Jenkins and his two former colleagues \u2013 Thomas Kalaris the former head of Barclays wealth division and Richard Boath, a former head of Barclays\u2019 European financial institutions \u2013 face charges of fraud as well as conspiracy to commit fraud. All three deny the charges.</p> <p>The SFO\u2019s case followed a five-year investigation into the details of the rescue package. The fraud charges carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence.</p> <p>A previous trial involving all three executives came to a close in April, when the jury was discharged following four months of court proceedings. The former Barclays chief executive John Varley was a co-defendant in that trial, but he was acquitted by an appeals court in June.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A former Barclays executive told a jury he developed a \u201cclose\u201d relationship with Qatar\u2019s prime minister in 2008, just months before the lender and Gulf state struck a controversial services deal that is now at the centre of a criminal trial. The details were laid out by defendant Roger Jenkins, Barclays\u2019 former investment banking chief, who is on trial in London on fraud charges and who gave evidence for the first time on Monday as part of the only UK criminal case brought against bankers for their actions during the financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has accused Jenkins and two former Barclays executives of devising fraudulent advisory services agreements in order to disguise payments worth \u00a3322m to Qatar. It alleges that the money was actually a fee demanded by Qatar in exchange for investing \u00a34bn in the bank as part of an \u00a311bn emergency fundraising drive at the height of the financial crisis. The fees effectively meant Qatar was able to purchase Barclays shares at a heavily discounted price. Jenkins told the jury on Monday that he first met Qatar\u2019s leader at a dinner in Sardinia in July 2007, to which he had been invited by his wife\u2019s friend. He said he struck up a conversation with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani about Qatar\u2019s stake in Sainsbury\u2019s, which had recently increased to 25%, and the pair later made plans to meet abroad. In the months that followed, the court heard that Sheikh Hamad invited Jenkins to the south of France, Qatar\u2019s capital Doha, and then met with the banking boss in Los Angeles over the Christmas holidays. Jenkins\u2019 lawyer, John Kelsey-Fry QC, asked whether Barclays colleagues were right to characterise the relationship with Sheik Hamad as \u201cextremely close\u201d. \u201cWe were close. We spoke frequently. We could pass time [speaking] \u2026 socially or on business,\u201d Jenkins said. Jenkins said Sheikh Hamad had also expressed interest the banking sector, which was starting to suffer during the 2008 global credit crunch. \u201cWe were talking about taking advantage of falling share prices of banks, generally,\u201d Jenkins said. By February 2008, Jenkins said he was aware that Barclays was going to need emergency cash of its own and was asked by the bank\u2019s former finance director Christopher Lucas whether Qatar would be interested in taking part. Jenkins said that there were \u201cextensive discussions\u201d with the Qataris ahead of the first funding round in June 2008. Jenkins and his two former colleagues \u2013 Thomas Kalaris the former head of Barclays wealth division and Richard Boath, a former head of Barclays\u2019 European financial institutions \u2013 face charges of fraud as well as conspiracy to commit fraud. All three deny the charges. The SFO\u2019s case followed a five-year investigation into the details of the rescue package. The fraud charges carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence. A previous trial involving all three executives came to a close in April, when the jury was discharged following four months of court proceedings. The former Barclays chief executive John Varley was a co-defendant in that trial, but he was acquitted by an appeals court in June. The trial continues.",

With his job at Everton currently hanging by a thread [subs please check thread hasn\u2019t snapped], Marco Silva is one of several top flight gaffers expected to be handed his P45 in the coming minutes, hours or days [subs please check current whereabouts of Silva\u2019s P45], following his side\u2019s latest risible capitulation, this time at home to a team wearing red shirts, shorts and socks but purporting to be league strugglers Norwich City. In a state of affairs that suggests Silva isn\u2019t only one who appears clueless about what\u2019s going on at the club he manages [subs please check he still manages the club], there seems widespread confusion regarding the identity of his successor. Some say the club are inclined to go homegrown and \u201cgive it back to Moyesey til the end of the season\u201d, while the scourge of referees that is Ailsa from Home and Away has also been linked with a job that has sadly proved too difficult for one fancy dan continental manager \u2013 Bobby M, Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardici and now Silva \u2013 after another, despite the enormous amounts of transfer funds most have been given to waste. Whoever replaces Silva, his dismissal is likely to be greeted by high-fives, honks and hoots from Sky Sports pundits Paul Merson and Phil Thompson, who were widely derided as dinosaurs by The Fiver and other younger football media hepcats when they had the temerity to publicly question the Portuguese manager\u2019s Premier League credentials upon his arrival in Hull two years and three high profile failures ago. While he may be closest to the sack [subs please check he hasn\u2019t been sacked], Silva is just one of no less than five Premier League managers currently sizing up boxes for their workplace possessions as none of Arsenal\u2019s Unai Emery, West Ham\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini, Watford\u2019s Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores or Southampton\u2019s Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl are expected to last too long in their current roles [subs please check etc, and so on and on and on and on and on]. With so many managerial opportunities arising even Harry Bassett is rumoured to be updating his CV. After all, his old club Sheffield United won\u2019t manage themselves if Chris Wilder ups and leaves [subs please check Chris Wilder hasn\u2019t upped and left].

      "bodyText": "Nine people have died as violent storms swept through parts of France, Greece and Italy over the weekend, causing flash floods, landslides and the collapse of an overpass. Greek media described the storms as leaving a trail of \u201cbiblical destruction\u201d in some areas of the country while the overpass collapse in northern Italy brought back a chilling reminder of Genoa\u2019s Morandi bridge giving way during a thunderstorm in August 2018, killing 43 people. Flash floods in France\u2019s C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur claimed the lives of four people, while two others are believed to still be missing. Three of the victims were found in cars that were swept away in floods in the Var region, and the fourth was among a group being rescued by the fire brigade when the dinghy carrying them to safety capsized. One of the worst affected towns was Roquebrune-sur-Argens in the Var, where the Argens River rose seven metres. The French meteorological office said three months\u2019 worth of rain had fallen in less than 48 hours. Members of the French civil defence took part in rescue operations in a number of flooded areas around Cannes and other coastal towns. The orange alert was lifted in the Var and Alpes-Maritimes regions on Monday as the water receded, leaving an estimated 4,500 homes without electricity. Two other French departments, the Puy-de-D\u00f4me and the Gironde, were placed on high flooding alert. Jean-Luc Videlaine, the prefect for the Var region, said the rain had been of \u201chistoric\u201d intensity and there was considerable damage. Jean-Pierre Hameau of M\u00e9t\u00e9o France said the storms and flooding should not be blamed on climate change. Hameau said the phenomena, known in France as c\u00e9venols, or Mediterraneans, were relatively frequent in the region. \u201cThey occur three or six times a year. It often begins in September when the Mediterranean is warm and there is rising hot air in the south,\u201d Hameau said. \u201cThis usually happens in September and October, but sometimes we find these conditions in November. It\u2019s not linked to global warming. We had these c\u00e9venols before and there hasn\u2019t been an increase since temperatures rose. However, we have noted an increase in the intensity of the rains.\u201d Meanwhile in Greece, two men in their 50s died when their sailing boat broke free of its moorings and capsized after being hit by gale-force winds in Antirio. At least one other person was reported missing in Kineta, a beach town west of Athens that was described as being the worst hit by the storms. Emergency services said it could take days to clear the extensive damage in Kineta, where uprooted trees and rockfalls from surrounding hills also disrupted the road network. Late on Monday Greece\u2019s public broadcaster said the extreme weather had claimed another two lives on the island of Rhodes. A disabled and elderly woman died when rainwater flooded her home, and a winter swimmer perished at sea. The fallout from heavy rainfall was such that authorities were forced to close the highway connecting the Greek capital with Corinth and the Peloponnese peninsula as services cleared the road network of tonnes of mud. The fire service reported widespread flooding of homes, saying hours after the downpours it was still trying to remove people trapped in buildings engulfed by water and debris. The country was bracing itself for more heavy rain later on Monday. In Italy, a woman died after her car was swept away by the flood of the Bormida River in the north of the country. There was flooding in Turin, landslides in the Liguria region and Lake Como overflowed on Sunday, while the River Ticino burst its banks overnight in the northern city of Pavia. Venice, which has suffered recurrent flooding in recent weeks, was again hit with acqua alta, or high water. The Emilia-Romagna region was on high alert for extreme weather on Monday. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the government had earmarked \u20ac11bn of investments intended to accelerate projects to protect the country from extreme weather events.",

      "bodyText": "The meeting at London Aquatics Centre was the sixth of the seven meetings that comprise the ISL\u2019s inaugural season. The league involves teams of 24 (12 men and 12 women) competing in short-course sprint, relay and skins races for team points. There are play-offs and finals, individual and club prize money, as well as appearance money for clubs. The league consists of eight teams \u2013 four from Europe and four from the USA \u2013 though there are plans to expand the league next season to 12 sides, with two further teams from both Europe and the USA and the series running from September to April as opposed to the current season of October to December. Despite the teams being based on two continents not all the swimmers are American or European; the teams comprise of swimmers from all over the world. ISL\u2019s founder, owner and financial backer Konstantin Grigorishin has said he is investing more than \u00a317m in the new venture and a zero-tolerance policy on drugs has been widely welcomed. No swimmer who has ever tested positive for banned substances has been allowed to sign up, and there is also equal prize money for men and women. Grigorishin has said \u201cthe IOC [International Olympic Committee] and international federations \u2026 don\u2019t respect athletes, they don\u2019t consider them like partners\u201d. He says the new league is about \u201cputting power back into the hands of athletes \u2026 championing the right of professional swimmers to make [the] living they deserve, and to have a greater say in the way their sport is run\u201d. The ISL wants to make its events media-friendly, achieve a viewing audience of at least 100 million people over five years, attract sponsors, bring an entertainment component, and work on fan engagement, including merchandising. It\u2019s about how we target ourselves to a new audience and how we grow the sport because swimming is one of the most watched sports at the Olympics. We need to fill that gap between every four years and make it every winter and every season - whatever it takes \u2013 Adam Peaty of London Roar Duncan Scott, Adam Peaty and James Guy, British members of the London Roar team, warm up before racing. A London Roar swimmer training and Belarus\u2019s Ilya Shymanovich of the Energy Standard team, practices his breaststroke despite being heavily strapped up. Members of the London Roar team, including Cate Campbell and Adam Peaty, do a question and answer session for a local club that had to cancel its usual training time in the pool to make room for the Roar training before the International Swimming League meeting. The Aqua Centurion team, wearing identical suits to keep warm, perform a routine as they are introduced to the crowd (top). Waiting in the call room before the women\u2019s 100m butterfly are Energy Standard\u2019s Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m of Sweden (centre) the current Olympic 100m butterfly champion and multiple world record holder, next to teammate Anastasiya Shkurdai of Belarus (left) and Marie Wattel of France and London Roar. Cate Campbell of London Roar walks out to compete with teammate Emma McKeon (right). The league\u2019s seven swimming meets take place in seven cities around the world. The regular season started in October has seen action in Indianapolis, Lewisville and Maryland in the United States, Budapest in Hungary and Naples in Italy ahead of this meet in London, the final meet of the regular season. Each team competes three times during the season, twice in regular competition against fellow teams followed by a \u201cderby match\u201d (of which the London event was one) against their regional rivals. The top two European teams secure a place in the finals in Las Vegas in December. Members of London Roar and Team Iron wait for their races (above), Anton Chupkov a Russian swimmer for Energy Standard team walks out in front of Great Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty of London Roar for the men\u2019s 200m breaststroke ( left) and Ranomi Kromowidjojo of Holland and Team Iron adjusts her goggles before competing in the women\u2019s 100m butterfly (right).

Without the fans you have got nothing and swimming is a sport for everyone.\u201d Many of the swimmers at the London event talked about how they absolutely loved being part of this revolution in their sport despite many of them being in the middle of hard blocks of training (always the focus is on the Olympics) and how they are loving being part of a team instead when they usually compete as individuals. The Women\u2019s 200m butterfy was won by Hungary\u2019s triple Olympic gold medallist Katinka Hosszu, of Team Iron, in a time of 2:03.94 (above).

Billy Joel and Elvis Costello similarly allowed 30 years to elapse before announcing that they had written classical pieces. Even Roger Waters, a man so untroubled by the concept of modesty he bills himself as a \u201ccreative genius\u201d on the adverts for his gigs, spent 28 years working on his opera Ca Ira before presenting it to the public.</p> <p>You can understand their reticence \u2013 the classical establishment is sniffy, even brutal, about pop artists chancing their arm in the world of chamber orchestras, librettos and movements in C minor \u2013 but they\u2019re not made of the same stuff as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a>, who blithely announced he\u2019d written an opera, which would be premiering at the 17,500-capacity Hollywood Bowl in seven days\u2019 time, a couple of weeks after releasing his album Jesus Is King.</p> <p>Here was evidence that West\u2019s belief in himself as not merely \u201cthe greatest artist that God has ever created\u201d but a polymath genius who can turn his hand to anything remains undimmed by a muted response to a number of his ventures \u2013 the people who queue up to buy his trainers seem to have reacted to the news that he was planning on inventing a flying car with an indulgent roll of the eyes. But the feeling that even his fans thought he might be pushing it this time was hard to miss: one US newspaper reported that tickets were still available for the premiere hours before it was due to begin, despite having been slashed in price from $150 to $20.</p> <p>Reports from the Hollywood Bowl on the night also suggested West may have overstretched himself.

For anyone without a working knowledge of the Book of Daniel, the plot was pretty hard to follow. There was no libretto: a choir thundered away, wordlessly or in what may have been like Latin, while West, offstage, read an abridged version of Daniel\u2019s first four chapters in a way that was alternately forceful and halting. Either that was insufficiently rehearsed as well, or his copy of the Bible had been printed with the punctuation in the wrong places: \u201cNow among them were. The children of Judah.

Babylon\u2019s siege of Jerusalem looked like a cross between a rugby scrum, an exposition of street dance moves and the kind of scuffling leave-it-Barry-he\u2019s-not-worth-it fight that often breaks out in Britain\u2019s high streets when the pubs chuck out on a Saturday. But there were moments when it was genuinely beautiful, a series of graceful rippling movements.</p> <p>The music went from full-on, high drama, choral and orchestral power to passages where you could hear the kind of crossover West was presumably aiming for: a lone, aching female soul voice rising above the general tumult; sections where you could make out melodies of old West tracks, most notably The Life of Pablo\u2019s Wolves; a beautiful interlude featuring acoustic guitar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/26/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review\">Kanye West: Jesus Is King review \u2013 rap genius can't see the light</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gorgeous musical passages or not, the halting narration, the imponderable plot, the defiant lack of staging, the fact that everyone bar Nebuchadnezzar was dressed exactly the same, making it hard to work out who was supposed to be who, and the sneaking suspicion that you were watching something that wasn\u2019t actually finished conspired to make the whole thing drag \u2013 it somehow felt a lot longer than 50 minutes. By the time it got round to Shadrach, Meschach and Abednego being cast into the fiery furnace, at least one person watching at home on Tidal would have willingly chucked himself in with them, considering immolation a merciful release from West\u2019s reading and Wes\u2019s bellowing.</p> <p>Instead, it ended with West commanding the audience to stand and put their hands in the air to praise God. At risk of sounding cynical, this also guaranteed Nebuchadnezzar a standing ovation, with the audience already on their feet. West bounded on stage beaming and hugging the cast, as if he were responsible for a huge triumph, which in a weird way he was.</p> <p>As an opera, or a piece of theatrical entertainment, or even as a means of piquing the public\u2019s interest in the Old Testament, Nebuchadnezzar wasn\u2019t much use. As an act of authentically mind-blowing pop-star folly, of a kind we rarely see nowadays \u2013 most pop stars having long been dissuaded from outlandish behaviour fuelled by immense self-regard, perhaps by the opprobrium it occasions on social media \u2013 it exceeded all expectations. Indeed, you\u2019d probably have to look back to the mid-70s, when Rick Wakeman attempted to stage a similarly shambolic live version of The Myths and Legends of King Arthur <em>on ice</em> to find something even vaguely comparable.</p> <p>If it didn\u2019t work in artistic terms, as a bulwark against the argument that pop music is devoid of character and spectacle and crazed, foolhardy ambition, Nebuchadnezzar worked perfectly.</p>",

Gorgeous musical passages or not, the halting narration, the imponderable plot, the defiant lack of staging, the fact that everyone bar Nebuchadnezzar was dressed exactly the same, making it hard to work out who was supposed to be who, and the sneaking suspicion that you were watching something that wasn\u2019t actually finished conspired to make the whole thing drag \u2013 it somehow felt a lot longer than 50 minutes. By the time it got round to Shadrach, Meschach and Abednego being cast into the fiery furnace, at least one person watching at home on Tidal would have willingly chucked himself in with them, considering immolation a merciful release from West\u2019s reading and Wes\u2019s bellowing. Instead, it ended with West commanding the audience to stand and put their hands in the air to praise God. At risk of sounding cynical, this also guaranteed Nebuchadnezzar a standing ovation, with the audience already on their feet. West bounded on stage beaming and hugging the cast, as if he were responsible for a huge triumph, which in a weird way he was. As an opera, or a piece of theatrical entertainment, or even as a means of piquing the public\u2019s interest in the Old Testament, Nebuchadnezzar wasn\u2019t much use. As an act of authentically mind-blowing pop-star folly, of a kind we rarely see nowadays \u2013 most pop stars having long been dissuaded from outlandish behaviour fuelled by immense self-regard, perhaps by the opprobrium it occasions on social media \u2013 it exceeded all expectations. Indeed, you\u2019d probably have to look back to the mid-70s, when Rick Wakeman attempted to stage a similarly shambolic live version of The Myths and Legends of King Arthur on ice to find something even vaguely comparable. If it didn\u2019t work in artistic terms, as a bulwark against the argument that pop music is devoid of character and spectacle and crazed, foolhardy ambition, Nebuchadnezzar worked perfectly.",

      "body": "<p>Surprisingly, amid the many big spending promises made so far in this election campaign, no one has yet pledged to <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/exclusive-johnson-considering-building-bridge-between-scotland-and-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">build a bridge</a> between Scotland and Northern Ireland. This boondoggle, popularised by a prime minister who was until recently very keen on the support of the Democratic Unionist party, is conservatively <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-49661019\" title=\"\">estimated to cost \u00a315</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-49661019\" title=\"\">bn</a> \u2013 though it may be much higher due to the challenge of avoiding second world war munitions <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort%27s_Dyke\" title=\"\">dumped in the sea</a>.</p> <p>The proposal is impractical to the point of impossibility, but the fact that the idea has been talked about at all is revealing. The constitutional fates of Scotland and Northern Ireland are now linked in a way they have never been before. In Northern Ireland, this election campaign has seen the emergence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/sinn-fein-stand-aside-remain-candidates-three-constituencies-general-election\" title=\"\">pro-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/sinn-fein-stand-aside-remain-candidates-three-constituencies-general-election\" title=\"\">remain voting alliances</a> \u2013 albeit still coloured by traditional green and orange allegiances \u2013 and the DUP looks likely to lose at least one of its 10 seats as a result.</p> <p>But for the constitutional future of Northern Ireland the election results in Scotland are much more important, particularly if Nicola Sturgeon wins an emphatic mandate for a second referendum. Though little discussed in the 2014 referendum \u2013 when I worked as a Treasury civil servant on the \u201cno\u201d side \u2013 the implications of a successful independence vote in Scotland are enormous on the other side of the Straits of Moyle, the narrow stretch between the Mull of Kintyre and the north Antrim coast. For it is hard to see how Northern Ireland\u2019s union with Britain can survive the end of Scotland\u2019s.</p> <p>It is true that sentiment on Irish unity has moved in Northern Ireland \u2013 largely as a result of Brexit. Moderate Irish nationalists and constitutionally agnostic liberals are, to use the current phrase, having conversations that they were not having a few years ago. Those discussions are tentative \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 and constricted by the unspoken rules of a divided society still a long way from healing the wounds of conflict.</p> <p>In the republic, there is concern over both the divisions in northern society and the fiscal consequences of incorporating a less productive economy heavily reliant on Westminster subsidy. And that is before one even gets to the symbolism of flags and anthems. Because these acknowledged risks exist alongside genuine hopes for what a reconstituted Ireland might look like, even some champions of unity are advocating years of discussion and consultation before a referendum.</p> <p>This is sensible on its own terms, but it is also predicated on the assumption that the UK\u2019s current constitutional settlement will calmly endure while the island of Ireland considers its options. Any reading of Scottish politics would suggest this assumption is unsafe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5b12692459db5ef3a0d6177b355b8556f77cc85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5b12692459db5ef3a0d6177b355b8556f77cc85/0_0_3000_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irish and Scottish fans at the RBS Six Nations match at Croke Park in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irish and Scottish fans at the RBS Six Nations match at Croke Park in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When viewed against the glacial pace of progress in Northern Ireland, change in Scotland has been lightning fast.

      "bodyText": "Surprisingly, amid the many big spending promises made so far in this election campaign, no one has yet pledged to build a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. This boondoggle, popularised by a prime minister who was until recently very keen on the support of the Democratic Unionist party, is conservatively estimated to cost \u00a315bn \u2013 though it may be much higher due to the challenge of avoiding second world war munitions dumped in the sea. The proposal is impractical to the point of impossibility, but the fact that the idea has been talked about at all is revealing. The constitutional fates of Scotland and Northern Ireland are now linked in a way they have never been before. In Northern Ireland, this election campaign has seen the emergence of pro-remain voting alliances \u2013 albeit still coloured by traditional green and orange allegiances \u2013 and the DUP looks likely to lose at least one of its 10 seats as a result. But for the constitutional future of Northern Ireland the election results in Scotland are much more important, particularly if Nicola Sturgeon wins an emphatic mandate for a second referendum. Though little discussed in the 2014 referendum \u2013 when I worked as a Treasury civil servant on the \u201cno\u201d side \u2013 the implications of a successful independence vote in Scotland are enormous on the other side of the Straits of Moyle, the narrow stretch between the Mull of Kintyre and the north Antrim coast. For it is hard to see how Northern Ireland\u2019s union with Britain can survive the end of Scotland\u2019s. It is true that sentiment on Irish unity has moved in Northern Ireland \u2013 largely as a result of Brexit. Moderate Irish nationalists and constitutionally agnostic liberals are, to use the current phrase, having conversations that they were not having a few years ago. Those discussions are tentative \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 and constricted by the unspoken rules of a divided society still a long way from healing the wounds of conflict. In the republic, there is concern over both the divisions in northern society and the fiscal consequences of incorporating a less productive economy heavily reliant on Westminster subsidy. And that is before one even gets to the symbolism of flags and anthems. Because these acknowledged risks exist alongside genuine hopes for what a reconstituted Ireland might look like, even some champions of unity are advocating years of discussion and consultation before a referendum. This is sensible on its own terms, but it is also predicated on the assumption that the UK\u2019s current constitutional settlement will calmly endure while the island of Ireland considers its options. Any reading of Scottish politics would suggest this assumption is unsafe. When viewed against the glacial pace of progress in Northern Ireland, change in Scotland has been lightning fast. In the final weeks of Tony Blair\u2019s tenure as prime minister in 2007, two striking things happened that seemed unconnected at the time but were not. First, Blair oversaw the re-establishment of the power-sharing institutions at Stormont, with the leaders of Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP \u2013 then Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley \u2013 in charge for the first time, having displaced more moderate parties.

I fell in love with the place, and then I made my career there.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of all this was <a href=\"https://spolin.com/\">Viola Spolin</a>, seen by many as the godmother of modern improvisation. A social worker, Spolin spent time on the lower south side of Chicago, assimilating immigrant children into their communities. \u201cShe developed [drama-based] games that would help the children come together and collaborate and communicate without necessarily speaking the same language,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, an executive director at Second City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d09c4b1fe9dcaa7e7f2e47e09e62a0d7f877df04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d09c4b1fe9dcaa7e7f2e47e09e62a0d7f877df04/0_0_3081_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theatre games \u2026 an improv class at The Second City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theatre games \u2026 an improv class at The Second City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M Spencer Green/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spolin wrote groundbreaking books on improvisation techniques, and her son, Paul Sills, carried her practices forward, blending them with performance, and forming the Compass Players improv theatre. In 1959, this became Second City, a name appropriated from jibes directed towards Chicago from a New York journalist.</p> <p>Second City\u2019s culture is built on two words: \u201cYes, and\u2026\u201d The belief is that during improvisation there are no incorrect answers, no wrong turns, only opportunities \u2013 demanding a response that would embrace and build on an idea, building confidence and fostering creativity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You're taught to listen and react to what you're given.

It seems backwards, but it\u2019s actually brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>Like most close-knit graduates, they stay loyal to their circle. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll see in my Netflix special are all things that I learned and developed at SC,\u201d says Garlin. \u201cAs an actor too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/curb-your-enthusiasm\">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a> would not exist without Second City.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt\u2019s all improvised \u2013 I approached Larry [David] with the idea \u2013 so it truly came from my time there.

Hoyt has just moved here from Second City LA, so I ask her, as an outsider, why she thinks Chicago made all of this possible. \u201cThere\u2019s an intrinsic DNA to this city which is a bit humble. They are aware that there\u2019s New York and LA. What makes it unique is it\u2019s the people that make the city go \u2013 the unions, the workers, the egalitarianism \u2013 there\u2019s a blue-collar attitude. There\u2019s a freedom in not being under the microscope.\u201d</p> <p>Leonard concurs: \u201cWe are a city that makes art that is un-ownable \u2013 you go elsewhere to make the money. Therefore, there\u2019s tremendous freedom here to experiment. Taking what could be perceived as a deficiency, and using it to its full effect.\u201d</p> <p>After mooing and lunging in that small room, maybe I could be the next one to embrace my deficiencies to full effect \u2026 or maybe not. But this is a typical day in a company that now runs seminars, goes out into the community with workshops that spread its ethos, and even into big corporations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump doesn't do improv, he spouts off.  He's doing 'no, but\u2026' instead of 'yes, and\u2026'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wonder out loud to Hoyt and Leonard whether they could take their skills to the White House as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">President Trump</a> seems to be improvising anyway. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t improv,\u201d Hoyt interjects, \u201che spouts off.

      "bodyText": "In the fashionable Old Town district of Chicago, I am making mooing noises and performing deep lunges. My classmates are frozen to the spot \u2013 waiting for me to tap one of them so they can make a strange movement and noise all of their own. This is not your typical Monday night, even in Chicago. In the hallway outside this improv class run by The Second City hang the headshots of actors who, once upon a time, were most likely gestating in a similarly ridiculous way, feeling roughly as self-aware. Amy Poehler, Bob Odenkirk, Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey, Dan Castellaneta, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Jordan Peele, Jane Lynch, John Belushi \u2026 the list of alumni covers an entire corridor. Chicago occupies a curious place in the hierarchy of big US cities \u2013 sitting somewhere on the edge of popular culture \u2013 but that\u2019s just how Chicagoans seem to like it. Huge worldwide cultural movements have emanated from here: house music, blues, world-beating musicals before they appear on Broadway and the West End. Oh \u2013 and comedy. The Second City, celebrating its 60th anniversary in December, is a giant in the world of improv, a monastery of mirth in which the great and the good of the US scene have paid their dues before taking over the world. \u201cWe were all early mid-20s, people not knowing what to do with ourselves, all misfits,\u201d Colbert told podcaster Marc Maron earlier this year. \u201cYou could experiment all you wanted in the improv set and then you would craft it, you would learn a little bit about dramatic structure to be able to make your scene work. I fell in love with the place, and then I made my career there.\u201d At the start of all this was Viola Spolin, seen by many as the godmother of modern improvisation. A social worker, Spolin spent time on the lower south side of Chicago, assimilating immigrant children into their communities. \u201cShe developed [drama-based] games that would help the children come together and collaborate and communicate without necessarily speaking the same language,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, an executive director at Second City. Spolin wrote groundbreaking books on improvisation techniques, and her son, Paul Sills, carried her practices forward, blending them with performance, and forming the Compass Players improv theatre. In 1959, this became Second City, a name appropriated from jibes directed towards Chicago from a New York journalist. Second City\u2019s culture is built on two words: \u201cYes, and\u2026\u201d The belief is that during improvisation there are no incorrect answers, no wrong turns, only opportunities \u2013 demanding a response that would embrace and build on an idea, building confidence and fostering creativity. One native Chicagoan who was very much part of the \u2018yes, and\u2026\u2019 brigade is Jeff Garlin. \u201cEveryone there is pretty genuine. There\u2019s no bullshit there, and no bullshit is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he says on the phone from LA. \u201cSecond City is the key to my entire career \u2013 it\u2019s the one ingredient that got me here.\u201d Above the hum of the traffic and down his speakerphone, he expands in his signature friendly foghorn-like timbre: \u201cIf there was a main lesson I took away, you\u2019re taught to listen and react to what you\u2019re given, and that\u2019s what I do, period. That\u2019s my number one lesson \u2013 being present and reacting to what I\u2019m given. Not just with the audience, but if something pops up in my mind, boom! I react to it. I\u2019m doing \u2018yes and\u2026\u2019 in my own head.\u201d Garlin started out working the box office with Colbert, and playing pranks on the punters they took against. What really established Second City on the national stage was John Belushi and Harold Ramis arriving in 1969, with Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Shelley Long following shortly afterwards. \u201cThe genius of this place is that the minute somebody becomes so great, they move on,\u201d says Leonard. \u201cThis is the model that guarantees there\u2019ll be a spot for the next weirdo that no one else conceives is going to do great work, and then they\u2019re going to leave. It seems backwards, but it\u2019s actually brilliant.\u201d Like most close-knit graduates, they stay loyal to their circle. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll see in my Netflix special are all things that I learned and developed at SC,\u201d says Garlin. \u201cAs an actor too. Curb Your Enthusiasm would not exist without Second City.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt\u2019s all improvised \u2013 I approached Larry [David] with the idea \u2013 so it truly came from my time there. I guarantee I\u2019ve hired more Second City actors for that show than from anywhere else.\u201d Second City opened at just the right time, on the cusp of a new cultural age. \u201cComedy was mother-in-law jokes,\u201d continues Leonard, \u201cthen suddenly Second City is appearing, Lenny Bruce is appearing, across the Atlantic there was Beyond the Fringe and The Establishment.\u201d In an office on the third floor of SC\u2019s headquarters, Leonard and Jen Hoyt, VP of production, sit beneath a blackboard wall on which the prettily written mantras of \u201cFailure is not fatal\u201d, \u201cSuccess is not final\u201d, and \u201cReplace blame with curiosity\u201d are scrawled in colourful chalk. Hoyt has just moved here from Second City LA, so I ask her, as an outsider, why she thinks Chicago made all of this possible. \u201cThere\u2019s an intrinsic DNA to this city which is a bit humble. They are aware that there\u2019s New York and LA. What makes it unique is it\u2019s the people that make the city go \u2013 the unions, the workers, the egalitarianism \u2013 there\u2019s a blue-collar attitude. There\u2019s a freedom in not being under the microscope.\u201d Leonard concurs: \u201cWe are a city that makes art that is un-ownable \u2013 you go elsewhere to make the money. Therefore, there\u2019s tremendous freedom here to experiment. Taking what could be perceived as a deficiency, and using it to its full effect.\u201d After mooing and lunging in that small room, maybe I could be the next one to embrace my deficiencies to full effect \u2026 or maybe not. But this is a typical day in a company that now runs seminars, goes out into the community with workshops that spread its ethos, and even into big corporations. I wonder out loud to Hoyt and Leonard whether they could take their skills to the White House as President Trump seems to be improvising anyway. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t improv,\u201d Hoyt interjects, \u201che spouts off. There is a synchronised movement to improv, where you\u2019re working with the person across from you. Together you are creating something that is not my idea or your idea. It\u2019s a synchronised idea that is better than either of ours. Trump\u2019s spontaneous. He\u2019s doing \u2018no, but..\u2019 instead of \u2018yes, and\u2026\u2019\u201d They should definitely go to the White House. As I walk back to my hotel along the shore of Lake Michigan, the skyline of the Windy City spread out in front of me, I wonder, could The Second City keep going for another 60 years? And suddenly the answer occurs to me: \u201cWith this attitude? Yes, and\u2026\u201d Jeff Garlin: Our Man in Chicago is available on Netflix.",

      "body": "<p>A friend in need is a friend indeed, but a friend who asks permission to talk is better. That\u2019s at least according to Melissa Fabello, a US-based activist and writer who posted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fyeahmfabello/status/1196551284914098177\" title=\"\">screengrab</a> of a text message she\u2019d received from a friend, asking if Fabello had the \u201ccapacity\u201d to listen to her \u201cvent about something medical/weight-related\u201d. Fabello argued that this was something we should all be doing \u2013 asking our friends if they can listen to our problems rather than \u201cunloading without warning\u201d \u2013 in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fyeahmfabello/status/1196581296564256768\" title=\"\">now-viral thread</a> that divided audiences online.</p> <p>Fabello lays out the benefits of this practice, such as recognising that a friend may have limited time or that the conversation may be upsetting, and encourages people to say no to their friends if they choose to. She even drafts a \u201cdelete as appropriate\u201d template message that reads: \u201cHey, I\u2019m so glad you reached out. I\u2019m actually at capacity/helping someone else who\u2019s in crisis/dealing with personal stuff right now and I don\u2019t think I can hold appropriate space for you. Could we connect [later time or date] instead/do you have someone else you could reach out to?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m fairly certain sending back this message would result in friend-relegation, and maybe a glass of ros\u00e9 to the face</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a decidedly business-like template, but the argument follows that it is better to have this exchange than to, for example, ignore a friend in need because the conversation is too much, or have a half-hearted, on the spot chat where both sides walk away feeling resentful. \u201cAsking for consent for emotional labour,\u201d Fabello concludes, \u201ceven from people with whom you have a longstanding relationship that is welcoming to crisis-averting, should be common practice.\u201d</p> <p>Personally I\u2019m not convinced.

      "bodyText": "A friend in need is a friend indeed, but a friend who asks permission to talk is better. That\u2019s at least according to Melissa Fabello, a US-based activist and writer who posted a screengrab of a text message she\u2019d received from a friend, asking if Fabello had the \u201ccapacity\u201d to listen to her \u201cvent about something medical/weight-related\u201d. Fabello argued that this was something we should all be doing \u2013 asking our friends if they can listen to our problems rather than \u201cunloading without warning\u201d \u2013 in a now-viral thread that divided audiences online. Fabello lays out the benefits of this practice, such as recognising that a friend may have limited time or that the conversation may be upsetting, and encourages people to say no to their friends if they choose to. She even drafts a \u201cdelete as appropriate\u201d template message that reads: \u201cHey, I\u2019m so glad you reached out. I\u2019m actually at capacity/helping someone else who\u2019s in crisis/dealing with personal stuff right now and I don\u2019t think I can hold appropriate space for you. Could we connect [later time or date] instead/do you have someone else you could reach out to?\u201d It\u2019s a decidedly business-like template, but the argument follows that it is better to have this exchange than to, for example, ignore a friend in need because the conversation is too much, or have a half-hearted, on the spot chat where both sides walk away feeling resentful. \u201cAsking for consent for emotional labour,\u201d Fabello concludes, \u201ceven from people with whom you have a longstanding relationship that is welcoming to crisis-averting, should be common practice.\u201d Personally I\u2019m not convinced. If I think of all the times a friend has wanted to vent out of the blue to me \u2013 often when they\u2019re at their wits\u2019 end and most vulnerable \u2013 I\u2019m fairly certain sending back this kind of \u201cfriendship out-of-office\u201d message would result in friend-relegation, and maybe a glass of ros\u00e9 to the face.

Undefeated, they also lead their Champions League group, ahead of Internazionale and Borussia Dortmund. Win on Wednesday night and they will be mathematically qualified from the competition\u2019s hardest group with a game to spare. They have lost just one of their last 11 matches, winning nine, and have scored more league goals than anybody in Spain: seven more than second-placed Real Madrid and more than twice as many as Athletic Bilbao in fifth, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in fourth and Sevilla in third. When they played Sevilla, they put four past them. They stuck four more past Celta and five past Betis, Valencia and Valladolid.</p> \n<p>They have the striker who scored 115 over the last four La Liga seasons, more than anyone except <em>that</em> guy, and they have <em>that</em> guy too \u2013 the best player in their history and maybe anybody else\u2019s history either. They won last season\u2019s league, making it four of five, and were a goal off a probable treble. Then they signed Europe\u2019s two most wanted players, even if neither was their players\u2019 most wanted: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/frenkie-de-jong-barcelona-transfer-news-ajax\">the \u20ac75m midfielder made for them</a>, voted Europe\u2019s best, and the summer\u2019s joint most expensive footballer at \u20ac126m. Their new front three had scored <em>401</em> league goals in five years; their goalkeeper might be Spain\u2019s best; they signed the full-back Bayern, Madrid, City chased; have the kid exciting everyone; and this weekend\u2019s starting XI cost \u20ac489m.</p> \n<p>And they\u2019re not very good.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/25/higuain-dybala-juventus-serie-a-ronaldo-atalanta-sarri-italian-football\">Higua\u00edn and Dybala make Juve party like it's 2016 \u2013 and give Sarri a problem | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A few days ago in his latest interview squeezed between sets at the Davis Cup, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 insisted: \u201cIf we\u2019re top, we can\u2019t be playing that badly.\u201d But, yes, they can. A couple of days later, Ernesto Valverde asked why so many questions start with <em>are you worried that\u2026?</em>, when the answer is obvious: because they\u2019re worried. And it\u2019s not going away; it\u2019s getting worse. That day, Ernesto Valverde said he always leaves the press room suddenly \u201cworried about a whole load of things\u201d; on Saturday, he laughed when a journalist sought a way of asking if he was worried without asking if he was worried, but they still were, even if he wasn\u2019t \u2013 or wasn\u2019t showing it. More, in fact, than ever before.</p> \n<p>The headline on the front of Sport summed it up: \u201cA worrying victory.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another one. Saturday\u2019s result against Legan\u00e9s is an improvement on last year \u2013 Barcelona were beaten then \u2013 but nothing else is. A goal down after 12 minutes, Youssef En-Nesyri bending a beautiful shot into the top corner, Barcelona turned it around with strikes from Luis Su\u00e1rez and substitute Arturo Vidal. Afterwards Valverde admitted it \u201cwasn\u2019t brilliant\u201d, which was one way of putting it. Check the papers and there were others: \u201cabhorrent,\u201d \u201cfrightening,\u201d \u201cfilthy\u201d. Most importantly, it felt like a portrait of what Barcelona have become. As Francisco Cabezas neatly put it in El Mundo: \u201cArturo Vidal rescued Ernesto Valverde\u2019s Barcelona at the team that\u2019s bottom. It\u2019s impossible to find a better metaphor for our times.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1198213503213015045\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udfaf En-Nesyri finds the top corner of ter Stegen's net with a beauty!<br><br>\ud83d\ude31 Leganes take a shock 1-0 lead against Barcelona and thrill the Butarque! <a href=\"https://t.co/O3HMwvXjqN\">pic.twitter.com/O3HMwvXjqN</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1198213503213015045?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 23, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>If that might not be entirely fair on Vidal, the man everyone except <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samuelmarsden/status/1198224842253881346?s=20\">the four-year-old with the mohican and the biro beard</a> loves to hate <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3841951/arturo-vidal-is-more-than-a-wild-haircut-or-bold-tattoos-hes-the-pure-fire-barcelona-and-chile-need\">when they shouldn\u2019t </a>\u2013 Vidal is much more <em>Bar\u00e7a</em> than it seems, the one midfielder to press, move, run, score goals \u2013 there was something in it. \u201cArturo Vital,\u201d ran the front page of El Mundo Deportivo, and when he is vital, coming on to rescue you, there is a problem. \u201cThe feelings we\u2019re left with are bad ones,\u201d the Chilean admitted.</p> \n<p>A win does not hide that, or shouldn\u2019t. Barcelona started by gifting Martin Braithwaite an opportunity inside two minutes and completed a comeback thanks to a header from a free-kick and a scuffed finish off a deflected corner, from which the only reason Vidal wasn\u2019t miles offside was because the ball bounced back to him off an opponent\u2019s leg. They did so at the team that have won once all season. Yes, Piqu\u00e9 hit the post, and Pichu Cu\u00e9llar made a superb save from Luis Su\u00e1rez. Yes, Barcelona had most of the ball. And, no, conditions weren\u2019t good. But this was no siege, no avalanche of opportunities, and no one-off. Instead, Butarque laid Barcelona bare.</p> \n<p>Barcelona started with four forwards and no idea, an empty space where one of the <em>interiores</em> should be, playing a sort of 4-1-1-1-3, maybe a 4-2-4, if you could call it anything at all. Slow, lacking ideas, barely able to open up lines of passes, they gave the ball away 135 times. Most the time, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say they didn\u2019t know what to do.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/25/lucien-favre-borussia-dortmund-horror-show-bundesliga-german-football\">Lucien Favre hanging by a thread after Dortmund horror show | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI try to read my teammates\u2019 movements, but it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Antoine Griezmann said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s all new for me. I still don\u2019t understand the runs of Su\u00e1rez, Messi or Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. I still lack the confidence to pass or shoot, but it will come.\u201d Forced into a left-sided role, nor do they understand his movements and if it might come, it hasn\u2019t yet. The case of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, now in his third season, is even more startling. Neither man did anything of note on Saturday. Again. In midfield, Frenkie de Jong is the only regular starter imposing any rhythm on the game, and he\u2019s finding his options limited. At the back, they\u2019re overrun when pressed, lacking focus and football. But their dysfunction was most noticeable was at full-back, where Junior Firpo didn\u2019t know where to go or what to do, unable or unwilling to overlap.</p> \n<p>This was not Saturday, this was systemic. Deeper even than that: it goes to the top, speaks to a culture, an environment where players are accommodated, Barcelona \u201closing the ball, their play, their soul\u201d in the words of El Pa\u00eds\u2019s Ram\u00f3n Besa; a place where there is little leadership or clear direction. It was striking to hear Piqu\u00e9, the organiser of the Davis Cup who admitted that some nights he sleeps only four or five hours and who spent the last few days travelling back and forth to Madrid, say that his manager asked <em>him</em> what the plan was this week. And it is hard to avoid the suspicion that Barcelona will pay for it. Already have, in fact: you can\u2019t demand a team wins all the time, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/10/roma-barcelona-champions-league-quarter-final-match-report\">Rome</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">Liverpool</a> were not just isolated accidents and 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/06/barcelona-juventus-luis-suarez\">Barcelona\u2019s last Champions League success</a>, feels a long way away now.</p> \n<p>Win on Wednesday against Dortmund and they\u2019re through; lose, though, and they will have to go to Milan needing a victory. Next Sunday they face Atl\u00e9tico at the Metropolitano. Barcelona have only won four of their last 15 Champions League games away, and they have won fewer than half their league games away this season. Defeated three times this season \u2013 as many times as in the whole of last year, three times as many as in the year before \u2013 this is their worst start on the road for eighteen years. In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/real-madrid-real-sociedad-la-liga-match-report\">Real Madrid are starting to come good</a>. Winning when you\u2019re not playing well is a sign of a title-winning team, they say, but just as often it\u2019s the sign of a team reality will soon catch up with.

      "bodyText": "Barcelona beat Legan\u00e9s 2-1 at Butarque on Saturday afternoon and are top of the table. Undefeated, they also lead their Champions League group, ahead of Internazionale and Borussia Dortmund. Win on Wednesday night and they will be mathematically qualified from the competition\u2019s hardest group with a game to spare. They have lost just one of their last 11 matches, winning nine, and have scored more league goals than anybody in Spain: seven more than second-placed Real Madrid and more than twice as many as Athletic Bilbao in fifth, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in fourth and Sevilla in third. When they played Sevilla, they put four past them. They stuck four more past Celta and five past Betis, Valencia and Valladolid. They have the striker who scored 115 over the last four La Liga seasons, more than anyone except that guy, and they have that guy too \u2013 the best player in their history and maybe anybody else\u2019s history either. They won last season\u2019s league, making it four of five, and were a goal off a probable treble. Then they signed Europe\u2019s two most wanted players, even if neither was their players\u2019 most wanted: the \u20ac75m midfielder made for them, voted Europe\u2019s best, and the summer\u2019s joint most expensive footballer at \u20ac126m. Their new front three had scored 401 league goals in five years; their goalkeeper might be Spain\u2019s best; they signed the full-back Bayern, Madrid, City chased; have the kid exciting everyone; and this weekend\u2019s starting XI cost \u20ac489m. And they\u2019re not very good. A few days ago in his latest interview squeezed between sets at the Davis Cup, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 insisted: \u201cIf we\u2019re top, we can\u2019t be playing that badly.\u201d But, yes, they can. A couple of days later, Ernesto Valverde asked why so many questions start with are you worried that\u2026?, when the answer is obvious: because they\u2019re worried. And it\u2019s not going away; it\u2019s getting worse. That day, Ernesto Valverde said he always leaves the press room suddenly \u201cworried about a whole load of things\u201d; on Saturday, he laughed when a journalist sought a way of asking if he was worried without asking if he was worried, but they still were, even if he wasn\u2019t \u2013 or wasn\u2019t showing it. More, in fact, than ever before. The headline on the front of Sport summed it up: \u201cA worrying victory.\u201d Another one. Saturday\u2019s result against Legan\u00e9s is an improvement on last year \u2013 Barcelona were beaten then \u2013 but nothing else is. A goal down after 12 minutes, Youssef En-Nesyri bending a beautiful shot into the top corner, Barcelona turned it around with strikes from Luis Su\u00e1rez and substitute Arturo Vidal. Afterwards Valverde admitted it \u201cwasn\u2019t brilliant\u201d, which was one way of putting it. Check the papers and there were others: \u201cabhorrent,\u201d \u201cfrightening,\u201d \u201cfilthy\u201d. Most importantly, it felt like a portrait of what Barcelona have become. As Francisco Cabezas neatly put it in El Mundo: \u201cArturo Vidal rescued Ernesto Valverde\u2019s Barcelona at the team that\u2019s bottom. It\u2019s impossible to find a better metaphor for our times.\u201d If that might not be entirely fair on Vidal, the man everyone except the four-year-old with the mohican and the biro beard loves to hate when they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 Vidal is much more Bar\u00e7a than it seems, the one midfielder to press, move, run, score goals \u2013 there was something in it. \u201cArturo Vital,\u201d ran the front page of El Mundo Deportivo, and when he is vital, coming on to rescue you, there is a problem. \u201cThe feelings we\u2019re left with are bad ones,\u201d the Chilean admitted. A win does not hide that, or shouldn\u2019t. Barcelona started by gifting Martin Braithwaite an opportunity inside two minutes and completed a comeback thanks to a header from a free-kick and a scuffed finish off a deflected corner, from which the only reason Vidal wasn\u2019t miles offside was because the ball bounced back to him off an opponent\u2019s leg. They did so at the team that have won once all season. Yes, Piqu\u00e9 hit the post, and Pichu Cu\u00e9llar made a superb save from Luis Su\u00e1rez. Yes, Barcelona had most of the ball. And, no, conditions weren\u2019t good. But this was no siege, no avalanche of opportunities, and no one-off. Instead, Butarque laid Barcelona bare. Barcelona started with four forwards and no idea, an empty space where one of the interiores should be, playing a sort of 4-1-1-1-3, maybe a 4-2-4, if you could call it anything at all. Slow, lacking ideas, barely able to open up lines of passes, they gave the ball away 135 times. Most the time, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say they didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cI try to read my teammates\u2019 movements, but it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Antoine Griezmann said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s all new for me. I still don\u2019t understand the runs of Su\u00e1rez, Messi or Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. I still lack the confidence to pass or shoot, but it will come.\u201d Forced into a left-sided role, nor do they understand his movements and if it might come, it hasn\u2019t yet. The case of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, now in his third season, is even more startling. Neither man did anything of note on Saturday. Again. In midfield, Frenkie de Jong is the only regular starter imposing any rhythm on the game, and he\u2019s finding his options limited. At the back, they\u2019re overrun when pressed, lacking focus and football. But their dysfunction was most noticeable was at full-back, where Junior Firpo didn\u2019t know where to go or what to do, unable or unwilling to overlap. This was not Saturday, this was systemic. Deeper even than that: it goes to the top, speaks to a culture, an environment where players are accommodated, Barcelona \u201closing the ball, their play, their soul\u201d in the words of El Pa\u00eds\u2019s Ram\u00f3n Besa; a place where there is little leadership or clear direction. It was striking to hear Piqu\u00e9, the organiser of the Davis Cup who admitted that some nights he sleeps only four or five hours and who spent the last few days travelling back and forth to Madrid, say that his manager asked him what the plan was this week. And it is hard to avoid the suspicion that Barcelona will pay for it. Already have, in fact: you can\u2019t demand a team wins all the time, but Rome and Liverpool were not just isolated accidents and 2015, Barcelona\u2019s last Champions League success, feels a long way away now. Win on Wednesday against Dortmund and they\u2019re through; lose, though, and they will have to go to Milan needing a victory. Next Sunday they face Atl\u00e9tico at the Metropolitano. Barcelona have only won four of their last 15 Champions League games away, and they have won fewer than half their league games away this season. Defeated three times this season \u2013 as many times as in the whole of last year, three times as many as in the year before \u2013 this is their worst start on the road for eighteen years. In the meantime, Real Madrid are starting to come good. Winning when you\u2019re not playing well is a sign of a title-winning team, they say, but just as often it\u2019s the sign of a team reality will soon catch up with. Only one of their last seven goals has been scored from open play. If you don\u2019t know why you won, you won\u2019t know why you lose either. If there is no clear system, the system becomes Messi. Instead of taking refuge in the structure, they take refuge in him \u2013 which says something about personality as well as play, about the lack of a model offering alternatives. And while give the ball to the best player there may have ever been might be a logical enough plan sometimes, it can\u2019t be your only plan. It becomes an abdication, removing responsibility, weakening them and him. Just because he often does it \u201calone\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he should. Or even that he wants to. There is a reason Messi wanted Neymar \u2013 a player who was not only good but knew it. It is often said Barcelona were not that good over the last two years with Valverde but it is not entirely true. The flaws were there, deepened at Anfield but not created there. They have been better than anyone else in Spain, and if it was not pure, if they were losing their religion, it was sometimes good. If this was coming, it wasn\u2019t here yet \u2013 not always, not quite like this. This is worse; there\u2019s a better squad but their problems weren\u2019t addressed, including the role of their manager. And now they\u2019re all exposed. On a cold, windy Saturday in Madrid, Barcelona beat Legan\u00e9s to stay top of the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it as a good thing,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cWe had to win any way we could.\u201d Outside, the team bus was waiting. Blue and orange, unmarked, as it headed out of Butarque and down the road, no one could tell it was Barcelona on board.",

      "body": "<p>While Rob McCracken sits through a meeting that is partly about Anthony Joshua\u2019s ring walk before he fights Andy Ruiz Jr in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/20/anthony-joshua-primed-heavyweight-rematch-andy-ruiz-jr\" title=\"\">intriguing rematch on 7 December</a>, there is time to wander around the Sheffield dream factory where he has been the understated foreman for the past 10 years. McCracken was appointed the performance director of GB Boxing in November 2009 and the transformation over the past decade has been staggering.</p> <p>When he was offered the job McCracken was best known as being Carl Froch\u2019s trainer \u2013 just as he now comes under fierce scrutiny in Joshua\u2019s corner. The way in which McCracken has managed to blend the contrasting worlds of amateur and professional boxing, for the benefit of all his fighters, is just one of the fascinating features in a story which reaches another milestone period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/23/deontay-wilder-luis-ortiz-fight-tyson-fury\">Deontay Wilder blasts Ortiz to defend title, then confirms Tyson Fury rematch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Apart from his 10-year anniversary in Sheffield, where he runs such a successful programme at the English Institute of Sport, McCracken faces a defining test in the unpalatable setting of Saudi Arabia as Joshua tries to win back the WBA, IBF and WBO world heavyweight titles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/anthony-joshua-andy-ruiz-jr-boxing-heavyweight-title-fight\" title=\"\">he lost so shockingly against Ruiz</a> in New York during the summer.</p> <p>McCracken is too modest to talk up his achievements with GB and so, while meeting a few of his current boxers in the gleaming gym and adjoining training facilities, it helps to check the bare statistics. In the past 10 years GB\u2019s male boxers have won 52 medals at 14 major competitions. Before he took over, from 2000 to 2008 the country\u2019s best amateur fighters had won only 12 medals in 13 major competitions. There was no female boxing programme until 2010 but, since then, GB\u2019s men and women have won 81 major medals between them.</p> <p>Under McCracken\u2019s leadership GB Boxing won eight Olympic medals at London 2012 and Rio 2016.

We start with him being asked in 2009 by Derek Mapp, the then chairman of GB Boxing, to take charge of the country\u2019s elite amateur boxers. \u201cDerek was a no-nonsense businessman and the first thing he said was: \u2018What do you need for the boxers? Whatever the boxer needs, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u2019 That was his strategy and it worked fantastically well. It\u2019s been run really well and I have been allowed to get on and work with the team here, the coaches, the support staff. Obviously the boxers come first and we\u2019ve been able to get on with it.\u201d</p> <p>In his typically downbeat way, McCracken lets slip a wry smile as he enjoys a slurp of his tea before taking a bite of a chocolate bar. It\u2019s one way of celebrating sustained success. \u201cI always tell my boxers you\u2019re only as good as your last tournament \u2013 and that was the world championships in Russia [last month],\u201d McCracken adds in his familiar Birmingham accent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecc8fcd48c391494691aff6a6c5ad33e9e255948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecc8fcd48c391494691aff6a6c5ad33e9e255948/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob McCracken.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rob McCracken.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What were his impressions of Joshua when they began working together in Sheffield? \u201cHe arrived here in October 2010 with Anthony Farrell.

That was my first conversation with big Josh. He accepted my decision and got on with it.</p> <p>\u201cI took him to the European Championships in 2011 in Turkey. He wasn\u2019t super fit but I thought I\u2019ll let him know how hard this sport is, we\u2019ll see if he wants it. He did better than we thought and had three bouts in five days \u2013 which was more than he\u2019d had in the previous three months. He got tired in the third bout and lost in the quarters. He said to me on the plane afterwards: \u2018I\u2019m going to get fit so that won\u2019t happen again.\u2019 He was really driven and, unlike your normal kid, really believed in himself.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that sticks out with Anthony is when they did the 2012 Olympic draw in London. I said to the other coaches: \u2018I want him to avoid the Cuban but I know he\u2019ll get him.\u2019 He drew the Cuban. Luke Campbell was a little concerned about drawing a tough Italian but Josh just said: \u2018What time are we eating?\u2019 He didn\u2019t care who he drew. That\u2019s rare.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/team-gb-medal-success-anthony-joshua\" title=\"\">Campbell and Joshua won gold in London</a> but, as a heavyweight, the big man\u2019s life changed fundamentally.

But McCracken argued before the fight that Ruiz was dangerous. \u201cI was happy for Josh to box in the UK, where he feels comfortable,\u201d he says now. \u201cGoing to the States was always a challenge. He was very motivated to fight Miller as it was personal between them. He changes five weeks before, when Ruiz comes in. Ruiz is an exceptional fighter. Yeah, he\u2019s a tubby guy but all the Hispanic fighters, like Canelo [\u00c1lvarez], rate him highly. But people on the internet are saying: \u2018Oh, this bloke is hopeless.\u2019 The main thing for me was Miller pulling out.

I much preferred a couple of other opponents.\u201d</p> <p>McCracken was criticised vehemently as the losing trainer on social media. There were demands he should be sacked while Joshua also suffered verbal abuse. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019ve achieved,\u201d McCracken says. \u201cYou get constant criticism. If you lose it really hits the fighter hard. The magical thing about the Olympic programme is you see them lose a close fight. They\u2019re very disappointed. Two days later they\u2019re shouting for their teammates in the stand.</p> <p>\u201cThe loneliness is deeper in professional boxing and social media makes it far worse. My generation can cope easily with social media because we don\u2019t turn it on. I\u2019m pretty robust and know that\u2019s coming but with the younger generation it\u2019s much harder. When you lose at Josh\u2019s level it can be ugly.\u201d</p> <p>It will be fascinating to see whether Ruiz has been affected by his own sudden fame and wealth. If he has retained his desire then his style could once again be a nightmare for Joshua. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/21/josh-taylor-boxing-interview\" title=\"\">McCracken listens when I say </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/21/josh-taylor-boxing-interview\" title=\"\">Josh Taylor</a>, arguably the best fighter in Britain today and another of his former amateurs at London 2012, told me Joshua has always struggled against smaller heavyweights with fast hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fd310c1e59fb85c647d0500a672180f1965dbb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fd310c1e59fb85c647d0500a672180f1965dbb9/122_114_3034_1821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Joshua works out with Rob McCracken at the Institute of Sport in October 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Joshua (right) works out with Rob McCracken at the institute in October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s beaten numerous small, mobile heavyweights and he\u2019s lost to a couple of them,\u201d McCracken says as he looks back over the nine years he has trained Joshua. \u201cSometimes fighters are just good.

      "bodyText": "While Rob McCracken sits through a meeting that is partly about Anthony Joshua\u2019s ring walk before he fights Andy Ruiz Jr in their intriguing rematch on 7 December, there is time to wander around the Sheffield dream factory where he has been the understated foreman for the past 10 years. McCracken was appointed the performance director of GB Boxing in November 2009 and the transformation over the past decade has been staggering. When he was offered the job McCracken was best known as being Carl Froch\u2019s trainer \u2013 just as he now comes under fierce scrutiny in Joshua\u2019s corner. The way in which McCracken has managed to blend the contrasting worlds of amateur and professional boxing, for the benefit of all his fighters, is just one of the fascinating features in a story which reaches another milestone period. Apart from his 10-year anniversary in Sheffield, where he runs such a successful programme at the English Institute of Sport, McCracken faces a defining test in the unpalatable setting of Saudi Arabia as Joshua tries to win back the WBA, IBF and WBO world heavyweight titles he lost so shockingly against Ruiz in New York during the summer. McCracken is too modest to talk up his achievements with GB and so, while meeting a few of his current boxers in the gleaming gym and adjoining training facilities, it helps to check the bare statistics. In the past 10 years GB\u2019s male boxers have won 52 medals at 14 major competitions. Before he took over, from 2000 to 2008 the country\u2019s best amateur fighters had won only 12 medals in 13 major competitions. There was no female boxing programme until 2010 but, since then, GB\u2019s men and women have won 81 major medals between them. Under McCracken\u2019s leadership GB Boxing won eight Olympic medals at London 2012 and Rio 2016. This matches their boxing medal count at the previous eight Olympics, from Moscow in 1980 to Beijing in 2008. The fighters he has helped to produce in Sheffield include world champions and top-10 boxers in the professional ranks \u2013 from Joshua, Josh Taylor, Callum Smith, Luke Campbell and Nicola Adams to Charlie Edwards, Khalid Yafai, Joe Joyce, Daniel Dubois and Lawrence Okolie. The meeting about the gaudy ring walk in Saudi breaks up and, for the next 45 minutes, McCracken talks engagingly about his decade in the job and the compelling rematch with Ruiz. We start with him being asked in 2009 by Derek Mapp, the then chairman of GB Boxing, to take charge of the country\u2019s elite amateur boxers. \u201cDerek was a no-nonsense businessman and the first thing he said was: \u2018What do you need for the boxers?

It\u2019s one way of celebrating sustained success. \u201cI always tell my boxers you\u2019re only as good as your last tournament \u2013 and that was the world championships in Russia [last month],\u201d McCracken adds in his familiar Birmingham accent. What were his impressions of Joshua when they began working together in Sheffield? \u201cHe arrived here in October 2010 with Anthony Farrell.

I was eight years old when I first picked up The Northern Lights. Headstrong, tomboyish and bossy as hell at that age, I felt an immediate connection with the protagonist Lyra and her daemon Pan. The third installment was the first book to ever make me weep. The trilogy as a whole was the first push I&#39;d felt to travel, to leave the little island I called home and see the world. Well, you all know how that ended. Like me, Lyra is now an adult, an aspiring scholar and an anxious young woman. Flashes of her former confidence burn through, but her character has become infinitely more complex in a way that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to appreciate had I not, also, felt the scratch of the years on my skin and heart. Even her relationship with her daemon, her soul, herself, is complicated. I feel the burn of their frustration even without having an animal incarnation of myself out in the world with me. It rubs at that sensitive crease between my ribs, knowing how often I punish myself, resent myself, am disappointed in myself. Every page I turn gives me butterflies, in a way that no book has in almost twenty years. And the world has never felt so large. __ QOTD: What is your most anticipated book?

Looking forward to the sequel.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the subject of old school scifi, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2238842\">FrogC </a>recommends RC Sherriff\u2019s <em>The Hopkins Manuscript</em>, an apocalyptic novel first published in 1939:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Must apocalypse novels are set after the apocalypse, depicting the way the survivors coped with the situation. In this case, the apocalypse takes place halfway through, and the characters know it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s an idea that sounds whimsical at first - the moon has been jolted out of its orbit and is gong to crash into the earth. The book starts as comedy: the narrator, Edgar Hopkins, is a Pooterish figure, smug, reclusive, lacking any self-knowledge and obsessed with keeping chickens. His narrative voice can be very funny:</p> <p>\u201cAunt Rose had grown stout in recent years, but she possessed the finest collection in England of old coloured prints of stage coaches that had overturned in snowdrifts.\u201d</p> <p>But as the moon approaches, now huge and terrible, even Edgar starts to become sensitive, and we see, movingly, that he\u2019s capable of disinterested love. The drama and pathos of the last week before the disaster is very powerful. He survives, of course, to tell his story, and the novel is now in the cosy catastrophe phase familiar from the work of John Wyndham. The Hopkins Manuscript is at least in that class, and arguably better. I\u2019m enjoying it immensely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yoko Ogawa\u2019s The Memory Police has given <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3165651\">captainlego</a> pause for thought:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It reads like a fable, and is beautifully written in spare, lucid prose. It\u2019s a quite a meditative book; I found it slowed me down as I wanted to savour her poetic style. It\u2019s quite a sad book, but in a gentle, resigned way \u2026 The novel acts more as a gentle examination of memory, love, friendship and most significantly, loss.</p> </blockquote> <p>Swimming Home by Deborah Levy has unsettled <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16923438\">alegnayelkcub</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although it\u2019s short I had to take my time over it and I kept rereading sections. I liked the repetition in the book and the way the heat and languor of the place were conveyed. Found it quite an unsettling read.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s In the Lake of the Woods is impressing <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3231012\">writeronthestorm</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So far, so great. Ahead of it\u2019s time in terms of structure, as it pretty much reads like a Netflix true crime original with a superb structure of what I assume to be flashbacks and news reports, interviews, police case notes, quotes, etc. that start to build up a deeply unnerving view of what may have happened to the wife of a prominent, recently defeated politician as they take a sojourn in the eponymous Lake of the Woods. It really is excellent, as it peels back the layers of their relationship and the husband\u2019s past.</p> </blockquote> <p>Persevering with Zadie Smith\u2019s NW has paid off for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1855544\">mycittavritti</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It took me quite a while to get through, but it certainly turned out to be worth the read. I posted a couple of weeks back that I was struggling with it, and someone helpfully pointed out that Smith seems to do characters better than she does plot/structure. That seems to be the case with <em>NW</em>. I had initially read it because it\u2019s been on my shelf for over five years and I was hoping to take it to the used bookstore to clear up some space, but after I read the last page I actually kind of wanted to go back and read it again. I suspect I\u2019d get a lot more out of it if I did.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101510359\">CCCubbon </a>has something good cooking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s a book I go back to time and time again, an old cookery book called Cakes and Cake Decorating by Rosemary Wadey. It\u2019s a soft-covered book, which over the years has become sticky and stained. You can tell which cakes and pastries I make most often by the amount of debris, scratchy notes and missing bits on a page. My edition dates from 1983 and there was a later reprint in 1985. It is out of print but secondhand ones appear. It\u2019s my cake making bible ... it\u2019s an easy fruit cake today that\u2019s cooling now.</p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds delicious.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://bookninja.com/page/1/\">Bookninja</a> has stealthily returned to the fray.</p></li> <li><p>An LGBTQ friendly book <a href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/lgbtq-friendly-book-removed-from-library-for-fear-of-turning-children-gay/\">has been removed</a> from a library for fear of turning children gay.</p></li> <li><p>The Oxford Dictionary word of the year is <a href=\"https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2019?utm_campaign=book_club&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=Newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_books&amp;wpmm=1\">climate emergency</a>.

It really is excellent, as it peels back the layers of their relationship and the husband\u2019s past. Persevering with Zadie Smith\u2019s NW has paid off for mycittavritti: It took me quite a while to get through, but it certainly turned out to be worth the read. I posted a couple of weeks back that I was struggling with it, and someone helpfully pointed out that Smith seems to do characters better than she does plot/structure. That seems to be the case with NW. I had initially read it because it\u2019s been on my shelf for over five years and I was hoping to take it to the used bookstore to clear up some space, but after I read the last page I actually kind of wanted to go back and read it again. I suspect I\u2019d get a lot more out of it if I did. Finally, CCCubbon has something good cooking: There\u2019s a book I go back to time and time again, an old cookery book called Cakes and Cake Decorating by Rosemary Wadey. It\u2019s a soft-covered book, which over the years has become sticky and stained. You can tell which cakes and pastries I make most often by the amount of debris, scratchy notes and missing bits on a page. My edition dates from 1983 and there was a later reprint in 1985. It is out of print but secondhand ones appear. It\u2019s my cake making bible ... it\u2019s an easy fruit cake today that\u2019s cooling now. That sounds delicious. Interesting links about books and reading Bookninja has stealthily returned to the fray. An LGBTQ friendly book has been removed from a library for fear of turning children gay. The Oxford Dictionary word of the year is climate emergency. (I know that\u2019s two words. I don\u2019t make the rules.) The BBC on the best first lines in fiction. \u201cWe\u2019re told the Queen has carpeted Andrew\u2026\u201d So wrote Clive James in 1983.

This was the first positive expectations balance since June </p> <p>It also may well be that some consumers have recently held back on their retail sales, waiting for Black Friday price cuts and promotions in the latter part of November.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. Encouraging economic data from Germany and the UK have raised optimism in the markets, alongside another dose of trade war optimism. German business confidence has picked up this month, according to the IFO survey. Businesses are more upbeat about future prospects, despite the ongoing factory recession. After months of tough trading, UK retailers have reported that the situation stabilised this month. This may be a sign that Christmas spending will hold up well. Here\u2019s the full story: Hong Kong\u2019s stock market has surged, after pro-democracy candidates swept to victory in council elections today. Transport for London has refused to renew Uber\u2019s licence, saying the ride-hailing site hasn\u2019t done enough to protect customers. Uber plans to appeal, and says the decision is unfair. China has announced new protections for intellectual property rights - a key demand of US negotiators. This could be a sign that the two sides are nearing a preliminary trade deal, following optimistic comments from Donald Trump in recent days. There\u2019s a double-dose of deal fever today, with LVMH buying Tiffany\u2019s and Viagogo snapping up StubHub. Shares in eBay have jumped 2.6% in early trading in New York, as traders welcome the sale of StubHub. But Uber is having a difficult day, with shares down almost 2% after London authorities refused to renew its licence (pending an appeal....). More takeover news: Online auction site Ebay has agreed to sell its online ticketing subsidiary StubHub to rival reseller Viagogo in a $4.05bn deal. StubHub was co-founded by Viagogo\u2019s creator, Eric Baker, during his time at business school, but left before the business was sold to eBay for $310 million in 2007. Baker says: \u201cIt has long been my wish to unite the two companies. I am so proud of how StubHub has grown over the years and excited about the possibilities for our shared future.\u201d Hopefully this \u2018shared future\u2019 won\u2019t include the controversies that have dogged Viagogo in the UK. A year ago it lost a legal battle that forced it to give more information about its sellers, including ticket touts. Viagogo was later banned from Google, after the search giant concluded it had violated its advertising rules. This hit its customer numbers sharply - down 80% in the UK.... UPDATED: Viagogo have reminded me that they have now been reinstated after working closely with Google, so that issue has been resolved. US farmers must be getting desperate for a trade war breakthrough. Data released today show that Chinese imports of American soybeans have hit a three-month low -- with Brazil taking up some of the slack. Optimism of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war is continuing to lift markets. In London the FTSE 100 is now 70 points higher at 7396, its highest level in nearly a week. Industrials, consumer cyclical firms and tech companies are among the risers, reflecting hopes that Washington and Beijing will (eventually) sign off a phase one trade deal. LVMH\u2019s capture of Tiffany\u2019s today (see earlier post) shows that the luxury end of retail is still hot, despite the global slowdown. Here\u2019s Kate Swaine, partner at legal firm Gowling WLG: It is interesting to witness further consolidation across the luxury goods sector, following hot on the heels of Michael Kors\u2019 2018 purchase of Versace. At a time when the retail market is challenging, the luxury end of the sector has proved resilient to the slowdown in economic growth. This purchase demonstrates the appetite for investment and expansion even at the heights of the sector. Gareth Shaw, Head of Money, Which?, fears TSB customers will lose out once it shuts 86 of its branches across the UK: \u201cBank customers are still enduring almost daily IT glitches, which is why everyday banking services and access to cash - which is a vital back-up - must be protected. The next government should urgently intervene with legislation that protects access to cash for as long as it is needed. Britain\u2019s financial sector continues to shed staff at a heady rate, as banks try to slash costs and keep up with technological changes. Today the ace is hovering over TSB, which is planning to shut 86 branches - one in seven of its estate - just six years after being spun out of Lloyds. That will eliminate up to 400 jobs - grim news in the run-up to Christmas. Uber\u2019s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has hit out at Transport for London\u2019s decision not to renew his company\u2019s licence. He insists Uber has made \u2018fundamental\u2019 changes, and will fight the ruling. But what about today\u2019s revelation that at least 14,000 Uber journeys took place with the \u2018wrong driver\u2019 at the wheel? London Mayor Sadiq Khan says this is unacceptable; Uber hasn\u2019t yet proved it has \u2018robust\u2019 procedures in place to prevent a repeat. (the company, though, will point to its facial recognition work that could thwart rogue drivers who upload their own photos). The improved CBI retail sales report could be a sign that shoppers will hit the high street with gusto this Christmas. So argues Howard Archer of the EY Item Club: The CBI survey offers the retailers genuine hope that consumers are prepared to loosen their purse strings for the critical Christmas period; and suggests that some of the recent lacklustre sales performance has been due to consumers taking a breather before splashing out over the festive season. The survey indicates that retailers are relatively upbeat about the Christmas sales outlook for sales with a balance of +21% expecting sales volumes to be up year-on-year in December. This was the first positive expectations balance since June It also may well be that some consumers have recently held back on their retail sales, waiting for Black Friday price cuts and promotions in the latter part of November. However, the evidence of recent years suggests that Black Friday tends to have more of an impact in distorting the timing of retail sales rather than boosting them overall. Confirmation that retailers are reluctant to invest: Here\u2019s Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief Economist, on today\u2019s retail survey: \u201cRetailers are entering the festive season with a bit of hope that sales will head up, with the strongest expectations in half a year. Actual sales have also stabilised and have nudged above average for the time of year. And employment has stopped falling after three years of decline. But Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on investment plans for the year ahead which remain weak. Just in: The downturn in UK retail may be bottoming out, just in time for Christmas. The CBI\u2019s monthly survey of British retailers has found that sales were \u201cbroadly unchanged\u201d in November, ending a six-month run of falling demand. Retailers are more optimistic about future prospects too. Many growth to return in the year to December, with their strongest expectations in seven months. However, suppliers reported another drop in demand, suggesting that shop owners are still cautious. Here are the main findings: 38% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago in November, while 41% said they were down, giving a balance of -3% - the highest balance in 7 months Retailers expect sales volumes to increase in the year to December (+21%), with 44% expecting a rise and 23% expecting a fall Sales were seen as above average for the time of year to the greatest extent since April: 38% reported sales for the time of year as good and 30% reported them as bad, giving a rounded balance of +8%. This is expected to improve further in December (+15%) Orders placed upon suppliers fell for the seventh consecutive month in annual terms: 32% reported an increase while 42% reported a fall, giving a rounded balance of -9%. Retailers expect a recovery in orders growth next month (+12%) Uber has hit back, saying it is \u201cextraordinary and wrong\u201d of TFL not to renew its London licence. The company says it has audited all its London drivers in the last two months, and is setting up a new \u201cfacial matching\u201d process to protect passengers. It also confirms it will appeal, meaning it can keep operating. Fans of Uber shouldn\u2019t delete the app quite yet, though. If Uber appeals this morning\u2019s ruling (which surely it will), it can keep operating in the UK capital through the extra-busy Christmas period. Here\u2019s the full story on Uber getting the red card in London. Alarmingly, TFL says that at least 14,000 Uber journeys were carried out by unauthorised drivers, who managed to upload their photos into other drivers\u2019 accounts. That allowed them to appear to be legitimate Uber operatives (who would have been through its vetting procedure). But they could actually have been uninsured, and a potential safety risk. NEWSFLASH: Ride-hailing service Uber has been refused a new licence to operate in London. Transport for London has concluded that Uber is not a fit and proper company to hold a licence to operate private hire vehicles in the capital. TFL says it cannot renew Uber\u2019s licence, due to a \u201cpattern of failures\u201d which put passenger safety at risk. This includes allowing unauthorised drivers to operate as Uber operatives, carrying out thousands of journeys. Uber has 21 days to appeal the decision, TFL says, and can keep operating while the appeal process is running.... Economist Daniel Lacalle points out that Germany\u2019s economy still looks weak, even if business conditions are improving: Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, says the economy appears to be bottoming out - but not recovering strongly. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s rise in business confidence: Germany\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, just added more evidence to a tentative bottoming out of the German economy. The Ifo index increased to 95.0 in November, from 94.7 in October. This is the third month in a row with an increasing Ifo index, after 17 drops in 21 months. In November, both the current assessment and expectations component increased. However, before anyone gets overly cheerful, the headline number is still not even back at its July level. Brzeski adds: It is part of Germany\u2019s new economic modesty to appreciate a tiny increase in the Ifo index. Better than another disappointment. However, while today\u2019s Ifo index suggests that the economy, and above all, the manufacturing sector, could be in a phase of bottoming out, a sharp rebound is not yet near. Thee pick-up in German business optimism, after a largely torrid year, is welcome, say trading platform BP Prime: This tweet shows how German business optimism had been falling steadily since early 2018: The key points from IFO\u2019s healthcheck on Germany: IFO reckons that this Christmas will be \u201cvery good\u201d for German businesses, following today\u2019s pick-up in confidence. It predicts that the economy will grow by 0.2% in the current quarter, following the 0.1% growth in Q3, led by consumer spending, construction, and the government. But, the institute is still concerned that Germany\u2019s factory sector is shrinking, so it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d to say the economy has turned around. IFO chief economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters: \u201cCompanies tell us that industrial order backlogs are still not satisfactory,\u201d Newsflash: German business morale has risen this month, after Europe\u2019s largest economy surprisingly avoided falling into recession. The Munich-based IFO Institute has just reported that its business climate index has risen to 95.0, up from 94.7 in October (revised slightly higher this morning). The survey found that companies are more upbeat about their future prospects, with current conditions marginally better too. Here\u2019s the details: Current conditions index: 97.9, UP from 97.8 Economic expectations: 92.1, UP from 91.5 But, IFO also warns that Germany\u2019s factory sector is still in recession This is the first IFO report since Germany officially returned to growth, with GDP expanding by 0.1% in July-September. More to follow! China\u2019s Global Times newspaper is reporting that Beijing and Washington are \u201cvery close\u201d to a phase one trade deal. It also criticised \u201cnegative\u201d media reports claiming that the negotiations are in trouble. That\u2019s significant, as the tabloid is controlled by China\u2019s communist party. China\u2019s government hasn\u2019t given up hopes of a deal either. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang has reiterated that Beijing would like Washington to work with it to resolve the outstanding trade issues on a basis of equality and mutual respect, Reuters reports. European stock markets are starting the new week on the front foot too. Here\u2019s the opening moves: FTSE 100: up 46 points at 7,373, up 0.6% Germany\u2019s DAX: up 98 points at 13,261, up 0.75% French CAC: up 30 points at 5,923, up 0.5% Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Beijing\u2019s compromise on IP protection is lifting equities. We\u2019ve had progress in an important area \u2013 China has appeared to relent to a degree on intellectual property, a key sticking point to the talks thus far. Beijing on Sunday said it will increase penalties for IP violations, and lower the bar for criminal proceedings to be brought in cases of alleged IP theft. This could be an important step forward, but we as ever will only believe it when we see it. The focus is on agreeing some kind of phase one deal before the Dec 15th deadline for about $150bn in tariffs to raise. Deal news: The luxury group behind fashion chain Louis Vuitton and champagne maker Mo\u00ebt Hennessy has swooped on jewellery chain Tiffany &amp; Co. LMVH is paying $16.2bn for Tiffany\u2019s, the two firms just announced. It says: The acquisition of Tiffany will strengthen LVMH\u2019s position in jewelry and further increase its presence in the United States. Both companies had been hurt by the protests in Hong Kong, which drove tourists away and disrupted its retail sector. Before the Hong Kong election got underway, China made an intriguing concession on intellectual property protection. Beijing said it would raise the penalties for violating IP rights, and make it easier to bring claims of alleged infringement. This has been a key demand from Washington during the ongoing trade talks. All the major Asia-Pacific markets are higher today, following the Hong Kong election results. The Hang Seng is the best performer (+1.5%), followed by South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+1%), China\u2019s CSI300 (+0.7%), and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 (+0.3%). Hopes of a trade war breakthrough are also a factor, points out Kyle Rodda of IG: Naturally, the Hang Seng is hypersensitive to trade-war developments, and the weekend\u2019s positive news on that front has boosted Hong Kong stocks. But on top of that, the market seems to have taken kindly to the weekend\u2019s Hong Kong\u2019s district council election results, which saw pro-democracy candidates capture significant gains. More importantly, the weekend\u2019s vote past without a major escalation in street violence between police and protesters. The election results are a turning point, and \u201ca slap on the cheek\u201d for Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam\u2019s administration, say political analysts. My colleague Verna Yu explains: Pro-democracy politicians took control of nearly all of the city\u2019s 18 district councils in what analysts said was a unanimous vote of no confidence in the government. Joseph Cheng, retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong people had seized the opportunity to express their dissatisfaction in the government and wanted to put pressure on the government to respond to their political demands. \u201cThey have not given up on their support for the pro-democracy camp and the protesters,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThis is a slap on the cheek for Carrie Lam\u2019s administration who insisted that the silent majority was supporting the government.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is sizzling today, after pro-democracy candidates secured a stunning win in the City\u2019s district council elections. Amid a record turnout, pro-democracy activists swept to victory = and will now control 17 of the 18 councils in the region. The news has driven shares higher, on hopes that the result raises the chances of a peaceful resolution to the crisis. It certainly undermines claims that most Hong Kong citizens approve of the administrations hard-line approach. Many young, first-time candidates ousted experienced, pro-Beijing councillors, in a key test of public opinion following months of demonstrations and increasingly violent clashes that have gripped Hong Kong and driven it into recession. The surprise success of the Civil Human Rights Fronts (CHRF) group is a boost for the pro-democracy movement, and a bruising blow to pro-Beijing DAB party. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index has leapt by 1.5%, up 411 points to 27,006. Stephen Innes of AxiTrader explains: Risk assets have opened favourably in the wake of a sensational voter turn out in Hong Kong, where the pro-democracy camp was headed for a stunning victory. And what\u2019s equally remarkable is that 71 % of registered voters cast their ballots, suggesting it will be difficult for Beijing to ignore these results for fear of greater international condemnation in the court of the public opinion. The people have spoken, and now the ball is in Beijing court. Here\u2019s our news story on the elections: We\u2019ll be tracking the financial reaction here. Also coming up today European stock markets are expected to open higher, lifted (not for the first time) by trade war optimism. Late last week, president Donald Trump said a deal with China was \u2018very close\u2019 - although such hopes have been dashed before... We also get a new healthcheck on German business confidence, and UK retail sales.

This was the home\u2019s side 11th victory in their past 16 on home soil (during which time they have lost once) and, in keeping with the resourceful character traits that have taken them to No 2 in the world, they did so without their spearhead Trent Boult on the final day because of a side injury. From the moment England collapsed on the second morning from 276 for four to 353 all out they lost control of the Test and a hammering resulted.

I\u2019m fond of the panto tradition whereby wickedly funny performers are deployed to send proceedings up and backchat shamelessly with the crowd. It\u2019s not observed here, in a show (directed by Tinuke Craig) that\u2019s strong on singing but relatively weak on comedy. Rhys Taylor\u2019s Fairy Fredbare is the nearest we get to an old-fashioned dame, but it\u2019s not near enough. As for Cinderella, we\u2019re told she\u2019s a wannabe astronomer, but otherwise (until a late blossoming) she\u2019s personality-lite. She seems fairly content skivvying for Shobna Gulati\u2019s Madame Meanie and being picked on \u2013 although we don\u2019t see much of this \u2013 by her \u201cSnuggly Sisters\u201d. But Jude Christian\u2019s script is sprightly: there\u2019s a nice number punning on tube stations (\u201cI\u2019ve got more of these if you can Stanmore. Or is that Morden enough?\u201d). And there\u2019s good work from Jodie Jacobs as the surprised-by-love sidekick and Gabriel Fleary as a shrinking violet prince. On hunting down the owner of the lost slipper: \u201cSize 6. Can\u2019t be many of those. This plan is foolproof.\u201d There should be enough, then, to satisfy families and festive fun-seekers \u2013 if nothing to make the heart soar. Pop-pickers can enjoy musical numbers co-opted from the charts: Cinders and her prince meet cute over Sheeran and Bieber; the show ends with a Shut Up and Dance routine. For all the progressive values, happily ever after still seems to require a proposal of marriage. But if the tension between trad and woke is never wholly resolved, you\u2019ll have (just) enough fun not to fret about it. At Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 5 January.",

He insisted, however, that his long and extraordinary political career is littered with such \u201cmade-up\u201d charges that have never deterred him before.</p> <p>Morales comes from an impoverished family of highland llama herders. They moved to the fertile Chapare region where they grew coca leaves, a traditional Bolivian crop used by locals as a mild stimulant, as well as by drug traffickers to make cocaine.</p> <p>During the 80s and 90s, Morales became a leading figure in the resistance to various eradication drives carried out under pressure from the US. His national profile grew when he was elected to congress in 1997 and expelled in 2002. He then helped lead a social uprising that forced the president, Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, out of office the following year.</p> <p>\u201cStruggle, struggle, struggle, struggle, that is where I come from,\u201d Morales said with obvious pride and some nostalgia.</p> <p>Morales was swept to power in the elections of 2005 and easily won a second term in 2009 and a third term in 2014.</p> <p>His governments brought stability to one of the world\u2019s most politically volatile countries marked by radical workers, peasant movements and a mind-boggling number of military coups. They also shook things up fundamentally by putting the indigenous majority at the centre of electoral politics and government, as well as by slashing poverty and keeping the economy growing with state-led investment.</p> <p>Loyalty to Morales waned, however, the longer he stayed in office. Even the former Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the leading light of the pink tide of leftist leaders that took power in Latin America in the noughties, said last week it was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/exclusive-bolsonaro-is-turning-back-the-clock-on-brazil-says-lula-da-silva\"> \u201ca mistake\u201d</a> for Morales to seek a fourth term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4f34e9926021d883e5bfd0caf26e119dfa6bf3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4f34e9926021d883e5bfd0caf26e119dfa6bf3f/0_111_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez being sworn in as interim president\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The rightwing senator Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez was sworn in as interim president after Morales fled to Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mercado/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morales was in no mood to agree. \u201cI did not look for the candidacy,\u201d he insisted on three occasions. \u201cThe organisations of the popular struggle asked me to be the candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Did he regret not rejecting them?</p> <p>\u201cI have nothing to regret because we won in the first round,\u201d he said, repeating his dismissal of the fraud charges that were backed by the Organization of American States. \u201cI have fulfilled the mandate of the people but these reactionaries can\u2019t deal with an indigenous candidate supported by the workers. That is class struggle.

      "bodyText": "Bolivia\u2019s ousted and exiled president, Evo Morales, says he has ruled out standing in his country\u2019s next elections to stop the existing crisis sliding into a broader civil or ethnic conflict. He told the Guardian: \u201cThis is what I am afraid of and it is what we have to avoid, which is why I am renouncing my candidacy. In the name of peace, sacrifices have to be made and I am sacrificing my candidacy even though I have every right to it.\u201d Morales, who became Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president when he took office in 2006, fled to Mexico on 11 November. This occurred three weeks after elections he claimed to have won sparked accusations of fraud and widespread protests, which culminated with the head of the army calling on him to go. The following day rightwing senator Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez swore herself in as interim president. At least 32 people have died since then, most of them reportedly in army crackdowns on pro-Morales protests. There have also been signs of social and racial tension between the mostly poor and indigenous protesters and wealthier onlookers. Bolivia\u2019s new interior minister, Arturo Murillo, has vowed to jail the former president for the rest of his life, accusing the exiled leftist of inciting anti-government protests that he claimed amounted to terrorism. From his new temporary home in Mexico City, Morales blamed the crisis in Bolivia on the \u201cracist and vengeful\u201d old elite he insisted has mounted a coup with the help of the US, which he described as the \u201cempire in the north\u201d. But he said his priority must now be helping to get the \u201cde facto government\u201d out by pushing it towards elections. \u201cThey say no to Evo, and so I say OK, no problem,\u201d he said. Morales was speaking as Bolivia\u2019s legislature, which is dominated by his Movement Towards Socialism party, was in the process of approving a law that would pave the way for new elections within a few months. It would also ban him from participating in them. \u00c1\u00f1ez signed the bill into law on Sunday. Morales admitted that part of the reason he had backed away from his vow to serve out his term until 22 January was because demands for his return had weakened. Talks between protest leaders and the interim government led to a promise on Sunday from \u00c1\u00f1ez to withdraw the military in exchange for lifting road blockades that had left several major cities hit by fuel and food shortages. \u201cThey are not renouncing their struggle against the coup,\u201d said Morales, who is living inside a Mexican military base and accompanied by plainclothes soldiers everywhere he goes. \u201cBut the truth is that of course people get tired after two weeks of resistance and so many dead.\u201d At the same time, the longtime icon of the Latin American left is facing efforts to prosecute him for terrorism and sedition. He insisted, however, that his long and extraordinary political career is littered with such \u201cmade-up\u201d charges that have never deterred him before. Morales comes from an impoverished family of highland llama herders. They moved to the fertile Chapare region where they grew coca leaves, a traditional Bolivian crop used by locals as a mild stimulant, as well as by drug traffickers to make cocaine. During the 80s and 90s, Morales became a leading figure in the resistance to various eradication drives carried out under pressure from the US. His national profile grew when he was elected to congress in 1997 and expelled in 2002. He then helped lead a social uprising that forced the president, Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, out of office the following year. \u201cStruggle, struggle, struggle, struggle, that is where I come from,\u201d Morales said with obvious pride and some nostalgia. Morales was swept to power in the elections of 2005 and easily won a second term in 2009 and a third term in 2014. His governments brought stability to one of the world\u2019s most politically volatile countries marked by radical workers, peasant movements and a mind-boggling number of military coups. They also shook things up fundamentally by putting the indigenous majority at the centre of electoral politics and government, as well as by slashing poverty and keeping the economy growing with state-led investment. Loyalty to Morales waned, however, the longer he stayed in office. Even the former Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the leading light of the pink tide of leftist leaders that took power in Latin America in the noughties, said last week it was \u201ca mistake\u201d for Morales to seek a fourth term. Morales was in no mood to agree. \u201cI did not look for the candidacy,\u201d he insisted on three occasions. \u201cThe organisations of the popular struggle asked me to be the candidate.\u201d Did he regret not rejecting them? \u201cI have nothing to regret because we won in the first round,\u201d he said, repeating his dismissal of the fraud charges that were backed by the Organization of American States. \u201cI have fulfilled the mandate of the people but these reactionaries can\u2019t deal with an indigenous candidate supported by the workers. That is class struggle. This is an age-old fight.\u201d Morales called environmentalists who said he has failed to protect the country\u2019s forests \u201cthe best tools of imperialism\u201d because he said they were seeking to prevent Bolivia developing its own resources. He laughed at the activists who said he deliberately stoked a \u201cmacho\u201d polarisation of politics. \u201cI am the feminist,\u201d he said, insisting women\u2019s participation in politics has soared on his watch. After some thought, the only \u201cmistake\u201d Morales could think off was removing petrol subsidies in 2010. It added up, he said, to a lifetime of political experience and achievements he was itching to put at the service of his country. This was why he will be returning to Bolivia as soon as possible, he said. It is also why his party is seeking to push through legislation guaranteeing him immunity from prosecution. \u201cTime is flying by and I really hope that I will be back by the end of the year,\u201d he said. Candidacy or no candidacy, Morales insisted there are still plenty of things for him to do, starting with helping his party find a candidate to replace him. \u201cThis is not a simple thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I also want to say that whereas before I was planning to leave after five more years in government, now, after everything they have done to me, it\u2019s possible I seek the candidacy after that.\u201d",

It\u2019s a radical manifesto that offers a genuine opportunity to transform society and accelerate social mobility, so how to best undermine it? To frame us all as consumers engaged in a transaction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The 'scroungers versus strivers' philosophy has become deeply embedded after a decade</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It goes like this: Labour announces a policy, that policy is trashed as a giveaway \u2013 unfeasible, irresponsible and reminiscent of communist Russia. It was the same in 2017. Then, as now, this form of political storytelling has trickled down to voters, and is now parroted so frequently that the Tories can just sit back and benefit. Even those voters who have benefitted from quite a bit of \u201cfree stuff\u201d themselves \u2013 student grants, dentistry, milk, library books \u2013 will decry Labour\u2019s \u201cfree stuff\u201d \u201cgiveaway\u201d. In this sense, the free-stuff narrative is one of the Tory party\u2019s most successful pieces of political messaging.</p> <p>The free-stuff narrative is dependent on several distinct mechanisms. Firstly, it is reliant on the idea that it was Labour, and not the global financial crisis in 2008, that caused the country to tumble into recession, and therefore that party cannot be trusted with the economy. This has proved a potent myth, which, in the form of Liam Byrne\u2019s infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/09/liam-byrne-apology-letter-there-is-no-money-labour-general-election\" title=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no money\u201d note</a>, is still doing the rounds as a meme all these years later. It ensures that whatever Labour offers can immediately be dismissed as reckless, irresponsible spending.</p> <p>Secondly, the free-stuff narrative is reliant on the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/04/what-overton-window\" title=\"\">Overton window</a> shifting towards discussions about the unviability of the welfare state, statements which once would have been unconscionable. To expect those services and schemes that we, the general public, used to take for granted as free at the point of use is now a sign of entitlement. Though we pay our tax and our national insurance, somehow this has ceased to be relevant. To expect well-run, universal basic services has come to signify a \u201csomething for nothing\u201d culture, as opposed to the normal functioning of the social contract with a post- Beveridge welfare state \u2013 where you pay in via tax and national insurance and in return can reasonably expect certain benefits (which, by the way, aren\u2019t actually free at all).</p> <p>This shift, and its results \u2013 a kind of social amnesia regarding the welfare state and its priorities \u2013 has proved convenient for a government that has spent much of the last decade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/un-report-compares-tory-welfare-reforms-to-creation-of-workhouses\" title=\"\">running down public services</a>.</p> <p>Thirdly, the free-stuff narrative is dependent on the not-unrelated notion of personal responsibility. The \u201cscroungers versus strivers\u201d philosophy has become deeply embedded after a decade, to the point where even children are not immune from it. When Margaret Thatcher abolished free milk for primary schoolchildren in 1971 as education secretary there was widespread uproar. Now, when Labour suggests bringing in free meals for primary school pupils (in a climate where frontline teaching staff talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/19/one-in-five-teachers-using-own-money-for-school-supplies-report\" title=\"\">dipping into their own pockets</a> to feed malnourished children), critics speak of parents\u2019 responsibility for keeping their own children nourished. \u201cWhy should I pay to feed the children of the feckless?\u201d seems to be, these days, a mainstream response.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the generational aspect. Younger voters are accustomed, by now, to being portrayed as entitled brats who don\u2019t know they\u2019re born, and the free-stuff narrative plays into this. It is patronisingly suggested that young people are idiots lured in by promises of free sweets, which Corbyn will probably use baby boomers\u2019 houses to pay for.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFree stuff for everyone\u201d: that\u2019s how Labour\u2019s manifesto pledges \u2013 for broadband, childcare, dentist check-ups, maternity and paternity pay, education and prescriptions \u2013 have been portrayed by centrist and rightwing political commentators. It\u2019s a radical manifesto that offers a genuine opportunity to transform society and accelerate social mobility, so how to best undermine it? To frame us all as consumers engaged in a transaction. It goes like this: Labour announces a policy, that policy is trashed as a giveaway \u2013 unfeasible, irresponsible and reminiscent of communist Russia. It was the same in 2017. Then, as now, this form of political storytelling has trickled down to voters, and is now parroted so frequently that the Tories can just sit back and benefit. Even those voters who have benefitted from quite a bit of \u201cfree stuff\u201d themselves \u2013 student grants, dentistry, milk, library books \u2013 will decry Labour\u2019s \u201cfree stuff\u201d \u201cgiveaway\u201d. In this sense, the free-stuff narrative is one of the Tory party\u2019s most successful pieces of political messaging. The free-stuff narrative is dependent on several distinct mechanisms. Firstly, it is reliant on the idea that it was Labour, and not the global financial crisis in 2008, that caused the country to tumble into recession, and therefore that party cannot be trusted with the economy. This has proved a potent myth, which, in the form of Liam Byrne\u2019s infamous \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no money\u201d note, is still doing the rounds as a meme all these years later. It ensures that whatever Labour offers can immediately be dismissed as reckless, irresponsible spending. Secondly, the free-stuff narrative is reliant on the Overton window shifting towards discussions about the unviability of the welfare state, statements which once would have been unconscionable. To expect those services and schemes that we, the general public, used to take for granted as free at the point of use is now a sign of entitlement. Though we pay our tax and our national insurance, somehow this has ceased to be relevant. To expect well-run, universal basic services has come to signify a \u201csomething for nothing\u201d culture, as opposed to the normal functioning of the social contract with a post- Beveridge welfare state \u2013 where you pay in via tax and national insurance and in return can reasonably expect certain benefits (which, by the way, aren\u2019t actually free at all). This shift, and its results \u2013 a kind of social amnesia regarding the welfare state and its priorities \u2013 has proved convenient for a government that has spent much of the last decade running down public services. Thirdly, the free-stuff narrative is dependent on the not-unrelated notion of personal responsibility. The \u201cscroungers versus strivers\u201d philosophy has become deeply embedded after a decade, to the point where even children are not immune from it. When Margaret Thatcher abolished free milk for primary schoolchildren in 1971 as education secretary there was widespread uproar. Now, when Labour suggests bringing in free meals for primary school pupils (in a climate where frontline teaching staff talk of dipping into their own pockets to feed malnourished children), critics speak of parents\u2019 responsibility for keeping their own children nourished. \u201cWhy should I pay to feed the children of the feckless?\u201d seems to be, these days, a mainstream response. Then there\u2019s the generational aspect. Younger voters are accustomed, by now, to being portrayed as entitled brats who don\u2019t know they\u2019re born, and the free-stuff narrative plays into this. It is patronisingly suggested that young people are idiots lured in by promises of free sweets, which Corbyn will probably use baby boomers\u2019 houses to pay for. Not only is this line hypocritical of those who parrot it \u2013 all of whom benefitted from the welfare state in one way or another \u2013 it serves to create more generational division. Lastly, there\u2019s the nationalistic myopia that has increased under Brexit. This has seen the country look away from its social democratic European neighbours, who might otherwise act as progressive inspirations for another way of doing things, and towards a Trumpian America, where the free-stuff narrative has been long established. With this has also come the US\u2019s virulent opposition to the prospect of a healthcare system free at the point of use, and its deep mistrust of \u2013 coupled with an economic interest in \u2013 our NHS. This is not to say that Labour\u2019s spending commitments should not be questioned and costed, that journalists and voters shouldn\u2019t ask how the party intends to pay for its manifesto pledges when it gains power. Such questions are essential in a democracy. Yet it is also important to ask: to what extent we have become so indoctrinated that so many of us have started to perceive such pledges as an irresponsible giveaway bonanza instead of the seeds of a well-funded, operational welfare state? People are no longer able to believe that another society is possible. Mark Fisher defined capitalist realism as the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it. \u201cOver the past 30 years, capitalist realism has successfully installed a \u2018business ontology\u2019 in which it is simply obvious that everything in society, including healthcare and education, should be run as a business,\u201d he wrote. There\u2019s something truly sad in all this: an internalised belief that, to borrow internet parlance, we don\u2019t deserve nice things.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump met with ridicule when in August he claimed to be \u201cthe chosen one\u201d, his apparently messianic self-confidence clashing with a press corps sceptical of the sincerity of his own religious beliefs as well as his behaviour and record in office. He subsequently said he\u2019d been joking. But his energy secretary, Rick Perry, thinks the president should take himself seriously. \u201cGod\u2019s used imperfect people all through history,\u201d Perry told the Fox News host Ed Henry in a video clip widely shared on Monday. \u201cKing David wasn\u2019t perfect, Saul wasn\u2019t perfect, Solomon wasn\u2019t perfect. \u201cAnd I actually gave the president a little one-pager\u201d \u2013 a possible reference to the short and colourful briefing notes Trump is reported to prefer \u2013 \u201con those Old Testament kings, about a month ago. \u201cAnd I shared it with him, I said, \u2018Mr President, I know there are people that say, y\u2019know, \u2018You said you were the chosen one.\u2019 And, I said: \u2018You were.\u2019 \u201cI said, \u2018If you\u2019re a believing Christian, you understand God\u2019s plan for the people who rule and judge over us on this planet and our government.\u2019\u201d Discussing the interview on air, Henry said Perry \u201cthinks at this moment and this time, Donald Trump was sent by God to do great things\u201d. Henry said Perry also \u201cpointed out to me he believes Barack Obama was sent by God as well, for that moment and that time\u201d. The notion that Trump is a ruler of less-than-perfect Christian values sent to benefit the godly \u2013 a second King Cyrus, perhaps \u2013 is common on the religious right. His own religious commitment seems questionable in the extreme but the thrice-married, porn star- and Playmate-paying, pussy-grabbing, customer-defrauding, disability-mocking, race-baiting, Nazi-sympathising, oft-bankrupt, impeachment-threatened president counts evangelical Christians as a key bloc of support. Perry, a former governor of Texas and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination who like other senior Trump aides has found himself under the shadow of the impeachment inquiry, will step down as energy secretary in December.",

We\u2019re not voting Labour in the naive hope that they will solve all the problems our communities face. We vote because they offer an urgent alternative to the destructive policies of the Conservatives. Ending austerity will, for the first time in many of our lifetimes, use the taxes we all already pay into, to reinvest in the housing, youth clubs, community groups and cultural centres being destroyed by the current government. These spaces made many of us who we are today, and while we don\u2019t rely on them like we used to, we know how important they will be for the next generation. It is only by restoring them that our communities can take charge of our own destinies, and build our own solutions to the problems we face. We are under no illusions about Labour\u2019s own imperial history, and we don\u2019t think the British establishment is fundamentally going to change. But we are sick of our taxes being spent on fighting more wars and building more jails. Jeremy Corbyn has been one of the few people who has fought against injustice all his political life, from apartheid South Africa to the bombing of Libya. To deny from our own, now quite comfortable places, that a Labour government would improve the lives of millions would betray the communities we come from. The opportunity for people-led change can be made possible under a Jeremy Corbyn Labour government. End austerity, rebuild our communities and take back the means to change our lives for the better. Surely, in an election that could transform the livelihoods of many, and be the difference between life or death for many more, life is something worth voting for. Join us.

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re on the left, it\u2019s easy to dislike the Liberal Democrats. Helping David Cameron into Downing Street; supporting most of his austerity policies for five years; splitting the anti-Tory vote; attacking Jeremy Corbyn more than Boris Johnson. Since 2010 the Lib Dems, supposedly a party of the centre, have done much to aid three of Britain\u2019s most rightwing governments ever. As their leader, Jo Swinson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/22/question-time-leaders-special-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">discovered</a> on Question Time last Friday, some voters may never forgive them.</p> <p>Last week her deputy, Ed Davey, suggested that \u201cthe most likely result\u201d of the election was \u201ca minority Tory government\u201d, and that the Lib Dems could informally support it in exchange for another Brexit referendum. The Lib Dems have been much more reluctant to say they might support a minority Labour administration, even though a second referendum is already Labour policy. For many leftists, such contortions may be final confirmation that the Lib Dems have ceased to be a centre party, and have turned into one of the right.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During a polarising election, the middle-of-the-road voter whom the Lib Dems have always sought may only get scarcer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Either way, today\u2019s Lib Dems are a puzzling political force. Despite their recent parliamentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/chuka-umunna-joins-liberal-democrats-after-quitting-change-uk\" title=\"\">recruits</a> from the Tories and Labour, and their surge in the polls over the summer (which has since gone into reverse), underneath they are still recovering from their disastrous performance at the 2015 election, which reduced them from 57 to eight MPs. At their manifesto launch in London last week, the hired room was modest in size and not completely full. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/liberal-democrat-manifesto-key-policies-explained\" title=\"\">manifesto</a> itself is bold and upbeat in places \u2013 \u201cStop Brexit. Build a brighter future\u201d \u2013 but underwhelming next to Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/labour-manifesto-blueprint-for-the-future-will-hutton-mariana-mazzucato\" title=\"\">radical pledges</a>.</p> <p>Yet the Lib Dems still matter. Like the parties they grew out of \u2013 the Liberals and the SDP \u2013 they reflect and influence the thinking of an important but slippery cohort of voters: moderate in their own minds, often middle-class, well represented in the media and business, and several million strong. Thanks to Brexit, the Lib Dems have even become \u201cthe party of choice for some of the country\u2019s elite\u201d, according to the Financial Times \u2013 and it should know.</p> <p>The worldview of the Lib Dems and their supporters is a sort of centrist common sense, built out of accumulating layers of political preoccupations. This worldview is not fixed, it changes over time. And these changes can reveal much about where wider politics is heading. During the 90s, the Lib Dems were hostile to the Tories and close to Labour in ways that might baffle observers of their recent behaviour. Paddy Ashdown, formerly a Labour supporter, was party leader. Under him, the Lib Dems often acted as Labour\u2019s accomplices rather than rivals or enemies, ganging up in parliament against John Major\u2019s government, and seeking to replace it with a Labour-Lib Dem coalition.</p> <p>Some of this closeness was personal. During the final days of the 1997 election, instead of campaigning to the last, Ashdown spent an evening in Edinburgh telling me and a few other journalists, off the record, how much he was in awe of Tony Blair. Yet the Lib Dems\u2019 crush on New Labour and its leader also reflected a widely held view among mainstream voters: that Thatcherism, while necessary, had gone too far; and that a mildly left-of-centre government was needed to undo the damage.</p> <p>Blair\u2019s 1997 landslide meant that Ashdown\u2019s coalition dream went unfulfilled. But his successor, Charles Kennedy \u2013 another former Labour supporter \u2013 at first maintained the Lib Dems\u2019 pro-Labour bias, treating Major\u2019s Tory leadership successors as pariahs. Then came the 2003 Iraq war. The Lib Dems, like many liberal Britons, opposed it, and they and Labour started to move rapidly apart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a117b6751e0446211b9e86d8c925c909e43983d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a117b6751e0446211b9e86d8c925c909e43983d/0_208_3574_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mock launch of the Liberal Democrat \u2018Orange book\u2019 by Labour MP Ruth Kelly in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mock launch of the Liberal Democrat \u2018Orange book\u2019, subtitled \u2018Lib Dems\u2019 secret agenda to scrap the NHS\u2019, by Labour MP Ruth Kelly in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Chung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A different breed of Lib Dem politician took advantage. The party has always had two politely competing tendencies: social democrats such as Ashdown, who favour state action to address public ills; and economic liberals, who believe more in the benign power of markets.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re on the left, it\u2019s easy to dislike the Liberal Democrats. Helping David Cameron into Downing Street; supporting most of his austerity policies for five years; splitting the anti-Tory vote; attacking Jeremy Corbyn more than Boris Johnson. Since 2010 the Lib Dems, supposedly a party of the centre, have done much to aid three of Britain\u2019s most rightwing governments ever. As their leader, Jo Swinson, discovered on Question Time last Friday, some voters may never forgive them. Last week her deputy, Ed Davey, suggested that \u201cthe most likely result\u201d of the election was \u201ca minority Tory government\u201d, and that the Lib Dems could informally support it in exchange for another Brexit referendum. The Lib Dems have been much more reluctant to say they might support a minority Labour administration, even though a second referendum is already Labour policy. For many leftists, such contortions may be final confirmation that the Lib Dems have ceased to be a centre party, and have turned into one of the right. Either way, today\u2019s Lib Dems are a puzzling political force. Despite their recent parliamentary recruits from the Tories and Labour, and their surge in the polls over the summer (which has since gone into reverse), underneath they are still recovering from their disastrous performance at the 2015 election, which reduced them from 57 to eight MPs. At their manifesto launch in London last week, the hired room was modest in size and not completely full. The manifesto itself is bold and upbeat in places \u2013 \u201cStop Brexit. Build a brighter future\u201d \u2013 but underwhelming next to Labour\u2019s radical pledges. Yet the Lib Dems still matter. Like the parties they grew out of \u2013 the Liberals and the SDP \u2013 they reflect and influence the thinking of an important but slippery cohort of voters: moderate in their own minds, often middle-class, well represented in the media and business, and several million strong. Thanks to Brexit, the Lib Dems have even become \u201cthe party of choice for some of the country\u2019s elite\u201d, according to the Financial Times \u2013 and it should know. The worldview of the Lib Dems and their supporters is a sort of centrist common sense, built out of accumulating layers of political preoccupations. This worldview is not fixed, it changes over time. And these changes can reveal much about where wider politics is heading. During the 90s, the Lib Dems were hostile to the Tories and close to Labour in ways that might baffle observers of their recent behaviour. Paddy Ashdown, formerly a Labour supporter, was party leader. Under him, the Lib Dems often acted as Labour\u2019s accomplices rather than rivals or enemies, ganging up in parliament against John Major\u2019s government, and seeking to replace it with a Labour-Lib Dem coalition. Some of this closeness was personal. During the final days of the 1997 election, instead of campaigning to the last, Ashdown spent an evening in Edinburgh telling me and a few other journalists, off the record, how much he was in awe of Tony Blair. Yet the Lib Dems\u2019 crush on New Labour and its leader also reflected a widely held view among mainstream voters: that Thatcherism, while necessary, had gone too far; and that a mildly left-of-centre government was needed to undo the damage. Blair\u2019s 1997 landslide meant that Ashdown\u2019s coalition dream went unfulfilled. But his successor, Charles Kennedy \u2013 another former Labour supporter \u2013 at first maintained the Lib Dems\u2019 pro-Labour bias, treating Major\u2019s Tory leadership successors as pariahs. Then came the 2003 Iraq war. The Lib Dems, like many liberal Britons, opposed it, and they and Labour started to move rapidly apart. A different breed of Lib Dem politician took advantage. The party has always had two politely competing tendencies: social democrats such as Ashdown, who favour state action to address public ills; and economic liberals, who believe more in the benign power of markets. In 2004 a group of ambitious young MPs from the latter faction, including Nick Clegg, David Laws and Ed Davey, together with an older social democrat who was moving rightwards, Vince Cable, published The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism. Its surprisingly sharp-toothed essays argued, among other things, that the civil service should be \u201cdrastically pruned\u201d, the Royal Mail should be privatised and \u201cmore provision from the private sector\u201d should be introduced in the NHS.

      "bodyText": "The government has removed the EU emblem and its 12 gold stars from British disabled drivers\u2019 parking badges even though the UK has not left the bloc, it has emerged. The move comes months after the row over the government decision to remove the words \u201cEuropean Union\u201d from British passports. It has caused concern among disabled drivers who fear their blue badges will no longer be accepted in the EU because of the absence of the stars, which demonstrate the car driver has EU rights. The Department for Transport has refused to say when it removed the stars, who took the decision or why it was deemed appropriate. The DfT has claimed it is barred from disclosing such details because it would breach purdah rules that bar civil servants from releasing any information that could influence the general election. Blue badge holders say they are worried it means the badge will no longer be valid for holidays in Europe. Linda Joanes, from Northumberland, said: \u201cVery surprised to find my new blue badge has no EU symbol. I have used my badge in France \u2013 large supermarket car parks etc \u2013 and last year it was also very useful, for example in giving priority boarding on the international ferry across Carlingford Lough between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Was not expecting this change and no information or warning given.\u201d The old blue badge was emblazoned with the letters \u201cUK\u201d encircled by 12 gold stars on a blue background, the symbol of the EU. This has been issued to approximately 2.5 million people in the UK to limit the amount of walking between their vehicle and their destination. The new badge retains the blue background but is stripped of stars and the words \u201cEuropean communities model\u201d. One retired person who is applying for a disabled parking badge said he was concerned decisions like this were being taken behind closed doors before the UK has left the EU, is still a full member of the EU, and there is still a chance it will remain in the bloc depending on the result of the election. \u201cHas the blue badge scheme quit the EU before the rest of the UK?\u201d he says, asking \u201con whose authority\u201d the redesign was undertaken. \u201cWhat if the government changes and we remain/revoke article 50?

Seems to me that some of the most vulnerable in Britain should be made aware.\u201d A spokesman for the DfT said they could not answer questions on the matter but confirmed the redesign. \u201cThe new blue badge design was rolled out earlier this year. These badges are still valid in the EU,\u201d he said. Asked if the badges were valid in the EU in a deal situation, or a no-deal situation, the DfT declined to answer, citing purdah rules. Earlier this year, Sajid Javid, the then home secretary, was forced to defend the redesigned British passport, saying it was \u201csensible and efficient\u201d to remove the words \u201cEuropean Union\u201d from the cover.

But those things can be worked through if the results and style of play are good, and Arsenal appear in a muddle. Emery has switched between back threes and fours, veered from high pressing to a more reactive approach, preached the need for more control while only cajoling a handful of 90-minute performances and become ensnared in messy situations around key figures like Granit Xhaka and Mesut \u00d6zil.

A hasty decision would not cut it; giving someone like Freddie Ljungberg the keys for six months would only be a populist call and, while a longer-term appointment might bring a spike in results, this is the time to take stock and decide who can propel Arsenal forward for years. It would be prudent to wait until the end of the season and, in the meantime, hope Emery can thrive in his natural habitat among a beatable Europa League field. As Emery has pointed out, factors like Laurent Koscielny\u2019s protracted departure and the issues befalling \u00d6zil and Xhaka have upset the \u201cemotional balance\u201d of his squad and not aided his task.

Madonna, Janet Jackson and TLC knew them well \u2013 but the concept of the pop \u201crole model\u201d, expected to set an example to kids, solidified when the Spice Girls became the first female act to be marketed at children. In the 70s and 80s, idols such as David Cassidy primed girls for a monogamous future. By comparison, the Spice Girls were lunatics conquering the asylum. But, given their fans\u2019 youth \u2013 and the sponsors that used the band to reach them \u2013 they also had a duty of responsibility. Their real lives \u2013 the all-nighters and eating disorders \u2013 were hidden so effectively that Eilish, born in 2001, <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/billie-eilish-thought-spice-girls-fictional-band-2474404\">thought the band was made up</a>, actors playing the roles of the group in Spiceworld: The Movie.</p> <p>In the late 90s, kid-pop became an industry unto itself: Smash Hits and Top of the Pops magazine pitched younger; CD:UK and America\u2019s TRL aimed at Saturday-morning and after-school audiences; Simons Fuller and Cowell built empires. The scrappy Spice Girls preceded the cyborgian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/britneyspears\">Britney</a>, who was a far sleeker enterprise \u2013 until she wasn\u2019t. She was pitched as a virgin: cruel branding that invited media prurience and set a time bomb counting down towards her inevitable downfall. Britney\u2019s 2007 breakdown revealed the cost of living as a virtuous cypher and being expected to repress her womanhood to sell to American prudes. Her shaved head and aborted stints in rehab prompted industry handwringing, and so an illusion of the music business offering greater freedom and care for pop\u2019s girls emerged in her wake.</p> <p>Major labels abandoned the traditional two-albums-in bad-girl turn (a la <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/christinaaguilera\">Christina Aguilera</a>\u2019s Stripped). Social media-born artists such as Lily Allen and Kate Nash were swept into the system and framed as the gobby antithesis to their manicured pop peers \u2013 until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/15/kate-nash-artists-often-have-mental-health-issues-the-music-industry-needs-to-protect-them\">their resistance to exactly the same kind of manipulation</a> saw them cast aside.

Like a rescued hatchling, it was in a pathetic state to begin with \u2013 dominated by white voices that tediously wondered whether anything a woman did was automatically feminist. Is brushing your teeth with Jack Daniel\u2019s feminist? Are meat dresses feminist? Is drunkenly stumbling through Camden feminist? Are butt implants feminist?</p> <p>Pop culture became the natural test site for these ideas \u2013 especially music, where a new wave of artists challenged this nascent, often misguided idealism. Kesha reclaimed the hard-partying values of rock\u2019s men to embody a generation\u2019s despair at seeing their futures obliterated by the recession. Lady Gaga questioned gender itself, as one writer in this paper put it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/10/10-years-of-lady-gaga-how-she-queered-mainstream-pop-forever\">\u201cre-queering a mainstream that had fallen back into heteronormative mundanity\u201d</a>.

In 2008, aged 15, she had posed in a sheet for Vanity Fair. \u201cMILEY\u2019S SHAME,\u201d screamed the New York Post. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/28/pressandpublishing1\">apologised to her fans</a>, \u201cwho I care so deeply about\u201d. But in 2013, she torched her child-star image by writhing in her knickers on a wrecking ball, twerking against Robin Thicke, being flagrant about her drug use, appropriating African American culture while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/miley-cyrus-twerking-cultural-appropriation\">perpetuating racist stereotypes</a>. </p> <p>Cyrus\u2019s 2013 transformation bore the hallmarks of a breakdown \u2013 especially witnessed two years after the death of Amy Winehouse, who was then perceived as a victim of her own self-destruction. But Cyrus was largely intentional about her work (if, then, ignorant of her racism). She had waited until she was no longer employed by Disney to express herself. Earlier in her career, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/arts/music/miley-cyrus-on-her-jump-to-sexy-twerker.html\">she said</a>, she struggled to watch her peers. \u201cI was so jealous of what everyone else got to do, because I didn\u2019t get to truly be myself yet.\u201d Despite apparently smoking massive amounts of weed herself, she didn\u2019t want to tell kids to copy her. But she knew the power she offered her peers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\">Ariana Grande</a>, who that year left Nickelodeon to release her debut album. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Walk out with me right now and get this picture, and this will be the best thing that happens to you, because just you associating with me makes you a little less sweet.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pop did get a little less sweet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sia-furler\">Sia</a> and Tove Lo sang brazenly about using drugs to mask pain. Icona Pop\u2019s I Love It reigned (\u201cI crashed my car into a bridge / I watched and let it burn\u201d) thanks to its inclusion on the soundtrack of Lena Dunham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/girls\">Girls</a>.

They also pushed aside the virgin/whore rivalries of old. In an earlier era, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey\">Lana Del Rey</a> might have been fashioned into nemeses, one sexualised and powerful, the other gothic and demure. Instead, their respective mid-decade self-mythologising showed that female musicians could be pop\u2019s auteurs, not just the men in the wings.</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/13/beyonce-album-first-review\">self-titled 2013 album</a> was an explicit rejection of her role-model status. She was 15 when Destiny\u2019s Child released their debut album. \u201cBut now I\u2019m in my 30s and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFXJGr7sYDk\">she said in a behind-the-scenes video</a>. The responsibility she felt to them \u201cstifled\u201d her. \u201cI felt like ... I could not express everything \u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve earned the right to be me and express any and every side of myself.\u201d</p> <p>It was the first of her albums to reveal the breadth of her inner life \u2013 the coexisting kinks, triumphs and insecurities, showing the complexity of black womanhood. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/12/28/finally-free-of-sasha-fierce-beyonce-is-a-grown-woman/\">The critic Soraya Nadia McDonald</a> wrote: \u201cMixed in with songs about insecurity, grief, protest and the love she has for her child, Beyonc\u00e9 manages to present her sexuality as a normal part of her life that deserves celebration.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you a bad mother. It doesn\u2019t make black people look bad, and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad feminist, either.\u201d When Beyonc\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/25/beyonce-flawless-feminist-vmas\">emblazoned \u201cFEMINIST\u201d</a> on stage at the 2014 MTV VMAs, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/13/beyonce-album-flawless-feminism\">helped reclaim the word from middle-class white discourse</a>.</p> <p>Like Beyonc\u00e9, Del Rey countered the idea that female pop stars were major-label puppets. She had struggled to make it as an indie artist but found a home at Polydor \u2013 a detail that caused detractors to question her authenticity. Her shaky debut SNL performance revealed the flaw in their thinking: if she was manufactured, wouldn\u2019t she have been better drilled? Her project was potent, but startlingly unrefined. More intriguingly, she opposed fast-calcifying ideas about how feminist art should look: Del Rey\u2019s lyrics revelled in submission and violence, in thrall to bad guys and glamour. It wasn\u2019t feminist to want these things; but nor was it feminist to insist on the suppression of desire in the name of shiny empowerment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ba81d97cec2fb200965ddde4a224b590372b8d5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba81d97cec2fb200965ddde4a224b590372b8d5b/0_143_3272_4086/801.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Wasted no opportunity to expose industry machinations\u2019 ...

Facing similar frustrations, rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/angel-haze\">Angel Haze</a> leaked her 2013 album, Dirty Gold, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/azealia-banks\">Azealia Banks</a> wasted no opportunity to expose industry machinations.</p> <p>The rise of Tumblr and SoundCloud put young artists in control of their own artistic identities, forging authentic fan relationships that labels couldn\u2019t afford to mess with. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lorde\">Lorde</a> was signed age 12, but her manager knew he had to <a href=\"https://www.rookiemag.com/2014/01/lorde-interview/\">follow her lead</a> because she knew her audience better than he did. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/22/halsey-you-can-be-homeless-and-a-one-direction-fan-at-the-same-time\">Halsey</a> was already Tumblr-famous for her covers, hair colours and candour about her bisexuality and bipolar diagnosis when she posted her first original song in 2014. It received so much attention that the 19-year-old \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6671107/halsey-the-weeknd-drugs-badlands-billboard-feature\">described herself</a> as an \u201cinconvenient woman\u201d for everything she represented \u2013 signed to major label Astralwerks the following evening.</p> <p>A new type of fan arrived with them. The illusion of intimacy led to greater emotional investment \u2013 and with it, an expectation of accountability. Social media was being used to arbitrate social justice issues, giving long overdue platforms to marginalised voices, and establishing far more complex moral standards for pop stars than the executives who shilled Britney\u2019s virginity could ever have imagined. In 2013, <a href=\"https://your-fave-is-problematic.tumblr.com/\">Your Fav Is Problematic</a> began to highlight stars\u2019 missteps: <a href=\"https://your-fave-is-problematic.tumblr.com/post/157089042461/halsey\">among Halsey\u2019s 11 infractions</a> were \u201csexualising Japanese culture\u201d and allegedly falsifying her story about being \u201chomeless\u201d.</p> <p>Musicians, particularly of an older guard, were unprepared. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lilyallen\">Lily Allen</a>\u2019s comeback single Hard Out Here, released in late 2013, satirised the impossible aesthetic standards expected of female musicians \u2013 a bold message undermined by the racist stereotypes she invoked to make her point: \u201cDon\u2019t need to shake my arse for you \u2019cause I\u2019ve got a brain,\u201d she sang, while black and Asian leotard-clad dancers twerked around her in the video. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/13/lily-allen-hard-out-here-racism\">The backlash was swift</a>.

But the most dramatic identity shifts were still a product of adversity, women battling for control.</p> <p>In 2015, Ariana Grande provoked mild outcry when she got caught licking a doughnut she hadn\u2019t paid for and declaring: \u201cI hate America.\u201d Two years later, a suicide bomber attacked her concert at Manchester Arena, leaving 22 dead. She went home to Florida in the aftermath, then returned to stage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/05/one-love-manchester-pop-healing-power-rises-from-dregs-of-depravity\">benefit concert One Love Manchester</a>. A victim\u2019s mother asked Grande to perform her raunchiest hits after the Daily Mail implied that the bomber had targeted the concert because of her sexualised aesthetic. So she did. By prioritising her mental health and refusing to let terrorists suppress girls\u2019 joy and sexuality, she set a powerful example for fans that ran counter to the moralising of commentators such as Piers Morgan.</p> <p>Grande appeared to emerge from this tragedy \u2013 and the death of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller \u2013 with a renewed sense of what was important, and what really was not. Her next album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/17/ariana-grande-sweetener-review-pops-ponytailed-paragon-gets-weird\">Sweetener</a>, defiantly reclaimed happiness from trauma; she swiftly released another, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/08/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-review\">Thank U, Next</a>, abandoning traditional pop release patterns to work with a rapper\u2019s spontaneity. \u201cI just want to fucking talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/women-in-music/8487877/ariana-grande-cover-story-billboard-women-in-music-2018\">she said</a>.</p> <p>Kesha had helped instigate this decade of greater freedom for female musicians \u2013 or so it seemed until October 2014, when she sued producer Dr Luke, making allegations including sexual assault. (In spring 2016, a judge dismissed the case; Luke denies all allegations and is suing Kesha for defamation.) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/30/magazine/kesha-lawsuit-dr-luke.html\">She claimed she was told she had to be \u201cfun\u201d</a>, an image that Luke\u2019s label intended to capitalise on, revealing how revelry could be just as confining as its prim counterpart. In 2017, she released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/10/kesha-rainbow-review-wronged-pop-avenger-makes-captivating-comeback\">Rainbow</a>, her first album in five years. Addressing her trauma, it got the best reviews of her career \u2013 a response that also seemed to reveal something about the most digestible way for a female artist to exist. But her forthcoming album, High Road, pointedly returns to the recklessness of her first two records. \u201cI don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019m beholden to be a tragedy just because I\u2019ve gone through something that was tragic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/kesha-the-worlds-going-to-burn-up-i-might-as-well-have-a-good-time\">she said</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\">Taylor Swift</a>\u2019s refusal to endorse a candidate in the 2016 election, and the fallout from a spat with Kanye West, saw her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/24/taylor-swift-pop-music-hunger-games-gladiators\">shred her image of nice-girl relatability</a> with her 2017 heel-turn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/10/taylor-swift-reputation-review-superb-songcraft-meets-extreme-drama\">Reputation</a>. But she rebelled more meaningfully when she leveraged her profile to expose the music industry, alerting the public to otherwise opaque matters of ownership and compensation.

      "bodyText": "While Billie Eilish has reinvented pop with her hushed SoundCloud rap menace, creepy ASMR intimacy and chipper show tune melodies, there\u2019s also something reassuringly comforting about her: as a teenage pop star, she has fulfilled her proper duty by confusing the hell out of adults. It\u2019s largely down to her aesthetic: a funhouse Fred Durst; a one-woman model for the combined wares of Camden Market. Critics have tried to make sense of it, but when editorials praised Eilish\u2019s \u201ctotal lack of sexualisation\u201d, she denounced them for \u201cslut-shaming\u201d her peers. \u201cI don\u2019t like that there\u2019s this weird new world of supporting me by shaming people that may not want to dress like me.\u201d To Gen Z\u2019s Eilish, not yet 18, it is a weird new world. She and her millennial peers have grown up in a decade in which pop\u2019s good girl/bad girl binary has collapsed into the moral void that once upheld it, resulting in a generation of young female stars savvy to how the expectation to be \u201crespectable\u201d and conform to adult ideas of how a role model for young fans should act \u2013 by an industry not known for its moral backbone \u2013 is a con. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to treat women the way they were treated in the 90s now, because you can get called out so easily on social media,\u201d Fiona Apple \u2013 who knows about the simultaneous sexualisation and dismissal of young female musicians \u2013 said recently. \u201cIf somebody does something shitty nowadays, a 17-year-old singer can get on their social media and say, \u2018Look what this fucker did! It\u2019s fucked up.\u2019\u201d Female musicians have been subject to conflicting moral standards for longer than Eilish has been alive. Madonna, Janet Jackson and TLC knew them well \u2013 but the concept of the pop \u201crole model\u201d, expected to set an example to kids, solidified when the Spice Girls became the first female act to be marketed at children. In the 70s and 80s, idols such as David Cassidy primed girls for a monogamous future. By comparison, the Spice Girls were lunatics conquering the asylum. But, given their fans\u2019 youth \u2013 and the sponsors that used the band to reach them \u2013 they also had a duty of responsibility. Their real lives \u2013 the all-nighters and eating disorders \u2013 were hidden so effectively that Eilish, born in 2001, thought the band was made up, actors playing the roles of the group in Spiceworld: The Movie. In the late 90s, kid-pop became an industry unto itself: Smash Hits and Top of the Pops magazine pitched younger; CD:UK and America\u2019s TRL aimed at Saturday-morning and after-school audiences; Simons Fuller and Cowell built empires. The scrappy Spice Girls preceded the cyborgian Britney, who was a far sleeker enterprise \u2013 until she wasn\u2019t. She was pitched as a virgin: cruel branding that invited media prurience and set a time bomb counting down towards her inevitable downfall. Britney\u2019s 2007 breakdown revealed the cost of living as a virtuous cypher and being expected to repress her womanhood to sell to American prudes. Her shaved head and aborted stints in rehab prompted industry handwringing, and so an illusion of the music business offering greater freedom and care for pop\u2019s girls emerged in her wake. Major labels abandoned the traditional two-albums-in bad-girl turn (a la Christina Aguilera\u2019s Stripped). Social media-born artists such as Lily Allen and Kate Nash were swept into the system and framed as the gobby antithesis to their manicured pop peers \u2013 until their resistance to exactly the same kind of manipulation saw them cast aside. And if Kesha, Lady Gaga or Amy Winehouse burned out, their visible excesses would distract from any behind-the-scenes exploitation, inviting spectators to imagine that they brought it on themselves. At the dawn of the 2010s, social media surpassed its teen origins to become an adult concern, and an earnest fourth wave of activists brought feminism back to the mainstream. Like a rescued hatchling, it was in a pathetic state to begin with \u2013 dominated by white voices that tediously wondered whether anything a woman did was automatically feminist. Is brushing your teeth with Jack Daniel\u2019s feminist? Are meat dresses feminist? Is drunkenly stumbling through Camden feminist? Are butt implants feminist? Pop culture became the natural test site for these ideas \u2013 especially music, where a new wave of artists challenged this nascent, often misguided idealism. Kesha reclaimed the hard-partying values of rock\u2019s men to embody a generation\u2019s despair at seeing their futures obliterated by the recession. Lady Gaga questioned gender itself, as one writer in this paper put it, \u201cre-queering a mainstream that had fallen back into heteronormative mundanity\u201d. In a career-making verse on Kanye West\u2019s Monster, Nicki Minaj annihilated her male peers and gloried in her sexualisation. MIA, infuriated by America\u2019s hypocritical propriety, flipped off the Super Bowl and proved her point by incurring a $16.5m fine. As a former Disney star, Miley Cyrus stepped the furthest out of bounds. In 2008, aged 15, she had posed in a sheet for Vanity Fair. \u201cMILEY\u2019S SHAME,\u201d screamed the New York Post. She apologised to her fans, \u201cwho I care so deeply about\u201d. But in 2013, she torched her child-star image by writhing in her knickers on a wrecking ball, twerking against Robin Thicke, being flagrant about her drug use, appropriating African American culture while perpetuating racist stereotypes. Cyrus\u2019s 2013 transformation bore the hallmarks of a breakdown \u2013 especially witnessed two years after the death of Amy Winehouse, who was then perceived as a victim of her own self-destruction. But Cyrus was largely intentional about her work (if, then, ignorant of her racism). She had waited until she was no longer employed by Disney to express herself. Earlier in her career, she said, she struggled to watch her peers. \u201cI was so jealous of what everyone else got to do, because I didn\u2019t get to truly be myself yet.\u201d Despite apparently smoking massive amounts of weed herself, she didn\u2019t want to tell kids to copy her. But she knew the power she offered her peers such as Ariana Grande, who that year left Nickelodeon to release her debut album. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Walk out with me right now and get this picture, and this will be the best thing that happens to you, because just you associating with me makes you a little less sweet.\u2019\u201d Pop did get a little less sweet. Sia and Tove Lo sang brazenly about using drugs to mask pain. Icona Pop\u2019s I Love It reigned (\u201cI crashed my car into a bridge / I watched and let it burn\u201d) thanks to its inclusion on the soundtrack of Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls. With its aimless characters and their ugly behaviour, the show mirrored pop\u2019s retreat from aspirational sheen, and the culture\u2019s growing obsession with \u201cmessy\u201d women and \u201cstrong female characters\u201d: flawed attempts to create new archetypes that rejected the expectation of girls behaving nicely. A new cohort of young female and non-binary critics shifted the discussion around music: in 2015, when the documentary Amy was released, they questioned how Winehouse was perceived in death compared to Kurt Cobain. They also pushed aside the virgin/whore rivalries of old. In an earlier era, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lana Del Rey might have been fashioned into nemeses, one sexualised and powerful, the other gothic and demure. Instead, their respective mid-decade self-mythologising showed that female musicians could be pop\u2019s auteurs, not just the men in the wings. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled 2013 album was an explicit rejection of her role-model status. She was 15 when Destiny\u2019s Child released their debut album. \u201cBut now I\u2019m in my 30s and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up,\u201d she said in a behind-the-scenes video. The responsibility she felt to them \u201cstifled\u201d her. \u201cI felt like ... I could not express everything \u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve earned the right to be me and express any and every side of myself.\u201d It was the first of her albums to reveal the breadth of her inner life \u2013 the coexisting kinks, triumphs and insecurities, showing the complexity of black womanhood. The critic Soraya Nadia McDonald wrote: \u201cMixed in with songs about insecurity, grief, protest and the love she has for her child, Beyonc\u00e9 manages to present her sexuality as a normal part of her life that deserves celebration.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you a bad mother. It doesn\u2019t make black people look bad, and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad feminist, either.\u201d When Beyonc\u00e9 emblazoned \u201cFEMINIST\u201d on stage at the 2014 MTV VMAs, she helped reclaim the word from middle-class white discourse. Like Beyonc\u00e9, Del Rey countered the idea that female pop stars were major-label puppets. She had struggled to make it as an indie artist but found a home at Polydor \u2013 a detail that caused detractors to question her authenticity. Her shaky debut SNL performance revealed the flaw in their thinking: if she was manufactured, wouldn\u2019t she have been better drilled? Her project was potent, but startlingly unrefined. More intriguingly, she opposed fast-calcifying ideas about how feminist art should look: Del Rey\u2019s lyrics revelled in submission and violence, in thrall to bad guys and glamour. It wasn\u2019t feminist to want these things; but nor was it feminist to insist on the suppression of desire in the name of shiny empowerment. Del Rey\u2019s lusts and designs were her own \u2013 pure female gaze \u2013 a hallmark of the defiant female pop stars to come. Rihanna said she was \u201ccompletely not\u201d a role model, a point driven home by the viscerally violent video for Bitch Better Have My Money. Lauren Mayberry of Scottish trio Chvrches refused to be singled out from her male bandmates and wrote searingly about the misogyny she faced online. Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Solange rubbished the idea that R&amp;B was the only lane open to young black women. They started revealing their business conflicts. In 2013, 21-year-old Sky Ferreira finally released her debut, six years after signing a $1m record deal. She was transparent about her paradoxical treatment: \u201cThey worked me to death, but when I wanted to input anything, it was like, \u2018You\u2019re a child, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u201d When Capitol pulled funding for the album, she financed its completion: it was widely named an album of the year. Facing similar frustrations, rapper Angel Haze leaked her 2013 album, Dirty Gold, and Azealia Banks wasted no opportunity to expose industry machinations. The rise of Tumblr and SoundCloud put young artists in control of their own artistic identities, forging authentic fan relationships that labels couldn\u2019t afford to mess with. Lorde was signed age 12, but her manager knew he had to follow her lead because she knew her audience better than he did. Halsey was already Tumblr-famous for her covers, hair colours and candour about her bisexuality and bipolar diagnosis when she posted her first original song in 2014. It received so much attention that the 19-year-old \u2013 who described herself as an \u201cinconvenient woman\u201d for everything she represented \u2013 signed to major label Astralwerks the following evening. A new type of fan arrived with them. The illusion of intimacy led to greater emotional investment \u2013 and with it, an expectation of accountability. Social media was being used to arbitrate social justice issues, giving long overdue platforms to marginalised voices, and establishing far more complex moral standards for pop stars than the executives who shilled Britney\u2019s virginity could ever have imagined. In 2013, Your Fav Is Problematic began to highlight stars\u2019 missteps: among Halsey\u2019s 11 infractions were \u201csexualising Japanese culture\u201d and allegedly falsifying her story about being \u201chomeless\u201d. Musicians, particularly of an older guard, were unprepared. Lily Allen\u2019s comeback single Hard Out Here, released in late 2013, satirised the impossible aesthetic standards expected of female musicians \u2013 a bold message undermined by the racist stereotypes she invoked to make her point: \u201cDon\u2019t need to shake my arse for you \u2019cause I\u2019ve got a brain,\u201d she sang, while black and Asian leotard-clad dancers twerked around her in the video. The backlash was swift. There was the sense of a balance tipping. Over the decade, female pop stars steadily self-determined beyond the old limited archetypes. But the most dramatic identity shifts were still a product of adversity, women battling for control. In 2015, Ariana Grande provoked mild outcry when she got caught licking a doughnut she hadn\u2019t paid for and declaring: \u201cI hate America.\u201d Two years later, a suicide bomber attacked her concert at Manchester Arena, leaving 22 dead. She went home to Florida in the aftermath, then returned to stage benefit concert One Love Manchester. A victim\u2019s mother asked Grande to perform her raunchiest hits after the Daily Mail implied that the bomber had targeted the concert because of her sexualised aesthetic. So she did. By prioritising her mental health and refusing to let terrorists suppress girls\u2019 joy and sexuality, she set a powerful example for fans that ran counter to the moralising of commentators such as Piers Morgan. Grande appeared to emerge from this tragedy \u2013 and the death of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller \u2013 with a renewed sense of what was important, and what really was not. Her next album, Sweetener, defiantly reclaimed happiness from trauma; she swiftly released another, Thank U, Next, abandoning traditional pop release patterns to work with a rapper\u2019s spontaneity. \u201cI just want to fucking talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do,\u201d she said. Kesha had helped instigate this decade of greater freedom for female musicians \u2013 or so it seemed until October 2014, when she sued producer Dr Luke, making allegations including sexual assault. (In spring 2016, a judge dismissed the case; Luke denies all allegations and is suing Kesha for defamation.) She claimed she was told she had to be \u201cfun\u201d, an image that Luke\u2019s label intended to capitalise on, revealing how revelry could be just as confining as its prim counterpart. In 2017, she released Rainbow, her first album in five years. Addressing her trauma, it got the best reviews of her career \u2013 a response that also seemed to reveal something about the most digestible way for a female artist to exist. But her forthcoming album, High Road, pointedly returns to the recklessness of her first two records. \u201cI don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019m beholden to be a tragedy just because I\u2019ve gone through something that was tragic,\u201d she said. Taylor Swift\u2019s refusal to endorse a candidate in the 2016 election, and the fallout from a spat with Kanye West, saw her shred her image of nice-girl relatability with her 2017 heel-turn, Reputation. But she rebelled more meaningfully when she leveraged her profile to expose the music industry, alerting the public to otherwise opaque matters of ownership and compensation. She joined independent labels in the fight to make Apple Music pay artists for the free trial period it offered consumers. Earlier this year, she despaired at her former label, Big Machine, being bought \u2013 and the master recordings to her first six albums with it \u2013 by nemesis Scooter Braun, an option she claimed she was denied. Now signed to Universal, and the owner of her masters going forward, she hoped young musicians might learn from her \u201cabout how to better protect themselves in a negotiation\u201d, she wrote. \u201cYou deserve to own the art you make.\u201d Swift\u2019s formative politesse came from country music, an industry that emphasises deference to power and traditional gender roles. In 2015, consultant Keith Hill \u2013 using a bizarre metaphor about salad \u2013 admitted that radio sidelined female musicians: they were then subject to endless questions about tomatogate, as if they had the power to fix it. But that blatant industry disregard freed female country artists to shuck off obligation and make whatever music they wanted. In recent years, Miranda Lambert, Ashley McBryde, Brandy Clark, Kacey Musgraves, Ashley Monroe, Maren Morris, Brandi Carlile and Margo Price have all creatively outstripped their male peers. Their situation resonates beyond country: greater personal freedoms for female musicians haven\u2019t equated to greater commercial success. Just because a wave of female pop acts have refused old industry ideals, that doesn\u2019t mean control is consigned to the past. There will be young women enduring coercive music industry situations right now \u2013 whether manipulation or more serious abuse. Some may never meet those impossible standards, and fail to launch. Others may quietly endure years of repression before potentially finding their voice. There are high-profile female pop acts working today who control their work yet are still subject to grinding suggestions that they change to meet market demands, and noisy women from this decade who have been sidelined. The tropes of the self-actualised female pop star are so established that labels know how to reverse engineer \u201creal\u201d pop girls beholden to a script. But the emergence of a more holistic female star will make it harder for labels to shill substitutes. Their emotional openness has destroyed the stigma around mental health that was used to diminish female musicians as \u201cmad\u201d divas. Charli XCX said she would never have betrayed her vulnerabilities when she was starting out in her teens. \u201cIf I\u2019m emotionally vulnerable,\u201d she thought, \u201cpeople won\u2019t take me seriously \u2026 Now I just don\u2019t care.\u201d Robyn spent eight years following up her most successful record because she needed time to grieve and unpick the impact of her own teen stardom. Britney \u2013 who in 1999 told Rolling Stone, \u201cI have no feelings at all\u201d \u2013 this year cancelled her Las Vegas residency to prioritise her mental health. They\u2019ve relentlessly countered the male gaze. Chris refused to simplify queerness for the mainstream; Kim Petras stood for \u201ctrans joy\u201d; Rihanna challenged the idea of skinny as aspirational by creating inclusive fashion lines and candidly discussing her own shape. \u201cJust me existing is revolutionary\u201d, Lizzo has said, while Cardi B refused to let anyone use her past as a stripper undermine her legitimacy as a powerful political voice. Where unthinking messiness was valorised at the start of the decade, now imperfection only gets a pass as long as nobody else is getting hurt. This summer, Miley, now 26, apologised for the racial insensitivity of her Wrecking Ball era. Soon after, she posted striking tweets in response to rumours of her cheating on her husband. She admitted to having been hedonistic and unprofessional in her youth. But she swore she hadn\u2019t cheated in her marriage. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in front of you, but the bottom line is, I HAVE GROWN UP,\u201d she wrote. (To a degree \u2013 not long after, she found herself called out again when she implied that queerness is a choice.) In their fallibility and resistance to commodification, the women who have defined this decade in pop look a lot more like role models than the corporate innocents sold to girls in the early millennium.

      "bodyText": "UK Athletics lurched into a fresh crisis on Monday after its chief executive, Zara Hyde Peters, lost her job before she had even begun. The move follows claims she failed to tell her local athletics club about her husband\u2019s \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with a 15-year-old schoolgirl. Hyde Peters was to start her \u00a3200,000 role next week but her position was deemed untenable by UKA after it was reported her spouse, Mike Peters, had been barred by the Department of Education in 2012 but was allowed to coach girls as young as 16 at Coventry Godiva Harriers without a UKA licence. At the time Hyde Peters was a coaching coordinator and then vice-chair at the club but reportedly did not alert it to the potential safeguarding problems. UKA has now lost its chief executive, performance director and chair \u2013 and failed to hit its medal target at the recent world championships \u2013 in the space of 10 months. In January, its former chair Richard Bowker\u2019s undistinguished reign ended when he stepped down while facing a vote of no confidence. In October UKA\u2019s performance director, Neil Black, left after the world championships. One insider said Hyde Peters\u2019s departure confirmed athletics as \u201cthe most dysfunctional Olympic sport in Britain\u201d. The organisation has also been on the back foot over lingering questions regarding its closeness to the Nike Oregon Project following Alberto Salazar\u2019s four-year ban for anti-doping offences in October \u2013 yet its terms of reference for a planned review into its relationship with Salazar are still to be announced. Salazar\u2019s appeal against the ban is not expected to be heard until March. To make matters worse, it was revealed this month that UKA\u2019s widely pilloried decision to stage last year\u2019s World Cup in London on the same weekend as the Wimbledon finals and football World Cup had cost it close to \u00a32m. UK Sport, which has provided UKA with \u00a327m in funding since the Rio Olympics, said it would be seeking urgent talks with UKA\u2019s new chair, Chris Clark. \u201cWe acknowledge the announcement from UK Athletics regarding Zara Hyde Peters,\u201d a UK Sport spokesman said. \u201cMaintaining the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct is crucial to the integrity of sport. \u201cWe will be seeking a face-to-face meeting with UK Athletics at the earliest opportunity to discuss next steps.\u201d When the claims regarding the safeguarding problem were first reported in the Times on Friday, Hyde Peters was \u201cfully supported\u201d by Clark in a statement. However, his was a lone voice with UK Sport warning the accusations were extremely serious and the Commonwealth Games Federation calling for her to be temporarily removed from the board of Birmingham 2022. As the pressure grew, UKA called an emergency meeting on Sunday, after which Hyde Peters agreed to step down apparently before she was pushed. Clark said in a statement: \u201cFollowing the meeting I had time with Zara to review the situation and we have agreed together that she will now not be taking up her position as CEO on 1st December.\u201d It is understood a UKA review into Hyde Peters\u2019s actions, which was announced on Friday, will continue. UKA will begin its search for a chief executive from scratch, with Jack Buckner, the chief executive of British Swimming, understood to be in the frame. Questions have also been raised about the judgment of Clark, who is seen by some in the sport as having been too quick to defend Hyde Peters when the reports first emerged. However, Clark was backed by Toni Minichiello, the coach of the Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill and a member of UKA\u2019s members\u2019 council, who said Clark should be given time to turn the sport round after his appointment in September. \u201cThe decision that UKA has come to is strong, positive and ultimately correct,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question now is how does athletics move forward? \u201cMany of the problems that have come to light since Chris took up the post on the 1 September date back a number of years. \u201cAlthough they are not of the new chairman\u2019s making, I believe he is the right man with an objective eye and vision to deliver the necessary reforms.\u201d",

We\u2019re speeding through the residential streets of the Lake Como Family Nudist Resort in Pasco county, Florida. It\u2019s a Saturday morning and families are sunbathing around the community pool and clubhouse. The air is thick with the languid warmth of summer camp.</p> <p>Lake Como is one of 13 nudist resorts and neighborhoods that pepper a 15-mile stretch of US 41 running through the rural heart of Pasco county, just inland of Tampa Bay, Florida.

He and his wife, Dorothy, grew fond of the practice and started inviting their friends. Within a few years they were taking out classified ads in nudist journals and selling memberships.</p> <p>Pasco county is now considered to be the nudist capital of the world \u2013 nowhere else has a larger year-round population of nudists (or \u201cnaturists\u201d, the preferred term). They have played an integral role in the local economy for decades. The bed and sales tax revenue generated from the 10,000 permanent residents and nearly 1 million annual tourists helps fund everything from school districts to law enforcement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2e415f623831d192dd2930a7a134d1036cab42f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e415f623831d192dd2930a7a134d1036cab42f6/0_0_3000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Lane shoots pool in Lake Como\u2019s recreation room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Lane shoots pool in Lake Como\u2019s recreation room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack Wittman for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a neighborhood or resort for every flavor: couples, singles, swingers, multigenerational families, LGBTQ people, retirees. But as different varieties of nudists decamped to Pasco county over the years, an ideological gulf has formed. On one side there\u2019s Lake Como, the oldest and surely the most staid, which upholds traditional nudist values (no PDA, no sexual overtones) and where children are welcome.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the Caliente Club and Resort, a natural adversary just up the road, known for its wild swinger parties and bawdy social media campaigns. Both represent the profile of naturism in America today. Both struggle with being misunderstood by the outside world and share the common goal of normalizing naturism, but they spend a considerable amount of time grappling with each other.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F820c87226b503f292aa9e1b357cec410a4050dc0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F28ae48bab0895987dbe871e7424dbe3dc262757c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Bible study\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F820c87226b503f292aa9e1b357cec410a4050dc0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F28ae48bab0895987dbe871e7424dbe3dc262757c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Bible study</a> <figcaption>Left<em>:</em> Jayson McMullen reads scripture during a small service at the Garden of Eden church on 17 November at the Lake Como Co-Op nudist community in Lutz, Florida.

They say stripping one\u2019s clothes leads to an immediate dissolution of ego \u2013 once they are no longer obscured, bodies and any perceived differences, are rendered invisible. It\u2019s the only way to achieve authentic social parity.</p> <p>\u201cWe took off our fears and inhibitions when we got here,\u201d McMullen, who\u2019s lived at the resort since 2012, says. \u201cWe just trust one another.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10276e11cceafc75e430ca1d4909b99e202ad09d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10276e11cceafc75e430ca1d4909b99e202ad09d/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Como\u2019s Butt Hutt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake Como\u2019s Butt Hutt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack Wittman for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Contemporary naturism began in Germany in the early 20th century as a folk medicine panacea, and then transformed during the postwar years into a manner of dissent from the authoritarian rule of the German Democratic Republic. Conversely, the origins of American naturism are socialistic. Lee Baxandall, a prominent figure of the new left, dedicated the second act of his life to nudist advocacy in America. (A nude statue of Karl Marx stands in the lobby of the American Nudist Research Library in nearby Kissimmee.)</p> <p>The fact that Lake Como is a co-op is further reification. All the money from daily passes for tourists or annual membership dues from residents is cycled back into property maintenance and improvements. Roughly half of the resorts in the area function as not-for-profits. If the principle stands that gender, race and sexuality are immaterial, then wealth and class are too.</p> <p>These are reasons why nude recreation is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/charynpfeuffer/2018/07/12/nude-and-clothing-optional-travel-nakations-are-on-the-rise/#d23a8051dc43\">gaining popularity</a> in America and abroad, particularly with demographics other than white people of a certain vintage. According to the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) \u2013 the oldest naturist advocacy group in North America, which offers legal counseling and a lobbying arm \u2013 the Black Naturists Association (BNA) is the fastest growing nudist organization in the country. Membership skews younger, and has increased tenfold in the last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fbc0a26176fd83296dbe3ca47042cc886832a65d2%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fdf68868026104082afbe92b4f4fff9e2f3eaf4f8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Karaoke night in the Butt Hutt bar at Lake Como Co-Op nudist community.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fbc0a26176fd83296dbe3ca47042cc886832a65d2%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fdf68868026104082afbe92b4f4fff9e2f3eaf4f8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2402&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Karaoke night in the Butt Hutt bar at Lake Como Co-Op nudist community.</a> <figcaption>Left: Phillip Mangus sings karaoke in the Butt Hutt bar at Lake Como. Right: Nudists on the dance floor during karaoke night in the Butt Hutt bar.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conversations I overhear among residents at Lake Como recall those halcyon days of childhood, before we found significance in skin color, or sneakers or the type of car our parents drove. That return to innocence is the argument for Pasco county being a utopian experiment worth preserving, though they feel it\u2019s undermined by Caliente.

      "bodyText": "Mike Kush punches the gas on a golf cart, the wind tousling his grizzled ponytail. \u201cYou look hot,\u201d he says, waving a disapproving hand at my trousers. \u201cFeel free to take your clothes off.\u201d A husky man, Kush takes up most of the seat, leaving only a few hallowed centimeters between me and his naked body. We\u2019re speeding through the residential streets of the Lake Como Family Nudist Resort in Pasco county, Florida. It\u2019s a Saturday morning and families are sunbathing around the community pool and clubhouse. The air is thick with the languid warmth of summer camp. Lake Como is one of 13 nudist resorts and neighborhoods that pepper a 15-mile stretch of US 41 running through the rural heart of Pasco county, just inland of Tampa Bay, Florida. (Clothing is required by law everywhere outside the confines of each resort or neighborhood.) Some \u201cresorts\u201d are nothing more than a cluster of trailer parks, others are primly landscaped and lined with stucco mansions. \u201cBut Lake Como was the original,\u201d Kush says. In 1941, Ava Weaver Brubaker, a tax lawyer from Tampa, bought this plot of land, then a 350-acre orange grove, after his doctor had prescribed nude sunbathing to treat a rare skin disease. He and his wife, Dorothy, grew fond of the practice and started inviting their friends. Within a few years they were taking out classified ads in nudist journals and selling memberships. Pasco county is now considered to be the nudist capital of the world \u2013 nowhere else has a larger year-round population of nudists (or \u201cnaturists\u201d, the preferred term). They have played an integral role in the local economy for decades. The bed and sales tax revenue generated from the 10,000 permanent residents and nearly 1 million annual tourists helps fund everything from school districts to law enforcement. There\u2019s a neighborhood or resort for every flavor: couples, singles, swingers, multigenerational families, LGBTQ people, retirees. But as different varieties of nudists decamped to Pasco county over the years, an ideological gulf has formed. On one side there\u2019s Lake Como, the oldest and surely the most staid, which upholds traditional nudist values (no PDA, no sexual overtones) and where children are welcome. Then there\u2019s the Caliente Club and Resort, a natural adversary just up the road, known for its wild swinger parties and bawdy social media campaigns. Both represent the profile of naturism in America today. Both struggle with being misunderstood by the outside world and share the common goal of normalizing naturism, but they spend a considerable amount of time grappling with each other. \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s sad how the outside world looks down on us,\u201d Karyn McMullen, president of the Lake Como co-op, tells me inside a screened-in porch bar called the Butt Hutt. She has a helmet of lank, straw-colored hair, its tone enhanced by the contrast of her chestnutty brown skin. The greatest misconception about their lifestyle, McMullen says, is that it\u2019s sexual in nature. \u201cIt has absolutely nothing to do with sex,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much deeper than that.\u201d Whether they were raised in nudist families or introduced to it as adults, Pasco county is filled with people who have eschewed conventional lives in favor of this enclave. They say stripping one\u2019s clothes leads to an immediate dissolution of ego \u2013 once they are no longer obscured, bodies and any perceived differences, are rendered invisible. It\u2019s the only way to achieve authentic social parity. \u201cWe took off our fears and inhibitions when we got here,\u201d McMullen, who\u2019s lived at the resort since 2012, says. \u201cWe just trust one another.\u201d Contemporary naturism began in Germany in the early 20th century as a folk medicine panacea, and then transformed during the postwar years into a manner of dissent from the authoritarian rule of the German Democratic Republic. Conversely, the origins of American naturism are socialistic. Lee Baxandall, a prominent figure of the new left, dedicated the second act of his life to nudist advocacy in America. (A nude statue of Karl Marx stands in the lobby of the American Nudist Research Library in nearby Kissimmee.) The fact that Lake Como is a co-op is further reification. All the money from daily passes for tourists or annual membership dues from residents is cycled back into property maintenance and improvements. Roughly half of the resorts in the area function as not-for-profits. If the principle stands that gender, race and sexuality are immaterial, then wealth and class are too. These are reasons why nude recreation is gaining popularity in America and abroad, particularly with demographics other than white people of a certain vintage. According to the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) \u2013 the oldest naturist advocacy group in North America, which offers legal counseling and a lobbying arm \u2013 the Black Naturists Association (BNA) is the fastest growing nudist organization in the country. Membership skews younger, and has increased tenfold in the last year. Conversations I overhear among residents at Lake Como recall those halcyon days of childhood, before we found significance in skin color, or sneakers or the type of car our parents drove. That return to innocence is the argument for Pasco county being a utopian experiment worth preserving, though they feel it\u2019s undermined by Caliente. Residents of Lake Como and other traditional resorts where children are raised and recreate have spent decades trying to divorce the association of nudism with sexual deviancy, whereas Caliente wholly embraces it. As I make my way to leave the Butt Hutt, a man with mussed white hair, an imposing frame and an all-over tan corners me. He introduces himself as Rich Pasco. \u201cI was hoping I\u2019d get a chance to talk to you about Caliente,\u201d he says, peering down from double-bridge eyeglasses. \u201cI live there.\u201d We arrange to meet later at Caliente, a few miles north on Highway 41.

The prime minister\u2019s claim that the government will build 40 new hospitals rapidly fell apart in late September, although he continues to push the misleading assertion. The Government has confirmed that six existing hospitals in England are being given \u00a32.7bn by 2025 as part of the programme \u2013 an upgrade rather than a fresh build. Another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/from-40-hospitals-to-six-tories-nhs-numbers-dont-add-up\">21 hospital trusts are being given \u00a3100m in seed funding</a> to prepare a business case for their hospitals \u2013 but no money for any actual building work. The work would then start between 2025 and 2030.</p> \n<p>And on manifesto launch day, the pledge to recruit 50,000 was immediately thrown into doubt when it emerged 19,000 would be \u201cretained\u201d staff and 12,000 would be from overseas. <strong>Jamie Grierson</strong></p> \n<h2>Environment</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Homes will be made more energy efficient, with \u00a39.2bn to be spent on insulation and similar measures for schools and hospitals.</p></li> \n <li><p>Offshore wind is to reach 40GW of capacity by 2030, \u00a3800m for carbon capture and storage, and \u00a3500m to help energy-intensive industries reduce carbon.</p></li> \n <li><p>Seas will be protected with a \u00a3500m Blue Planet Fund, producers of plastic waste will have to take responsibility for its disposal, and the export of plastic waste to developing countries will be banned.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Measures on insulation and targets for offshore wind raise questions over what the Conservatives have done on such issues while in government. The number of homes being newly insulated collapsed in the past five years after the previous incentive system was abandoned, and the requirement for new homes to be built to zero-carbon standards was dropped in 2015. Offshore wind is growing, but onshore wind farms \u2013 which are cheaper \u2013 are stymied by previous Tory governments\u2019 measures to make planning permission all but impossible, and there is no mention of solar power, uptake of which plunged after incentives were withdrawn. On transport, the measures to support electric vehicles are for charging infrastructure rather than addressing the cost of the vehicles, and the road-building and repair budget dwarfs low-carbon transport spending. More responsibility will be put on producers to cut plastic waste, but also missing is any commitment to keep EU recycling targets after Brexit. Campaigners say this does not add up to a plan to achieve zero-carbon by 2050, despite the re-confirmation of that target. <strong>Fiona Harvey</strong></p> \n<h2>Brexit</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Start putting the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU27 in Brussels last month through parliament before Christmas and leave the EU in January.</p></li> \n <li><p>Negotiate a trade agreement with the EU27 next year and refuse to extend the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020.</p></li> \n <li><p>Legislate at the same to underpin workers\u2019 rights, environmental protections and consumer rights.</p></li> \n <li><p>Replace the common agricultural policy with a system based on \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>Set up a new office for environmental protection.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The central mantra of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d runs through the Tory manifesto like a stick of rock, but there are major questions about how oven-ready Johnson\u2019s plan really is.</p> \n<p>The document commits to negotiating a trade deal with the EU next year, and not to extend the implementation period beyond December 2020 \u2013 effectively leaving the prospect of a disruptive no-deal Brexit a firm possibility.</p> \n<p>Johnson could argue this strengthens his hand with Brussels, but leading trade experts warn that international agreements are fiendishly complex and can take several years to conclude \u2013 an average of 48 months. Johnson will argue Britain and the EU are in close alignment, so precedents for lengthy trade talks do not apply. But there will also be concerns that the intention of negotiating with other countries \u201cin parallel with our EU deal\u201d may be problematic as a deal with one partner could affect what can be negotiated with another. <strong>Richard Partington</strong></p> \n<h2>Immigration</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Introduce a \u201cfirmer and fairer\u201d Australian-style points based immigration system that will:<br>1) Require most people to have a clear job offer before they can come.<br>2) Reduce the number of lower-skilled immigrants and the number of people coming into the country overall.<br>3) Treat EU and non-EU immigrants equally \u2013 including not allowing them to access unemployment and other benefits for the first five years.</p></li> \n <li><p>Ensure immigrants contribute to the NHS, paying in before they can receive benefits.</p></li> \n <li><p>Introduce an \u201cNHS Visa\u201d to fast track entry for qualified doctors, nurses and other health professionals from overseas, with a job offer from the NHS and who speak good English.</p></li> \n <li><p>Actively recruit \u201cleaders in the field\u201d to come to the UK \u2013 including the best technology and science graduates and winners of top scientific prizes.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T18:34:05/embed.html\" data-alt=\"immigration graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T18:34:05/embed.html\">immigration graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Along with \u201cthe will of the people\u201d and \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d has become well-established in the lexicon of Brexit bingo. Nigel Farage has been banging on about the fabled approach for many years. Now the offer has reached the political offer from one of the big parties, with the Tories\u2019 pledging to adopt the framework in the UK.</p> \n<p>It is unusual that the party has included this pledge before hearing back from the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac), which has been asked by the home secretary, Priti Patel, to review the feasibility of introducing an Australian-style points-based system in the UK.</p> \n<p>Beyond this, the detail remains light. The manifesto states: \u201cMost people coming into the country will need a clear job offer.\u201d This already deviates from the Australian system in that one of the key features of that approach is that a job offer is not required. What will points be issued for? The manifesto mentions English language and \u201cgood education\u201d. The Australian system is far more complex. <strong>Jamie Grierson</strong></p> \n<h2>Education and early years</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Increase spending on schools to level up per pupil funding to \u00a35,000, as already announced.</p></li> \n <li><p>Back school heads and teachers on discipline \u2013 including by supporting the use of exclusions.</p></li> \n <li><p>Expand \u201calternative provision\u201d schools for children who have been excluded.</p></li> \n <li><p>Offer an \u201carts premium\u201d to secondary schools to \u201cfund enriching activities\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>Raise teachers\u2019 starting salaries to \u00a330,000.</p></li> \n <li><p>Review the care system to make sure children get the support they need.</p></li> \n <li><p>Establish a \u00a31bn fund to help create more high quality, affordable childcare, including before and after school and during the holidays.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The pledge for more money for schools was first made in the summer but no cash was forthcoming straight away.

It is unlear whether that allocation is included in the \u00a314bn.</p> \n<p>The Institute of Fiscal Studies has estimated that because student numbers are to rise, and once inflation is taken into account, the extra money for schools adds up to a 7.4% real-terms increase in spending per pupil between 2019-20 and 2022-23. This is less than the 8% it has worked out would be needed to reverse cuts in funding since 2009-10.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives offer on childcare is smaller than Labour\u2019s \u2013 it does not explicitly promise free childcare for younger children, and it is unclear how money from the \u00a31bn fund would be allocated. <strong>Hilary Osborne</strong></p> \n<h2>Economy and Skills</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Fund day-to-day spending through taxation, while increasing borrowing to \u201cinvest thoughtfully and responsibly in infrastructure\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>Public debt to be lower than the last parliament.</p></li> \n <li><p>Public sector net investment not to average more than 3% of GDP; and if debt interest reaches 6% of annual revenue, \u201cwe will reassess our plans to keep debt under control\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>Prioritise the environment in the next budget.</p></li> \n <li><p>Create a new \u00a33bn skills fund to provide funding for education and training.</p></li> \n <li><p>Create a single enforcement body for labour standards.</p></li> \n <li><p>Ensure workers have the right to request a more predictable contract.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T16:00:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"spending promise by party graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T16:00:15/embed.html\">spending promise by party graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The Conservatives are offering a fraction of what the other leading opposition parties are proposing. When it comes to day-to-day spending, the Tory plan would increase the amount spent by just \u00a32.9bn a year by 2023-24, compared with \u00a382.9bn for Labour and \u00a362.9bn for the Lib Dems.</p> \n<p>On that basis, Labour would spend almost \u00a328 more for every extra pound the Conservatives promise, This is the clearest attempt by the Tories to put clear blue water between Johnson and Corbyn. The differences are stark.</p> \n<p>According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the plan would lift government spending as a share of national income a few places up the international league table for wealthy nations. Labour plan a German-sized state with government spending of about 45% of GDP, while the Tories aim to match the Netherlands at roughly 41%. Though modest in comparison with Labour, it would still mean the biggest increase in the size of the state under a Tory government since Harold Macmillan.</p> \n<p>Johnson will hope the public believe Labour lack credibility with the public finances \u2013 but it could backfire. The Tories could be charged with failing to credibly turn the page on a decade of austerity, while committing insufficient funds to tackle the climate emergency. The Tory manifesto offers a relative status-quo, versus Labour\u2019s fundamental reform. <strong>Richard Partington</strong></p> \n<h2>Tax, pay and benefits</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Raise the national insurance threshold to \u00a39,500 next year, with an \u201cultimate ambition\u201d of increasing it further, to \u00a312,500.</p></li> \n <li><p>A \u201ctriple lock\u201d on personal taxation: no increase in the rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT.</p></li> \n <li><p>Offer a \u201cnew deal for towns\u201d, cutting taxes for high street shops and providing funding for regeneration projects through the Towns Fund.</p></li> \n <li><p>Continue the rollout of universal credit, and \u201cmake sure it works for the most vulnerable\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>End the benefit freeze.</p></li> \n <li><p>Extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers to a week.</p></li> \n <li><p>Reduce the number of reassessments faced by disabled people, when their condition is unlikely to change.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T18:34:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"national insurance graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T18:34:49/embed.html\">national insurance graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>One omission is an increase in the higher-rate income tax threshold, which could anger Tory voters. Johnson appears to have concluded that this tax cut for the wealthy would prove an electoral mistake.</p> \n<p>The \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d is similar to Labour\u2019s promise not to raise income taxes ,VAT and national insurance, although Corbyn\u2019s party will target the top 5% of earners.</p> \n<p>Such constraints could be problematic if the government finds it needs to raise more money to fund public services. Any chancellor could also be hamstrung in an economic downturn.</p> \n<p>The big promise to cut national insurance comes with a \u00a32.5bn price tag, according to the manifesto costing document. However, Johnson has been warned that an ambition to tmove the threshold up to \u00a312,500 a year would come with an even heftier price tag of arbout \u00a36bn more \u2013 a figure missing from the five-year plan at present. <strong>Richard Partington</strong></p> \n<h2>Crime and justice</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Recruit 20,000 new police officers.</p></li> \n <li><p>Empower police to target known knife carriers, making it easier for them to stop and search those convicted of knife crime.</p></li> \n <li><p>Introduce tougher sentencing for the worst offenders and end automatic halfway release for serious crimes.</p></li> \n <li><p>Prevent more foreign national offenders entering the country.</p></li> \n <li><p>Establish a royal commission on the criminal justice process.</p></li> \n <li><p>Expand electronic tagging and toughen up community sentences \u2013 for example, by making curfews tighter.</p></li> \n <li><p>Create a new national cybercrime force and a new national crime laboratory.</p></li> \n <li><p>Add 10,000 more prison places.</p></li> \n <li><p>Review the parole system and allow victims to attend parole hearings.</p></li> \n <li><p>Spend \u00a3500m on youth services in an effort to to reduce offending.</p></li> \n <li><p>Expand the role of local police and crime commissioners and make them more accountable.</p></li> \n <li><p>Pass a new victims law that guarantees their rights and the support they should receive.</p></li> \n <li><p>Tackle unauthorised Traveller camps by giving the police new powers to arrest and seize property and vehicles of trespassers.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The Tories\u2019 toughened stance on law and order is by now well-known, with Johnson making his pledge to recruit 20,000 police officers one of the first he made as prime minister. Increased use of stop and search, longer sentences for some violent and sex offenders, and creating 10,000 new prison places are all in there.</p> \n<p>However, much of what is proposed goes against the evidence of what works when attempting to reduce crime and reoffending. Experts warn stop and search entrenches knife crime. The government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy states a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d \u2013 low educational attainment, poor health, unemployment and more. Short prison sentences, which were close to being scrapped before Johnson took office, are proven to be ineffective.</p> \n<p>The Tories are getting tough on crime without being so tough on \u2013 or interested in \u2013 its causes. <strong>Jamie Grierson</strong></p> \n<h2>Foreign policy and defence</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Continue to exceed the Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence and increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation throughout the parliament.</p></li> \n <li><p>Maintain the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.</p></li> \n <li><p>Maintain the Trident nuclear deterrent.</p></li> \n <li><p>Introduce new legislation to tackle vexatious legal claims against veterans.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>As he presented the manifesto, Johnson moved fast to put to bed reports that troop numbers could be cut under a Conservative government. According to the Sunday Times, defence chiefs are discussing plans to slash the size of the army amid fears of further cuts. But asked by reporters whether troops would be cut, Johnson replied with a firm no.</p> \n<p>It is correct, however, that the manifesto does not include a firm pledge to \u201cmaintain the overall size of the armed forces\u201d, as it did under Theresa May in 2017. The 2015 Tory manifesto pledged to keep the army\u2019s strength at minimum of 82,000 but that commitment was dropped \u2013 with the figure hovering around 73,000.</p> \n<p>The manifesto maintains the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid but does little to assuage fears that Johnson plans to alter the way in which the aid budget is spent. <strong>Jamie Grierson</strong></p> \n<h2>Housing</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>\u201cEncourage\u201d a market in long-term fixed rate mortgages, which could \u201cslash the cost of deposits\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>Allow councils to use the money they raise from developers through the planning process to give low-paid local people a discount of up to a third on some of the new homes build.</p></li> \n <li><p>Reform leasehold, including by banning the sale of new leasehold homes.</p></li> \n <li><p>Bring in a \u201cbetter deal for renters\u201d, including abolishing no fault evictions and requiring one \u201clifetime\u201d deposit that moves with the tenant.</p></li> \n <li><p>Change planning rules so infrastructure such as schools and GP surgeries have to be built before housing.</p></li> \n <li><p>Protect and enhance the green belt.</p></li> \n <li><p>End rough sleeping by the end of the parliament: part paid for with proceeds of a 3% stamp duty surcharge on foreign buyers.</p></li> \n <li><p>Support the residents of highrises with the removal of unsafe cladding</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Mortgage lending rules that came in after the crash are designed to stop people taking on loans they could struggle to repay in future, but the Conservatives appear to be saying they would make changes to free up lending. Fixing interest rates offsets some of the risk, but if prices fall there will be more people at risk of negative equity. Previous attempts by lenders to offer long-term fixed-rate mortgages have failed, so this would need a big change in the market and homebuyers\u2019 attitudes.</p> \n<p>A big problem with cutting deposits for first-time buyers is it is likely to fuel demand for homes without tackling the supply-side problems. Renters will be pleased with the pledges on no-fault evictions, and lifetime deposits, but social housing will be lost with the maintenance of right-to buy. <strong>Hilary Osborne</strong><br></p> \n<h2>Business and employment</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Cancel planned corporation tax cuts, leaving the 19% rate in place and saving \u00a36.3bn a year by 2023-24.</p></li> \n <li><p>Carry out a fundamental review of the rates system to cut the burden on businesses.</p></li> \n <li><p>Increase the employment allowance for small firms \u2013 a discount on national insurance payments.</p></li> \n <li><p>Increase the research and development tax credit rate to 13%.</p></li> \n <li><p>Crack down on tax evasion and avoidance, including by passing a new law doubling the prison term to 14 years for individuals convicted of the worst forms of tax fraud.</p></li> \n <li><p>Implement the digital services tax, which is aimed at forcing multinationals to pay more tax in the UK.</p></li> \n <li><p>Create a new arms length agency for \u201chigh-risk, high-payoff research\u201d that will receive some of the planned increase in science spending.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Johnson has not always had the smoothest relationship with business, given his infamous remarks about company bosses\u2019 Brexit concerns, though CEOs are likely to broadly welcome this manifesto.</p> \n<p>The Confederation of British Industry said firms would be \u201cheartened by a pro-enterprise vision\u201d and praised the \u00a33bn national skills fund for training workers. But there are questions about the impact of Brexit for firms that are yet to be answered.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s decision to scrap the planned corporation tax cut has gone down badly with some Tory supporters, but the prime minister has been advised that such a change would simply damage public finances without boosting growth.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a review of business rates could be a double-edged sword. Companies could save millions of pounds from reforms to a system widely regarded to be broken. Retailers in particular have lobbied hard for cuts, saying the tax is among reasons for shop closures and job losses on the high street. But councils have grown more reliant on business rates revenue amid cuts to their funding from central government. Further cuts present additional challenges. <strong>Richard Partington</strong></p> \n<h2>Transport and Energy</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>End rail franchising and create a simpler, more effective system.</p></li> \n <li><p>Invest \u00a329bn in strategic roads.</p></li> \n <li><p>Build a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d rail line between Leeds and Manchester.</p></li> \n <li><p>Invest in the Midlands rail hub, strengthening links including between Birmingham, Leicester and Nottingham.</p></li> \n <li><p>Extend contactless ticketing to 200 more stations in the south-east.</p></li> \n <li><p>Consult on whether to go ahead with HS2 rail project, which as the manifesto points out will now cost \u201cat least \u00a381bn\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>Restore many of the rail lines closed down during the Beeching cuts, reconnecting small towns.</p></li> \n <li><p>Launch \u201cthe biggest ever pothole filling programme\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>Create a new \u00a3350m cyling infrastructure fund to support commuter cycling routes.</p></li> \n <li><p>Require the owners of Heathrow to show it can meet air quality and noise requirements for the third runway to go ahead, and that the project will get no new public funding.</p></li> \n <li><p>Bring full-fibre broadband to every home and business by 2025, including setting aside \u00a35bn to connect premises where it wouldn\u2019t be commercially viable.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The manifesto promises a \u201ctransport revolution\u201d but not much of it is new and it was pot holes that made the headlines before the launch, with \u00a32bn pledged to filling them over the next four years. This is considerably more than the \u00a3500m allocated to a \u201creversing Beeching fund\u201d for railways, but to meet that promise experts say they will need more funds. It also dwarfs the money being pledged for infrastructure to support electric vehicles \u2013 \u00a3600m over six years \u2013 and an investment of \u00a3350m in cycling.</p> \n<p>The \u00a329bn investment in strategic roads sounds very like money <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/2018/10/autumn-budget-2018-28-8bn-injection-into-uk-roads-fuel-duty-frozen-again/\">pledged back in 2018</a> by the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, rather than new money, and does not appearing in the costings document.</p> \n<p>The manifesto pledge on broadband confirms that the Conservatives have rowed back on <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-full-fibre-broadband-uk-2025\">a previous promise made by Boris Johnson</a> to install full-fibre broadband to every home and business by 2025.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s been replaced by the promise of \u201cfull-fibre and gigabit-capable\u201d broadband, which is still ambitious but will be easier to achieve than the original plan and still provide faster speeds for consumers. <strong>Hilary Osborne</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2019 because one of the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto pledges is to extend contactless ticketing to 200 more stations in the south-east, not 200,000 as an earlier version said.

      "bodyText": "Health Increase spending on the NHS by \u00a334bn a year by the end of the parliament (as already announced). Build and fund 40 new hospitals over the next 10 years. Enshrine the long-term funding plan for the NHS in law. Deliver 50,000 more nurses, providing them with a maintenance grant of \u00a35,000-\u00a38,000 a year (effectively bringing back the nursing bursary that was scrapped two years ago) Create 50m more GP appointments each year, by recruiting and training 6,000 more general practitioners and 6,000 more primary care doctors. Allocate \u00a31bn extra for social care in every year of the next parliament; and \u201cbuild a cross party consensus\u201d on how it should be funded in the long term \u2013 while guaranteeing that no one should have to sell their home to pay for care. Make finding a cure for dementia a priority, doubling funding for research. Abolish hospital car park charges for blue badge holders and the gravely ill. Clamp down on \u201chealth tourism\u201d and increase the surcharge foreign users pay for the NHS. The NHS has undoubtedly been the main domestic issue of the campaign so far with attempts at spending one-upmanship between the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats and claims that a post-Brexit US trade deal would allow the NHS to be put \u201cup for sale\u201d dominating coverage outside of the UK leaving the EU. But some of Boris Johnson\u2019s key NHS pledges have proven to be problematic. The prime minister\u2019s claim that the government will build 40 new hospitals rapidly fell apart in late September, although he continues to push the misleading assertion. The Government has confirmed that six existing hospitals in England are being given \u00a32.7bn by 2025 as part of the programme \u2013 an upgrade rather than a fresh build. Another 21 hospital trusts are being given \u00a3100m in seed funding to prepare a business case for their hospitals \u2013 but no money for any actual building work. The work would then start between 2025 and 2030. And on manifesto launch day, the pledge to recruit 50,000 was immediately thrown into doubt when it emerged 19,000 would be \u201cretained\u201d staff and 12,000 would be from overseas. Jamie Grierson Environment Homes will be made more energy efficient, with \u00a39.2bn to be spent on insulation and similar measures for schools and hospitals. Offshore wind is to reach 40GW of capacity by 2030, \u00a3800m for carbon capture and storage, and \u00a3500m to help energy-intensive industries reduce carbon. Seas will be protected with a \u00a3500m Blue Planet Fund, producers of plastic waste will have to take responsibility for its disposal, and the export of plastic waste to developing countries will be banned. Measures on insulation and targets for offshore wind raise questions over what the Conservatives have done on such issues while in government. The number of homes being newly insulated collapsed in the past five years after the previous incentive system was abandoned, and the requirement for new homes to be built to zero-carbon standards was dropped in 2015. Offshore wind is growing, but onshore wind farms \u2013 which are cheaper \u2013 are stymied by previous Tory governments\u2019 measures to make planning permission all but impossible, and there is no mention of solar power, uptake of which plunged after incentives were withdrawn. On transport, the measures to support electric vehicles are for charging infrastructure rather than addressing the cost of the vehicles, and the road-building and repair budget dwarfs low-carbon transport spending. More responsibility will be put on producers to cut plastic waste, but also missing is any commitment to keep EU recycling targets after Brexit. Campaigners say this does not add up to a plan to achieve zero-carbon by 2050, despite the re-confirmation of that target. Fiona Harvey Brexit Start putting the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU27 in Brussels last month through parliament before Christmas and leave the EU in January. Negotiate a trade agreement with the EU27 next year and refuse to extend the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. Legislate at the same to underpin workers\u2019 rights, environmental protections and consumer rights. Replace the common agricultural policy with a system based on \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d. Set up a new office for environmental protection. The central mantra of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d runs through the Tory manifesto like a stick of rock, but there are major questions about how oven-ready Johnson\u2019s plan really is. The document commits to negotiating a trade deal with the EU next year, and not to extend the implementation period beyond December 2020 \u2013 effectively leaving the prospect of a disruptive no-deal Brexit a firm possibility. Johnson could argue this strengthens his hand with Brussels, but leading trade experts warn that international agreements are fiendishly complex and can take several years to conclude \u2013 an average of 48 months. Johnson will argue Britain and the EU are in close alignment, so precedents for lengthy trade talks do not apply. But there will also be concerns that the intention of negotiating with other countries \u201cin parallel with our EU deal\u201d may be problematic as a deal with one partner could affect what can be negotiated with another. Richard Partington Immigration Introduce a \u201cfirmer and fairer\u201d Australian-style points based immigration system that will: 1) Require most people to have a clear job offer before they can come. 2) Reduce the number of lower-skilled immigrants and the number of people coming into the country overall. 3) Treat EU and non-EU immigrants equally \u2013 including not allowing them to access unemployment and other benefits for the first five years. Ensure immigrants contribute to the NHS, paying in before they can receive benefits. Introduce an \u201cNHS Visa\u201d to fast track entry for qualified doctors, nurses and other health professionals from overseas, with a job offer from the NHS and who speak good English. Actively recruit \u201cleaders in the field\u201d to come to the UK \u2013 including the best technology and science graduates and winners of top scientific prizes. Along with \u201cthe will of the people\u201d and \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d has become well-established in the lexicon of Brexit bingo. Nigel Farage has been banging on about the fabled approach for many years. Now the offer has reached the political offer from one of the big parties, with the Tories\u2019 pledging to adopt the framework in the UK. It is unusual that the party has included this pledge before hearing back from the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac), which has been asked by the home secretary, Priti Patel, to review the feasibility of introducing an Australian-style points-based system in the UK. Beyond this, the detail remains light. The manifesto states: \u201cMost people coming into the country will need a clear job offer.\u201d This already deviates from the Australian system in that one of the key features of that approach is that a job offer is not required. What will points be issued for? The manifesto mentions English language and \u201cgood education\u201d. The Australian system is far more complex. Jamie Grierson Education and early years Increase spending on schools to level up per pupil funding to \u00a35,000, as already announced. Back school heads and teachers on discipline \u2013 including by supporting the use of exclusions. Expand \u201calternative provision\u201d schools for children who have been excluded. Offer an \u201carts premium\u201d to secondary schools to \u201cfund enriching activities\u201d. Raise teachers\u2019 starting salaries to \u00a330,000. Review the care system to make sure children get the support they need. Establish a \u00a31bn fund to help create more high quality, affordable childcare, including before and after school and during the holidays. The pledge for more money for schools was first made in the summer but no cash was forthcoming straight away. The schools budget was already poised to rise by \u00a31bn a year by 2023 owing to an increase in the number of students. It is unlear whether that allocation is included in the \u00a314bn. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has estimated that because student numbers are to rise, and once inflation is taken into account, the extra money for schools adds up to a 7.4% real-terms increase in spending per pupil between 2019-20 and 2022-23. This is less than the 8% it has worked out would be needed to reverse cuts in funding since 2009-10. The Conservatives offer on childcare is smaller than Labour\u2019s \u2013 it does not explicitly promise free childcare for younger children, and it is unclear how money from the \u00a31bn fund would be allocated. Hilary Osborne Economy and Skills Fund day-to-day spending through taxation, while increasing borrowing to \u201cinvest thoughtfully and responsibly in infrastructure\u201d. Public debt to be lower than the last parliament. Public sector net investment not to average more than 3% of GDP; and if debt interest reaches 6% of annual revenue, \u201cwe will reassess our plans to keep debt under control\u201d. Prioritise the environment in the next budget. Create a new \u00a33bn skills fund to provide funding for education and training. Create a single enforcement body for labour standards. Ensure workers have the right to request a more predictable contract. The Conservatives are offering a fraction of what the other leading opposition parties are proposing. When it comes to day-to-day spending, the Tory plan would increase the amount spent by just \u00a32.9bn a year by 2023-24, compared with \u00a382.9bn for Labour and \u00a362.9bn for the Lib Dems. On that basis, Labour would spend almost \u00a328 more for every extra pound the Conservatives promise, This is the clearest attempt by the Tories to put clear blue water between Johnson and Corbyn. The differences are stark. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the plan would lift government spending as a share of national income a few places up the international league table for wealthy nations. Labour plan a German-sized state with government spending of about 45% of GDP, while the Tories aim to match the Netherlands at roughly 41%. Though modest in comparison with Labour, it would still mean the biggest increase in the size of the state under a Tory government since Harold Macmillan. Johnson will hope the public believe Labour lack credibility with the public finances \u2013 but it could backfire. The Tories could be charged with failing to credibly turn the page on a decade of austerity, while committing insufficient funds to tackle the climate emergency. The Tory manifesto offers a relative status-quo, versus Labour\u2019s fundamental reform. Richard Partington Tax, pay and benefits Raise the national insurance threshold to \u00a39,500 next year, with an \u201cultimate ambition\u201d of increasing it further, to \u00a312,500. A \u201ctriple lock\u201d on personal taxation: no increase in the rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT. Offer a \u201cnew deal for towns\u201d, cutting taxes for high street shops and providing funding for regeneration projects through the Towns Fund. Continue the rollout of universal credit, and \u201cmake sure it works for the most vulnerable\u201d. End the benefit freeze. Extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers to a week. Reduce the number of reassessments faced by disabled people, when their condition is unlikely to change. One omission is an increase in the higher-rate income tax threshold, which could anger Tory voters. Johnson appears to have concluded that this tax cut for the wealthy would prove an electoral mistake. The \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d is similar to Labour\u2019s promise not to raise income taxes ,VAT and national insurance, although Corbyn\u2019s party will target the top 5% of earners. Such constraints could be problematic if the government finds it needs to raise more money to fund public services. Any chancellor could also be hamstrung in an economic downturn. The big promise to cut national insurance comes with a \u00a32.5bn price tag, according to the manifesto costing document. However, Johnson has been warned that an ambition to tmove the threshold up to \u00a312,500 a year would come with an even heftier price tag of arbout \u00a36bn more \u2013 a figure missing from the five-year plan at present. Richard Partington Crime and justice Recruit 20,000 new police officers. Empower police to target known knife carriers, making it easier for them to stop and search those convicted of knife crime. Introduce tougher sentencing for the worst offenders and end automatic halfway release for serious crimes. Prevent more foreign national offenders entering the country. Establish a royal commission on the criminal justice process. Expand electronic tagging and toughen up community sentences \u2013 for example, by making curfews tighter. Create a new national cybercrime force and a new national crime laboratory. Add 10,000 more prison places. Review the parole system and allow victims to attend parole hearings. Spend \u00a3500m on youth services in an effort to to reduce offending. Expand the role of local police and crime commissioners and make them more accountable. Pass a new victims law that guarantees their rights and the support they should receive. Tackle unauthorised Traveller camps by giving the police new powers to arrest and seize property and vehicles of trespassers. The Tories\u2019 toughened stance on law and order is by now well-known, with Johnson making his pledge to recruit 20,000 police officers one of the first he made as prime minister. Increased use of stop and search, longer sentences for some violent and sex offenders, and creating 10,000 new prison places are all in there. However, much of what is proposed goes against the evidence of what works when attempting to reduce crime and reoffending. Experts warn stop and search entrenches knife crime. The government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy states a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d \u2013 low educational attainment, poor health, unemployment and more. Short prison sentences, which were close to being scrapped before Johnson took office, are proven to be ineffective. The Tories are getting tough on crime without being so tough on \u2013 or interested in \u2013 its causes. Jamie Grierson Foreign policy and defence Continue to exceed the Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence and increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation throughout the parliament. Maintain the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid. Maintain the Trident nuclear deterrent. Introduce new legislation to tackle vexatious legal claims against veterans. As he presented the manifesto, Johnson moved fast to put to bed reports that troop numbers could be cut under a Conservative government. According to the Sunday Times, defence chiefs are discussing plans to slash the size of the army amid fears of further cuts. But asked by reporters whether troops would be cut, Johnson replied with a firm no. It is correct, however, that the manifesto does not include a firm pledge to \u201cmaintain the overall size of the armed forces\u201d, as it did under Theresa May in 2017. The 2015 Tory manifesto pledged to keep the army\u2019s strength at minimum of 82,000 but that commitment was dropped \u2013 with the figure hovering around 73,000. The manifesto maintains the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid but does little to assuage fears that Johnson plans to alter the way in which the aid budget is spent. Jamie Grierson Housing \u201cEncourage\u201d a market in long-term fixed rate mortgages, which could \u201cslash the cost of deposits\u201d. Allow councils to use the money they raise from developers through the planning process to give low-paid local people a discount of up to a third on some of the new homes build. Reform leasehold, including by banning the sale of new leasehold homes. Bring in a \u201cbetter deal for renters\u201d, including abolishing no fault evictions and requiring one \u201clifetime\u201d deposit that moves with the tenant. Change planning rules so infrastructure such as schools and GP surgeries have to be built before housing. Protect and enhance the green belt. End rough sleeping by the end of the parliament: part paid for with proceeds of a 3% stamp duty surcharge on foreign buyers. Support the residents of highrises with the removal of unsafe cladding Mortgage lending rules that came in after the crash are designed to stop people taking on loans they could struggle to repay in future, but the Conservatives appear to be saying they would make changes to free up lending. Fixing interest rates offsets some of the risk, but if prices fall there will be more people at risk of negative equity. Previous attempts by lenders to offer long-term fixed-rate mortgages have failed, so this would need a big change in the market and homebuyers\u2019 attitudes. A big problem with cutting deposits for first-time buyers is it is likely to fuel demand for homes without tackling the supply-side problems. Renters will be pleased with the pledges on no-fault evictions, and lifetime deposits, but social housing will be lost with the maintenance of right-to buy. Hilary Osborne Business and employment Cancel planned corporation tax cuts, leaving the 19% rate in place and saving \u00a36.3bn a year by 2023-24. Carry out a fundamental review of the rates system to cut the burden on businesses. Increase the employment allowance for small firms \u2013 a discount on national insurance payments. Increase the research and development tax credit rate to 13%. Crack down on tax evasion and avoidance, including by passing a new law doubling the prison term to 14 years for individuals convicted of the worst forms of tax fraud. Implement the digital services tax, which is aimed at forcing multinationals to pay more tax in the UK. Create a new arms length agency for \u201chigh-risk, high-payoff research\u201d that will receive some of the planned increase in science spending. Johnson has not always had the smoothest relationship with business, given his infamous remarks about company bosses\u2019 Brexit concerns, though CEOs are likely to broadly welcome this manifesto. The Confederation of British Industry said firms would be \u201cheartened by a pro-enterprise vision\u201d and praised the \u00a33bn national skills fund for training workers. But there are questions about the impact of Brexit for firms that are yet to be answered. Johnson\u2019s decision to scrap the planned corporation tax cut has gone down badly with some Tory supporters, but the prime minister has been advised that such a change would simply damage public finances without boosting growth. Meanwhile, a review of business rates could be a double-edged sword. Companies could save millions of pounds from reforms to a system widely regarded to be broken. Retailers in particular have lobbied hard for cuts, saying the tax is among reasons for shop closures and job losses on the high street. But councils have grown more reliant on business rates revenue amid cuts to their funding from central government. Further cuts present additional challenges. Richard Partington Transport and Energy End rail franchising and create a simpler, more effective system. Invest \u00a329bn in strategic roads. Build a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d rail line between Leeds and Manchester. Invest in the Midlands rail hub, strengthening links including between Birmingham, Leicester and Nottingham. Extend contactless ticketing to 200 more stations in the south-east. Consult on whether to go ahead with HS2 rail project, which as the manifesto points out will now cost \u201cat least \u00a381bn\u201d. Restore many of the rail lines closed down during the Beeching cuts, reconnecting small towns. Launch \u201cthe biggest ever pothole filling programme\u201d. Create a new \u00a3350m cyling infrastructure fund to support commuter cycling routes. Require the owners of Heathrow to show it can meet air quality and noise requirements for the third runway to go ahead, and that the project will get no new public funding. Bring full-fibre broadband to every home and business by 2025, including setting aside \u00a35bn to connect premises where it wouldn\u2019t be commercially viable. The manifesto promises a \u201ctransport revolution\u201d but not much of it is new and it was pot holes that made the headlines before the launch, with \u00a32bn pledged to filling them over the next four years. This is considerably more than the \u00a3500m allocated to a \u201creversing Beeching fund\u201d for railways, but to meet that promise experts say they will need more funds. It also dwarfs the money being pledged for infrastructure to support electric vehicles \u2013 \u00a3600m over six years \u2013 and an investment of \u00a3350m in cycling. The \u00a329bn investment in strategic roads sounds very like money pledged back in 2018 by the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, rather than new money, and does not appearing in the costings document. The manifesto pledge on broadband confirms that the Conservatives have rowed back on a previous promise made by Boris Johnson to install full-fibre broadband to every home and business by 2025. That\u2019s been replaced by the promise of \u201cfull-fibre and gigabit-capable\u201d broadband, which is still ambitious but will be easier to achieve than the original plan and still provide faster speeds for consumers. Hilary Osborne \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2019 because one of the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto pledges is to extend contactless ticketing to 200 more stations in the south-east, not 200,000 as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

We\u2019d all be overnight billionaires like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/back-to-the-future-writer-bad-guy-biff-was-based-on-donald-trump\">Biff Tannen</a> in Back to the Future Part II. But when said TV show is merely foretelling something as yawnsome as the weather, few care, even though the technology to forecast the weather is \u2026 Actually, who knows how they forecast the weather, but you can bet it\u2019s really expensive and complicated and uses all sorts of anemometers and barometers and other expensive and complicated things ending in \u201cometers\u201d?</p> <p>These days, most people simply combine the old school (look out of the window, which is surprisingly up-to-date) with the new (look at your phone, which neatly sums everything in an icon). Hence the Weather is only really watched by true weather aficionados or people waiting for The One Show to start.</p> <p>The first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/16/bbc-weathermen-being-moved-off-screen\">televised weather report</a> was given in 1954 by George Cowling, famous for being, erm, the first BBC TV weatherman. In the 70s and 80s, weathermen resembled geography teachers on their way home from a disco, apart from Barbara Edwards (the first lady weatherman in 1974) who looked as if she taught home economics. Who can forget poor Michael Fish categorically denying the Great Storm of 1987? (Erm, everyone under 30?). There have been further controversies of course. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekiManwI26s\">Louise Lear got the giggles</a> in 2016, leaving her in tears while chatting about incoming storms across Reading. Simon King felt some pressure when he unveiled his <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-weatherman-simon-king-opens-14051468\">new hair transplant</a> in February 2019.

The days are long gone when weathermen slapped magnetic clouds on to paper cutouts of the UK. Computer images came into play in 1985, satellite in 2000, and 3D imagery in 2005. Things trundled along until March 2018 when, after 95 years of buying in its weather from the Met Office (the Rolls-Royce of weather services), the BBC controversially decided to save cash by renegotiating with whichever cheaper private weather organisation (in this case MeteoGroup) seemingly threw in the most unwanted extras.</p> <p>Gasp! at the new flat-map projection, meaning that Scotland is no longer out of proportion. Cry! at the improvements in high-res mapping, including key roads and urban areas.

      "bodyText": "Imagine if you could tune into a daily TV show that (more or less) predicts the future, localised (more or less) to your house. We\u2019d all be overnight billionaires like Biff Tannen in Back to the Future Part II. But when said TV show is merely foretelling something as yawnsome as the weather, few care, even though the technology to forecast the weather is \u2026 Actually, who knows how they forecast the weather, but you can bet it\u2019s really expensive and complicated and uses all sorts of anemometers and barometers and other expensive and complicated things ending in \u201cometers\u201d? These days, most people simply combine the old school (look out of the window, which is surprisingly up-to-date) with the new (look at your phone, which neatly sums everything in an icon). Hence the Weather is only really watched by true weather aficionados or people waiting for The One Show to start. The first televised weather report was given in 1954 by George Cowling, famous for being, erm, the first BBC TV weatherman. In the 70s and 80s, weathermen resembled geography teachers on their way home from a disco, apart from Barbara Edwards (the first lady weatherman in 1974) who looked as if she taught home economics. Who can forget poor Michael Fish categorically denying the Great Storm of 1987? (Erm, everyone under 30?). There have been further controversies of course. Louise Lear got the giggles in 2016, leaving her in tears while chatting about incoming storms across Reading. Simon King felt some pressure when he unveiled his new hair transplant in February 2019. And gay icon Tomasz Schafernaker risked a notable chill factor coming in from the south by stripping for Attitude in 2010, the same year he was caught sticking his middle finger up at newsreader Simon McCoy. But the Weather\u2019s real jump-the-shark moment had less to do with the presenters and more to do with what they were pointing at. The days are long gone when weathermen slapped magnetic clouds on to paper cutouts of the UK. Computer images came into play in 1985, satellite in 2000, and 3D imagery in 2005. Things trundled along until March 2018 when, after 95 years of buying in its weather from the Met Office (the Rolls-Royce of weather services), the BBC controversially decided to save cash by renegotiating with whichever cheaper private weather organisation (in this case MeteoGroup) seemingly threw in the most unwanted extras. Gasp! at the new flat-map projection, meaning that Scotland is no longer out of proportion. Cry! at the improvements in high-res mapping, including key roads and urban areas. Yet, on its launch more than a thousand cynical comments were left on the BBC\u2019s website within 10 days, branding the new service \u201cthe opposite of improvements\u201d, \u201cutterly laughable\u201d, \u201ccluttered and confusing\u201d and \u201cwoefully inaccurate\u201d.

      "body": "<p>I arrive at White Cube in south London just as Anselm Kiefer is writing the title of his exhibition on a gallery wall. Perched on a mini-forklift, the 74-year-old German slowly and meticulously inscribes the words \u201cSuperstrings, Runes, the Norns, Gordian Knot\u201d.<em> </em>It is<em> </em>a typically dense and allusive title for a show that merges Kiefer\u2019s now familiar preoccupations \u2013 ancient myths, astronomy, alchemy, history and arcane systems of knowledge \u2013 with a more recent obsession, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/05/gravitational-waves-string-theory\">string theory</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThese advanced mathematicians are attempting to find a theory of everything,\u201d he says, when we sit down for a chat in a back room of the gallery, \u201cbut each time they open a door, many other doors reveal themselves. It is all abstract mathematics, of course, so nothing is really yet proved. The more I read about it, the more I think they will never find the answer.\u201d He is not good at maths, he tells me, laughing, but nevertheless when a serious mathematician visited his studio recently, he looked at the paintings inspired by string theory and exclaimed: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p> <p>As the exhibition shows, for Kiefer string theory is a relatively new big idea around which all the old big ideas can coalesce. Described in the show\u2019s press release as an attempt \u201cto articulate the known fundamental interactions of the universe and forms of matter\u201d, it is the perfect subject for an artist whose interest in the arcane matches his curiosity for the scientific. He is a rationalist who is fascinated with the mysterious, an agnostic whose work is full of references to ancient belief systems, from the Kabbalah to Gnosticism. When I mention this, he says gaily: \u201cThese are such fantastic systems of thought because there is so much hard work put into proving that there is a big meaning to everything. But, of course, the reason that there is so much hard work is because there is no meaning.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ac9d23c3efcdaa46b9cc7fbf2bba112b21a6736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac9d23c3efcdaa46b9cc7fbf2bba112b21a6736/230_125_2982_2221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Der Gordische Knoten.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Der Gordische Knoten by Anselm Kiefer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy White Cube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In person, as with his art, Kiefer is a complex, obsessive individual, given to making connections that may seem tenuous to the rest of us but provide extraordinarily fertile raw material for his work. The show\u2019s ungainly title barely hints at the range of allusions in the works: to runic alphabets, mathematical equations, mythical prophecies, Alexander the Great and the Norns \u2013 three female spinners of fate from Norse mythology. His recent fascination with string theory has also led him back to the alchemical writings of Robert Fludd, a mystical 17th-century thinker who has long obsessed him: \u201cHe, too, wanted to find this theory of the world.\u201d</p> <p>At White Cube, all of these topics are somehow connected, though the result often resembles a kind of organised chaos theory, no more so than in the gallery\u2019s long central corridor, which is lined with 30 tall glass vitrines full of coils and swirls of plastic tubing and electrical cables. In one, a large axe is visible though the tangle of wires, a reference to the mythical Gordian Knot of the exhibition\u2019s title, which was chopped asunder by Alexander the Great. On the glass panels, Kiefer has scrawled elaborate formulas and equations, latterday runes by, among others, Albert Einstein and Edward Witten, an American theoretical physicist who lends his name to one of the new paintings (Edward Witten: Quantized Gravity).</p> <p>\u201cI cannot produce these formulas exactly, because they are too complicated,\u201d says Kiefer. \u201cSo it is string theory as far as I can understand it. But there is also a deeper fascination that connects me to it.\u201d Is it purely intellectual curiosity? \u201cYes, but also a kind of veneration. Critics say that I am an artist who always wants to overwhelm people. But, no, it is I who am overwhelmed. And, if I am not, something is wrong.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ff85c4b15638948eb234effad6072e39e49ca9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ff85c4b15638948eb234effad6072e39e49ca9f/343_0_2632_2632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramanujan Summation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramanujan Summation by Anselm Kiefer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy White Cube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the spacious galleries on either side of the corridor, though, his epic paintings are indeed overwhelming in their scale and their looming sense of apocalyptic ruin. In this, they are more reassuringly Kieferesque. From a distance, the landscapes look parched and arid, as if a biblical catastrophe has scorched the earth, removing all traces of life. Up close, burnt branches and twigs protrude, charred books dangle from thin wires and broken stalks of straw cling to the canvases. In a series titled Der Gordische Knoten (2019), more large axes appear, suspended as if in mid-flight amid the tangle of wood and wheat in which several burnt sticks have been arranged to resemble ancient runic letters. The paintings are steeped in myth and mystery, the science buried beneath layers of allusion.</p> <p>\u201cIn a way, science is like mystery,\u201d says Kiefer, \u201cinsofar as it does not make me sure of anything. I remember when I did my baccalaureate at high school my statement was, \u2018Wisdom should make us sure; art should make us unsure.\u2019 Smart, no?\u201d So, as an artist, he is working in a state of perpetual uncertainty? \u201cYes, except for when I make a truly great painting, then I feel real.\u201d</p> <p>Kiefer belongs to a generation of postwar German artists for whom recent history, to paraphrase James Joyce, was a nightmare they were trying to escape. An art critic once declared that his work continually posed the question, \u201cHow to be a German artist after Hitler, the be-all and end-all of German artists?\u201d In oil and ash, wood and steel, lead and concrete, as well as fabric, seeds, plant matter and paper, Kiefer has, one way or another, been grappling with that question ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6980784d2c52c525153ddf2d372e4cf946189b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6980784d2c52c525153ddf2d372e4cf946189b0/184_363_3015_1491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Die Sieben Siegel, die geheime Offenbarung des Johannes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"495\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Die Sieben Siegel, die geheime Offenbarung des Johannes by Anselm Kiefer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy White Cube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His critics, including a later generation of more mischievously provocative artists that included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/05/albert-oehlen-interview-gagosian-gallery-london\">Albert Oehlen</a> and the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/07/2\">Martin Kippenberger</a>, lambasted him for what they saw as a quintessentially German portentousness. In person, though, Kiefer is as mischievous as any artist I have met, his often wildly associative train of thought suggesting a mad professor more than a philosophical quester.</p> <p>Intriguingly, his formative artistic mentor was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/beuys\">Joseph Beuys</a>, whom he met in 1971. Back then, Kiefer was still struggling to escape the notoriety he had gained following a series of wilfully provocative photographs he had exhibited in 1969.

It was, he told me in 2008, an attempt \u201cto confront it and explode\u201d the silence that had settled on the German past. That past was still too raw in the collective memory, though, and the ensuing controversy and attendant critical mauling almost derailed the 24-year-old Kiefer\u2019s fledgling artistic career.

It also is nothing new, but, yes, I do feel that democracy is more threatened than before and this, of course, is deeply worrying.\u201d</p> <p>Though not a political artist per se, Kiefer has been known to make a stand for what he believes in.

I still know a few collectors who are not like this, but most of them are. I remember in the 70s and 80s, you would have discussions with your collectors.

      "bodyText": "I arrive at White Cube in south London just as Anselm Kiefer is writing the title of his exhibition on a gallery wall. Perched on a mini-forklift, the 74-year-old German slowly and meticulously inscribes the words \u201cSuperstrings, Runes, the Norns, Gordian Knot\u201d. It is a typically dense and allusive title for a show that merges Kiefer\u2019s now familiar preoccupations \u2013 ancient myths, astronomy, alchemy, history and arcane systems of knowledge \u2013 with a more recent obsession, string theory. \u201cThese advanced mathematicians are attempting to find a theory of everything,\u201d he says, when we sit down for a chat in a back room of the gallery, \u201cbut each time they open a door, many other doors reveal themselves. It is all abstract mathematics, of course, so nothing is really yet proved. The more I read about it, the more I think they will never find the answer.\u201d He is not good at maths, he tells me, laughing, but nevertheless when a serious mathematician visited his studio recently, he looked at the paintings inspired by string theory and exclaimed: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d As the exhibition shows, for Kiefer string theory is a relatively new big idea around which all the old big ideas can coalesce. Described in the show\u2019s press release as an attempt \u201cto articulate the known fundamental interactions of the universe and forms of matter\u201d, it is the perfect subject for an artist whose interest in the arcane matches his curiosity for the scientific. He is a rationalist who is fascinated with the mysterious, an agnostic whose work is full of references to ancient belief systems, from the Kabbalah to Gnosticism. When I mention this, he says gaily: \u201cThese are such fantastic systems of thought because there is so much hard work put into proving that there is a big meaning to everything. But, of course, the reason that there is so much hard work is because there is no meaning.\u201d In person, as with his art, Kiefer is a complex, obsessive individual, given to making connections that may seem tenuous to the rest of us but provide extraordinarily fertile raw material for his work. The show\u2019s ungainly title barely hints at the range of allusions in the works: to runic alphabets, mathematical equations, mythical prophecies, Alexander the Great and the Norns \u2013 three female spinners of fate from Norse mythology. His recent fascination with string theory has also led him back to the alchemical writings of Robert Fludd, a mystical 17th-century thinker who has long obsessed him: \u201cHe, too, wanted to find this theory of the world.\u201d At White Cube, all of these topics are somehow connected, though the result often resembles a kind of organised chaos theory, no more so than in the gallery\u2019s long central corridor, which is lined with 30 tall glass vitrines full of coils and swirls of plastic tubing and electrical cables. In one, a large axe is visible though the tangle of wires, a reference to the mythical Gordian Knot of the exhibition\u2019s title, which was chopped asunder by Alexander the Great. On the glass panels, Kiefer has scrawled elaborate formulas and equations, latterday runes by, among others, Albert Einstein and Edward Witten, an American theoretical physicist who lends his name to one of the new paintings (Edward Witten: Quantized Gravity). \u201cI cannot produce these formulas exactly, because they are too complicated,\u201d says Kiefer. \u201cSo it is string theory as far as I can understand it. But there is also a deeper fascination that connects me to it.\u201d Is it purely intellectual curiosity? \u201cYes, but also a kind of veneration. Critics say that I am an artist who always wants to overwhelm people. But, no, it is I who am overwhelmed. And, if I am not, something is wrong.\u201d In the spacious galleries on either side of the corridor, though, his epic paintings are indeed overwhelming in their scale and their looming sense of apocalyptic ruin. In this, they are more reassuringly Kieferesque. From a distance, the landscapes look parched and arid, as if a biblical catastrophe has scorched the earth, removing all traces of life. Up close, burnt branches and twigs protrude, charred books dangle from thin wires and broken stalks of straw cling to the canvases. In a series titled Der Gordische Knoten (2019), more large axes appear, suspended as if in mid-flight amid the tangle of wood and wheat in which several burnt sticks have been arranged to resemble ancient runic letters. The paintings are steeped in myth and mystery, the science buried beneath layers of allusion. \u201cIn a way, science is like mystery,\u201d says Kiefer, \u201cinsofar as it does not make me sure of anything. I remember when I did my baccalaureate at high school my statement was, \u2018Wisdom should make us sure; art should make us unsure.\u2019 Smart, no?\u201d So, as an artist, he is working in a state of perpetual uncertainty? \u201cYes, except for when I make a truly great painting, then I feel real.\u201d Kiefer belongs to a generation of postwar German artists for whom recent history, to paraphrase James Joyce, was a nightmare they were trying to escape. An art critic once declared that his work continually posed the question, \u201cHow to be a German artist after Hitler, the be-all and end-all of German artists?\u201d In oil and ash, wood and steel, lead and concrete, as well as fabric, seeds, plant matter and paper, Kiefer has, one way or another, been grappling with that question ever since. His critics, including a later generation of more mischievously provocative artists that included Albert Oehlen and the late Martin Kippenberger, lambasted him for what they saw as a quintessentially German portentousness. In person, though, Kiefer is as mischievous as any artist I have met, his often wildly associative train of thought suggesting a mad professor more than a philosophical quester. Intriguingly, his formative artistic mentor was Joseph Beuys, whom he met in 1971. Back then, Kiefer was still struggling to escape the notoriety he had gained following a series of wilfully provocative photographs he had exhibited in 1969. Entitled Occupation, they showed him dressed as a member of the National Socialist Party and performing mock Nazi salutes at various monuments and tourist sites across Europe. It was, he told me in 2008, an attempt \u201cto confront it and explode\u201d the silence that had settled on the German past. That past was still too raw in the collective memory, though, and the ensuing controversy and attendant critical mauling almost derailed the 24-year-old Kiefer\u2019s fledgling artistic career. Only Beuys approved of his provocations. Kiefer later described him as \u201cthe first one to understand me\u201d. Fifty years on, with often violent far-right populism on the rise across Europe, the sense of historical and existential anxiety that has for so long been a palpable presence in Kiefer\u2019s landscapes seems more a portent than a reminder. \u201cThese are really difficult times.\u201d he says, quietly. \u201cIn Germany, in Hungary, in Poland, it takes a different form, but really it is not new. It has just been covered for a time.

      "body": "<p>A goal down, with less than 20 minutes left to play, in a fixture they had not won for three seasons, Juventus needed a saviour. They had been dominated by Atalanta in Bergamo, overwhelmed by the hosts\u2019 high press and carved open repeatedly by Robin Gosens and Papu Gomez. Only a missed penalty and some last-ditch blocks from Wojciech Szczesny and Matthijs de Ligt had kept them within touching distance.</p> \n<p>In moments like this, it helps to be able to call on your club\u2019s record signing. Lucky for Juventus, then, that they have more than one.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/eni-aluko-leave-juventus-early\">Eni Aluko will leave Juventus early and return to Britain at end of month</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The \u20ac100m man, Cristiano Ronaldo, was absent, but his \u20ac90m precursor was present and correct. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn pulled his team level: seizing on a loose ball inside the box and pivoting to fire a deflected shot beyond Pierluigi Gollini. Eight minutes later, he put his team in front with a first-time finish.</p> \n<p>Finally, Higua\u00edn turned provider, releasing Paulo Dybala with an angled pass from the halfway line to the edge of Atalanta\u2019s area. His compatriot cut inside and slotted the ball home at the near post.</p> \n<p>This was not the combination that Juventus expected to build their success upon in this campaign. Higua\u00edn and Dybala were marketed to other teams in the summer, as the Bianconeri worked to balance the books following the arrivals of De Ligt, Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot. At least one of the Argentinians was supposed to depart, if not both.</p> \n<p>Instead, they have carried their side. It was Dybala who hit Juventus\u2019s winner against Milan before the international break, after entering the game as a second-half replacement for Ronaldo. Prior to that, he scored his team\u2019s only goals in a come-from-behind win at home to Lokomotiv Moscow, as well as the draw at Lecce.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>With Higua\u00edn, I just need a glance to know what he\u2019s thinking \u2026 we make a great pair</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Paulo Dybala</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>He and Higua\u00edn both found the net away to Inter, in what remains Juventus\u2019s most important victory of the season to date. The latter scored in the win over Napoli, too, and has shown impressive selflessness throughout. Saturday\u2019s game was his fourth in a row with an assist.</p> \n<p>Were it not for the presence of Ramsey, and a newly-roofed Curva Nord at Atalanta\u2019s home ground, you could almost have believed we were back in 2016. That was when Higua\u00edn arrived to partner Dybala, soon to be nicknamed by the papers as \u201can attack in HD\u201d. They scored a combined 51 goals in that first season together, winning a domestic double and reaching the Champions League final.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith Higua\u00edn, I just need a glance to know what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Dybala of their on-pitch understanding after Saturday\u2019s win. \u201cWe make a great pair.\u201d</p> \n<p>But can they make a great trio, when Ronaldo is present as well? The Portuguese is expected to return to the starting line-up against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Maurizio Sarri declined to answer questions about whether he might consider a front three.</p> \n<p>Both the manager and Ronaldo have played down any talk of a rift, following the player\u2019s angry response to being substituted against Milan. Ronaldo appeared to swear at Sarri as he headed to the tunnel, and then left the Allianz Stadium early, but subsequently told Portugal\u2019s A Bola that he understood the decision to take him off.</p> \n<p>Whether he has now had enough time to recover remains to be seen. Ronaldo remains very capable of scoring goals even when he is not at his physical best, and has since bagged four of them in two Euro 2020 qualifiers for Portugal. Yet both of his last two games for Juventus were decided by the player who replaced him \u2013 Dybala against Milan and before that Douglas Costa away to Lokomotiv Moscow.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2087220ed458e39e3847d7d4052c799a78f4a992\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2087220ed458e39e3847d7d4052c799a78f4a992/0_56_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paulo Dybala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paulo Dybala celebrates after scoring Juve\u2019s third goal against Atalanta.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Magni/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All of which leaves Sarri in a delicate position. He has made it clear that he views Ronaldo as a special case, saying: \u201cCristiano is the best player on this team, so we need to organise the other 10 well for the defensive phase of the game and let him go wherever he needs on the pitch.\u201d</p> \n<p>That outlook meshes with the needs of his club. Juventus need to prioritise and ensure the happiness of their most valuable commercial asset.</p> \n<p>At the same time, though, Sarri also has an obligation to win. So far, he is beyond reproach: taking 35 points from a possible 39 in Serie A and 10 from 12 in the Champions League. A victory over Atl\u00e9tico would guarantee Juventus first place, as would a draw in which neither team scores more than one goal.</p> \n<p>Still, there is a sense that Sarri\u2019s side are not yet delivering the fluid football that was hoped for. Gazzetta Sportiva offered a succinct analysis in its match report, suggesting that \u201cAtalanta played like a great team, Juventus won with great players.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps that is enough. Ronaldo is one of the greatest of all-time, and even in this injury-disrupted season has still scored a goal in every other game. Knowing Higua\u00edn and Dybala can produce when he is absent is a huge asset to a side that failed to win four out of eight games that it played without him last season.</p> \n<p>Any background concerns that Juventus may have \u2013 about the manager, Ronaldo\u2019s fitness, or the quality of performances \u2013 will only become tangible if they start to lose. To date, they remain very good at winning.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Gian Piero Gasperini was right when he said that it was \u201cNot one point lost, but three\u201d for Atalanta. They were unfortunate \u2013 a Cuadrado handball went unpunished not long before Juventus\u2019s second \u2013 but have missed Duv\u00e1n Zapata terribly up front, taking six points from six games since their top scorer got injured; before that it was 16 from seven.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Chris Smalling headed in Roma\u2019s opener against Brescia on Sunday, making him the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptaPaolo/status/1198621545033338885\">most prolific Englishman in Serie </a>A since David Beckham. He set one up for his centre-back partner Gianluca Mancini, too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1198622248531312640\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udc4f Smalling turns provider this time, and Mancini produces a brilliant looping finish for his first Roma goal to double their lead!<br><br>\u26bd The Giollarossi are in complete command now! <a href=\"https://t.co/uH62F4Xdrd\">pic.twitter.com/uH62F4Xdrd</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1198622248531312640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 This was the week when Antonio Conte shared his views on sex during the season. \u201cIn a period of competition, sex should not last long,\u201d he told L\u2019Equipe. \u201cYou need to put in the least exertion possible, so it\u2019s better to stay under your partner.\u201d It was not clear whether Lautaro Martinez was agreeing or disagreeing when he told Dazn: \u201cAt home, we relax.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 An impressive victory for Inter on a sodden pitch away to Torino. This is only the second time in the club\u2019s history that they have won 11 of their first 13 games in a top-flight campaign, though the occasion was marred by a serious knee injury to Nicol\u00f2 Barella, who is not expected to play again until after the winter break.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The mood at Napoli remains grim ahead of their Champions League visit to Liverpool, with owner Aurelio De Laurentiis issuing large fines and reportedly considering legal action against the players who mutinied against his punitive training camp this month. Carlo Ancelotti will have been encouraged to see Hirving Lozano get his second goal for the club away to Milan, but neither team impressed in a 1-1 draw.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\">

      "bodyText": "A goal down, with less than 20 minutes left to play, in a fixture they had not won for three seasons, Juventus needed a saviour. They had been dominated by Atalanta in Bergamo, overwhelmed by the hosts\u2019 high press and carved open repeatedly by Robin Gosens and Papu Gomez. Only a missed penalty and some last-ditch blocks from Wojciech Szczesny and Matthijs de Ligt had kept them within touching distance. In moments like this, it helps to be able to call on your club\u2019s record signing. Lucky for Juventus, then, that they have more than one. The \u20ac100m man, Cristiano Ronaldo, was absent, but his \u20ac90m precursor was present and correct. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn pulled his team level: seizing on a loose ball inside the box and pivoting to fire a deflected shot beyond Pierluigi Gollini. Eight minutes later, he put his team in front with a first-time finish. Finally, Higua\u00edn turned provider, releasing Paulo Dybala with an angled pass from the halfway line to the edge of Atalanta\u2019s area. His compatriot cut inside and slotted the ball home at the near post. This was not the combination that Juventus expected to build their success upon in this campaign. Higua\u00edn and Dybala were marketed to other teams in the summer, as the Bianconeri worked to balance the books following the arrivals of De Ligt, Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot. At least one of the Argentinians was supposed to depart, if not both. Instead, they have carried their side. It was Dybala who hit Juventus\u2019s winner against Milan before the international break, after entering the game as a second-half replacement for Ronaldo. Prior to that, he scored his team\u2019s only goals in a come-from-behind win at home to Lokomotiv Moscow, as well as the draw at Lecce. He and Higua\u00edn both found the net away to Inter, in what remains Juventus\u2019s most important victory of the season to date. The latter scored in the win over Napoli, too, and has shown impressive selflessness throughout. Saturday\u2019s game was his fourth in a row with an assist. Were it not for the presence of Ramsey, and a newly-roofed Curva Nord at Atalanta\u2019s home ground, you could almost have believed we were back in 2016. That was when Higua\u00edn arrived to partner Dybala, soon to be nicknamed by the papers as \u201can attack in HD\u201d. They scored a combined 51 goals in that first season together, winning a domestic double and reaching the Champions League final. \u201cWith Higua\u00edn, I just need a glance to know what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Dybala of their on-pitch understanding after Saturday\u2019s win. \u201cWe make a great pair.\u201d But can they make a great trio, when Ronaldo is present as well? The Portuguese is expected to return to the starting line-up against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Maurizio Sarri declined to answer questions about whether he might consider a front three. Both the manager and Ronaldo have played down any talk of a rift, following the player\u2019s angry response to being substituted against Milan. Ronaldo appeared to swear at Sarri as he headed to the tunnel, and then left the Allianz Stadium early, but subsequently told Portugal\u2019s A Bola that he understood the decision to take him off. Whether he has now had enough time to recover remains to be seen. Ronaldo remains very capable of scoring goals even when he is not at his physical best, and has since bagged four of them in two Euro 2020 qualifiers for Portugal. Yet both of his last two games for Juventus were decided by the player who replaced him \u2013 Dybala against Milan and before that Douglas Costa away to Lokomotiv Moscow. All of which leaves Sarri in a delicate position. He has made it clear that he views Ronaldo as a special case, saying: \u201cCristiano is the best player on this team, so we need to organise the other 10 well for the defensive phase of the game and let him go wherever he needs on the pitch.\u201d That outlook meshes with the needs of his club. Juventus need to prioritise and ensure the happiness of their most valuable commercial asset. At the same time, though, Sarri also has an obligation to win. So far, he is beyond reproach: taking 35 points from a possible 39 in Serie A and 10 from 12 in the Champions League. A victory over Atl\u00e9tico would guarantee Juventus first place, as would a draw in which neither team scores more than one goal. Still, there is a sense that Sarri\u2019s side are not yet delivering the fluid football that was hoped for. Gazzetta Sportiva offered a succinct analysis in its match report, suggesting that \u201cAtalanta played like a great team, Juventus won with great players.\u201d Perhaps that is enough. Ronaldo is one of the greatest of all-time, and even in this injury-disrupted season has still scored a goal in every other game. Knowing Higua\u00edn and Dybala can produce when he is absent is a huge asset to a side that failed to win four out of eight games that it played without him last season. Any background concerns that Juventus may have \u2013 about the manager, Ronaldo\u2019s fitness, or the quality of performances \u2013 will only become tangible if they start to lose. To date, they remain very good at winning. Talking points \u2022 Gian Piero Gasperini was right when he said that it was \u201cNot one point lost, but three\u201d for Atalanta. They were unfortunate \u2013 a Cuadrado handball went unpunished not long before Juventus\u2019s second \u2013 but have missed Duv\u00e1n Zapata terribly up front, taking six points from six games since their top scorer got injured; before that it was 16 from seven. \u2022 Chris Smalling headed in Roma\u2019s opener against Brescia on Sunday, making him the most prolific Englishman in Serie A since David Beckham. He set one up for his centre-back partner Gianluca Mancini, too. \u2022 This was the week when Antonio Conte shared his views on sex during the season. \u201cIn a period of competition, sex should not last long,\u201d he told L\u2019Equipe. \u201cYou need to put in the least exertion possible, so it\u2019s better to stay under your partner.\u201d It was not clear whether Lautaro Martinez was agreeing or disagreeing when he told Dazn: \u201cAt home, we relax.\u201d \u2022 An impressive victory for Inter on a sodden pitch away to Torino. This is only the second time in the club\u2019s history that they have won 11 of their first 13 games in a top-flight campaign, though the occasion was marred by a serious knee injury to Nicol\u00f2 Barella, who is not expected to play again until after the winter break. \u2022 The mood at Napoli remains grim ahead of their Champions League visit to Liverpool, with owner Aurelio De Laurentiis issuing large fines and reportedly considering legal action against the players who mutinied against his punitive training camp this month. Carlo Ancelotti will have been encouraged to see Hirving Lozano get his second goal for the club away to Milan, but neither team impressed in a 1-1 draw.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes on the high street of a pick-up in business during the pivotal Christmas period have been boosted by the latest retail health check from the CBI. In its monthly distributive trades survey, the employers\u2019 organisation said the broadly unchanged level of activity in November had broken a six-month-long streak of falling sales. The peak Christmas shopping season starts with this week\u2019s Black Friday offers, and the CBI said the stabilisation reported in its survey of 52 retailers provided some reasons for cautious optimism. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s deputy chief economist, said: \u201cRetailers are entering the festive season with a bit of hope that sales will head up, with the strongest expectations in half a year. Actual sales have also stabilised and have nudged above average for the time of year. And employment has stopped falling after three years of decline. But Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on investment plans for the year ahead, which remain weak. \u201cAs the election period gets into full swing, retailers will welcome the prominence being given to fixing the broken business rates system.

Within a few hours after the industrial action was announced, a petition was launched calling for lost contact hours to be reimbursed.</p> <p>Many are worried that the eight-day period may impact their end of term grades. They reason that they\u2019re paying tuition fees, so they should expect a full term of teaching.</p> <p>Of course, losing valuable time is frustrating for the one million students who could be affected. But the frustration is mutual among staff and students. Both feel that universities are being turned into businesses that are impersonal and poorly run. We should not direct our anger towards lecturers, but rather to the institutions forcing them to strike. </p> <p>It\u2019s not as if our tuition fees all go to our tutors. Academics\u2019 pay has <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10342/Value-of-university-staff-pay-has-plummeted-in-last-decade-employers-own-research-reveals\">fallen by 17%</a> in real terms since 2009. More than half are estimated to be on temporary contracts, and this precariousness only adds to the daily stress of teaching. A recent report found an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/23/higher-education-staff-suffer-epidemic-of-poor-mental-health\">\u201cepidemic\u201d of poor mental health</a> among higher education staff. Meanwhile, the UCU reports a 15% gender pay gap, and pensions have also shrunk after changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).</p> <p>With our tutors working in these conditions, how can students expect to get the best out of them? As NUS vice president Claire Sosienski-Smith put it: \u201cStudents won\u2019t be happy about having to miss lectures, but they\u2019re not happy about studying in institutions where their staff are underpaid and overworked.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/24/universities-accused-of-using-strong-arm-tactics-to-stop-strike-action\">Universities accused of using 'strong-arm tactics' to undermine strike action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t really true that this strike will damage our university careers. Some lecturers are ensuring their students won\u2019t be completely abandoned, and many are leaving pre-prepared work and practical tips on how to make the most of this \u201clost\u201d time. Lecturers care deeply about the academic success of their students. Why else would they do such a thankless job?</p> <p>This strike will have a greater impact if universities see that the lecturers have the full support of their students and understand that changes must be made. We have a part to play in these strikes, to keep the pressure up to ensure fairer working conditions. I know I\u2019m going to be asking my vice-chancellor what they\u2019re doing to fix the problem.</p> <p>\u2022 Joshua Curiel is a 19-year-old student at the University of Kent</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week, staff in 60 universities across the UK will take part in a strike led by the University and College Union (UCU). Their choice to strike has the full support of the National Union of Students (NUS) \u2013 but not all students have come out in favour of the action. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve heard many fellow students criticise the decision of lecturers to go on strike. Within a few hours after the industrial action was announced, a petition was launched calling for lost contact hours to be reimbursed. Many are worried that the eight-day period may impact their end of term grades. They reason that they\u2019re paying tuition fees, so they should expect a full term of teaching. Of course, losing valuable time is frustrating for the one million students who could be affected. But the frustration is mutual among staff and students. Both feel that universities are being turned into businesses that are impersonal and poorly run. We should not direct our anger towards lecturers, but rather to the institutions forcing them to strike. It\u2019s not as if our tuition fees all go to our tutors. Academics\u2019 pay has fallen by 17% in real terms since 2009. More than half are estimated to be on temporary contracts, and this precariousness only adds to the daily stress of teaching. A recent report found an \u201cepidemic\u201d of poor mental health among higher education staff. Meanwhile, the UCU reports a 15% gender pay gap, and pensions have also shrunk after changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). With our tutors working in these conditions, how can students expect to get the best out of them? As NUS vice president Claire Sosienski-Smith put it: \u201cStudents won\u2019t be happy about having to miss lectures, but they\u2019re not happy about studying in institutions where their staff are underpaid and overworked.\u201d It isn\u2019t really true that this strike will damage our university careers. Some lecturers are ensuring their students won\u2019t be completely abandoned, and many are leaving pre-prepared work and practical tips on how to make the most of this \u201clost\u201d time. Lecturers care deeply about the academic success of their students. Why else would they do such a thankless job? This strike will have a greater impact if universities see that the lecturers have the full support of their students and understand that changes must be made. We have a part to play in these strikes, to keep the pressure up to ensure fairer working conditions. I know I\u2019m going to be asking my vice-chancellor what they\u2019re doing to fix the problem. \u2022 Joshua Curiel is a 19-year-old student at the University of Kent",

      "body": "<p>On the surface, Borussia Dortmund\u2019s annual general meeting on Sunday was a globally positive affair. Reinhard Rauball was, as expected, re-elected as president for three years. A healthy financial picture was unveiled, with an annual turnover of \u20ac490m and a tidy operating profit of just under \u20ac18m.</p> \n<p>Anyone who knows the first thing about German football also knows that happiness can never be wholly quantified on a balance sheet, and the mood was largely defined by the horror show at home against doomed-to-relegation bottom side Paderborn, who were in the third tier 18 months ago (annual budget of \u20ac11m) and were 3-0 up at Westfalen at half-time. So, among the applause when CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke took the stage, there were clearly audible whistles and even a few angered shouts, perhaps from fans who hadn\u2019t stopped whistling from their Friday night dissatisfaction. Those catcalls had continued at full-time despite Dortmund salvaging a draw from the game with Marco Reus\u2019s stoppage-time equaliser.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/barcelona-leganes-real-madrid-juventus-bayern-munich\">European roundup: Barcelona edge to win, Bayern make up ground</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was all in stark contrast to last year\u2019s get together, where the directors\u2019 summaries and stocktakes bounced along joyously on the cushion of a nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. BVB, the shareholders and their fans don\u2019t expect that every year. What they do expect is a lot more from an expensively assembled, richly talented squad who have underperformed this season. The club may present itself as the sunnily dispositioned behemoth it\u2019s OK to love, but there\u2019s no escaping at times like this that it\u2019s very much a business.</p> \n<p>Coach Lucien Favre, whose position seemed to be hanging by a thread at half-time, was backed very conditionally. \u201cLucien, you still have our confidence,\u201d said Watzke, addressing him directly and reminding him that results would ultimately decide \u2013 beginning with this week\u2019s trips to Barcelona and Berlin, Favre\u2019s most must-win week since the last one, a month ago.</p> \n<p>As Ruhr Nachrichten\u2019s Dirk Krampe pointed out, it recalled the AGM of two years ago, which happened the day after Dortmund let a four-goal lead slip in the Revierderby with Schalke. Then-incumbent Peter Bosz survived that. It was a pivotal moment, however. Fifteen days later, with the die cast, Bosz was fired.</p> \n<p>The players too were put on notice. Watzke thanked Reus for his blunt confessional at the end of the Paderborn game \u2013 the captain had said \u201cthis can\u2019t happen\u201d \u2013 but also warned the squad that \u201cdeeds must follow words\u201d with the season still up for grabs. \u201cYou\u2019re in the front line,\u201d Watzke told them. \u201cTry to act as Borussen [Dortmund fans] expect,\u201d Watzke warned.</p> \n<p>Yet while the players and Watzke \u2013 who admitted the board\u2019s mistake in not buying a second centre-forward to back up Paco Alc\u00e1cer \u2013 are under the microscope, the buck will stop with Favre. Dortmund looked like a team lost for much of this game, devoid of discipline or dynamism. They were mind-bendingly bad. The Swiss coach is not known for cracking the whip, but it feels as if something drastic has to happen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1197991697109700609\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What a crazy night in Dortmund \ud83d\ude2e<br><br>Bottom of the league Paderborn found themselves 3-0 up at half-time...<br><br>But Jadon Sancho sparked a revival before providing the assist for Marco Reus to equalise in stoppage time!<br><br>Brilliant Bundesliga drama \ud83d\udc4c <a href=\"https://t.co/0zQi1nDXCq\">pic.twitter.com/0zQi1nDXCq</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1197991697109700609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 22, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The inner circle of Jadon Sancho, who scored and set up Reus\u2019s leveller, briefing that he felt scapegoated of late does not play well for the coach either. Whether it changes the medium-term future of Sancho is fairly unlikely. It is widely expected that he\u2019ll be sold next summer, and the logistical difficulties of assembling such a big deal in January makes that strictly the emergency option. It does, however, add to a sense of disquiet.</p> \n<p>Finally spare a thought for Paderborn, stopped within touching distance of the mother of all exploits and then seeing their story kicked to the kerb as Dortmund\u2019s apparent crisis took centre-stage. Streli Mamba, who ran the home side ragged in the first half and scored twice, was still taking it all in after the game. \u201cWhen I scored the second goal,\u201d he said, \u201cI asked [my teammates] if anyone could pinch me.\u201d Despite this brief moment in the sun, we know where Paderborn are ending up at the end of this season. As for Dortmund, we still have absolutely no idea.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Bayern went to Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf for what Thomas M\u00fcller described as \u201ca character test\u201d following the international break, and it was one they passed with flying colours. They \u201cset the tone\u201d in the first half, as M\u00fcller said, scoring three times through Benjamin Pavard, Corentin Tolisso and the excellent Serge Gnabry and though Robert Lewandowski\u2019s run of scoring in every Bundesliga game came to an end \u2013 Philippe Coutinho got the fourth in the second half \u2013 they are flushed with optimism after another very complete performance, and are still yet to concede in three games under Hansi Flick. There is no immediate rush for Mauricio Pochettino, or anyone else, to ride to the rescue.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Leaders Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach remain so but with their lead cut after a loss at surging Union, looking as if the international break had curtailed their momentum. \u201cWe didn\u2019t show what we can do today,\u201d lamented Patrick Hermann, though the team were still warmly received by their travelling fans \u2013 well aware of realistic expectations \u2013 at the end.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Across the capital things look bleak for Hertha\u2019s Ante Covic, after his team were hammered 4-0 at Augsburg \u2013 whose Twitter feed mischievously put up a mock-up of Hertha\u2019s crest with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FCA_World/status/1198629021027835904\">flag changed from blue to clear white</a>. Covic, a loyal servant to the club over two decades, said his own future was the \u201cleast important\u201d element of the aftermath, but after four straight losses it wouldn\u2019t be a shock if a change occurred before Dortmund\u2019s visit.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Leipzig are second, just a point behind Gladbach, after beating K\u00f6ln for a third straight victory. Emil Forsberg scored twice, with a penalty and a long-range free-kick, against a visiting side who seem hell-bent on continuing to shoot themselves in the foot under the new management team of coach Markus Gisdol and sporting director Horst Heldt. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s concerns are solely fitness-based, with Kevin Kampl needing an operation for a heel problem, and his defence decimated.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1198534526978461697\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Julian Nagelsmann giving it the CR7 for this free-kick by Emil Forsberg \ud83d\ude02 <a href=\"https://t.co/DOXf5i5ay8\">pic.twitter.com/DOXf5i5ay8</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1198534526978461697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 What a few weeks it\u2019s been for Achim Beierlorzer. Dismissed by K\u00f6ln the day after a heartbreakingly late home defeat by Hoffenheim which signalled the start of the international break, he was surprisingly picked up by Mainz (whose sporting director Rouwen Schr\u00f6der he worked with at Greuther F\u00fcrth), and made his debut in the Sunday late game at \u2026 Hoffenheim, whose win at the RheinEnergie Stadion two weeks back had been their sixth in a row in all competitions. So, naturally, Mainz won 5-1, despite playing more than half the game a man down after Ridle Baku\u2019s red card, with Pierre Kunde\u2019s brace the highlight of a masterful counter-attacking display.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Elsewhere Freiburg and Schalke complete the top five, with the latter winning at Werder Bremen as they continue to improve under David Wagner. Christian Streich\u2019s surprise packages stay fourth after grinding out a draw at Leverkusen. \u201cI really like to look at the table, and to see us annoying everyone,\u201d smirked their striker Nils Pedersen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7e204cd4-fdbe-4318-952e-b9f3825bd5e2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n

      "bodyText": "On the surface, Borussia Dortmund\u2019s annual general meeting on Sunday was a globally positive affair. Reinhard Rauball was, as expected, re-elected as president for three years. A healthy financial picture was unveiled, with an annual turnover of \u20ac490m and a tidy operating profit of just under \u20ac18m. Anyone who knows the first thing about German football also knows that happiness can never be wholly quantified on a balance sheet, and the mood was largely defined by the horror show at home against doomed-to-relegation bottom side Paderborn, who were in the third tier 18 months ago (annual budget of \u20ac11m) and were 3-0 up at Westfalen at half-time. So, among the applause when CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke took the stage, there were clearly audible whistles and even a few angered shouts, perhaps from fans who hadn\u2019t stopped whistling from their Friday night dissatisfaction. Those catcalls had continued at full-time despite Dortmund salvaging a draw from the game with Marco Reus\u2019s stoppage-time equaliser. It was all in stark contrast to last year\u2019s get together, where the directors\u2019 summaries and stocktakes bounced along joyously on the cushion of a nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. BVB, the shareholders and their fans don\u2019t expect that every year. What they do expect is a lot more from an expensively assembled, richly talented squad who have underperformed this season. The club may present itself as the sunnily dispositioned behemoth it\u2019s OK to love, but there\u2019s no escaping at times like this that it\u2019s very much a business. Coach Lucien Favre, whose position seemed to be hanging by a thread at half-time, was backed very conditionally. \u201cLucien, you still have our confidence,\u201d said Watzke, addressing him directly and reminding him that results would ultimately decide \u2013 beginning with this week\u2019s trips to Barcelona and Berlin, Favre\u2019s most must-win week since the last one, a month ago. As Ruhr Nachrichten\u2019s Dirk Krampe pointed out, it recalled the AGM of two years ago, which happened the day after Dortmund let a four-goal lead slip in the Revierderby with Schalke. Then-incumbent Peter Bosz survived that. It was a pivotal moment, however. Fifteen days later, with the die cast, Bosz was fired. The players too were put on notice. Watzke thanked Reus for his blunt confessional at the end of the Paderborn game \u2013 the captain had said \u201cthis can\u2019t happen\u201d \u2013 but also warned the squad that \u201cdeeds must follow words\u201d with the season still up for grabs. \u201cYou\u2019re in the front line,\u201d Watzke told them. \u201cTry to act as Borussen [Dortmund fans] expect,\u201d Watzke warned. Yet while the players and Watzke \u2013 who admitted the board\u2019s mistake in not buying a second centre-forward to back up Paco Alc\u00e1cer \u2013 are under the microscope, the buck will stop with Favre. Dortmund looked like a team lost for much of this game, devoid of discipline or dynamism. They were mind-bendingly bad. The Swiss coach is not known for cracking the whip, but it feels as if something drastic has to happen. The inner circle of Jadon Sancho, who scored and set up Reus\u2019s leveller, briefing that he felt scapegoated of late does not play well for the coach either. Whether it changes the medium-term future of Sancho is fairly unlikely. It is widely expected that he\u2019ll be sold next summer, and the logistical difficulties of assembling such a big deal in January makes that strictly the emergency option. It does, however, add to a sense of disquiet. Finally spare a thought for Paderborn, stopped within touching distance of the mother of all exploits and then seeing their story kicked to the kerb as Dortmund\u2019s apparent crisis took centre-stage. Streli Mamba, who ran the home side ragged in the first half and scored twice, was still taking it all in after the game. \u201cWhen I scored the second goal,\u201d he said, \u201cI asked [my teammates] if anyone could pinch me.\u201d Despite this brief moment in the sun, we know where Paderborn are ending up at the end of this season. As for Dortmund, we still have absolutely no idea. Talking points \u2022 Bayern went to Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf for what Thomas M\u00fcller described as \u201ca character test\u201d following the international break, and it was one they passed with flying colours. They \u201cset the tone\u201d in the first half, as M\u00fcller said, scoring three times through Benjamin Pavard, Corentin Tolisso and the excellent Serge Gnabry and though Robert Lewandowski\u2019s run of scoring in every Bundesliga game came to an end \u2013 Philippe Coutinho got the fourth in the second half \u2013 they are flushed with optimism after another very complete performance, and are still yet to concede in three games under Hansi Flick. There is no immediate rush for Mauricio Pochettino, or anyone else, to ride to the rescue. \u2022 Leaders Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach remain so but with their lead cut after a loss at surging Union, looking as if the international break had curtailed their momentum. \u201cWe didn\u2019t show what we can do today,\u201d lamented Patrick Hermann, though the team were still warmly received by their travelling fans \u2013 well aware of realistic expectations \u2013 at the end. \u2022 Across the capital things look bleak for Hertha\u2019s Ante Covic, after his team were hammered 4-0 at Augsburg \u2013 whose Twitter feed mischievously put up a mock-up of Hertha\u2019s crest with the flag changed from blue to clear white. Covic, a loyal servant to the club over two decades, said his own future was the \u201cleast important\u201d element of the aftermath, but after four straight losses it wouldn\u2019t be a shock if a change occurred before Dortmund\u2019s visit. \u2022 Leipzig are second, just a point behind Gladbach, after beating K\u00f6ln for a third straight victory. Emil Forsberg scored twice, with a penalty and a long-range free-kick, against a visiting side who seem hell-bent on continuing to shoot themselves in the foot under the new management team of coach Markus Gisdol and sporting director Horst Heldt. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s concerns are solely fitness-based, with Kevin Kampl needing an operation for a heel problem, and his defence decimated. \u2022 What a few weeks it\u2019s been for Achim Beierlorzer. Dismissed by K\u00f6ln the day after a heartbreakingly late home defeat by Hoffenheim which signalled the start of the international break, he was surprisingly picked up by Mainz (whose sporting director Rouwen Schr\u00f6der he worked with at Greuther F\u00fcrth), and made his debut in the Sunday late game at \u2026 Hoffenheim, whose win at the RheinEnergie Stadion two weeks back had been their sixth in a row in all competitions. So, naturally, Mainz won 5-1, despite playing more than half the game a man down after Ridle Baku\u2019s red card, with Pierre Kunde\u2019s brace the highlight of a masterful counter-attacking display. \u2022 Elsewhere Freiburg and Schalke complete the top five, with the latter winning at Werder Bremen as they continue to improve under David Wagner. Christian Streich\u2019s surprise packages stay fourth after grinding out a draw at Leverkusen. \u201cI really like to look at the table, and to see us annoying everyone,\u201d smirked their striker Nils Pedersen.",

He instead urged Tories to vote for the Liberal Democrats, apart from in areas where they could vote for former Tory independent rebels such as Dominic Grieve, Anne Milton and David Gauke.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2019. Due to an editing error an earlier version was incorrect to describe Michael Heseltine as having said he would be voting for the Liberal Democrats.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has said neither Labour nor the Conservatives are seen as fit to win the general election, accusing both parties of peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d. The former prime minister, one of the architects of New Labour who was speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event in London, said Britain\u2019s biggest parties were engaged in \u201cpopulism running riot\u201d and it would end in tears. Blair has repeatedly called for Brexit to be reversed and said the right thing would have been to hold a second referendum followed by a general election. He described the poll on 12 December as \u201cthe weirdest of my lifetime\u201d, adding: \u201cThe truth is: the public aren\u2019t convinced either main party deserve to win this election outright. They\u2019re peddling two sets of fantasies and both, as majority governments, pose a risk it would be unwise for the country to take.\u201d Blair, who guided Labour to three election victories, said people \u201crightly\u201d did not trust Boris Johnson with a \u201cblank cheque\u201d. He said though Labour were promising a revolution, \u201cthe problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end\u201d. Blair, who as prime minister sought to occupy the centre ground and has long been at loggerheads with Jeremy Corbyn, said there were \u201csolid, mainstream, independent-minded MPs and candidates in both parties\u201d who merited support. He added that the Liberal Democrats also had an important role to play in forcing a second referendum, suggesting the poll should be viewed as \u201c650 mini-elections\u201d. Johnson has pledged to deliver Brexit by 31 January but, on that issue at least, Blair concurred with Corbyn that it was not possible, warning that there was no chance of Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe being settled by the end of the transition period. He said even a hard Brexit with a third-country free-trade agreement analogous to one that the EU has with Canada would be \u201chorrible\u201d to negotiate and could take years to conclude. He identified no deal as being the likeliest outcome because of the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto commitment not to extend the transition period beyond next year. Blair described the country as being in a state of paralysis and said that despite what was going on elsewhere in the world, Britain had the \u201ccraziest\u201d politics. \u201cAround the world, where political leaders are gathered, there is often a conversation about whose politics is crazier,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree that right now the competition is fierce. But I still believe British politics is unfortunately ahead of the pack.\u201d He accused the two main parties of appealing to extremes, leaving the remainder of the electorate, who did not subscribe to their ideas, \u201cscratching their heads, changing their minds, floating and unsure\u201d. He added: \u201cThe unifying sentiment is a desire, bordering on the febrile, to end the mess, to wake from the nightmare.\u201d He said Brexit remained the country\u2019s single most important decision since 1945 because it would necessarily impact on the economy and therefore every pledge the parties were making. \u201cWe\u2019re a mess,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThe buoyancy of the world economy has kept us going up to now, but should that falter, we will be in deep trouble. Investment is down; jobs in certain sectors are already moving; our currency stays devalued sharply; and market sentiment swings between anxiety and alarm. \u201cAnd across a range of international issues which matter to us, we\u2019re irrelevant \u2013 too preoccupied to spare overstretched bandwidth of attention. Our politics is utterly dysfunctional.\u201d Meanwhile at an event on Monday night, Michael Heseltine, the former Tory deputy prime minister, also failed to endorse his old party. He instead urged Tories to vote for the Liberal Democrats, apart from in areas where they could vote for former Tory independent rebels such as Dominic Grieve, Anne Milton and David Gauke. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2019. Due to an editing error an earlier version was incorrect to describe Michael Heseltine as having said he would be voting for the Liberal Democrats. As a member of the House of Lords, he is ineligible to vote in general elections, but he did urge other Tories to vote for the Lib Dems.",

For information on our full range of classes, sign up to the Guardian Masterclasses newsletter, follow us on Twitter, or keep an eye on our calendar. In the face of personal set-backs and societal pressures, it\u2019s easy to feel disempowered. Or that meaningful change is always just out of reach.

Join us to learn from your peers and equip yourself with genuinely useful knowledge and tools that will help you make a difference not just in your own life, but in your community too. Our incredible lineup of speakers will cover all bases, including the hidden history of feminism, managing your financial independence, coming across as confident at work without compromising your authenticity, safeguarding the well-being of your mental and physical self, improving the quality of your relationships, and more. Through practical activities and guided discussions, you will come away with a toolkit for making positive changes in yourself that will enable you to make a positive impact on the world - from trusting your resourcefulness and combating your inner critic, to leveling-up your creativity and championing your peers and allies. When it comes to boosting your health, relationships and career, this is a safe and supportive space for you to take a chance and invest in yourself this International Women\u2019s Day. Plus, bring a friend to make use of our two-ticket offer and save 20%! Course content Guardian columnist, author and broadcaster Afua Hirsch will draw on her experiences building a successful media career to share her personal perspective on how to find your voice, navigating intersectional feminism and building collective progress, as well as exploring whether we\u2019re getting better at telling all women\u2019s stories. Historian and lecturer at King\u2019s College London Dr Hannah Dawson will take you on a whistle-stop tour of the four waves of feminism, exploring key topics such as the construction of gender, white privilege, the difference between flirting and harassing and how we can shake free of the stereotypes that shackle us all. How do you combat workplace or public speaking nerves? Comedian and actress Maddy Anholt believes that you have the creativity within you to change your lives \u2013 and she will show you the importance of trusting your instinct, tricking your body into thinking you\u2019re more confident than you feel, and how to combat your inner critical voice. Writer and illustrator Flo Perry will be leading a sex and intimacy workshop, discussing how we can have a healthier relationship with our bodies and sexual happiness, start more open and productive conversations about sex with our partners, and tackle some of the complexities around issues such consent in a post-#metoo world. With Bola Sol, you will be taken through a personal finance workshop which will cover how we can manage our finances more successfully (including having difficult conversations about money), how to budget, and how to make more considered financial choices. Psychologist and lecturer Kimberley Wilson will take you through the connections between mental health and nutrition, such as how disordered eating habits can develop when coping with trauma and psychological difficulties. She will also supply you with important advice on practicing body neutrality in the face of perfectionism, and how to build emotional resilience and a healthier relationship with food.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Former NY mayor to skip first four Democratic primaries Michael Bloomberg, the self-made billionaire and former three-term mayor of New York City, has formally launched his late bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination with a $30m national TV ad campaign, in which he casts himself, one of the world\u2019s richest men, as a \u201cmiddle-class kid who made good\u201d. The 77-year-old\u2019s self-funded campaign will skip the first four primary states to make a play for the \u201csuper Tuesday\u201d states in early March. \u2018Existential threat.\u2019 Bloomberg is reportedly running because of his concern that none of the existing Democratic candidates can defeat Donald Trump, whom he describes as \u201can existential threat to our country and our values\u201d. Amy Klobuchar. The Minnesota senator, one of the more centrist candidates in the Democratic field, said on Sunday that her party \u201cbetter not screw this up\u201d by alienating independents and moderate Republicans. Republicans remain unified in defence of Trump Any hope that congressional Democrats held of building bipartisan support for the president\u2019s impeachment appears to have been dashed, with the GOP remaining united in its defence of Donald Trump. Despite a week of damning testimony, in which fresh evidence emerged of Trump\u2019s misconduct over Ukraine, those Republicans who braved the Sunday shows stuck firmly to a series of pro-Trump talking points that are misleading at best. Navy secretary. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, has fired the Navy\u2019s top official, Richard Spencer, over his handling of the controversial case of a Navy Seal accused of war crimes in Iraq, who had won Trump\u2019s backing on Twitter. Leaked China cables reveal extent of Uighur crackdown A set of classified internal documents, known as the China cables and leaked from within the Chinese Communist party, describes the workings of the network of prison camps that holds more than a million ethnic minority Uighur Muslims from the country\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region. The documents also throw light on the surveillance technology being used by Beijing to monitor the same minority communities, both inside China and beyond its borders. Beijing responds. The Chinese embassy in the UK has responded to the leaked cables, calling them \u201cfake news\u201d and insisting \u201cthere are no so-called \u2018detention camps\u2019 in Xinjiang\u201d. Hong Kong votes. After months of political and civil unrest, Hong Kong voters have delivered a \u201cslap on the cheek\u201d to their city\u2019s Beijing-backed leadership, with landslide victories for pro-democracy candidates in the weekend\u2019s local elections. Exiled Morales: \u2018civil conflict\u2019 risk if I stand in next elections The former Bolivian president Evo Morales has ruled out standing in his country\u2019s next elections, to try to prevent the current unrest descending further into civil conflict. \u201cIn the name of peace, sacrifices have to be made and I am sacrificing my candidacy even though I have every right to it,\u201d he told the Guardian\u2019s Jo Tuckman in an interview in Mexico City, to which he fled following the \u201ccoup\u201d that ended his 14-year socialist rule earlier this month. \u2018Racist\u2019 elite. At least 32 people have died in recent clashes between the Bolivian authorities and pro-Morales protesters, who are mostly poor and indigenous. Morales blamed the crisis on the country\u2019s \u201cracist and vengeful\u201d old elite, backed by the US \u201cempire in the north\u201d. Cheat sheet Taylor Swift won six American Music awards on Sunday night, including artist of the year and artist of the decade, taking her all-time total to 29 to surpass Michael Jackson\u2019s record of 24. The former congresswoman Katie Hill, who resigned in October after the publication of nude photographs and allegations of an affair with a staff member, said on Sunday that rightwing media outlets attack women because \u201cthey\u2019re easier targets\u201d for bullying. The latest group of 32 US college students to be named Rhodes scholars is made up mostly of minorities, including the first transgender woman selected for the prestigious program. Prince Andrew is to withdraw his patronage from all 230 of the charities he currently supports, as part of the continuing effort to contain the public relations fallout from his friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Must-reads Florida nudist resorts split between purists and partygoers Pasco county near Tampa Bay is the nudist capital of the world, home to at least 13 nudist resorts and neighborhoods. But an ideological gap has opened up between Lake Como, the oldest and most traditional of the resorts, and the nearby Caliente Club, known for its wild swinger parties, as Jordan Blumetti discovered.

Wexit: Alberta\u2019s push for independence Alberta, the oil-rich western province known as the Texas of Canada, has suffered years of recession and frustration with the federal government. Now a new party founded by an Alberta farmer is channeling those resentments into a push for secession, or \u201cWexit\u201d, as Leyland Cecco and David Agren report.

The GB and England forward, 28, was hit in the face by a ball during the Olympic qualifying victory over Malaysia on 3 November. He underwent surgery 10 days later to reconstruct his cheek. \u201cOver the last week, I have received advice from three separate eye consultants,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThey have all told me that I have suffered damage to the retina of my left eye and that this damage is partly irreversible. \u201cI may get some sight back, but this won\u2019t be a quick process, and whether it will be sufficient for me to get back to playing international hockey only time will tell. It is a tough pill to swallow but, as people know, I am not one to give up easily and I will do everything can to make myself available for selection for Tokyo.\u201d It is expected to take several months before the extent of the damage to Ward\u2019s sight is fully understood.

Instead of \u201cclimate change\u201d, the preferred terms are \u201cclimate emergency, crisis or breakdown\u201d and \u201cglobal heating\u201d is favoured over \u201cglobal warming\u201d.</p>\n    <p>The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world\u2019s scientists. In October 2018, they said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">carbon emissions must halve</a>&nbsp;by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\">destruction of the ecosystems</a>&nbsp;that support all life on Earth.</p>\n    <p>The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: \u201cWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase \u2018climate change\u2019, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Other terms that have been updated include the use of \u201cwildlife\u201d rather than \u201cbiodiversity\u201d, \u201cfish populations\u201d instead of \u201cfish stocks\u201d and \u201cclimate science denier\u201d rather than \u201cclimate sceptic\u201d.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/damiancarrington\"><b>Damian Carrington</b></a> <i>Environment editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The research was undertaken by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air , the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and the UK climate thinktank Sandbag.</p> \n<p>The researchers found that China\u2019s coal-fired power generation was flatlining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/china-appetite-for-coal-power-stations-returns-despite-climate-pledge-capacity\">despite an increase in the number of coal plants being built</a>, because they were running at record low rates. China builds the equivalent of one large new coal plant every two weeks, according to the report, but its coal plants run for only 48.6% of the time, compared with a global utilisation rate of 54% on average.</p> \n<p>The findings come after a report from Global Energy Monitor found that the number of coal-fired power plants in the world is growing, because China is building new coal plants five times faster than the rest of the world is reducing their coal-fired power capacity.</p> \n<p>The report found that in other countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/25/g20-nations-triple-coal-power-subsidies-climate-crisis\">coal-fired power capacity</a> fell by 8GW in the 18 months to June but over the same period China increased its capacity by 42.9GW.</p> \n<p>In a paper for the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-global-coal-power-set-for-record-fall-in-2019\">industry journal Carbon Brief</a>, the researchers said: \u201cA 3% reduction in power sector coal use could imply zero growth in global CO2 output, if emissions changes in other sectors mirror those during 2018.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, the authors of the report have warned that despite the record coal power slump the world\u2019s use of coal remained far too high to meet the climate goals of the Paris agreement.</p> \n<p>The US \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\">which is backing out of the Paris </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\">agreement</a> \u2013 has made the deepest cuts to coal power of any developed country this year by shutting coal plants down in favour of gas power and renewable energy. By the end of August the US had reduced coal by almost 14% over the year compared with the same months in 2018.</p> \n<p>The EU reported a record slump in coal-fired electricity use in the first half of the year of almost a fifth compared with the same months last year. This trend is expected to accelerate over the second half of the year to average a 23% fall over 2019 as a whole. The EU is using less coal power in favour of gas-fired electricity \u2013 which can have roughly half the carbon footprint of coal \u2013 and renewable energy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s use of coal-fired electricity is on track for its biggest annual fall on record this year after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth that has stoked the global climate crisis. Data shows that coal-fired electricity is expected to fall by 3% in 2019, or more than the combined coal generation in Germany, Spain and the UK last year and could help stall the world\u2019s rising carbon emissions this year. The steepest global slump on record is likely to emerge in 2019 as India\u2019s reliance on coal power falls for the first time in at least three decades this year, and China\u2019s coal power demand plateaus. Both developing nations are using less coal-fired electricity due to slowing economic growth in Asia as well as the rise of cleaner energy alternatives. There is also expected to be unprecedented coal declines across the EU and the US as developed economies turn to clean forms of energy. In almost 40 years the world\u2019s annual coal generation has fallen only twice before: in 2009, in the wake of the global financial crisis, and in 2015, following a slowdown in China\u2019s coal plants amid rising levels of deadly air pollution. The research was undertaken by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air , the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and the UK climate thinktank Sandbag. The researchers found that China\u2019s coal-fired power generation was flatlining, despite an increase in the number of coal plants being built, because they were running at record low rates. China builds the equivalent of one large new coal plant every two weeks, according to the report, but its coal plants run for only 48.6% of the time, compared with a global utilisation rate of 54% on average. The findings come after a report from Global Energy Monitor found that the number of coal-fired power plants in the world is growing, because China is building new coal plants five times faster than the rest of the world is reducing their coal-fired power capacity. The report found that in other countries coal-fired power capacity fell by 8GW in the 18 months to June but over the same period China increased its capacity by 42.9GW. In a paper for the industry journal Carbon Brief, the researchers said: \u201cA 3% reduction in power sector coal use could imply zero growth in global CO2 output, if emissions changes in other sectors mirror those during 2018.\u201d However, the authors of the report have warned that despite the record coal power slump the world\u2019s use of coal remained far too high to meet the climate goals of the Paris agreement. The US \u2013 which is backing out of the Paris agreement \u2013 has made the deepest cuts to coal power of any developed country this year by shutting coal plants down in favour of gas power and renewable energy. By the end of August the US had reduced coal by almost 14% over the year compared with the same months in 2018. The EU reported a record slump in coal-fired electricity use in the first half of the year of almost a fifth compared with the same months last year. This trend is expected to accelerate over the second half of the year to average a 23% fall over 2019 as a whole. The EU is using less coal power in favour of gas-fired electricity \u2013 which can have roughly half the carbon footprint of coal \u2013 and renewable energy.",

The pickles give this sandwich quite a striking personality, it just needs a bit more filling. <strong>4/5</strong></p> <p><strong>Pret\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Lunch Vegan Sandwich</strong><strong><br></strong>Pret never lets you down on filling. The quality of bread is good, the spinach is fresh and I think there\u2019s some cumin in there. It\u2019s just a bit stodgy. It reminds me of vegetarian food of the past which was always in need of something more to lift it up.

A mashup of Israeli, Lebanese, Indian and British cuisine. It\u2019s substantial but, sadly, I don\u2019t think any of these flavours work together. And this is the cauliflower of the 1980s ... boiled and a bit soggy. 1/5 Boots Vegan Sausage This looks really unappetising, doesn\u2019t it? But never judge a sandwich by its colour \u2013 it\u2019s quite tasty. The sausage, mustard and onion flavour combination is comforting and reminiscent of childhood, which is quite lovely. 3.5/5 Starbucks Very Merry Vegan Wrap This is really vibrant looking and I\u2019m glad Starbucks has done something different to the traditional roast. I suppose it doesn\u2019t really say Christmas, does it? I guess they\u2019ve gone down the joy route \u2013 lots of colour, crunch and hoping for the best. 4/5 Waitrose Smoked Carrot And Dill It looks like rabbit food and I\u2019m not sure it would be very filling. It\u2019s more of a sandwich for a summer picnic. It does, however, smell amazing; the dill and the smokiness work really well together, but it sets you up for smoked salmon and ends up tasting like \u2026 well, carrot. 2.5/5 Wicked Kitchen Pea Protein (Tesco) \u201cWe\u2019re proud graduates of the university of common sense,\u201d it says on the packet. That is vomit-inducing, and the phrase \u201cpea protein pieces\u201d is never going to create a fire in anybody\u2019s belly. But it\u2019s not bad as a lighter option \u2013 like a fresh Christmas salad wrapped in a tortilla. 3/5 M&amp;S Nutcracker - **WINNER** It feels as if this is going for a hashtag with that name. There\u2019s sweet potato, cranberry, nut roast and almond butter dressing. Plus, some nice crunch from the pistachios. It has been made with love and I\u2019d be really happy to buy one. 5/5 Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas New Yorker This conjures up images of 90s films about Christmas in New York. This has a \u201ccoconut based vegan alternative to cheese\u201d which is a wild idea and it works. The pickles give this sandwich quite a striking personality, it just needs a bit more filling. 4/5 Pret\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Lunch Vegan Sandwich Pret never lets you down on filling. The quality of bread is good, the spinach is fresh and I think there\u2019s some cumin in there. It\u2019s just a bit stodgy. It reminds me of vegetarian food of the past which was always in need of something more to lift it up. This might send me to sleep after eating it \u2013 which would, at least, be reminiscent of Christmas dinner. 3/5 Waitrose Christmas Vegan No Turkey Feast \u201cSoy protein\u201d doesn\u2019t set my heart alight ... I don\u2019t see it and think \u201cyum\u201d. But this is not bad as a meat substitute. It has nice bread, fresh spinach and a good balance of Christmas flavours \u2013 it\u2019s an excellent sandwich full of festive cheer. 4.5/5 Co-Op Vegan Festive Feast I love the pink and yellow, but of all the sandwiches I\u2019ve had, this is one of the most forgettable. It\u2019s bland and the parsnip fritter has lost its fritteriness. This might be what you give to someone who hasn\u2019t been very good this year. 1.5/5",

      "bodyText": "US law enforcement officials preparing for fresh Keystone XL pipeline protests have privately discussed tactics to stop activists \u201cby any means\u201d and have labeled demonstrators potential \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d threats, records reveal. Internal government documents seen by the Guardian show that police and local authorities in Montana and the surrounding region have been preparing a coordinated response in the event of a new wave of protests opposing the controversial Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Canada to Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. Civil rights organizations say the documents raise concerns that law enforcement is preparing to launch an even more brutal and aggressive response than the police tactics utilized during the 2016 Standing Rock movement, which drew thousands of indigenous and environmental activists opposed to the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) to North Dakota. At Standing Rock, law enforcement organized repeated rounds of mass arrests and filed a wide array of serious charges in local and federal courts against activists. Police also deployed water cannons, teargas grenades, bean bag rounds and other weapons, causing serious injuries to protesters. The documents are mostly emails from 2017 and 2018 between local and federal authorities discussing possible Keystone protests. They show that police officials are anticipating construction will spark a sustained resistance campaign akin to the one at Standing Rock and that police are considering closing public lands near the pipeline project. The new records have come to light as the Keystone pipeline project has overcome numerous legal hurdles with help from the Trump administration, and as the project\u2019s owner, TC Energy (formerly TransCanada), is moving forward with initial construction efforts. Among the major revelations in the documents: Officials at a 2017 law enforcement briefing on potential Keystone XL protests said one key tactic would be to \u201cinitially deny access to the property by protestors and keep them as far away [from] the contested locations as possible by any means\u201d, according to an email summary from a US army corps of engineers security manager in Nebraska in July 2017. Officials with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said in 2017 that the bureau had 10 armed officers in Montana and was prepared to \u201cwork with local [law enforcement] to deny access to federal property\u201d. In 2018, army corps officials were also in discussions with the Montana disaster and emergency services department to discuss ways to \u201cclose access\u201d to lands near the pipeline route, including areas typically open for hunting and other activities. A \u201cjoint terrorism task force\u201d involving the US attorney\u2019s office and other agencies, along with federal \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d officials, said it was prepared to assist in the response to protests and a \u201ccritical incident response team\u201d would be available for \u201cdomestic terrorism or threats to critical infrastructure\u201d. Authorities have also pre-emptively discussed specific potential felony charges that protesters could face, noting that a \u201ccivil disorder\u201d statute was used to prosecute activists at Standing Rock. Authorities have been preparing for possible protests in the Fort Peck area, home to a Native American reservation and indigenous people opposing the project. \u201cThere is a lot of muscle behind this effort to make sure that Keystone is constructed,\u201d said Alex Rate, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, which obtained the documents through records act requests and shared them with the Guardian. \u201cThere are historically marginalized communities, primarily indigenous folks, who have grave concerns about the impact of this pipeline on their sovereignty, their resources, their religion and culture. They have a first amendment right to assemble and make their viewpoints heard.\u201d Remi Bald Eagle, intergovernmental affairs coordinator of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe, which is located along the pipeline route, said the police buildup was part of a long history of armed subjugation of native people in the region. \u201cThis is an experience of the tide of Manifest Destiny still coming at us,\u201d Bald Eagle said, referring to the 19th-century belief that US settlers had the right to expand across the continent. The files follow repeated revelations that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have investigated environmental groups and leftwing activists as possible \u201cterrorists\u201d. Keystone XL was rejected by the Obama administration and then revived by Donald Trump shortly after his inauguration in 2017. The $8bn project has been subject to multiple legal challenges, including over the environmental review process, but pre-construction efforts are now under way. Opponents of Keystone XL have warned about the environmental and cultural impact of the project for a decade \u2013 concerns that came into sharper focus last month after the existing Keystone pipeline, which follows a similar route, leaked 383,000 gallons of tar sands into a swath of North Dakota wetlands. The new Keystone records, which come from a number of government agencies and were released after a protracted legal battle, also show that officials have specifically met with police involved in the Standing Rock response to discuss \u201clessons learned\u201d. North Dakota police officials told law enforcement prepping for Keystone that one of their biggest mistakes was their failure to keep activists far away and shut down access to nearby lands. In one 2018 BLM document, labeled \u201cKEYSTONE XL PIPELINE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES\u201d, officials discussed the \u201cavailable resources\u201d to respond to protests in Montana. \u201cThe FBI will have primary investigative authority for all national security investigations, including but not limited to international terrorism, domestic terrorism, and weapons of mass destruction,\u201d BLM wrote. US border patrol would also be available to assist law enforcement around the border and has access to \u201cdrone assets\u201d, the document continued. Border patrol also provided a surveillance drone that police used to track Standing Rock protesters. BLM also discussed purchasing \u201criot batons\u201d, helmets and gas masks in advance of possible protests. Mike Glasch, an army corps spokesman, said that the \u201cby any means\u201d comment came from the agency\u2019s security chief, who was \u201crelaying talking points\u201d from police officials in Mandan and Morton County in North Dakota, adding: \u201cAny method that we would employ to protect the safety of our employees and the public, as well as property and equipment, would be within the limits of the law and be the least invasive possible, while still protecting the public\u2019s first amendment rights.\u201d A spokesperson for the Morton county sheriff, Kyle Kirchmeier, said he advises law enforcement that \u201cmay be involved with potential pipeline protests to make it their goal to keep protesters off of private property and any areas that may be considered a public hazard, such as ditches or highways\u201d, adding that he \u201cis supportive of people\u2019s right to protest, but they need to do so in a lawful manner\u201d. Kirchmeier said he did not recall the 2017 briefing. A Mandan police spokesperson declined to comment. Glasch said the army corps had not closed access to its land around the project, but added: \u201cSince a construction site comes with inherent hazards, options are being analyzed for methods to keep any non-essential personnel away from potential construction sites, while at the same time considering constitutional rights.\u201d He said it was too early to speculate about specific potential closure plans. A spokesperson for the US attorney\u2019s office did not respond to questions about the \u201cterrorism\u201d references but said the office\u2019s \u201cgoal is to provide coordinated assistance to local, tribal and state law enforcement to protect public safety and civil rights, and to protect federal lands, while enforcing federal law\u201d. The FBI declined to comment. A border patrol spokesperson said the agency would \u201cassist, upon request, with any law enforcement activities within the border area near the pipeline\u201d. Spokespeople for BLM and TC Energy did not respond to questions. \u201cLaw enforcement are getting ready. They\u2019ve been having meetings behind closed doors,\u201d said Angeline Cheek, an indigenous organizer from the Fort Peck reservation. \u201cWe know that they\u2019re preparing \u2026 We\u2019ve been preparing for the last three years.\u201d Rate, from the ACLU, said there was no legal justification for the government to pre-emptively shut down lands in an effort to stop protests. He said it was also troubling for law enforcement to prepare a \u201cmilitarized\u201d response and suggest that activists could pose terrorist or criminal threats before any actions had even begun. \u201cThey are thinking of them as potential \u2018domestic terrorists\u2019. There is simply no support for adopting that paradigm,\u201d said Rate. \u201cThe public justifiably thinks of BLM as a land management agency and not necessarily in the business of arming themselves and going out and squelching protesters.\u201d Candi Brings Plenty, an Oglala Lakota Sioux activist working with the ACLU of Montana, said they were not surprised to learn that law enforcement was talking about stopping indigenous activists \u201cby any means\u201d. \u201cThat is the type of language that has been spoken to us our whole lives,\u201d they said, adding: \u201cWe live these injustices on a daily basis. This is finally being unveiled for what it is.\u201d Brings Plenty, who led a two-spirit camp at Standing Rock, said they would not be intimidated by law enforcement and hoped people would still support the fight against Keystone \u2013 instead of just accepting the pipeline. \u201cIt\u2019s almost become the norm for folks to look the other way, feeling like there isn\u2019t something they can do, that it\u2019s beyond their grasp,\u201d they said. \u201cI want folks to see these pipelines the way they do the glaciers in the arctic. This is happening right here in their own front yard.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In Orinda, any indication that, less than a month ago, dozens of people jumped from windows and off of balconies to escape gunfire are nearly erased. The house on the narrow private road where five people were shot and killed during a party on Halloween night is almost free of debris. All that remains are a couple of sparse empty bottles of alcohol and Halloween costume accessories strewn across a leaf-covered backyard. But the grief for what happened in this small, upper-middle-class community in San Francisco\u2019s Bay area on the night of 31 October is still fresh, and the families of Omar Taylor, 24; Oshiana Thompkins, 19; Tiyon Farley, 22; Javlin County, 29; and Raymon Hill Jr, 23, are still searching for answers. Convicting the person or people involved in the shooting will probably be a long, complicated process. \u201cRight now the families are consumed with a lot of grief and coping with this tremendous loss,\u201d said Adante Pointer, an attorney who is representing four of the five families who lost a loved one. \u201cYou can imagine the pain that this is causing,\u201d Pointer continued. \u201cThe mothers of some of the young men\u2019s children have to explain to their child that their father isn\u2019t coming home. It\u2019s been devastating.\u201d \u201cMr Taylor told me what he went through to raise a young man and help him avoid situations that could result in something like this,\u201d he said of Omar Taylor\u2019s father. \u201cHis son was there DJing, working, minding his business, a true innocent.\u201d Taylor was one of three people found dead after dozens of shots were fired at a Halloween event advertised as an Airbnb mansion party. Two people later died of their injuries at the hospital. One witness told the Guardian the party was attended by dozens of people from nearby Bay Area cities, including people who looked to be minors, and the party had just started when bullets started flying and people began scrambling to get out of the house. So far, none of the families Pointer represents have filed any lawsuits, so in the meantime Pointer is helping them deal with funeral logistics and getting support through victims\u2019 services and funds provided by Airbnb. However, he says his most important role is helping them \u201ccome to grips with the loss of their family and loved ones in such an easily preventable, unnecessary and violent way\u201d. In the days following the shooting, officials remained tight-lipped about the details of the investigation \u2013 including the number of suspects, the firearms that were used and a possible motive behind the violence. On 14 November, two weeks after the incident, the Contra Costa county sheriff\u2019s office announced the arrest of five people in connection with the shooting.

Since Instagram\u2019s public launch in October 2010, there have been 97m photos hashtagged #dogs on the site, but only 92m hashtagged #cats.

It started in 2013, when artist Colette Miller posted the first Instagram picture of her <a href=\"https://www.colettemiller.com/angelwings\" title=\"\">Global Angel Wings project</a>. In essence: she encouraged artists to paint human-sized wings on walls around the world, which in turn encouraged people to pose in front of them.

As such, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West win the award for \u201cthe world\u2019s most romantic Instagram photo\u201d after their first kiss as a married couple became <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ogSSO6uS9C/\" title=\"\">the most-liked picture of 2014</a> (knocking Justin Bieber from the throne). Kim\u2019s post broke records as the first picture to receive more than two million likes, a number the star now achieves on a regular basis. In five years, Instagram has grown from 200 million users to one billion, and the Kardashian-Wests remain our Instagram overlords.</p> <h2>4 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/9poYKgOWk4/\">The fakest picture (2015)</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02ddd0d4ebc576d3e253b6973222c0d3a871a729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02ddd0d4ebc576d3e253b6973222c0d3a871a729/37_33_589_589/500.jpg\" alt=\"Essena O\u2019Neill's post\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s now firmly established \u2013 in PSHE lessons and heartfelt #NoMakeUpSelfies \u2013 that social media is not real life. Yet the first person to authoritatively announce this was Australian teenage influencer Essena O\u2019Neill in 2015. After gaining more than 600,000 followers on the site, O\u2019Neill deleted 2,000 images and recaptioned the remaining 96. \u201cI just want younger girls to know this isn\u2019t candid life, or cool or inspirational. It\u2019s contrived perfection made to get attention,\u201d she wrote on <a href=\"instagram.com/p/9poYKgOWk4/\" title=\"\">an image of herself wearing a bikini</a>, confessing to sucking in her stomach and pushing up her boobs.

The picture showed <a href=\"instagram.com/p/3H0-Yqjo7u/\" title=\"\">Jenner lying on the ground in a white lace dress</a>, her hair intricately arranged in the shape of seven hearts. The Macmillan dictionary definition of organic? \u201cHappening or developing in a natural and continuous process.\u201d You can\u2019t get much more contrived than getting three supermodels to arrange your hair on a yacht, but c\u2019est la vie, because after Jenner received 3.5m likes, the pose became incredibly popular among copycats. Yacht: optional.</p> <h2>6 The most-fumbled picture (2016)</h2> <p>The concept of influencers who can prompt their followers to purchase products has taken off in recent years; this year Business Insider valued the influencer industry at $8bn.

      "bodyText": "1 The first picture (2010) Before 2010, the internet belonged to cats. Not only could they Has Cheezburger, they ate it, too, as cat memes superimposed with funny broken English captions reigned supreme on the web. Then came the first post on Instagram, on 16 July 2010. App co-founder Kevin Systrom took a picture of a stray dog lying near a taco stand in Mexico and uploaded it with the caption \u201ctest\u201d. He was testing the capabilities of his new photo-sharing service, sure, but he was also testing the water for dogs. Since Instagram\u2019s public launch in October 2010, there have been 97m photos hashtagged #dogs on the site, but only 92m hashtagged #cats. Yes, Systrom changed social media as we know it, but when it comes to PR for man\u2019s best friend, his work is unparalleled. 2 The most influential picture (2013) What do you do when you visit a new city? Try out the local cuisine? Check out the most popular museum on TripAdvisor? If you\u2019re big on Instagram, you might be more interested in walking wall to wall to wall. \u201cWall crawls\u201d are an incredibly popular tourist activity, as murals and street art have long been considered the best backdrop for interesting #holiday pics. It started in 2013, when artist Colette Miller posted the first Instagram picture of her Global Angel Wings project. In essence: she encouraged artists to paint human-sized wings on walls around the world, which in turn encouraged people to pose in front of them. She aimed to \u201cremind humanity that we are the angels of this earth\u201d; she succeeded in getting your LA holiday snap 150 likes. 3 The most romantic picture (2014) Lancelot and Guinevere were born a few hundred years early for Instagram, and Romeo and Juliet never got the chance to put a Lark filter atop their #OOTD posts from the Capulet ball. As such, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West win the award for \u201cthe world\u2019s most romantic Instagram photo\u201d after their first kiss as a married couple became the most-liked picture of 2014 (knocking Justin Bieber from the throne). Kim\u2019s post broke records as the first picture to receive more than two million likes, a number the star now achieves on a regular basis. In five years, Instagram has grown from 200 million users to one billion, and the Kardashian-Wests remain our Instagram overlords. 4 The fakest picture (2015) It\u2019s now firmly established \u2013 in PSHE lessons and heartfelt #NoMakeUpSelfies \u2013 that social media is not real life. Yet the first person to authoritatively announce this was Australian teenage influencer Essena O\u2019Neill in 2015. After gaining more than 600,000 followers on the site, O\u2019Neill deleted 2,000 images and recaptioned the remaining 96. \u201cI just want younger girls to know this isn\u2019t candid life, or cool or inspirational. It\u2019s contrived perfection made to get attention,\u201d she wrote on an image of herself wearing a bikini, confessing to sucking in her stomach and pushing up her boobs. In being one of the first people to expose the fakery inherent in Instagramming, O\u2019Neill paved the way for conversations \u2013 and academic studies \u2013 about how the social network affects mental health. 5 The most-copied picture (2015) There are many remarkable things that we take for granted in life: the neon pink of an autumn sunset; the trilling of birds on our morning commute. Also underappreciated in its time: Kendall Jenner\u2019s claim that the most-liked Instagram picture of 2015 was \u201corganic\u201d. The picture showed Jenner lying on the ground in a white lace dress, her hair intricately arranged in the shape of seven hearts. The Macmillan dictionary definition of organic? \u201cHappening or developing in a natural and continuous process.\u201d You can\u2019t get much more contrived than getting three supermodels to arrange your hair on a yacht, but c\u2019est la vie, because after Jenner received 3.5m likes, the pose became incredibly popular among copycats. Yacht: optional. 6 The most-fumbled picture (2016) The concept of influencers who can prompt their followers to purchase products has taken off in recent years; this year Business Insider valued the influencer industry at $8bn. Kim Kardashian allegedly earns up to $500,000 per branded post, so you can\u2019t blame marketers for going with a cheaper option. In May 2016, Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s ex, Scott Disick, accidentally left the instructions from an advertiser in his Instagram caption about a protein shake. \u201cHere you go, at 4 pm est, write the below. Caption: \u2018Keeping up with the summer workout routine with my morning @booteauk protein shake!\u2019,\u201d Scott posted for the world to see. Two months later, girl band Little Mix did the same thing in a perfume ad. 7 The most controversial picture (2016) Launched in 2016, the @genderless_nipple account sought to expose Instagram\u2019s double standards when it comes to female nudity. Since its launch, the social network has been criticised for censoring breasts by removing nude pictures of women, while topless pictures of men remain acceptable fodder for Likes. Three advertising students from New York created this account, which posts zoomed-in pictures of nipples, meaning the identity (and gender) of the owner remains hidden. In December 2016, a male nipple was removed from their page for violating Instagram\u2019s community guidelines; \u201cWhy even bother banning female nipples if they can be so similar?\u201d retorted the account. The page now has over 77,000 followers and continues to post nipples. Meanwhile, Instagram\u2019s guidelines remain unchanged, and in October 2019, 20 artists met with the site to ask them to stop the censorship. 8 The most-political picture (2017) On 29 January 2017, former White House photographer Pete Souza posted a picture of former president Barack Obama kneeling at the school desk of a young refugee who was painting a picture. This wasn\u2019t your regular #ThrowbackThursday; Souza was using the image to subtly condemn new president Donald Trump. Two days earlier, Trump had signed an executive order lowering the number of refugees who could be admitted into the United States. Since then, Souza has regularly posted pictures of Obama that contrast with news stories about Trump: when Trump fought with German chancellor Angela Merkel, Souza posted a picture of Obama and Merkel captioned \u201cbesties\u201d; when Trump tweeted that his former aide Omarosa was a \u201cdog\u201d, Souza posted a picture of Obama and his family dog Bo, captioned, \u201cA real dog waiting for a real President\u201d. 9 The most-liked picture (2019) How will history judge us?

Two people were arrested on Sunday morning while a third man escaped after the vessel was intercepted in an estuarine inlet in the north-western Spanish region. \u201cEarly this morning an international operation was able to locate a small submarine about 20 metres long near the beach of Hio in the province of Pontevedra,\u201d a source with the central government\u2019s delegation to Galicia told Reuters. The central government\u2019s delegate, Javier Losada, told Radio Galega that the seizure had also involved Spanish officers from the Guardia Civil, national police and customs service. Although narco-subs have been used regularly in Colombia and other parts of South and Central America for more than 25 years, they remain a novelty in European waters. The Spanish news agency Efe quoted Guardia Civil sources, who claimed the boat was carrying about 3,000kg of cocaine. However, the source told Reuters that while the submarine appeared to be carrying drugs, its cargo had yet to be confirmed. The Guardia Civil and national police force said they had no further details on the matter. Losada said efforts to raise the sub were being hampered by difficult weather conditions and by a lack of resources. Helicopters and flotation equipment have been dispatched to the area, which lies south-west of Pontevedra, but the majority of available resources are being used to try to refloat the Blue Star, a chemical tanker that ran aground off Galicia on 22 November.

      "bodyText": "Nicky Morgan has defended Boris Johnson over his decision to shelve plans to overhaul social care funding in the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto launch. The Tories have pledged to allocate an extra \u00a31bn a year for the social care sector as part of a cautious manifesto, while guaranteeing that no one should have to sell their home to meet the costs. But it falls short of Johnson\u2019s rallying cry on the steps of Downing Street when he took office, claiming \u201cwe will fix the crisis in social care once and for all \u2026 with a clear plan we have prepared\u201d. Theresa May was forced into a U-turn when her 2017 manifesto social care plan was labelled a \u201cdementia tax\u201d, and Johnson has now committed only to saying the party will \u201cbuild a cross-party consensus\u201d on how it should be funded in the long term. Sir Andrew Dilnot, the former chair of the commission on funding of care and support, said the Tory plans were \u201cvery vague\u201d. And the head of a thinktank has said Johnson\u2019s pledge is too little to plug the gap needed to cater for the country\u2019s ageing population. However, Nicky Morgan, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS), defended Johnson\u2019s strategy. \u201cThere\u2019s a very clear three-point plan that\u2019s the \u00a31bn extra every year, the need to build a cross-party consensus \u2013 because social care is a long-term, complex issue \u2013 But also a very clear statement, as the prime minister set out in the Question Time debate last week, that no one should have to sell their own home to pay for their care,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Asked about Johnson\u2019s previous claim to have a plan \u201calready prepared\u201d, Morgan said: \u201cThere has been work going on but it\u2019s not at a stage yet in order to be launched. I think actually what you see overall in the manifesto, and I think quite right because the second part of our campaign is about unleashing Britain\u2019s potential, but it\u2019s about saying we\u2019re going to do this in a responsible, one-nation way. We\u2019re not going to make lots of unfunded, uncosted promises.\u201d Pressed again on why Johnson claimed he would fix the problem four months ago with a \u201cclear plan\u201d but has not included it in the manifesto, Morgan said the previous government had been working on the issue, of which the prime minister may have been aware, but \u201cit\u2019s not there in a form to be included in the manifesto\u201d. Johnson has also faced scrutiny over the party\u2019s pledge to deliver 50,000 more nurses \u2013 it has emerged that nearly 20,000 of that number include existing staff who would be encouraged to remain, or those who had left being encouraged to return. Dilnot told Today the Conservatives\u2019 social care plans were \u201creally not very specific\u201d, adding: \u201cFour months ago we had the prime minister standing on the steps of Downing Street saying he would fix the crisis in social care once and for all with \u2018a clear plan we have prepared\u2019.

On how big the gap is between the Tories\u2019 promise of an extra \u00a31bn a year over the next five years and the amount that is needed to help the sector, Warren added: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a couple of billion pounds short a year.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In the smoke-filled basement of Bristol\u2019s Brunswick Club, the T-shirts are off for Giant Swan. The duo coax unearthly noise from a web of drum machines and guitar effects pedals; as Robin Stewart\u2019s robotic howls and Harry Wright\u2019s clattering beats resolve into techno, their audience of peers in Bristol\u2019s music community disrobe from the sweat and explode into dance.</p> <p>For the family of artists in the room, in January 2018 at the last festival by Howling Owl Records, this closing show marks the start of a new chapter \u2013 one that has been moving into the spotlight ever since.</p> <p>Several breakthrough artists are now creating a vibrant new Bristolian underground, a scene long obscured by the enduring legacy of the city\u2019s trip-hop era, when artists including Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky created pre-millennial tension by splicing dub and hip-hop. Like those trip-hoppers before them, many of the new avant gardists are rooted in the city\u2019s vital reggae soundsystem culture, but what marks them out is an impulse to marry it with the theatrical world of guitar music.</p> <p>At their forefront is Giant Swan. Nodding to both noise-rock and techno in their recently released <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3sQ4kRPmlOz4DehzdZkdvz\">self-titled debut album</a>, a work of soaring imagination, Wright hopes that \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing, and what our friends are doing, is helping to blur that line\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V49791v5rBI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V49791v5rBI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I meet the duo at The Old Bell near their Bristol studio, currently in use by the astonishing avant-pop artist EBU, who appears in a portrait on their album cover. Elsewhere in the pub is Ky Witney, drummer in Wright and Stewart\u2019s art-rock band the Naturals. It was while trying to use their pedalboards to devise more electronic sounds for this band that the two guitarists started Giant Swan as a drone project. Their dance leanings began when Wright broke his arm before a gig, swapping his guitar for a friend\u2019s drum machine, but they had already become infatuated with Bristol\u2019s dub nights. \u201cThere was this eureka moment,\u201d Stewart claims, in \u201chearing sound systems take on this role of being grimmer and heavier than the craziest guitar band ever.\u201d</p> <p>By blurring this distinction, Giant Swan hope to be inclusive to listeners from both worlds, \u201cconversing\u201d with their audiences by improvising in the democratic space of the dancefloor. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing it for the first time too, so we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Wright says with a grin. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t sound good, we know!\u201d Stewart views Giant Swan within a wider Bristol impulse to \u201cgo to the most extreme point we can think of,\u201d which has developed over the past 10-or-so years. \u201cBefore that, Bristol was quite a dark place musically.\u201d</p> <p>The 2010s opened with the confluence of two events. The subversive label Howling Owl arrived, and \u2013 after an argument with a promoter \u2013 was blackballed from holding gigs at any local venues. Their consequent shows in non-venues (crypts, Scout huts, art galleries) not only rewired Bristol\u2019s live circuit and label culture, but drew together a community of previously isolated new artists such as the Naturals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/25/spectre-by-spectres-james-bond-alternative-theme-listen\">Spectres</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/14/best-albums-2018-idles-joy-as-an-act-of-resistance\">Idles</a>. Around this time, a circle of Bristol avant gardists collectivised to form the shadowy and highly productive Young Echo; spawning several labels, a radio show and a vast body of recordings, their sonic and entrepreneurial extremity inspired a new wave of labels, promoters and artists. Having been at their first bedroom transmissions, Wright says Giant Swan are indebted to them for advice and inspiration: \u201cYoung Echo proved you can build this community out of experimentation, or a sense of otherness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9428c36ae73e76dd0dc09f2b694efe7d3f18d5dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9428c36ae73e76dd0dc09f2b694efe7d3f18d5dd/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Tracking performing live.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bad Tracking performing live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Holliday</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest manifestation of this spirit is <a href=\"https://avonterrorcorps.bandcamp.com/\">Avon Terror Corps</a>, a \u201ccrew label\u201d rejecting nostalgic perceptions of \u201cthe Bristol sound\u201d to promote the city\u2019s subversive new music. Ranging from goth duo Fever 103 to \u201ccyborg industrial trap\u201d artists Kinlaw &amp; Franco Franco, this colourful circle\u2019s prime mover is Miles Opland, creator of leftfield dub label Bokeh Versions.</p> <p>Opland is moving flat when I visit him, packing up gig posters, records and memorabilia from his years in Bristol\u2019s music scene. \u201cWhat relics do we have here?\u201d he asks himself with a smile, before pointing to the poster for the first <a href=\"https://bokeh-versions.com/\">Bokeh Versions</a> night. This featured the live debut of dub producer Sunun, whose work forgoes computers in favour of live vocals and real instrumentation. \u201cThere\u2019s no one doing what she\u2019s doing with a mixing desk,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is a band, for want of a better term.\u201d Opland has an eccentric fondness for spreading misinformation: one poster claims that thrash metallers Napalm Death are appearing, while on that debut show\u2019s anniversary, he put the old posters back up around town. \u201cI wonder if anyone turned up\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Avon Terror Corps formed as a reaction to the <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/noise-complaints-luxury-flats-force-828946\">closure of Bristol music hub The Surrey Vaults</a>. \u201cDJ October once told me it\u2019s the closest thing we could have had to CBGBs,\u201d Opland says. When it closed in 2017 at a week\u2019s notice, \u201cwe drank it dry and took any furnishings we could \u2013 that weird pot is from there,\u201d he continues, pointing to an enormous vase behind me. ATC was formed by the \u201cmisfits and weirdos\u201d who coalesced there, and has already produced several critically lauded records. He plays me some new music from the duo <a href=\"https://avonterrorcorps.bandcamp.com/track/bad-tracking-generic-music\">Bad Tracking</a>, pairing spoken word with industrial noise played on old cassette machines, and themed around the body\u2019s relationship with technology. Giant Swan\u2019s Robin Stewart claims their devastating live sets, which see their nude vocalist choke himself with a belt, often bring him to tears.</p> <p>Opland baulks at the mention of trip-hop, saying nostalgic media coverage of that scene has obscured the city\u2019s new music. \u201cI know for a fact we\u2019re going through a golden age right now,\u201d he says. \u201cRobin said to me about 18 months ago that something\u2019s happening, or about to happen. I don\u2019t mean we\u2019re about to sell a million records \u2013 I mean we\u2019re about to do all the stuff that\u2019s going to mean something to us when we die,\u201d he says softly, looking at the posters again. \u201cIt\u2019s the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faf98f927e8688181fcb55446a950d21789a6186\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faf98f927e8688181fcb55446a950d21789a6186/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harrga.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A sonic Guernica\u2019 \u2026 Harrga.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Holliday</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another of ATC\u2019s affiliates is <a href=\"https://avonterrorcorps.bandcamp.com/album/h-ro-ques-animaux-de-la-mis-re\">Harrga, whose album H\u00e9ro\u00efques Animaux de la Mis\u00e8re</a> channels Bristol\u2019s experimental impulse into urgent political music. Over Miguel Prado\u2019s abstract electronic compositions, Dali De Saint Paul\u2019s multilingual lyrics in French, Darija and more present a harrowing exploration of the refugee crisis. The album has been termed \u2013 she explains in the pool room of The Old England \u2013 \u201ca sonic Guernica.\u201d</p> <p>As in Bad Tracking or Giant Swan, Harrga\u2019s cross-pollination of punk elements with beat-driven electronics has a conceptual foundation. Album-opener Melilla is named after a Spanish autonomous city in Morocco, frequently used by refugees fleeing war zones to access Europe; to do so, they must vault two walls covered in razor wire while evading police patrols. The shouting that opens the song, Prado explains, \u201cis a field recording of the moment they are able to trespass into the city\u201d. The middle sees De Saint Paul repeatedly shout \u201c<em>bosa</em>\u201d (Bambara for victory), which is called out by successful crossers. The end, segueing into a dance-oriented beat, was inspired by trap music made in Andalusia by second-generation Moroccan migrants \u2013 overall, it evokes refugees entering Europe and suffusing it with new art.</p> <p>De Saint Paul recalls her first experience of St Paul\u2019s Carnival here; seeing \u201call these people joining in the streets, dancing to these really loud beats,\u201d she felt an openness she considers foundational to Bristol\u2019s experimental scene. \u201cThese people from Avon Terror Corps or Young Echo are trying to push boundaries, but they share this idea of making music to make people share in the community. If you go to Giant Swan, you can\u2019t stay like this!\u201d she laughs, stiffening her arms by her sides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"308de3076674cd4d031453bda7bebde273aee094\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/308de3076674cd4d031453bda7bebde273aee094/0_2125_5245_2906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scalping.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"554\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cross-pollination \u2026 Scalping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rowan Allen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The weekend we meet also sees the closing-down night at local venue Start the Bus (later Hy Brasil Music Club).

      "bodyText": "In the smoke-filled basement of Bristol\u2019s Brunswick Club, the T-shirts are off for Giant Swan. The duo coax unearthly noise from a web of drum machines and guitar effects pedals; as Robin Stewart\u2019s robotic howls and Harry Wright\u2019s clattering beats resolve into techno, their audience of peers in Bristol\u2019s music community disrobe from the sweat and explode into dance. For the family of artists in the room, in January 2018 at the last festival by Howling Owl Records, this closing show marks the start of a new chapter \u2013 one that has been moving into the spotlight ever since. Several breakthrough artists are now creating a vibrant new Bristolian underground, a scene long obscured by the enduring legacy of the city\u2019s trip-hop era, when artists including Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky created pre-millennial tension by splicing dub and hip-hop. Like those trip-hoppers before them, many of the new avant gardists are rooted in the city\u2019s vital reggae soundsystem culture, but what marks them out is an impulse to marry it with the theatrical world of guitar music. At their forefront is Giant Swan. Nodding to both noise-rock and techno in their recently released self-titled debut album, a work of soaring imagination, Wright hopes that \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing, and what our friends are doing, is helping to blur that line\u201d. I meet the duo at The Old Bell near their Bristol studio, currently in use by the astonishing avant-pop artist EBU, who appears in a portrait on their album cover. Elsewhere in the pub is Ky Witney, drummer in Wright and Stewart\u2019s art-rock band the Naturals. It was while trying to use their pedalboards to devise more electronic sounds for this band that the two guitarists started Giant Swan as a drone project. Their dance leanings began when Wright broke his arm before a gig, swapping his guitar for a friend\u2019s drum machine, but they had already become infatuated with Bristol\u2019s dub nights. \u201cThere was this eureka moment,\u201d Stewart claims, in \u201chearing sound systems take on this role of being grimmer and heavier than the craziest guitar band ever.\u201d By blurring this distinction, Giant Swan hope to be inclusive to listeners from both worlds, \u201cconversing\u201d with their audiences by improvising in the democratic space of the dancefloor. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing it for the first time too, so we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Wright says with a grin. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t sound good, we know!\u201d Stewart views Giant Swan within a wider Bristol impulse to \u201cgo to the most extreme point we can think of,\u201d which has developed over the past 10-or-so years. \u201cBefore that, Bristol was quite a dark place musically.\u201d The 2010s opened with the confluence of two events. The subversive label Howling Owl arrived, and \u2013 after an argument with a promoter \u2013 was blackballed from holding gigs at any local venues. Their consequent shows in non-venues (crypts, Scout huts, art galleries) not only rewired Bristol\u2019s live circuit and label culture, but drew together a community of previously isolated new artists such as the Naturals, Spectres and Idles. Around this time, a circle of Bristol avant gardists collectivised to form the shadowy and highly productive Young Echo; spawning several labels, a radio show and a vast body of recordings, their sonic and entrepreneurial extremity inspired a new wave of labels, promoters and artists. Having been at their first bedroom transmissions, Wright says Giant Swan are indebted to them for advice and inspiration: \u201cYoung Echo proved you can build this community out of experimentation, or a sense of otherness.\u201d The latest manifestation of this spirit is Avon Terror Corps, a \u201ccrew label\u201d rejecting nostalgic perceptions of \u201cthe Bristol sound\u201d to promote the city\u2019s subversive new music. Ranging from goth duo Fever 103 to \u201ccyborg industrial trap\u201d artists Kinlaw &amp; Franco Franco, this colourful circle\u2019s prime mover is Miles Opland, creator of leftfield dub label Bokeh Versions. Opland is moving flat when I visit him, packing up gig posters, records and memorabilia from his years in Bristol\u2019s music scene. \u201cWhat relics do we have here?\u201d he asks himself with a smile, before pointing to the poster for the first Bokeh Versions night. This featured the live debut of dub producer Sunun, whose work forgoes computers in favour of live vocals and real instrumentation. \u201cThere\u2019s no one doing what she\u2019s doing with a mixing desk,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is a band, for want of a better term.\u201d Opland has an eccentric fondness for spreading misinformation: one poster claims that thrash metallers Napalm Death are appearing, while on that debut show\u2019s anniversary, he put the old posters back up around town. \u201cI wonder if anyone turned up\u2026 \u201d Avon Terror Corps formed as a reaction to the closure of Bristol music hub The Surrey Vaults. \u201cDJ October once told me it\u2019s the closest thing we could have had to CBGBs,\u201d Opland says. When it closed in 2017 at a week\u2019s notice, \u201cwe drank it dry and took any furnishings we could \u2013 that weird pot is from there,\u201d he continues, pointing to an enormous vase behind me. ATC was formed by the \u201cmisfits and weirdos\u201d who coalesced there, and has already produced several critically lauded records. He plays me some new music from the duo Bad Tracking, pairing spoken word with industrial noise played on old cassette machines, and themed around the body\u2019s relationship with technology. Giant Swan\u2019s Robin Stewart claims their devastating live sets, which see their nude vocalist choke himself with a belt, often bring him to tears. Opland baulks at the mention of trip-hop, saying nostalgic media coverage of that scene has obscured the city\u2019s new music. \u201cI know for a fact we\u2019re going through a golden age right now,\u201d he says. \u201cRobin said to me about 18 months ago that something\u2019s happening, or about to happen. I don\u2019t mean we\u2019re about to sell a million records \u2013 I mean we\u2019re about to do all the stuff that\u2019s going to mean something to us when we die,\u201d he says softly, looking at the posters again. \u201cIt\u2019s the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d Another of ATC\u2019s affiliates is Harrga, whose album H\u00e9ro\u00efques Animaux de la Mis\u00e8re channels Bristol\u2019s experimental impulse into urgent political music. Over Miguel Prado\u2019s abstract electronic compositions, Dali De Saint Paul\u2019s multilingual lyrics in French, Darija and more present a harrowing exploration of the refugee crisis. The album has been termed \u2013 she explains in the pool room of The Old England \u2013 \u201ca sonic Guernica.\u201d As in Bad Tracking or Giant Swan, Harrga\u2019s cross-pollination of punk elements with beat-driven electronics has a conceptual foundation. Album-opener Melilla is named after a Spanish autonomous city in Morocco, frequently used by refugees fleeing war zones to access Europe; to do so, they must vault two walls covered in razor wire while evading police patrols. The shouting that opens the song, Prado explains, \u201cis a field recording of the moment they are able to trespass into the city\u201d. The middle sees De Saint Paul repeatedly shout \u201cbosa\u201d (Bambara for victory), which is called out by successful crossers. The end, segueing into a dance-oriented beat, was inspired by trap music made in Andalusia by second-generation Moroccan migrants \u2013 overall, it evokes refugees entering Europe and suffusing it with new art. De Saint Paul recalls her first experience of St Paul\u2019s Carnival here; seeing \u201call these people joining in the streets, dancing to these really loud beats,\u201d she felt an openness she considers foundational to Bristol\u2019s experimental scene. \u201cThese people from Avon Terror Corps or Young Echo are trying to push boundaries, but they share this idea of making music to make people share in the community. If you go to Giant Swan, you can\u2019t stay like this!\u201d she laughs, stiffening her arms by her sides. The weekend we meet also sees the closing-down night at local venue Start the Bus (later Hy Brasil Music Club). Half of Bristol\u2019s music community convenes for a final blowout, spilling into the upstairs offices and throwing feathers from the balcony, presumably left from when those rooms belonged to Howling Owl Records. \u201cThis is really sad,\u201d says Alex Hill of Scalping, having once seen music here as often as four times a week. Among my own memories of the venue is Scalping\u2019s first gig. Gaining attention for their extraordinary shows and acclaimed EP Chamber, they are now set to become Bristol\u2019s next national breakthrough. I visit Scalping at Pirate Studios, where the four-piece are practising for a tour with Mercury-prize nominated Black Midi. The latest example of Bristol\u2019s cross-pollinating impulse, they use the setup of a traditional guitar band to create live techno drawing from post-rock and industrial; flickering in the pitch-black room, a projection screen accompanies their set with Technicolor animations. \u201cThis band wouldn\u2019t exist without Giant Swan,\u201d bassist James Rushforth says, having co-organised the gig where the Giant Swan first used a drum machine and \u201ceverything changed. It was so good that Logos, the main headliner, gave us back his fee.\u201d This family of experimentalists in Bristol is bound by a wild love of extremity, and the inspiration they continually draw from each other. Shrugging off the millstone of trip-hop, they are creating not only the country\u2019s most bewilderingly forward-thinking music, but proof of the strength found in community, one that\u2019s \u201cmore important than your family, where you grew up, where you\u2019re from,\u201d says Opland. \u201cYou can rise above your current situation by seeking the people you can make real change with.\u201d",

The idea came about after she saw the long-distance runner Paula Radcliffe on TV and spotted an opportunity. Oakes was a good runner and thought that, if she got faster, she could end up alongside Radcliffe at the start line of the London marathon, on national television, with the words \u201cVegan Runners\u201d emblazoned across her vest. \u201cIt was a way of showcasing the cause,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d been vegan since I was six years old. I\u2019d lost my kneecap from an illness when I was 17 and been told I would never run again. If I could do this as a vegan, it showed that anything was possible.\u201d Back then she was a lone crusader, trying to introduce people to the word \u201cvegan\u201d in a positive way. \u201cRather than cause disruption and be in people\u2019s faces, by running, I was leading by example and generating interest in a positive way,\u201d she says.

As Kitz tells it, secession was the only cause that matched his growing frustration with the country\u2019s federal government.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a bad relationship with someone that\u2019s just draining you all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one hand they\u2019ll take the money from you and the other hand they want to knock down [our energy industry]. Eventually you\u2019re gonna have to just call it quits.\u201d</p> <p>Years of recession and a tepid energy market have helped fuel a growing separatist movement in Alberta, where a fossil fuel industry which once powered a boom is now dragging the economy into bust.</p> <p>The region \u2013 often dubbed the \u201cTexas of Canada\u201d \u2013 has some of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, but a lack of pipelines has made it exceedingly difficult to move the oil to market.</p> <p>The resulting glut has kept the price of Canadian oil significantly cheaper than other producers, and economists estimate Alberta has shed more than 130,000 energy jobs since 2014. Foreign companies have fled the region.</p> <p>Anger at the ruling Liberals is palpable. In October\u2019s federal election, Trudeau\u2019s party lost all its five seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, even though his government had paid billions to help along a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/canada-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-approved-trudeau\">controversial pipeline project</a>.</p> <p>Liberal policies focused on reducing carbon emissions and economic dependence on the oil industry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/alberta-canada-election-justin-trudeau-oil\">have only added to opposition in the staunchly Conservative region</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/14/canada-oil-production-crisis-suicide-alberta\">The boom, the bust, the darkness: suicide rate soars in wake of Canada's oil crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople feel clobbered. Economic conditions are bad, but at that very point you have governments layering on policies which make the situation worse. That\u2019s why people are directing their anger toward the federal government,\u201d said Amber Ruddy, a political strategist at the conservative lobby group Counsel.</p> <p>In the face of a looming crisis of national unity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/justin-trudeau-cabinet-chrystia-freeland-national-unity-climate-crisis\">Trudeau last week appointed a new </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/justin-trudeau-cabinet-chrystia-freeland-national-unity-climate-crisis\">western advis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/justin-trudeau-cabinet-chrystia-freeland-national-unity-climate-crisis\">er </a>and moved one of his most senior allies \u2013 former foreign minister Chrystia Freeland \u2013 to a new position where she will be in charge of negotiations with provincial governments.</p> <p>But that may not be enough to change opinions in Alberta, where a perception that the federal government is indifferent to the region\u2019s economic pain has given fringe groups a populist rallying cry.</p> <p>Independence remains a minority cause, but there are signs it is gaining momentum.</p> <p>At a recent rally with more than 700 attendees in the city of Edmonton, the leader of the newly formed Wexit party told the crowd he intended to submit 543 signatures to Elections Canada for his movement to be designated a federal party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f1e0e4c96319d2c4d6232a4cbe2800402831f1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f1e0e4c96319d2c4d6232a4cbe2800402831f1f/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wexit party leader, Peter Downing, a former police officer, speaks to a full house in Calgary, Alberta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wexit party leader, Peter Downing, a former police officer, speaks to a full house in Calgary, Alberta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Korol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this eastern Canadian mentality \u2013 a willingness to throw the chains on us,\u201d said party leader Peter Downing, a retired police officer. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s a colonialist mindset and we\u2019ve simply had enough. We\u2019re going to walk away.\u201d</p> <p>Downing, who has previously run as a candidate for the rightwing Christian Heritage party, says his party is inclusive to all. But there is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VestsCanada/status/1192478859612045318\">plentiful evidence</a> of members using racial epithets towards immigrants and Indigenous peoples.</p> <p>And while Downing and others have framed the frustration sweeping the region as a reaction to recent policies, the grievances of the west have deep roots in the region\u2019s past relationship with the rest of Canada.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, the prairie provinces rebelled against Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, prime minister Pierre Trudeau, after he proposed exerting greater federal control over the country\u2019s oilfields as a way of hedging against the influence of Opec \u2013 at the expense of Alberta\u2019s provincial revenues.</p> <p>The policy, known as the National Energy Program, was deeply controversial and eroded any Liberal support in the region.</p> <p>But even further back, westerners saw themselves as bootstrapping settlers whose hard work was frittered away for the benefit of eastern Canada.</p> <p>A notorious 1915 cartoon called the \u201cMilch Cow\u201d depicted farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba working hard to feed a cow, while top-hatted bankers directed her milk into buckets labelled \u201cOttawa\u201d, \u201cToronto\u201d and \u201cMontreal\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f91b168db5e13eb310e170d857615e274db16e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f91b168db5e13eb310e170d857615e274db16e7/0_0_641_516/500.jpg\" alt=\"1915 Cartoon from the Grain Growers Guide\" width=\"500\" height=\"402\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1915 Cartoon from the Grain Growers Guide.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Glenbow Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople need a myth.

But there\u2019s no recognition that part of this is just the sheer, amazing luck of living in a place that is not just beautiful, but endowed with natural resources that are beyond belief,\u201d said Aritha Van Herk, an author and English professor at the university of Calgary. \u201cThat isn\u2019t virtue. It\u2019s a geological accident.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the current frustration is linked to an arcane but increasingly controversial financing system called \u201cequalization\u201d, whereby money collected by the federal government from all provinces is redistributed to those with the most need.</p> <p>Many Albertans, believe that the policy is unfair; Downing characterizes the relationship as one of \u201cexpropriation\u201d.</p> <p>But the popular understanding of equalization in the province \u2013 that it is dragging down Alberta\u2019s economy \u2013 is plain wrong, said Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary.</p> <p>Despite the recession, incomes in Alberta remain higher than anywhere else in Canada and the province has the highest concentration of people earning more than $100,000 a year.</p> <p>\u201cFights over transfers is what Canada is all about.

      "bodyText": "The day after Justin Trudeau won re-election, Larry Kitz \u2013 a farmer in the western province of Alberta \u2013 went online and donated money to a political party with one central goal: separating from Canada. As Kitz tells it, secession was the only cause that matched his growing frustration with the country\u2019s federal government. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bad relationship with someone that\u2019s just draining you all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one hand they\u2019ll take the money from you and the other hand they want to knock down [our energy industry]. Eventually you\u2019re gonna have to just call it quits.\u201d Years of recession and a tepid energy market have helped fuel a growing separatist movement in Alberta, where a fossil fuel industry which once powered a boom is now dragging the economy into bust. The region \u2013 often dubbed the \u201cTexas of Canada\u201d \u2013 has some of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, but a lack of pipelines has made it exceedingly difficult to move the oil to market. The resulting glut has kept the price of Canadian oil significantly cheaper than other producers, and economists estimate Alberta has shed more than 130,000 energy jobs since 2014. Foreign companies have fled the region. Anger at the ruling Liberals is palpable. In October\u2019s federal election, Trudeau\u2019s party lost all its five seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, even though his government had paid billions to help along a controversial pipeline project. Liberal policies focused on reducing carbon emissions and economic dependence on the oil industry, have only added to opposition in the staunchly Conservative region. \u201cPeople feel clobbered. Economic conditions are bad, but at that very point you have governments layering on policies which make the situation worse. That\u2019s why people are directing their anger toward the federal government,\u201d said Amber Ruddy, a political strategist at the conservative lobby group Counsel. In the face of a looming crisis of national unity, Trudeau last week appointed a new western adviser and moved one of his most senior allies \u2013 former foreign minister Chrystia Freeland \u2013 to a new position where she will be in charge of negotiations with provincial governments. But that may not be enough to change opinions in Alberta, where a perception that the federal government is indifferent to the region\u2019s economic pain has given fringe groups a populist rallying cry. Independence remains a minority cause, but there are signs it is gaining momentum. At a recent rally with more than 700 attendees in the city of Edmonton, the leader of the newly formed Wexit party told the crowd he intended to submit 543 signatures to Elections Canada for his movement to be designated a federal party. \u201cThere\u2019s this eastern Canadian mentality \u2013 a willingness to throw the chains on us,\u201d said party leader Peter Downing, a retired police officer. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s a colonialist mindset and we\u2019ve simply had enough. We\u2019re going to walk away.\u201d Downing, who has previously run as a candidate for the rightwing Christian Heritage party, says his party is inclusive to all. But there is plentiful evidence of members using racial epithets towards immigrants and Indigenous peoples. And while Downing and others have framed the frustration sweeping the region as a reaction to recent policies, the grievances of the west have deep roots in the region\u2019s past relationship with the rest of Canada. In the early 1980s, the prairie provinces rebelled against Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, prime minister Pierre Trudeau, after he proposed exerting greater federal control over the country\u2019s oilfields as a way of hedging against the influence of Opec \u2013 at the expense of Alberta\u2019s provincial revenues. The policy, known as the National Energy Program, was deeply controversial and eroded any Liberal support in the region. But even further back, westerners saw themselves as bootstrapping settlers whose hard work was frittered away for the benefit of eastern Canada. A notorious 1915 cartoon called the \u201cMilch Cow\u201d depicted farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba working hard to feed a cow, while top-hatted bankers directed her milk into buckets labelled \u201cOttawa\u201d, \u201cToronto\u201d and \u201cMontreal\u201d. \u201cPeople need a myth. They buy into the mythology of the western \u2018Pull-up-your- socks, we\u2019re mavericks, we can do it\u2019 story. But there\u2019s no recognition that part of this is just the sheer, amazing luck of living in a place that is not just beautiful, but endowed with natural resources that are beyond belief,\u201d said Aritha Van Herk, an author and English professor at the university of Calgary. \u201cThat isn\u2019t virtue. It\u2019s a geological accident.\u201d Much of the current frustration is linked to an arcane but increasingly controversial financing system called \u201cequalization\u201d, whereby money collected by the federal government from all provinces is redistributed to those with the most need. Many Albertans, believe that the policy is unfair; Downing characterizes the relationship as one of \u201cexpropriation\u201d. But the popular understanding of equalization in the province \u2013 that it is dragging down Alberta\u2019s economy \u2013 is plain wrong, said Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary. Despite the recession, incomes in Alberta remain higher than anywhere else in Canada and the province has the highest concentration of people earning more than $100,000 a year. \u201cFights over transfers is what Canada is all about. It\u2019s why Canada exists, said Tombe, noting that feuds date back more than 100 years. The burgeoning separatist cause has found little sympathy in the rest of the country. Many in Atlantic Canada still remember the economic devastation wrought by a government-enforced closure of the cod industry. Ontario, the most populous province, has seen hundreds thousands of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent years. And in British Columbia, a downturn in the forestry industry has shuttered a number of small towns. Geography itself would conspire against an independent Alberta, said Van Herk. \u201cAlberta would be surrounded on four sides. It would be landlocked. It would be surrounded by foreign nations. And in five and a half minutes we\u2019d be annexed by Montana,\u201d she said. Van Herk sees the secessionist platform as a show of political opportunism by a small minority, but she remains optimistic that a renewed discussion on fairness across the country can mend the growing rift. \u201cThis cleavage is part of the discourse of a really big country \u2013 one that needs to talk a lot in order to stay together,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the best parts of Canada is that it stays together as a virtual act of imagination, tied with binder twine and duct tape.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Many cities across the US face significant challenges \u2013 places like Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Cleveland are among them. Much has been written about how these former economic powerhouses have struggled over the last few decades. But this week we want to tell a different story. We want to highlight the remarkable people and groups (many of them not-for-profits and social enterprises) working on inspiring projects that show the resilience of those wanting to improve the lives of people in one of those cities, Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland has many challenges \u2013 inequality, a deeply segregated city, black infant mortality, shamefully untreated lead poisoning that mostly affects brown and black communities\u2013 but it also has a network of people creating innovative projects that are addressing these challenges with significant success. We will be telling their stories over the next week in the first installment of our City Champions series. We have collaborated with the local newspaper \u2013 the Plain Dealer \u2013 and the local PBS station, ideastream. All of three news organisations canvassed residents for their suggestions as to who should be recognised as Cleveland\u2019s champions. We received hundreds and hundreds of replies. Helped by an advisory panel of mostly local public figures, we selected the final 25 champions. You can see a full list of the below; they include groups using art as a form of activism for the city\u2019s youth, doulas supporting women to reduce the shocking rates of black infant mortality, the restaurant giving ex-offenders second chance, and the urban farmers creating a green oasis in what was a food desert in a blighted part of the city. As part of this project we have also worked with the art collective For Freedoms to create a public art expression for this project. Working with For Freedoms and local artists we commissioned artwork for six billboards that help tell the stories of the city and the challenges these champions are addressing. Cleveland is not perfect. It has failed many of its residents. They deserve better. But visiting Cleveland and meeting many of these people over the last few months has been inspirational and moving. Seeing the impact these people \u2013 our City Champions \u2013 are having on the lives of those around them has been remarkable. We hope these stories inspire our readers too. Birthing Beautiful Communities Across the US, black babies are twice as likely to die before reaching their first birthday as white babies and in Cleveland they are more than three times as likely to die \u2013 a situation that the Ohio city\u2019s doula collective, Birthing Beautiful Communities, is determined to change. The collective, founded in 2014 by Christin Farmer, provides culturally sensitive education, advocacy and emotional support for women during pregnancy and up to a year after birth. Shooting Without Bullets \u201cI go to sleep to gunshots. But that doesn\u2019t stop me from being successful\u201d says Lai Lai Bonner, 19, who is one of the young creatives being mentored by the art collective Shooting Without Bullets, whose founder Amanda King says: \u201cBlack youth have historically shaped culture and art, they just haven\u2019t gotten the credit for it.\u201d Edwins Leadership and Restaurant Institute Chef Brandon Chrostowski knows the power of getting a second chance after getting into trouble himself with the police as a young man \u2013 and now his restaurant training institute takes in 40 ex-offenders every two months and gives them a springboard to a job in the industry, and a path away from reoffending, which they virtually all seize. Dont\u00e9 Gibbs Gibbs and his volunteers have surprised 1,536 families with gifts and gift cards at Christmas in East Cleveland, Ohio\u2019s poorest city, between 2013 and 2018, and hope to expand the effort to provide school supplies and clothes. Rid-All The urban farming group has transformed a desolate illegal dumping ground in Cleveland into a lush, eight-acre agricultural innovation site and spawned not-for-profit and business spin-offs, including a commercial fish farm and vegan catering and beekeeping. Rust Belt Riders In Cleveland, like most of the US, there is no government composting service. Rust Belt Riders is a local food-waste collection company that began in 2014 as two guys on their bikes collecting and composting food and now collects 50,000 pounds of food waste weekly from 150 schools, restaurants and grocery stores and homes. Archie Green Rapper Archie Green\u2019s mental health initiative uses hip-hop to destigmatize mental illness and provide a \u201ccoping mechanism toolkit\u201d, with a special focus on those in the black community. Through events that incorporate hip-hop performance, discussion groups and panels with pastors, artists and health professionals, Green has carved out an unlikely haven for those grappling with mental illness. Refugee Response Refugee Response creates programs to address the needs of the 2,500 refugees who have settled in Cleveland since 2008. The offerings include in-home tutoring, work on one of the largest urban farms in the country and a program for high school students. Urban Community School For the past 51 years, the Urban Community School on Cleveland\u2019s Near West Side has offered an ecumenical education for preschool through eighth-grade students living in low-income neighborhoods. Its 578 students from eight surrounding neighborhoods represent a diversity of races and ethnicities. Most students pay just $110 per year, representing only 3% of the nearly $7m annual budget revenue. Will Sanchez Will Sanchez of La Cosecha Galleria has weathered nearly two years behind bars and a few other hardships. Among his early transgressions was trying to rob a store in the Stockyard neighborhood. That store is now the location of his art gallery, which has been closed since a storm last July. But he hopes to reopen later this month with a series of holiday markets and eventually open a store down the block. Twelve Literary Arts Twelve Literary Arts is an intergenerational teaching, learning and professional development organisation for poets, writers and performance artists who seek a safe space to write in the middle of Cleveland\u2019s inner city. Is programs include after-school spoken word open mics. Kim Foreman Public health campaigner Kim Foreman, of the city\u2019s Environmental Health Watch, has helped drive the creation of historic anti-lead poisoning legislation in the Ohio city earlier this year. And she has long been among those who have campaigned to better protect children at risk of ingesting lead from old paint either peeling or flaking or turning to dust, which is a particular issue in older rental homes in deprived communities. Ricardo Leon Ricardo Leon, 27, grew up on Cleveland\u2019s West Side thinking his goal was to leave it. Now he is helping transform neighborhoods there in his role at Metro West Community Development. After helping convert some 30 abandoned homes into residences, he\u2019s engaged in several projects including affordable housing efforts. Renee Jones For 17 years, long before human trafficking in Ohio became a topic on billboards, Renee Jones fought human trafficking on two fronts: Educating communities about the problem and helping women get out of the forced sex trade. Erika Anthony If a group doesn\u2019t exist to address a problem, Erika Anthony, of Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, helps create one, like she did as co-founder of Cleveland Votes in 2014, and multiple community development corporations that span the city. Hazel Remesch Hazel Remesch leads an alliance that has been successful in making it easier for Cleveland tenants to seal eviction records, and in getting the city to adopt legislation that gives tenants in eviction cases the right to legal representation LeJean Ray Ray is director of the Fatima Center in Cleveland\u2019s Hough neighborhood, where children enjoy summer day camp, teens come for leadership training, social activities and, during spring break, visits to college campuses. Ray also fosters a positive relationship between teens and police. Making Our Own Space Making Our Own Space introduces kids from low-income, minority middle and high school students to the design professions and processes that shape cities \u2013 and shows them how urban design affects their lives, and might even influence career paths they take. My Com P-16 Slavic Village P-16 Council (for preschool, 12 years of school and four of college) has a simple goal: to help students learn more and build better lives. Rhonda Crowder Rhonda Crowder of Hough Reads is helping foster of love of reading in the Cleveland neighborhood that has a high illiteracy rate among adults. Tim Tramble Cleveland leaders call the Burten Bell Carr neighborhood development director, Tim Tramble, \u201cone of the most under-sung but influential people in the city\u2019\u2019 and \u201ca star of community development\u2019\u2019 because of his creative ability to solve problems. Vel Scott Vel Scott, a former Cleveland restaurateur, has been proving to skeptical Clevelanders that they can cook great meals with less meat, less salt and more fresh vegetables. Scott\u2019s forays into cooking plant-based meals began when her husband, Don, was diagnosed with hypertension. She learned to cook for him and got a new career \u2013 teaching people how to cook healthy. She has two not-for-profits, Vel Scott\u2019s Healthy You Program and the Purple Oasis community garden, fueled by the belief that good food is the best medicine. Stephanie Morrison Hrbek Morrison Hrbek, 65, founded the Near West Theatre with a $800 grant in 1978 and has overseen its growth into a vibrant community hub now operating from a $7.3m building in the Gordon Square Arts District that she helped create. West Side Catholic Center Serving more than 7,000 needy people each year, West Side Catholic Center feeds and clothes its clients and also offers a shelter for women and families, workforce development, help in finding housing and efforts to help people overcome the trauma that comes with being poor. Damien Ware Cleveland\u2019s Buckeye neighborhood is well-acquainted with the words of poet Damien Ware, whose prose is painted in bright colors on buildings and embossed in the ground at the base of a statue of a water tower, a monument to the fresh water in nearby Lake Erie that replenishes the neighborhood. He is busy with a day job as a social worker with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he manages to find time to teaching poetry workshops across Cleveland, particularly in areas that struggle to prioritize the literary arts.

      "bodyText": "Rachel is a college-educated professional pianist who lives in a middle-class leafy Cleveland suburb with her husband and their baby boy. The 34-year-old is fit and healthy with good medical insurance and a close-knit family network, but these socio-economic advantages were not sufficient insurance to insulate her from the racial disparities that characterise America\u2019s infant and maternal mortality rates: African American babies are twice as likely to die before reaching their first birthday than white babies, regardless of the mother\u2019s income or education level. A report earlier this year from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that over 22,000 babies died before their first birthday in 2017. But the racial disparities tell their own story: black women\u2019s babies died at a rate of 10.97 per 1,000 births \u2013 more than twice the rate for white, Asian or Hispanic women. And in Ohio \u2013 home to Cleveland \u2013 the situation is even worse: the mortality rate for black infants ( 15.1 per 1,000) was around three times as high as the rate for white infants. Black women are also three to four times more likely to die in childbirth in America than white women, again regardless of their socio-economic status. It\u2019s this terrifying reality that persuaded Rachel, who suffered a miscarriage before becoming pregnant with her son last year, that she needed an African American doula by her side during the pregnancy, delivery and after the birth. \u201cI was scared \u2026 I wanted someone who understood my history as a black woman to be with me during the birth and advocate for me in the hospital system where we are dismissed and not heard,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cEven Serena [Williams] was dismissed.\u201d (After giving birth in 2017, medical staff initially dismissed the tennis star\u2019s concerns about life threatening blood clots, a condition which almost killed her in 2011.) Rachel eventually came across Birthing Beautiful Communities (BBC) \u2013 a Cleveland-based African American doula collective that provides culturally sensitive education, advocacy and emotional support for women during pregnancy and up to a year after birth. The not-for-profit group was founded in 2014 by Christin Farmer, a straight-talking community organiser with an entrepreneurial spirit. \u201cThe American infant mortality crisis is driven by black babies dying. It\u2019s about systemic racism and the lack of power sharing,\u201d said Farmer, 34. \u201cWe have to take things in our own hands at the grassroots level because we cannot depend on the same people that enslaved and repressed us to save us.\u201d \u2018Black babies account for a third of births, but three-quarters of infant deaths\u2019 Farmer set up BBC to tackle longstanding birth inequalities by training local black women to provide holistic attention to pregnant women in their own communities. Birthing Beautiful Communities is among 25 inspirational people and organizations that the Guardian is highlighting as part of a week-long City Champions project in Cleveland. It is designed to showcase the upsides in a city like Cleveland where grassroots activists faced with endemic problems \u2013 like lead poisoning, infant mortality and gun violence \u2013 and few or no state solutions, are taking the initiative and helping to change lives in some of the city\u2019s most marginalised communities. Cleveland is the capital of Cuyahoga county located on the shore of Lake Erie in north-east Ohio, a former urban powerhouse which has suffered decades of economic decline and widespread racial inequalities. It is one of the most segregated cities in the US, a fact which directly influences the allocation of public resources for housing, health, education, infrastructure, crime prevention, parks and environmental hazards. Back in 1850, when the US first started collecting infant mortality statistics, the black infant mortality rate was 340 per 1,000 while the white infant mortality rate was 217 per 1,000. While deaths have fallen overall thanks to improvements in hygiene, nutrition and healthcare, the black-white disparity has grown. The situation in Cuyahoga county is shocking: last year African Americans accounted for just over a third of births, but three-quarters of infant deaths. This year looks set to be the worst since 2015, with black babies dying 3.8 times more frequently than white babies, according to preliminary figures. \u201cEverytime I hear these numbers something inside me dies,\u201d said Margaret Mitchell, president of YWCA Cleveland. \u201cWe have suppressed the truth for too long; this is not about race, it\u2019s about racism.\u201d Community leaders and health experts in Cleveland are pushing city officials to declare racism a public health crisis. At a recent city event, 400 years of Inequity: A Call to Action, some of the country\u2019s leading racial justice researchers argued that racism \u2013 historical and contemporary \u2013 contributes to widespread health inequalities for African Americans including infant and maternal mortality. Infant and maternal health specialist, Dr. Arthur James, of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, said: \u201c85% of the African American experience has been defined by slavery and Jim Crow yet we never talk about the role of history in today\u2019s racial inequalities in gun crime, addictions, mass incarceration and infant mortality. \u201cAdvantage and disadvantage accumulates over time, it\u2019s time to change the narrative and shift the direction of public policy towards social determinants and achieving equity. Declaring racism as a public health crisis could change this dynamic.\u201d Milwaukee, Wisconsin, declared racism a public health crisis earlier this year. \u2018Black babies and black mothers are dying\u2019 BBC is located in a cozy converted house in Hough, one of the city\u2019s most marginalized neighborhoods, where women attend classes on breastfeeding, baby bonding and healthy eating in the open-plan lounge. (In 1966 the economically depressed and predominantly African-American neighborhood of Hough was the site of four days of rioting sparked after a black man was denied a glass of water at the white-owned Seventy-Niners Cafe at Hough Ave. The National Guard ordered in and, four days later, four people had been killed.) The women coming to BBC can also access legal assistance, education, art therapy and entrepreneurial opportunities. In the past five years, they have trained almost 30 \u201csuper doulas\u201d who have worked with more than 600 women. Creating jobs and reducing infant deaths marries Farmer\u2019s two passions: community wealth-building and health equalities. \u201cI\u2019m unapologetic about ensuring African Americans get opportunities first. We need space to focus on our community issues because as a culture we have so much healing to do,\u201d said Farmer. Doula Marlene Morris, 38, has supported 27 mothers through childbirth this year and witnessed countless examples of casual racism in hospitals such as assuming the woman\u2019s partner is nothing more than a \u201cbaby daddy\u201d. \u201cThere are some awesome midwives, nurses and doctors, but too many assume that black women are angry, on Medicaid, and don\u2019t have a birth plan, and can tolerate more pain.\u201d Research by the University of Virginia in 2016 found that a substantial proportion of white medical students and residents falsely believe black people have less-sensitive nerve endings, and that black skin is thicker than white. \u201cBlack babies and black mothers are dying \u2026 women come to us because they are scared,\u201d added Morris. To qualify for BBC help, there are some non-negotiable rules: smokers must stop smoking (which may contribute to their good outcomes), and are obligated to take anxiety management classes, known as Sisters Offering Support (SOS). Why? Toxic stress. In the first few months of BBC, Farmer noticed an odd phenomenon among pregnant women coping with tough situations such as domestic violence, poverty, homelessness and family incarceration \u2013 they consistently denied feeling stressed. To find out why, Farmer approached Angela Neal, a professor, clinical psychologist and director of the Program for Research on Anxiety Disorders among African Americans at Kent State University. The findings show a link between the extent of racism a woman has experienced and low cortisol levels \u2013 which is associated with anxiety and PTSD. \u201cThe cause of toxic stress is American racism, and that is the principal social determinant of infant mortality disparity,\u201d added Neal. \u201cPart of the solution to infant mortality is making sure emotional care is part of antenatal care.\u201d Farmer added: \u201cBlack women have been normalizing and internalizing stress and trauma for so long \u2026 this is a big deal in prematurity which is killing our babies.\u201d Toxic stress contributes to conditions like hypertension and pre-eclampsia, which increase the risk of premature birth and its complications -\u2013 the largest contributors to infant death globally.

      "bodyText": "Madonna has been accused of failing to credit and pay a songwriter on her 2019 album Madame X. Casey Spooner, a member of the recently disbanded electronic pop group Fischerspooner, wrote on Instagram that he was co-writer of the track God Control. \u201cI have had enough \u2026 I\u2019ve gotten no credit and no compensation \u2026 while you\u2019re galavanting around on stage I\u2019m completely broke in Berlin. Robbed, ignored and delayed.\u201d Spooner said he had been offered first $10,000, then $25,000 as an advance against future publishing royalties, but argued he should instead be paid \u201c1% of touring profits \u2026 There is no money in record sales. Period. Not even for Madonna.\u201d In a later Instagram post, he said: \u201cThey are trying to intimidate me \u2026 it\u2019s not easy fighting giants.\u201d Spooner says he worked with God Control producer Mirwais in 2017, for the latter\u2019s solo album, which was later shelved. Elements of their work together later appeared in the Madonna track without his knowledge. He posted a demo version of God Control that he worked on, which features the same lyrics and melody as the Madonna track. Madonna has not commented on the accusations. The Guardian has requested comment via her UK representatives. God Control, a dance-pop track that confronts gun control in the US, has already provoked controversy. Its violent music video depicted an attack similar to the one on Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub in June 2016 that left 49 people dead, and was criticised as \u201chorrible\u201d by Parkland shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez.",

The protests will coincide with a holiday travel season projected to set a record for the number of passengers flying as the Transportation Security Agency estimates more than 26.8 million passengers will travel through security screening checkpoints between 22 November to 2 December 2019.

      "body": "<p>After the Patriots eked out a low-scoring win against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11, Tom Brady looked like he had just attended a funeral. He sullenly expressed frustration with his offense, a sentiment he continued on his weekly radio show the following day. Former Patriot and current Fox Sports guest analyst Rob Gronkowski offered an honest assessment of Brady\u2019s intensity. \u201cHe\u2019s so frustrated, too. It\u2019s like, \u2018Yo, you guys are 9-1.\u2019 That\u2019s one part I don\u2019t miss about being there \u2026 I\u2019m not going to lie. I don\u2019t miss that,\u201d Gronkowski said Sunday on the Fox pregame show.</p> <p>New England narrowly won once again Sunday 13-9, this time against the Dallas Cowboys who entered Foxboro as the NFL\u2019s top offense. The Patriots defense was its typical smothering self, containing Ezekiel Elliott and keeping the Cowboys out of the end zone all day. The Cowboys\u2019 top wideout Amari Cooper was held without a catch thanks to unshakable coverage from Pats corner Stephon Gilmore. As for the Patriots\u2019 offense, well, they scored just 13 points. In fact, since Week 6, the Pats have scored fewer points each week than the week before. Against Dallas, Brady threw for 191 yards and a score, decent numbers for some quarterbacks but below expectations for this one. </p> <p>No one would have been surprised if Brady waltzed into Sunday\u2019s postgame presser with the same grimace he wore last week. But this time Brady was a different man. He was relaxed, had nothing negative to say about the offense, and relished his 17<sup>th</sup> consecutive 10-win season. \u201cIt\u2019s a great win. They\u2019re a good football team and I\u2019m happy we came away with more points than them,\u201d Brady said.</p> <p>When asked about rookie wideouts N\u2019Keal Harry and Jakobi Meyers, who each showcased growing chemistry with their quarterback but also had drops, Brady continues his positivity. \u201cProud of those two. They put a lot of effort in and made improvements. It was great to see.\u201d</p> <p>Could Brady finally be accepting his new reality? The fact is he\u2019s operating without two experienced wideouts in Phillip Dorsett and Mohamed Sanu and a top-flight tight end (it\u2019s unlikely but Gronkowski has until next Saturday to apply for reinstatement to be eligible for the playoffs.). Sony Michel had a healthy 85 yards on the ground but the run game hasn\u2019t exactly been unstoppable, and there\u2019s the reality that Brady is 42. If the Antonio Brown experiment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/22/antonio-brown-quits-nfl-robert-kraft-ben-roethlisberger\">hadn\u2019t been an unmitigated disaster</a> we might be viewing the offense through a different lens. But Brady can only deal with the cards he has been dealt. It appears he\u2019s starting to realize this.</p> <p>The transition for Brady from central figure of the Patriots to one of many key pieces is strange. It\u2019s strange for fans and media, so it must be extra strange for Brady. For 20 years Brady has not only been the face of this franchise, but the face of the NFL. He still is to an extent but we\u2019re deep enough into the season to realize the shift in this franchise is undeniable. Brady is no longer the primary reason to tune into a Patriots game. There is a plausible reality in which Bill Belichick continues as the grizzled, hooded coach of this team in a post-Brady era. They won\u2019t be as successful because that\u2019s impossible but they will be competitive.</p> <p>In the coming weeks Brady\u2019s receiving corps will become more robust and Brady\u2019s smarts, work ethic and experience will be invaluable in the playoffs, especially at Foxboro. Yes, they are going to need to produce more than 13 points a game to win a fourth Super Bowl in six years, especially as the road may include offensive powerhouses like the Chiefs or Ravens. But how long the Patriots play this postseason is likely to be determined by the defense. If Sunday was any indication, Brady appears at peace with his offense\u2019s new place in the Patriots\u2019 hierarchy. As long he sees incremental progress, of course.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56283b3b7233454ee50d60fa814f7c2c7e5aaad3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56283b3b7233454ee50d60fa814f7c2c7e5aaad3/0_209_3541_2125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Gore is now the NFL\u2019s third all-time leading rusher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Gore is now the NFL\u2019s third all-time leading rusher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Munson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>15,289. </strong>Ageless wonder Frank Gore unquestionably reserved his place in the Hall of Fame Sunday after passing Barry Sanders to move into third on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing list.

      "bodyText": "After the Patriots eked out a low-scoring win against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11, Tom Brady looked like he had just attended a funeral. He sullenly expressed frustration with his offense, a sentiment he continued on his weekly radio show the following day. Former Patriot and current Fox Sports guest analyst Rob Gronkowski offered an honest assessment of Brady\u2019s intensity. \u201cHe\u2019s so frustrated, too. It\u2019s like, \u2018Yo, you guys are 9-1.\u2019 That\u2019s one part I don\u2019t miss about being there \u2026 I\u2019m not going to lie. I don\u2019t miss that,\u201d Gronkowski said Sunday on the Fox pregame show. New England narrowly won once again Sunday 13-9, this time against the Dallas Cowboys who entered Foxboro as the NFL\u2019s top offense. The Patriots defense was its typical smothering self, containing Ezekiel Elliott and keeping the Cowboys out of the end zone all day. The Cowboys\u2019 top wideout Amari Cooper was held without a catch thanks to unshakable coverage from Pats corner Stephon Gilmore. As for the Patriots\u2019 offense, well, they scored just 13 points. In fact, since Week 6, the Pats have scored fewer points each week than the week before. Against Dallas, Brady threw for 191 yards and a score, decent numbers for some quarterbacks but below expectations for this one. No one would have been surprised if Brady waltzed into Sunday\u2019s postgame presser with the same grimace he wore last week. But this time Brady was a different man. He was relaxed, had nothing negative to say about the offense, and relished his 17th consecutive 10-win season. \u201cIt\u2019s a great win. They\u2019re a good football team and I\u2019m happy we came away with more points than them,\u201d Brady said. When asked about rookie wideouts N\u2019Keal Harry and Jakobi Meyers, who each showcased growing chemistry with their quarterback but also had drops, Brady continues his positivity. \u201cProud of those two. They put a lot of effort in and made improvements. It was great to see.\u201d Could Brady finally be accepting his new reality? The fact is he\u2019s operating without two experienced wideouts in Phillip Dorsett and Mohamed Sanu and a top-flight tight end (it\u2019s unlikely but Gronkowski has until next Saturday to apply for reinstatement to be eligible for the playoffs.). Sony Michel had a healthy 85 yards on the ground but the run game hasn\u2019t exactly been unstoppable, and there\u2019s the reality that Brady is 42. If the Antonio Brown experiment hadn\u2019t been an unmitigated disaster we might be viewing the offense through a different lens. But Brady can only deal with the cards he has been dealt. It appears he\u2019s starting to realize this. The transition for Brady from central figure of the Patriots to one of many key pieces is strange. It\u2019s strange for fans and media, so it must be extra strange for Brady. For 20 years Brady has not only been the face of this franchise, but the face of the NFL. He still is to an extent but we\u2019re deep enough into the season to realize the shift in this franchise is undeniable. Brady is no longer the primary reason to tune into a Patriots game. There is a plausible reality in which Bill Belichick continues as the grizzled, hooded coach of this team in a post-Brady era. They won\u2019t be as successful because that\u2019s impossible but they will be competitive. In the coming weeks Brady\u2019s receiving corps will become more robust and Brady\u2019s smarts, work ethic and experience will be invaluable in the playoffs, especially at Foxboro. Yes, they are going to need to produce more than 13 points a game to win a fourth Super Bowl in six years, especially as the road may include offensive powerhouses like the Chiefs or Ravens. But how long the Patriots play this postseason is likely to be determined by the defense. If Sunday was any indication, Brady appears at peace with his offense\u2019s new place in the Patriots\u2019 hierarchy. As long he sees incremental progress, of course. Stat of the week 15,289. Ageless wonder Frank Gore unquestionably reserved his place in the Hall of Fame Sunday after passing Barry Sanders to move into third on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing list. The 36-year-old entered the day 45 yards behind Sanders but etched his place in history with 9:28 left in the Bills\u2019 shellacking of the Broncos. Gore has never been splashy like Sanders or Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton, who occupy the top two spots; his career is a testament to longevity, health, and work ethic. Incredibly, Gore now in his 15th season has missed just two games since 2010. MVP of the week Drew Brees, QB, New Orleans Saints. It wasn\u2019t the prettiest win for Brees and the Saints but they all count the same. The Panthers missed a field goal that would have given them a late lead, and that\u2019s when Mr Clutch put on his cape and led the Saints to a field goal to secure the win as time expired. Brees\u2019s game-winning drive, the 50th of his career, now has the Saints at 9-2 in a tight battle for the NFC\u2019s top seed. Quote of the week \u201cHow do miss the last snap of a game because ur taking selfies. That\u2019s unprofessional &amp; wrong.\u201d \u2013 Joe Theismann on Twitter. The former Washington quarterback is referring to current starting quarterback Dwayne Haskins missing the final play of his first career victory because he was taking selfies with fans. Apparently Haskins didn\u2019t realize Lions quarterback Jeff Driskel threw a pick on his final drive and that the rookie would be needed again. When asked about his absence, Haskins told reporters, \u201cI was so hype. I broke a water bottle. But I\u2019ll get it next time.\u201d Weirdness in Washington, even in victory. Video of the week Classless display by these Browns fans who spent their tailgate mimicking Myles Garrett\u2019s boneheaded decision to remove his helmet and take a swing at Steelers QB Mason Rudolph in Week 11. Garrett\u2019s shocking lapse of judgement resulted in a season-long suspension, a decision which was upheld after Garrett appealed last week. Garrett insinuated that Rudolph incited the melee by calling him a racial slur but the NFL found no such evidence.

It's time for that to end'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A student of civil engineering and freestyle rapper, Veloz, 26, was born in Ecuador, but had moved to Chile with his mother when he was nine. He told his family that he was going to protest so that his daughter Maite, five, could grow up in a fairer society.</p> <p>But as the crowd neared the city\u2019s bus station, Veloz was struck by a soldier\u2019s bullet, and according witnesses, never regained consciousness. He was pronounced dead that evening. Two other protesters were also injured that afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cAn hour after he left home, a message came through on a WhatsApp group saying that they had just killed an Ecuadorian and I knew that it was my son,\u201d said his mother, Mery Cortez.</p> <p>Soon after the unrest began, Chile\u2019s President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era deployed troops and militarized police, declaring that the country was \u201cat war with a powerful and uncompromising enemy\u201d. </p> <p>More than a month later, the country\u2019s security forces have been accused of a catalogue of serious human rights abuses against protesters, including torture, sexual violence and extrajudicial executions.</p> <p>The turmoil has left at least 23 dead and 7,000 detained. Chile\u2019s human rights institute (INDH) reported that more than 2,300 have been injured \u2013 more than 1,400 of whom sustained gunshot wounds.</p> <p>The INDH is compiling 384 legal cases against the police and armed forces, including six cases of homicide.</p> <p>Meanwhile, more than 200 people have suffered eye injuries from shotgun pellets, teargas canisters and non-lethal ammunition. </p> <p>Outbreaks of vandalism and arson have left shops and buildings in ruins, and more than 1,700 police officers have been injured.</p> <p>But so high is the toll among protestors that human rights observers conclude the carnage is the result of a deliberate strategy, said Claudio Nash, an assistant professor in the University of Chile\u2019s department of international law. \u201cThese are not isolated cases, and it can all be interpreted as a mesh of serious, widespread and systematic violations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, Amnesty International accused officers of carrying out attacks with \u201cunnecessary and excessive force with the intention of injuring and punishing protesters\u201d. (Chile\u2019s defense minister Alberto Espina rejected the findings as \u201cextraordinarily serious and absolutely false\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52e4a1531b18679f958fbae05c8a67984bf9fa31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e4a1531b18679f958fbae05c8a67984bf9fa31/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mery Cort\u00e9z and Eric Villalobos, whose son Romario Veloz was shot dead by Chilean troops during recent protests in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mery Cortez and Eric Villalobos, whose son Romario Veloz was shot dead by Chilean troops during recent protests in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Bartlett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Romario Veloz\u2019s family is still trying to find out exactly what happened. Although she has lived in the country for 17 years, and was married to a Chilean, Cortez says that she has not heard anything from the country\u2019s authorities.</p> <p>\u201cNobody has called me to explain the situation, to apologise, to see how we are or how [Romario\u2019s] daughter is. Nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for social media, I would never have found out what happened to my son.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the military said its troops had acted in self-defence after a large group of people approached an army unit, \u201csurrounding and attacking them with different objects and weapons\u201d. The statement contained no more detail and misspelled Veloz\u2019s surname.</p> <p>Witnesses dispute that official version. Ulises Cort\u00e9s, a 19-year-old student from nearby Coquimbo, was standing beside Veloz when he was hit.</p> <p>\u201cThe march was very peaceful, but when we approached a mall some soldiers appeared,\u201d he said, \u201cSome protesters began to insult them and they suddenly knelt and aimed their guns at us.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the first shots rang out people started throwing stones. More gunfire followed \u2013 and that\u2019s when Romario was hit. We must have been more than 100 metres away, so we couldn\u2019t have hurt or threatened them.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Soto, a 56-year-old neurologist who was in the crowd, rushed to administer CPR.</p> <p>\u201cHe never regained consciousness as we treated him, and suddenly a hail of bullets tore over our heads and we threw ourselves to the ground. All of this took place in a peaceful march,\u201d Soto said.</p> <p>Cortez was not allowed to see her son\u2019s body until the following day. \u201cThey returned his bag to me, but when I finally brought myself to look inside the clothes weren\u2019t even his.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never got his watch back nor the chain he always wore around his neck, and his phone was handed to me without a SIM card. There was nothing on it \u2013 it had been completely reset,\u201d said Cortez.</p> <p>Pi\u00f1era ordered the military back to their barracks a week after Veloz\u2019s death, but Chile\u2019s <em>carabineros</em> police force remains on the streets \u2013 even though it too faces a string of abuse accusations.</p> <p>The INDH has tallied 220 cases of severe eye trauma, and scores of people have been injured or blinded by non-lethal projectiles. Amnesty investigators found that police officers have fired \u201cpotentially lethal ammunition in an unjustified, widespread and indiscriminate manner and in many cases aiming at people\u2019s heads\u201d.</p> <p>The carabineros have insisted that the non-lethal projectiles used in crowd control are made of rubber, citing the supplier\u2019s technical specifications and an analysis carried out by its own forensics laboratory.</p> <p>But a University of Chile laboratory study concluded that some are only 20% rubber, with the rest made up of barium sulphate, silica and lead.</p> <p>Gen Enrique Bassaletti of the carbineros gave a radio interview on Friday in which he likened the use of shotguns to chemotherapy, saying that \u201cthey kill some good cells and some bad ones\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this month, President Pi\u00f1era admitted that there had been \u201csome\u201d excessive use of force and promised that there would be \u201cno impunity\u201d for officers found responsible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Romario Veloz and his daughter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "Hastily cramming spare clothes into his rucksack, Romario Veloz left his mother\u2019s home in the Chilean beach city of La Serena on the afternoon of 20 October to attend his first ever protest. Days earlier, the first sparks of what would become a firestorm of unrest had broken out in the South American country, as thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against political exclusion and economic inequality. A student of civil engineering and freestyle rapper, Veloz, 26, was born in Ecuador, but had moved to Chile with his mother when he was nine. He told his family that he was going to protest so that his daughter Maite, five, could grow up in a fairer society. But as the crowd neared the city\u2019s bus station, Veloz was struck by a soldier\u2019s bullet, and according witnesses, never regained consciousness. He was pronounced dead that evening. Two other protesters were also injured that afternoon. \u201cAn hour after he left home, a message came through on a WhatsApp group saying that they had just killed an Ecuadorian and I knew that it was my son,\u201d said his mother, Mery Cortez. Soon after the unrest began, Chile\u2019s President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era deployed troops and militarized police, declaring that the country was \u201cat war with a powerful and uncompromising enemy\u201d. More than a month later, the country\u2019s security forces have been accused of a catalogue of serious human rights abuses against protesters, including torture, sexual violence and extrajudicial executions. The turmoil has left at least 23 dead and 7,000 detained. Chile\u2019s human rights institute (INDH) reported that more than 2,300 have been injured \u2013 more than 1,400 of whom sustained gunshot wounds. The INDH is compiling 384 legal cases against the police and armed forces, including six cases of homicide. Meanwhile, more than 200 people have suffered eye injuries from shotgun pellets, teargas canisters and non-lethal ammunition. Outbreaks of vandalism and arson have left shops and buildings in ruins, and more than 1,700 police officers have been injured. But so high is the toll among protestors that human rights observers conclude the carnage is the result of a deliberate strategy, said Claudio Nash, an assistant professor in the University of Chile\u2019s department of international law. \u201cThese are not isolated cases, and it can all be interpreted as a mesh of serious, widespread and systematic violations,\u201d he said. On Thursday, Amnesty International accused officers of carrying out attacks with \u201cunnecessary and excessive force with the intention of injuring and punishing protesters\u201d. (Chile\u2019s defense minister Alberto Espina rejected the findings as \u201cextraordinarily serious and absolutely false\u201d. Meanwhile, Romario Veloz\u2019s family is still trying to find out exactly what happened. Although she has lived in the country for 17 years, and was married to a Chilean, Cortez says that she has not heard anything from the country\u2019s authorities. \u201cNobody has called me to explain the situation, to apologise, to see how we are or how [Romario\u2019s] daughter is. Nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for social media, I would never have found out what happened to my son.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, the military said its troops had acted in self-defence after a large group of people approached an army unit, \u201csurrounding and attacking them with different objects and weapons\u201d. The statement contained no more detail and misspelled Veloz\u2019s surname. Witnesses dispute that official version. Ulises Cort\u00e9s, a 19-year-old student from nearby Coquimbo, was standing beside Veloz when he was hit. \u201cThe march was very peaceful, but when we approached a mall some soldiers appeared,\u201d he said, \u201cSome protesters began to insult them and they suddenly knelt and aimed their guns at us. \u201cAfter the first shots rang out people started throwing stones. More gunfire followed \u2013 and that\u2019s when Romario was hit. We must have been more than 100 metres away, so we couldn\u2019t have hurt or threatened them.\u201d Carlos Soto, a 56-year-old neurologist who was in the crowd, rushed to administer CPR. \u201cHe never regained consciousness as we treated him, and suddenly a hail of bullets tore over our heads and we threw ourselves to the ground. All of this took place in a peaceful march,\u201d Soto said. Cortez was not allowed to see her son\u2019s body until the following day. \u201cThey returned his bag to me, but when I finally brought myself to look inside the clothes weren\u2019t even his.\u201d \u201cI never got his watch back nor the chain he always wore around his neck, and his phone was handed to me without a SIM card. There was nothing on it \u2013 it had been completely reset,\u201d said Cortez. Pi\u00f1era ordered the military back to their barracks a week after Veloz\u2019s death, but Chile\u2019s carabineros police force remains on the streets \u2013 even though it too faces a string of abuse accusations. The INDH has tallied 220 cases of severe eye trauma, and scores of people have been injured or blinded by non-lethal projectiles. Amnesty investigators found that police officers have fired \u201cpotentially lethal ammunition in an unjustified, widespread and indiscriminate manner and in many cases aiming at people\u2019s heads\u201d. The carabineros have insisted that the non-lethal projectiles used in crowd control are made of rubber, citing the supplier\u2019s technical specifications and an analysis carried out by its own forensics laboratory. But a University of Chile laboratory study concluded that some are only 20% rubber, with the rest made up of barium sulphate, silica and lead. Gen Enrique Bassaletti of the carbineros gave a radio interview on Friday in which he likened the use of shotguns to chemotherapy, saying that \u201cthey kill some good cells and some bad ones\u201d. Earlier this month, President Pi\u00f1era admitted that there had been \u201csome\u201d excessive use of force and promised that there would be \u201cno impunity\u201d for officers found responsible. But such promises are of little comfort to Cortez and her grieving granddaughter Maite. \u201cOne evening she took some rosary beads from me and began to pray,\u201d Cortez recalls. \u201cShe asked him to come down from heaven so she could tell him how much she loved him. \u201cHow do I explain to her that he won\u2019t come home any more? How do I find the words? The only thing I ask of God is that there is justice for Romario.\u201d",

After the match Archer, 24, wrote on Twitter: \u201cA bit disturbing hearing racial insults today whilst battling to help save my team, the crowd was been amazing this week except for that one guy, @TheBarmyArmy was good as usual also.\u201d The alleged incident took place as Archer walked back to the pavilion after being dismissed for 30 during England\u2019s failed attempt to save the Test. Joe Root\u2019s side eventually subsided to an innings and 65-run loss that puts the tourists 1-0 down in the two-Test series. In a previous tweet, subsequently deleted, Archer further outlined the nature of the abuse, posting: \u201cCan the guy that was yelling bbc and bc from the scoreboard area today come forward and tell me what those words mean please?

      "body": "<h2>1) Unai Emery and Arsenal cannot go on like this</h2> <p>One of Unai Emery\u2019s buzz phrases nowadays regards the need to form a \u201cconnection\u201d with the Arsenal fans. It has crept into his lexicon to the extent there would be no surprise if he was repeating an edict handed down from up high, and it certainly would be among the reasonable criteria against which to measure his performance. The club\u2019s hierarchy will surely have noticed the response to Alexandre Lacazette\u2019s equaliser against Southampton amounted to little more than a collective shrug, and things simply cannot continue this way for much longer. The danger is many around the Emirates have made up their minds what they think of a manager who just cannot get a tune out of his squad. The international break should have helped a stuttering team to reset; instead it was only an excellent Southampton side who took that opportunity. Emery\u2019s demeanour after the match, when he readily lamented that a big chance to begin bonding with the support had been thrown away, suggested he knows he may not have many more. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Arsenal 2-2 Southampton</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/24/dele-alli-tottenham-jose-mourinho-project-player-west-ham\">Flash of inspiration shows Dele Alli can be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s project player | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Wolves defy fears of Europa League slump</h2> <p>By now Wolves were supposed to have wilted under the strain of having started their season on 25 July but, with a third of this Premier League campaign gone, they are fifth, above Arsenal and Tottenham after stretching their unbeaten run to eight Premier League matches following victory over a below-par Bournemouth. It proved the perfect warm-up for Wolves, who know a point against Sporting Braga on Thursday \u2013 the 26th match of their season \u2013 will secure a place in the Europa League knockout stages. Last season Wolves were the best of the rest and in Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez they have one of the best No 9s in the division; the Mexican has the 20-goal mark in his sights. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo started a league-low 18 players last season and while they have added a couple of new faces, his small squad continue to make waves. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/bournemouth-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Bournemouth 1-2 Wolves</a></em></p> <h2>3) Barnes shows Leicester can get even better</h2> <p>One of the joys for Leicester is that while they are a team without any obvious weakness, they have several players with room to improve. Harvey Barnes is having a terrific season, regularly shredding opponents on the left. On Saturday Brighton became the latest side to be tormented by him as Leicester came away with a 2-0 win. But Barnes\u2019 finishing is not yet as good as the rest of his play, which is why he has scored only once. \u201cThe pleasing aspect is he\u2019s getting into the areas,\u201d Brendan Rodgers said. \u201cIn the previous years if you analysed any of the goals or opportunities, he was away outside looking in. We\u2019ve done a lot of work getting into the right areas. Then it\u2019s only about composure and confidence. Once he gets the confidence of scoring regularly, he will be an absolutely brilliant player.\u201d <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/brighton-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Brighton 0-2 Leicester</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"693fb77cdcc109e3babeb0ac90955f3165bf34b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/693fb77cdcc109e3babeb0ac90955f3165bf34b8/0_201_4591_2754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harvey Barnes takes on Martin Montoya of Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harvey Barnes takes on Martin Montoya of Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Zaha looking sharp again despite late miss</h2> <p>For Wilfried Zaha it was a game of two moments \u2013 the one in the 82nd minute when he equalised for Crystal Palace and the one at the end when he failed to do so again after sending a close-range shot over the bar. He knew it was a bad miss but ultimately defeat to Liverpool was a step in the right direction for Zaha during what has been a difficult season following his much publicised push to leave Selhurst Park last summer. There was a first goal of the campaign and a display the manager believes could be just what Palace need to get back to winning ways after a run of four losses and a draw in their past five fixtures. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen him play against top-level opposition much better than he did against Liverpool and that gives me great hope,\u201d Roy Hodgson said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just loved by the fans, he\u2019s loved by the coaching staff and the players too, because we know what he can do. We are looking for him to give these type of performances.\u201d <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/24/roman-abramovich-chelsea-russia-wealth-visa\">Chelsea are back in fashion \u2013 but Roman Abramovich is out in the cold</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>5) Zimmermann offers Norwich some stability</h2> <p>Daniel Farke made several references to \u201ca first clean-sheet win\u201d after Norwich\u2019s defeat of sorry Everton as he took as much satisfaction from the resilience his team displayed at Goodison Park as from a first victory in eight matches. That it was achieved with Christoph Zimmermann alongside the commanding Ben Godfrey in central defence was no coincidence. Zimmermann was making his first appearance since suffering a serious foot injury at West Ham in August. Norwich, who spent a little over \u00a31m on new recruits in the summer compared to Everton\u2019s \u00a3117m, have been desperately short of cover as a consequence but the return of an established centre-half pairing gives them a foundation to build on. \u201cIt was not far away from being a season or career-ending injury,\u201d Farke said. \u201cThere were big concerns in the first week and Christoph totally deserves to be in the spotlight because he worked so hard during his rehab period. He got back earlier than we all expected. He\u2019s massive for us.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/everton-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Everton 0-2 Norwich</a></em></p> <h2>6) Kant\u00e9 and Kovacic driving new-look Chelsea</h2> <p>Pep Guardiola is a connoisseur of midfielders, a man who can accumulate so many they are often found in his defence and attack. On Saturday, he was waxing lyrical about a central trio: Chelsea\u2019s group of Jorginho, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Mateo Kovacic. Chelsea\u2019s opener involved all three, with the Croatian playing the penetrative ball from his own half for the onrushing Frenchman. Kovacic, who has been belatedly allowed to unleash his long passing, made the most passes in the match \u2013 a rarity for any opponent in a City game \u2013 but also the best one. His distribution was invariably accurate but often felt pointless under Maurizio Sarri but he has been reinvented under Frank Lampard and if Kant\u00e9\u2019s conversion into a goalscoring midfielder, with three in his last six games, was capped by a Lampard-like run, Kovacic also appears to have acquired some of the sense of purpose his manager displayed during his own productive career. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea</a></em></p> <h2>7) Wilder in the Old Trafford dugout?</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/23/manchester-city-chelsea-duelling-scars\">Manchester City leave Chelsea with duelling scars after high-class hoot | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Saturday\u2019s matches, fans of several Premier League clubs \u2013 Arsenal and Everton to name two \u2013 were again wondering why expensively assembled squads are amounting to so much less than the sum of their parts. That feeling would only have been magnified on Sunday as Sheffield United outclassed Manchester United for most of a thrilling match at Bramall Lane. Despite a revival by the visitors that took them from 2-0 down to 3-2 up in nine second-half minutes, Sheffield United fans may ponder how long it will be before a bigger, better-resourced club try to tempt away the impressive Chris Wilder. The tactical and motivational ability the Blades manager is consistently demonstrating is the envy of much of the league and would surely not be out of place in the dugout at Old Trafford. <strong>Luke McLaughlin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/24/sheffield-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Sheffield United 3-3 Manchester United</a></em></p> <h2>8) Exalted Pope may answer England\u2019s prayers</h2> <p>\u201cThey think, \u2018Maybe we\u2019ve got a chance.\u2019 But then the cross comes in and a big monster like him comes and takes it,\u201d said Sean Dyche of the goalkeeper Nick Pope after the smash-and-grab victory over Watford. Two excellent saves from Pope in the first half at Vicarage Road on Saturday were the platform for Burnley\u2019s first away win of the season, with his manager also praising the keeper for the \u201ccalmness\u201d he brings to the defence. Gareth Southgate has clearly also recognised his ability having handed the 27-year-old his first England start in last week\u2019s Euro 2020 victory in Kosovo. His former Burnley teammate Tom Heaton \u2013 now at Aston Villa \u2013 finds himself down the pecking order once more. With question marks over the current No 1 Jordan Pickford\u2019s form in a struggling Everton side, could Pope be the answer to England\u2019s prayers come next summer? <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/watford-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Watford 0-3 Burnley</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"654a55c3f889e9119409a8da69fae5789f91cd2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/654a55c3f889e9119409a8da69fae5789f91cd2e/0_73_2489_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Pope Burnley\u2019s win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Pope Burnley\u2019s win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Kane has kind words for Pochettino and Mourinho</h2> <p>Mauricio Pochettino belongs to Tottenham\u2019s past but Harry Kane will never forget what the former manager has done for him. \u201cI\u2019ve been to see him,\u201d the striker said. \u201cI went round his house and caught up with him the next day. It was a shock for everyone, so I wanted to go and see him and we had a chat for a couple of hours.\u201d It is time to move on from last week\u2019s drama, though, and Tottenham began the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho era by beating West Ham at the London Stadium. Kane scored the decisive goal and he thinks Mourinho could turn this team into winners. \u201cThe gaffer has won at every club he has gone to,\u201d Kane said. \u201cHe\u2019s a proven winner. I\u2019m at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies, I\u2019ve made it clear I want to win them with Tottenham. When someone has got a reputation like he has, it gives you confidence.\u201d <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/nov/24/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend\u2019s best Premier League photos</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>10) Hammers look short of heart and hope</h2> <p>Tottenham used to regard trips to West Ham with trepidation, particularly a Spurs side under the kind of pressure bearing down on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s new charges going into Saturday\u2019s derby, but they have now won three times at the London Stadium in 13 months and memories of uncomfortable afternoons at the Upton Park bearpit seem distant indeed. Aside from being second best technically against Spurs, what will also worry Hammers fans was the limpness of their display, their lack of fervour. Their players\u2019 despondent body language when Son Heung-min opened the scoring spoke volumes, and was reflected in the ponderous defending that assisted Spurs\u2019 second and third goals. It can\u2019t help having the most lampooned goalkeeper in the Premier League behind them, but the spirit looks weak in all areas under Manuel Pellegrini at the moment.

      "bodyText": "1) Unai Emery and Arsenal cannot go on like this One of Unai Emery\u2019s buzz phrases nowadays regards the need to form a \u201cconnection\u201d with the Arsenal fans. It has crept into his lexicon to the extent there would be no surprise if he was repeating an edict handed down from up high, and it certainly would be among the reasonable criteria against which to measure his performance. The club\u2019s hierarchy will surely have noticed the response to Alexandre Lacazette\u2019s equaliser against Southampton amounted to little more than a collective shrug, and things simply cannot continue this way for much longer. The danger is many around the Emirates have made up their minds what they think of a manager who just cannot get a tune out of his squad. The international break should have helped a stuttering team to reset; instead it was only an excellent Southampton side who took that opportunity. Emery\u2019s demeanour after the match, when he readily lamented that a big chance to begin bonding with the support had been thrown away, suggested he knows he may not have many more. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 2-2 Southampton 2) Wolves defy fears of Europa League slump By now Wolves were supposed to have wilted under the strain of having started their season on 25 July but, with a third of this Premier League campaign gone, they are fifth, above Arsenal and Tottenham after stretching their unbeaten run to eight Premier League matches following victory over a below-par Bournemouth. It proved the perfect warm-up for Wolves, who know a point against Sporting Braga on Thursday \u2013 the 26th match of their season \u2013 will secure a place in the Europa League knockout stages. Last season Wolves were the best of the rest and in Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez they have one of the best No 9s in the division; the Mexican has the 20-goal mark in his sights. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo started a league-low 18 players last season and while they have added a couple of new faces, his small squad continue to make waves. Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 1-2 Wolves 3) Barnes shows Leicester can get even better One of the joys for Leicester is that while they are a team without any obvious weakness, they have several players with room to improve. Harvey Barnes is having a terrific season, regularly shredding opponents on the left. On Saturday Brighton became the latest side to be tormented by him as Leicester came away with a 2-0 win. But Barnes\u2019 finishing is not yet as good as the rest of his play, which is why he has scored only once. \u201cThe pleasing aspect is he\u2019s getting into the areas,\u201d Brendan Rodgers said. \u201cIn the previous years if you analysed any of the goals or opportunities, he was away outside looking in. We\u2019ve done a lot of work getting into the right areas. Then it\u2019s only about composure and confidence. Once he gets the confidence of scoring regularly, he will be an absolutely brilliant player.\u201d Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Brighton 0-2 Leicester 4) Zaha looking sharp again despite late miss For Wilfried Zaha it was a game of two moments \u2013 the one in the 82nd minute when he equalised for Crystal Palace and the one at the end when he failed to do so again after sending a close-range shot over the bar. He knew it was a bad miss but ultimately defeat to Liverpool was a step in the right direction for Zaha during what has been a difficult season following his much publicised push to leave Selhurst Park last summer. There was a first goal of the campaign and a display the manager believes could be just what Palace need to get back to winning ways after a run of four losses and a draw in their past five fixtures. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen him play against top-level opposition much better than he did against Liverpool and that gives me great hope,\u201d Roy Hodgson said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just loved by the fans, he\u2019s loved by the coaching staff and the players too, because we know what he can do. We are looking for him to give these type of performances.\u201d Sachin Nakrani \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool 5) Zimmermann offers Norwich some stability Daniel Farke made several references to \u201ca first clean-sheet win\u201d after Norwich\u2019s defeat of sorry Everton as he took as much satisfaction from the resilience his team displayed at Goodison Park as from a first victory in eight matches. That it was achieved with Christoph Zimmermann alongside the commanding Ben Godfrey in central defence was no coincidence. Zimmermann was making his first appearance since suffering a serious foot injury at West Ham in August. Norwich, who spent a little over \u00a31m on new recruits in the summer compared to Everton\u2019s \u00a3117m, have been desperately short of cover as a consequence but the return of an established centre-half pairing gives them a foundation to build on. \u201cIt was not far away from being a season or career-ending injury,\u201d Farke said. \u201cThere were big concerns in the first week and Christoph totally deserves to be in the spotlight because he worked so hard during his rehab period. He got back earlier than we all expected. He\u2019s massive for us.\u201d Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Everton 0-2 Norwich 6) Kant\u00e9 and Kovacic driving new-look Chelsea Pep Guardiola is a connoisseur of midfielders, a man who can accumulate so many they are often found in his defence and attack. On Saturday, he was waxing lyrical about a central trio: Chelsea\u2019s group of Jorginho, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Mateo Kovacic. Chelsea\u2019s opener involved all three, with the Croatian playing the penetrative ball from his own half for the onrushing Frenchman. Kovacic, who has been belatedly allowed to unleash his long passing, made the most passes in the match \u2013 a rarity for any opponent in a City game \u2013 but also the best one. His distribution was invariably accurate but often felt pointless under Maurizio Sarri but he has been reinvented under Frank Lampard and if Kant\u00e9\u2019s conversion into a goalscoring midfielder, with three in his last six games, was capped by a Lampard-like run, Kovacic also appears to have acquired some of the sense of purpose his manager displayed during his own productive career. Richard Jolly \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea 7) Wilder in the Old Trafford dugout? After Saturday\u2019s matches, fans of several Premier League clubs \u2013 Arsenal and Everton to name two \u2013 were again wondering why expensively assembled squads are amounting to so much less than the sum of their parts. That feeling would only have been magnified on Sunday as Sheffield United outclassed Manchester United for most of a thrilling match at Bramall Lane. Despite a revival by the visitors that took them from 2-0 down to 3-2 up in nine second-half minutes, Sheffield United fans may ponder how long it will be before a bigger, better-resourced club try to tempt away the impressive Chris Wilder. The tactical and motivational ability the Blades manager is consistently demonstrating is the envy of much of the league and would surely not be out of place in the dugout at Old Trafford. Luke McLaughlin \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 3-3 Manchester United 8) Exalted Pope may answer England\u2019s prayers \u201cThey think, \u2018Maybe we\u2019ve got a chance.\u2019 But then the cross comes in and a big monster like him comes and takes it,\u201d said Sean Dyche of the goalkeeper Nick Pope after the smash-and-grab victory over Watford. Two excellent saves from Pope in the first half at Vicarage Road on Saturday were the platform for Burnley\u2019s first away win of the season, with his manager also praising the keeper for the \u201ccalmness\u201d he brings to the defence. Gareth Southgate has clearly also recognised his ability having handed the 27-year-old his first England start in last week\u2019s Euro 2020 victory in Kosovo. His former Burnley teammate Tom Heaton \u2013 now at Aston Villa \u2013 finds himself down the pecking order once more. With question marks over the current No 1 Jordan Pickford\u2019s form in a struggling Everton side, could Pope be the answer to England\u2019s prayers come next summer? Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Watford 0-3 Burnley 9) Kane has kind words for Pochettino and Mourinho Mauricio Pochettino belongs to Tottenham\u2019s past but Harry Kane will never forget what the former manager has done for him. \u201cI\u2019ve been to see him,\u201d the striker said. \u201cI went round his house and caught up with him the next day. It was a shock for everyone, so I wanted to go and see him and we had a chat for a couple of hours.\u201d It is time to move on from last week\u2019s drama, though, and Tottenham began the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho era by beating West Ham at the London Stadium. Kane scored the decisive goal and he thinks Mourinho could turn this team into winners. \u201cThe gaffer has won at every club he has gone to,\u201d Kane said. \u201cHe\u2019s a proven winner. I\u2019m at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies, I\u2019ve made it clear I want to win them with Tottenham. When someone has got a reputation like he has, it gives you confidence.\u201d Jacob Steinberg 10) Hammers look short of heart and hope Tottenham used to regard trips to West Ham with trepidation, particularly a Spurs side under the kind of pressure bearing down on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s new charges going into Saturday\u2019s derby, but they have now won three times at the London Stadium in 13 months and memories of uncomfortable afternoons at the Upton Park bearpit seem distant indeed. Aside from being second best technically against Spurs, what will also worry Hammers fans was the limpness of their display, their lack of fervour. Their players\u2019 despondent body language when Son Heung-min opened the scoring spoke volumes, and was reflected in the ponderous defending that assisted Spurs\u2019 second and third goals. It can\u2019t help having the most lampooned goalkeeper in the Premier League behind them, but the spirit looks weak in all areas under Manuel Pellegrini at the moment. It\u2019s scarcely surprising replacements are being talked about. Tom Davies \u2022 Match report: West Ham 2-3 Tottenham",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong\u2019s voters have delivered an unprecedented landslide for pro-democracy candidates in local elections, in a powerful show of solidarity with the city\u2019s protest movement and rebuke to the government over its handling of the crisis. Over six months of escalating violence on the streets, Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam had claimed the support of a \u201csilent majority\u201d for her hardline response and refusal to compromise. Sunday\u2019s vote, widely seen as a proxy referendum on the city\u2019s future, exposed that stance as a sham. People turned out in record numbers to eject pro-Beijing politicians from district councils they had controlled across the city. They held on to little over 10 percent of the 452 openly contested seats. Pro-democracy candidates won a majority of seats on all 18 councils, although they will only control 17 because a large number of government appointees shifted the balance of power in the Islands district. Both in absolute numbers and in turnout rates it was easily the biggest exercise in democratic participation that Hong Kong has seen, with many voters waiting more than an hour to cast their ballots. Lam and her backers in China who are unused to dealing with democratic challenges to their rule, must now decide how to respond. Lam said on Monday her government would respect the election results and would \u201clisten humbly\u201d to the views of the public, but Beijing took a less conciliatory tone. \u201cWhatever happens, Hong Kong is always a part of China and any attempts to create chaos in Hong Kong or to jeopardise its prosperity and stability will not be successful,\u201d said the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, during a visit to Japan. When polls closed at 10.30pm on Sunday, nearly 3 million people had voted, representing more than 71% of the electorate and nearly half of Hong Kong\u2019s population. Many had never voted before. The unexpected clean sweep marks a sea change in Hong Kong politics, where pro-Beijing and government politicians have enjoyed a wealth of resources and support from the elite. \u201cI would not use the word happy, but we have made progress towards a situation where we can fight back against the government,\u201d said Clarisse Yeung, an artist-turned-politician who led campaigning in the Wan Chai district, and announced the shift of power with tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s important because we all know that we have been sacrificing too much in the past few months,\u201d she said. \u201cHong Kong people are no longer naive. We have to prepare ourselves, we have to have faith in ourselves to bring change.\u201d A string of prominent pro-Beijing candidates were also evicted from what had been safe seats, among them Junius Ho, who has been widely reviled for shaking hands with a gang of thugs who attacked protesters and commuters in July. There will be few immediate political consequences in Hong Kong because the councils have limited powers, only a small budget and a mandate restricted to hyper-local issues such as parks, bus stops and waste collection. But these local election victories may sow the seeds of greater long-term influence for democrats, because the councils play a role in choosing the city\u2019s chief executive and some legislators. Many of those who turned out on Sunday had never cast a ballot before. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time voting. I registered myself because of the [protest] movement,\u201d said Vivian Lee, an insurance worker in her 30s. \u201cI\u2019m happy so many people have come out to vote, because we want our voices heard.\u201d Despite long queues outside polling stations a spirit of exhilaration gripped much of the city, perhaps because people had a chance to give private, peaceful verdicts on a showdown that has upended normal life. It was the first weekend without teargas on the streets since mid-August, though after voting ended, riot police did end an almost entirely peaceful day by using pepper spray to resolve a dispute between supporters of rival candidates. District elections had not previously attracted much interest in Hong Kong, or beyond. The councils have a reputation for self-serving indolence and for years they were packed by disciplined and well-funded pro-Beijing candidates. But months of pro-democracy protests, from a two million-strong peaceful march in June, to increasingly violent street demonstrations that culminated in a siege of a city-centre university, turned a sleepy local poll into something more significant. For many in Hong Kong, Sunday\u2019s vote was both an opportunity and an obligation, particularly important because district councils are the only Hong Kong authority selected by full universal suffrage. The city\u2019s leader is chosen by an electoral college and only some seats in the city\u2019s legislature are selected in open ballots. \u201cIf you are willing to march or protest in the streets, which requires blood and sweat and tears, it\u2019s much easier to walk downstairs and vote,\u201d said one man who has taken part in the protests, and asked not to be named because of fear of official retaliation. \u201cEven if the system is broken, we can try to use it against the government.\u201d A last-minute surge in registrations added nearly 400,000 voters to the electoral rolls \u2013 most of them young \u2013 and a wave of novice pro-democracy candidates meant that for the first time in Hong Kong\u2019s history every seat was contested. Many pro-Beijing candidates were running on promises to \u201cstop the violence\u201d of the protests in which at least two people have died and hundreds have been injured, some critically. Authorities have tried to paint the demonstrators as unreasonable extremists, and brush off calls for an independent inquiry into escalating police brutality. But even in establishment strongholds, support for pro-democracy candidates grew. Adrian Lau ran in a seat in Yuen Long district that had never been contested by a pro-democracy candidate before, near a village where thugs gathered after they attacked protesters and commuters at the Yuen Long metro station in July. \u201cMany people have completely lost trust in the police after the incident,\u201d he said. \u201cSome told us they\u2019d vote for us and thank us for giving them an alternative but daren\u2019t say that out loud.\u201d Stephen, a retired businessman in his 60s voting in the affluent Mid-Levels neighbourhood, said: \u201cThis will send the message to the government that they should be more humble. It\u2019s your job to serve people, and not beat people up if they don\u2019t listen to you.\u201d Lam acknowledged that the result has sparked discussion of the fact that \u201ccitizens are dissatisfied with the current social situation and ... deep-seated problems,\u201d without going into details. The protest movement has had several key demands including direct popular elections and a probe into alleged police brutality, and the result may bring new pressure on Lam to meet them. She has previously rejected the demands as \u201cwishful thinking\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>After reading her playful, political novels \u2013 described by reviewers as \u201cexplosive\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a surprise to find Meena Kandasamy to be quiet and diffident in person. Today this may be because she is not feeling well; she keeps a scarf wrapped around her throughout our conversation. But also, as she tells me: \u201cI think I\u2019m much better writing down what I feel.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in Belfast\u2019s Grand Central hotel, an opulent symbol of the city\u2019s post-Troubles renaissance and a landmark that celebrates local literary history: walls, exterior paving and even the revolving doors display work by poet Paul Muldoon. Kandasamy is in Belfast to promote her new novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/01/exquisite-cadavers-meena-kandasamy-review\" title=\"\">Exquisite Cadavers</a></em>, but it\u2019s impossible to talk about this without first discussing her last novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/07/when-i-hit-you-meena-kandasamy-review\" title=\"\">When I Hit You</a>: Or, a Portrait of the Artist As a Young Wife</em>, to which the new book is in part a response.</p> <p>It was an \u201cintermingling of [the] political and domestic\u201d that drove Kandasamy to write <em>When I Hit You</em>, which was shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction last year. In 2011, she was married briefly \u2013 four months \u2013 to a man who subjected her to physical and psychological violence. \u201cI went to the police in India. I had this nine-page complaint, literally everything that had happened to me. The officer was really kind and he said to me: \u2018You\u2019ve written a novel!\u2019\u201d She laughs.</p> <p>It was a representation of her own story, but she anonymised the narrator of <em>When I Hit You</em> to universalise the experience; she had learned that being \u201cfeminist, outspoken, successful, loud\u201d was no protection against violence. Like her other books, it was driven by a desire for social justice. Her social media audience \u2013 around 100,000 followers on Twitter \u2013 is \u201cmore political than literati\u201d.</p> <p>Kandasamy was born in 1984 in Chennai, India, the daughter of a mixed-caste Tamil marriage. She offloaded her anger at India\u2019s \u201cvery rigid caste system, which doesn\u2019t give acknowledgement to anyone except the Brahmin [high-caste] population, and even women are excluded from that\u201d by writing poetry, publishing two collections \u2013 <em>Touch</em> and <em>Ms Militancy</em> \u2013 in her 20s. Following the end of the marriage that inspired <em>When I Hit You</em>, she met her current partner in 2013 and came to the UK in 2016, where she still lives.</p> <p>Her first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/31/gypsy-goddess-meena-kandasamy-review\" title=\"\">The Gypsy Goddess</a></em>, was published in 2014 and is a stunning account of the murder of 44 low-caste labourers and their families in a Tamil village in 1968. The workers, striking for better pay and conditions, were locked in a hut and burned alive. It is deeply faithful: \u201cResearching this book was one of the ways in which I tried repeatedly to escape the task of actually writing it.\u201d Yet it also shows Kandasamy\u2019s originality; the terrible story is framed by a humorous narrator who talks directly to us: \u201cNow the nail-biting reader can join the nervous author in elaborating the rest of the story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4be19c342b04d5721a50697b4b6fc5cf8243ab0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4be19c342b04d5721a50697b4b6fc5cf8243ab0/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chennai, India, where Kandasamy was born.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chennai, India, where Kandasamy was born.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Soltan/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Gypsy Goddess</em> received good reviews but didn\u2019t reach a wide readership at the time. Comparing it with the breakthrough success of <em>When I Hit You</em>, she sounds frustrated: \u201cWhen publishers tell me, \u2018<em>When I Hit You</em> did well and <em>Gypsy Goddess</em> didn\u2019t do well, it\u2019s because this is about a woman\u2019s story, they can identify with this person.\u2019 Oh, you must be kidding me if people can\u2019t identify with people striking for wages, people fighting for justice.\u201d</p> <p><em>When I Hit You </em>is a horrifying and gripping portrayal of the narrator\u2019s isolation and abuse at the hands of her husband. Living in a society in which a woman is expected to remain silent and compliant, she comes to realise that she must rescue herself. One of the more troubling aspects of the novel\u2019s success, says Kandasamy, was the way in which some readers treated it as autobiography: a Polish publisher wanted to buy the rights so as to repackage the novel as narrative non-fiction. (She said no.) Although \u201cthere was not a line of falsehood in that book\u201d, it was not a memoir. \u201cA memoir for me means a person\u2019s life story; if I was going to write my actual life story, I would condense this entire marriage into a footnote.\u201d By treating it as memoir, people were overlooking the artistry: \u201cThe idea was: \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you a story about what happened to me.\u2019 For me, the artistic enterprise is: \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you a story\u2019, a narrative that has been shaped. It\u2019s not therapy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of my sons is British, the other is American, my partner is Belgian, I am Indian. This is the new family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She compares it to Magritte\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/sep/22/rene-magritte-pompidou-centre-surrealism\" title=\"\">The Treachery of Images</a></em> (\u201c<em>Ceci n\u2019est pas une pipe</em>\u201d) \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not what happened to me, it\u2019s a representation of what happened to me.\u201d She asked her publisher not to give it a stereotypical cover design: \u201cI don\u2019t want hands with henna or disembodied parts of a woman. I want you to design a cover like you would design it for a 60-year-old white man.\u201d</p> <p>Praise for <em>When I Hit You</em> did focus on the subject \u2013 reviews called it \u201ccourageous and brave\u201d, \u201cimportant and shocking\u201d \u2013 rather than the form, in which stories surround the central story, as Kandasamy\u2019s narrator tries to wrest control of her own narrative from her family. (The book\u2019s opening line is: \u201cMy mother has not stopped talking about it.\u201d)</p> <p>It was this question of \u2013 as she puts it today \u2013 \u201cwho is the narrator, who is allowed to tell the story\u201d that led to<em> Exquisite Cadavers</em>. To spike the guns of anyone seeking to read her new book as a memoir, it would be \u201cbased on a story as removed from my own as possible\u201d. The title comes from the surrealist parlour game, also known as exquisite corpse, where each person adds a body part to a drawing, or a sentence to a story, without seeing the previous parts: \u201cArt as assemblage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to do something where I was going to look for inspirations, things that were happening to me, and project them on to a fictional couple.\u201d The couple are Maya, a young woman working for a liberal newspaper, and her partner Karim, a film-maker originally from north Africa, both living in present-day Britain. One theme is how artists of colour are \u201ctaken only at face value\u201d.

She has no time for nationalism. \u201cOne of my sons is British, the other is American, my partner is Belgian, I am Indian. This is the new family.\u201d She laughs.

      "bodyText": "After reading her playful, political novels \u2013 described by reviewers as \u201cexplosive\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a surprise to find Meena Kandasamy to be quiet and diffident in person. Today this may be because she is not feeling well; she keeps a scarf wrapped around her throughout our conversation. But also, as she tells me: \u201cI think I\u2019m much better writing down what I feel.\u201d We meet in Belfast\u2019s Grand Central hotel, an opulent symbol of the city\u2019s post-Troubles renaissance and a landmark that celebrates local literary history: walls, exterior paving and even the revolving doors display work by poet Paul Muldoon. Kandasamy is in Belfast to promote her new novel Exquisite Cadavers, but it\u2019s impossible to talk about this without first discussing her last novel When I Hit You: Or, a Portrait of the Artist As a Young Wife, to which the new book is in part a response. It was an \u201cintermingling of [the] political and domestic\u201d that drove Kandasamy to write When I Hit You, which was shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction last year. In 2011, she was married briefly \u2013 four months \u2013 to a man who subjected her to physical and psychological violence. \u201cI went to the police in India. I had this nine-page complaint, literally everything that had happened to me. The officer was really kind and he said to me: \u2018You\u2019ve written a novel!\u2019\u201d She laughs. It was a representation of her own story, but she anonymised the narrator of When I Hit You to universalise the experience; she had learned that being \u201cfeminist, outspoken, successful, loud\u201d was no protection against violence. Like her other books, it was driven by a desire for social justice. Her social media audience \u2013 around 100,000 followers on Twitter \u2013 is \u201cmore political than literati\u201d. Kandasamy was born in 1984 in Chennai, India, the daughter of a mixed-caste Tamil marriage. She offloaded her anger at India\u2019s \u201cvery rigid caste system, which doesn\u2019t give acknowledgement to anyone except the Brahmin [high-caste] population, and even women are excluded from that\u201d by writing poetry, publishing two collections \u2013 Touch and Ms Militancy \u2013 in her 20s. Following the end of the marriage that inspired When I Hit You, she met her current partner in 2013 and came to the UK in 2016, where she still lives. Her first novel, The Gypsy Goddess, was published in 2014 and is a stunning account of the murder of 44 low-caste labourers and their families in a Tamil village in 1968. The workers, striking for better pay and conditions, were locked in a hut and burned alive. It is deeply faithful: \u201cResearching this book was one of the ways in which I tried repeatedly to escape the task of actually writing it.\u201d Yet it also shows Kandasamy\u2019s originality; the terrible story is framed by a humorous narrator who talks directly to us: \u201cNow the nail-biting reader can join the nervous author in elaborating the rest of the story.\u201d The Gypsy Goddess received good reviews but didn\u2019t reach a wide readership at the time. Comparing it with the breakthrough success of When I Hit You, she sounds frustrated: \u201cWhen publishers tell me, \u2018When I Hit You did well and Gypsy Goddess didn\u2019t do well, it\u2019s because this is about a woman\u2019s story, they can identify with this person.\u2019 Oh, you must be kidding me if people can\u2019t identify with people striking for wages, people fighting for justice.\u201d When I Hit You is a horrifying and gripping portrayal of the narrator\u2019s isolation and abuse at the hands of her husband. Living in a society in which a woman is expected to remain silent and compliant, she comes to realise that she must rescue herself. One of the more troubling aspects of the novel\u2019s success, says Kandasamy, was the way in which some readers treated it as autobiography: a Polish publisher wanted to buy the rights so as to repackage the novel as narrative non-fiction. (She said no.) Although \u201cthere was not a line of falsehood in that book\u201d, it was not a memoir. \u201cA memoir for me means a person\u2019s life story; if I was going to write my actual life story, I would condense this entire marriage into a footnote.\u201d By treating it as memoir, people were overlooking the artistry: \u201cThe idea was: \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you a story about what happened to me.\u2019 For me, the artistic enterprise is: \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you a story\u2019, a narrative that has been shaped. It\u2019s not therapy.\u201d She compares it to Magritte\u2019s The Treachery of Images (\u201cCeci n\u2019est pas une pipe\u201d) \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not what happened to me, it\u2019s a representation of what happened to me.\u201d She asked her publisher not to give it a stereotypical cover design: \u201cI don\u2019t want hands with henna or disembodied parts of a woman. I want you to design a cover like you would design it for a 60-year-old white man.\u201d Praise for When I Hit You did focus on the subject \u2013 reviews called it \u201ccourageous and brave\u201d, \u201cimportant and shocking\u201d \u2013 rather than the form, in which stories surround the central story, as Kandasamy\u2019s narrator tries to wrest control of her own narrative from her family. (The book\u2019s opening line is: \u201cMy mother has not stopped talking about it.\u201d) It was this question of \u2013 as she puts it today \u2013 \u201cwho is the narrator, who is allowed to tell the story\u201d that led to Exquisite Cadavers. To spike the guns of anyone seeking to read her new book as a memoir, it would be \u201cbased on a story as removed from my own as possible\u201d. The title comes from the surrealist parlour game, also known as exquisite corpse, where each person adds a body part to a drawing, or a sentence to a story, without seeing the previous parts: \u201cArt as assemblage.\u201d \u201cI wanted to do something where I was going to look for inspirations, things that were happening to me, and project them on to a fictional couple.\u201d The couple are Maya, a young woman working for a liberal newspaper, and her partner Karim, a film-maker originally from north Africa, both living in present-day Britain. One theme is how artists of colour are \u201ctaken only at face value\u201d. Karim, completing a course on film, tells his professors that as a north African he wants to prepare a dissertation on the camel in cinema. His proposal is \u201cgleefully embraced with such earnestness that it breaks him to summon the courage to say he was merely being sarcastic\u201d. This reflects the earnest responses to Kandasamy\u2019s first two books. Writing Exquisite Cadavers, she says, presented challenges on a couple of levels. Her previous books were based on past events. Despite their difficult subject matter, \u201cthat stuff has finished, you can put a lid on it and write about it\u201d. It was harder to write about what is happening now, where there is no narrative closure. The novel takes in recent events, including the media response to \u201cIsis bride\u201d Shamima Begum and the evergreen politics of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. It seems an apt subject to raise in Northern Ireland \u2013 the Gordian knot of Brexit \u2013 on a sunny autumn day when the EU has just granted the UK another delay to its departure. \u201cOnly a super-anxious nation,\u201d Kandasamy writes in the book, \u201ccould have come up with Brexit.\u201d She tells me she is pro-remain, while her partner, who is a leftist, \u201cwould like to leave because the EU is a bankers\u2019 institution\u201d. They have two sons: the first was born in the UK in 2016; their second last year in New York, where she was working at NYU. She has no time for nationalism. \u201cOne of my sons is British, the other is American, my partner is Belgian, I am Indian. This is the new family.\u201d She laughs. But she knows who will be hardest hit by Brexit. \u201cWhen they start discriminating against British people at European borders, they\u2019re not going to go after white British people, they\u2019re going to go after people like me.\u201d Kandasamy\u2019s political passion comes alive as she warms to her theme. \u201cIt\u2019s not a polite term to use but I think there\u2019s an element of \u2018brown-washing\u2019 going on, like making Priti Patel the face of hard Brexit, following very racist immigration policies, but using a brown person to push it through.

This crisp pastry holds the filling well and I prefer to cut out a star shape to cover the top of the pies, allowing some of the filling to be visible. It also provides a better mincemeat to pastry ratio.

      "bodyText": "Homemade mincemeat is simple to make and easy to store, so I always make a few jars before Christmas. One batch of pastry and one jar of mincemeat will make 12 mince pies. This crisp pastry holds the filling well and I prefer to cut out a star shape to cover the top of the pies, allowing some of the filling to be visible. It also provides a better mincemeat to pastry ratio. You can keep a tray of uncooked pastry shells in the freezer to fill and bake for last-minute mince pies; they also make sweet gifts, in a box tied with a ribbon. For the mincemeat, makes three 350ml jars Bramley apples 225g, cored and chopped small shredded suet 110g raisins 175g sultanas 110g currants 110g mixed candied peel 110g, chopped finely dark brown sugar 175g orange 1, zested and juiced lemon 1, zested and juiced blanched almonds 25g, chopped ground mixed spice 2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp grated nutmeg a pinch fine sea salt a pinch brandy 3 tbsp For the sweet pastry, makes 12 pies plain flour 250g caster sugar 25g salt a pinch cold butter 170g ice-cold water egg 1 beaten For the mince, in a bowl large enough to hold all the ingredients, mix everything together and stir well. Cover and set aside overnight. The next day, put the mixture into a large pan and gently heat, stirring, until the fat has melted and the mixture is heated through. Remove from the heat and allow to cool before packing into sterilised jars. This will keep for up to a year in a cool place and it\u2019s best left for a week or so before use for the flavours to really mingle. For the pastry, put the flour, sugar and salt into a mixer and add the butter, in large chunks. Blitz until the butter has been cut up into petit pois sized pieces, then tip the mixture into a bowl. Add 3-4 tablespoons of cold water and start to bring the mixture together lightly, with your hands. Add more water if necessary to form a cohesive dough. Wrap in clingfilm and press into a disc shape then chill for at least half an hour before rolling. Roll on a lightly floured surface to approx 5mm thickness. Cut out round shapes, large enough to fill a standard 12-hole tart tray. Re-roll the remainder and cut out 12 stars to put on top. Heat the oven to 150C/gas mark 2.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s holiday season soon, a time for winter feasting, for baking Christmas treats. If you want simple and savoury \u2013 Jeremy Lee\u2019s definitive soda bread, a smart twist on cheesy straws, or something eye-catching and adventurous such as Justin Gellatly\u2019s monumental croquembouche \u2013 you need look no further. From Dan Lepard to Dominique Ansel, Anna Jones to Claire Ptak, Yotam Ottolenghi to Nigel Slater, our experts have your back. There are also crisp shortbread stars, a Christmas pudding, perfect mince pies, Mont Blanc tarts, a luxurious meringue cake, even Anja Dunk\u2019s gingerbread house. Top recipes for a family tea or a posher party. Merry Christmas everyone. Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s orange and saffron shortbread stars Gloriously festive, these fragrant star biscuits are perfect to have on hand for cups of tea over Christmas, and make a great present. Violet Bakery\u2019s Christmas pudding from Claire Ptak Bright, rich, spicy and most importantly delicious, this seasonal staple is best made ahead, then left to gently warm while you eat Christmas lunch. Napoleon cake from Alissa Timoshkina With its snowy surface giving way to layers of crisp flaky pastry and rich and buttery vanilla creme patissiere, this is a winter wonderland of a cake. Cheesy Marmite straws from Alvin Caudwell Christmas entertaining is a snap with these moreish snacks \u2013 easy to make, quick to cook straight from the freezer, and perfect with a drink. Gingerbread house from Anja Dunk An easy recipe for a snowy fairytale scene that\u2019s as fun to decorate as it is to eat. Nigel Slater\u2019s prune brownies Deep, rich flavours from prune and armagnac add seasonally appropriate indulgent notes to a chocolate brownie recipe that will still please purists. Justin Gellatly\u2019s croquembouche This impressive cake, traditionally smashed by the host before serving, makes a theatrical centrepiece for the Christmas table. Pear, persimmon and ricotta crostata from Joe Trivelli This take on an Italian tart is an almost perfect wintry pudding \u2013 seasonal fruit, enveloped in a ricotta cream and baked in a hazelnut crust. Dauphinoise pies from Ravneet Gill Buttery puff pastry, oozy cheese and layered potatoes, this pie elevates comfort food to be a vegetarian main worthy of a Christmas feast. Mince pies from Blanche Vaughan One recipe for fruity and deeply spiced mincemeat and one for the perfect crisp pastry that helps transform it into these Christmas essentials. Dan Lepard\u2019s pistachio halva chocolate roulade A twist on the French b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl sees the traditional dark chocolate sponge and icing swapped for pistachios and white chocolate. Jeremy Lee\u2019s beremeal treacle soda bread Nothing beats bread warm from the oven, generously spread with butter. This easy loaf is made with an interesting heritage grain and works particularly well with smoked salmon or Christmas cheese. Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh\u2019s mont blanc tarts In this sophisticated tart, the classic pudding of chestnut puree and whipped cream is given a bit more interest with crunchy pecan praline. Anna Jones\u2019s membrillo, buttermilk and poppy seed cake Membrillo \u2013 quince paste \u2013 isn\u2019t just for the cheese board. Stirred into a mix with buttermilk, spelt and poppy seeds, when baked it melts deliciously into this surprisingly decadent tray bake. Jeremy Lee\u2019s walnut and pineapple meringue cake Like a boozy pavlova with a lid, the elements for this merry pudding can be made two days in advance, taking a little stress out of Christmas feasting. Chocolate fondant pudding cakes with Turkish delight from Greg and Lucy Malouf This dinner-party favourite takes an update, hiding nuggets of a favourite Christmas sweet in its oozy centre. One for the traditional pudding haters. Rum-soaked raisin caramel cake from Nik Sharma This traditional Indian Catholic family recipe is full of rich and bittersweet caramel and rum flavours, with plenty of spiced sweet ginger and chopped cashews. Honey &amp; Co\u2019s butternut squash and spice cheesecake from Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich Influenced by American home-cooking, this cheesecake is full of seasonal spices \u2013 and was a much-coveted favourite of the kitchen staff at Honey &amp; Co. Jam and butter croissant pudding from Dominique Ansel There\u2019s no better use for leftover croissants, and this is an easy and a gorgeously indulgent brunch or supper for the lazy post-Christmas days. La pompe \u00e0 huile bread from Caroline Craig A sweet, orange-blossom-flavoured brioche-like bread is traditional in Provence for Christmas Eve \u2013 but it works equally well as a Boxing Day breakfast for dipping into mugs of hot chocolate.",

      "body": "<p>We infants were never likely to get a visitation from three kings. However, things from afar were often brought to the house over the festive season, not least of which was a whole pineapple that sat in a great heap of clementines over Christmas. This simple recipe for two discs of walnut meringue sandwiching pineapple made merry with sugar, orange and Grand Marnier or rum makes fine eating.</p> <p>You can make this up to two days in advance. The meringue discs can be stored in an airtight box, while the pineapple will happily sit in its boozy syrup in a sealed container in the fridge.</p> <p><strong><em>Serves 10-12</em></strong><br><strong>pineapple</strong> 1, as ripe as can be<br><strong>dark brown muscovado sugar</strong> 100g<br><strong>Grand Marnier</strong> or a very good rum<br><strong>lemon</strong> 1<br><strong>clementine</strong> 1<br><strong>orange</strong> 1<br><strong>double cream</strong> 500ml</p> <p><strong><em>For the meringue</em></strong><br><strong>egg whites</strong> 6<br><strong>golden caster sugar</strong> 375g, weighed into two equal heaps<br><strong>walnuts</strong> 200g, chopped none too fine</p> <p>To make the meringue, preheat the oven to 140C/gas mark 1. Line two baking sheets with silicone paper. Outline a favourite serving plate upon each paper to ensure the discs of meringue will sit comfortably thereon.</p> <p>In a scrupulously clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Whisk in half the sugar, tumble in the chopped walnuts then the remaining sugar. Fold together swiftly, then spoon into discs, one on each baking sheet.</p> <p>Place these in the oven and turn the heat down immediately \u2013 you want the oven to be quite cool, about 110C/gas mark \u00bc. Let the meringues cook for half an hour, then check they are not too dark. You want them to be lovely and coffee-coloured. Let the cakes cook for a further 15-20 minutes then switch off the oven and open the door, leaving them inside to cool.</p> <p>Peel the pineapple and remove its core. Slice the pineapple down the middle and then again, so it\u2019s in four long pieces. Slice these thinly and tumble them into a bowl. Spoon over the muscovado sugar, which will soon dissolve into a very good syrup.</p> <p>Add to this a good jigger (45ml) of Grand Marnier and/or rum. Grate in \u00bd teaspoon each of lemon, clementine and orange zest. Let this steep for a few hours, covered, in the fridge.</p> <p>When ready to serve, place one meringue on the serving plate. Whisk the cream until good solid drifts form. Spoon one third of the cream onto the cake. Lift the pineapple from the syrup and heap upon the cream. Spoon a few tablespoons of the syrup into the remaining cream, stir and heap upon the pineapple. Sit the second disc atop and serve.

      "bodyText": "We infants were never likely to get a visitation from three kings. However, things from afar were often brought to the house over the festive season, not least of which was a whole pineapple that sat in a great heap of clementines over Christmas. This simple recipe for two discs of walnut meringue sandwiching pineapple made merry with sugar, orange and Grand Marnier or rum makes fine eating. You can make this up to two days in advance. The meringue discs can be stored in an airtight box, while the pineapple will happily sit in its boozy syrup in a sealed container in the fridge. Serves 10-12 pineapple 1, as ripe as can be dark brown muscovado sugar 100g Grand Marnier or a very good rum lemon 1 clementine 1 orange 1 double cream 500ml For the meringue egg whites 6 golden caster sugar 375g, weighed into two equal heaps walnuts 200g, chopped none too fine To make the meringue, preheat the oven to 140C/gas mark 1. Line two baking sheets with silicone paper. Outline a favourite serving plate upon each paper to ensure the discs of meringue will sit comfortably thereon. In a scrupulously clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Whisk in half the sugar, tumble in the chopped walnuts then the remaining sugar. Fold together swiftly, then spoon into discs, one on each baking sheet. Place these in the oven and turn the heat down immediately \u2013 you want the oven to be quite cool, about 110C/gas mark \u00bc. Let the meringues cook for half an hour, then check they are not too dark. You want them to be lovely and coffee-coloured. Let the cakes cook for a further 15-20 minutes then switch off the oven and open the door, leaving them inside to cool. Peel the pineapple and remove its core. Slice the pineapple down the middle and then again, so it\u2019s in four long pieces. Slice these thinly and tumble them into a bowl. Spoon over the muscovado sugar, which will soon dissolve into a very good syrup. Add to this a good jigger (45ml) of Grand Marnier and/or rum. Grate in \u00bd teaspoon each of lemon, clementine and orange zest. Let this steep for a few hours, covered, in the fridge. When ready to serve, place one meringue on the serving plate. Whisk the cream until good solid drifts form. Spoon one third of the cream onto the cake. Lift the pineapple from the syrup and heap upon the cream. Spoon a few tablespoons of the syrup into the remaining cream, stir and heap upon the pineapple. Sit the second disc atop and serve. With more rum, maybe?

      "bodyText": "A majority of Australian voters back the medevac regime in its current state or believe it should be more compassionate, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The new snapshot of positive voter sentiment, which lands as the critical medevac repeal vote looms in the Senate, has a quarter of the sample saying the medevac procedures do not go far enough in providing humane treatment for people in offshore detention. Despite the Morrison government arguing for months that medevac creates national security risks, it appears a number of voters aren\u2019t listening to the rhetoric. In February, only 16% of the sample were of the view the medevac system wasn\u2019t compassionate enough, and that\u2019s now up to 25%. A further 37% of the sample argue the medevac procedures strike a balance between strong borders and humane treatment for people on Nauru and Manus Island, which is the same result as February. While more than 60% of the sample appear to favour the status quo or something stronger, just under a quarter of the sample (22%) believes the regime weakens Australia\u2019s borders and 17% are unsure. With federal parliament now in its final two sitting weeks before the summer break, the Morrison government has listed medevac repeal for Wednesday in the Senate. The medevac laws, passed when the Coalition governed in minority last year, allow for Australia-based doctors to recommend a refugee or asylum seeker offshore be transferred to Australia for care. The minister can refuse if he or she disagrees with the clinical assessment \u2013 in which case it goes to the independent medical panel for review \u2013 or on security or criminal grounds. The panel cannot override vetoes based on security or criminal concerns.

The Coalition will only succeed in repealing the regime if it wins backing from the Tasmanian independent senator Jacqui Lambie, who has been running down the clock for months while she deliberates. Lambie, who is understood to want asylum seekers currently offshore resettled more quickly, met Scott Morrison on Monday morning to discuss options.

      "bodyText": "The unprecedented landslide victory of the pro-democracy camp in the Hong Kong district council election was a \u201cslap on the cheek\u201d for the city\u2019s government but the violent protests that have roiled the city for nearly six months will not stop if authorities continue to ignore citizens\u2019 political demands, analysts have said. In an effective proxy referendum on the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement, nearly 3 million people voted, representing more than 71% of the electorate and nearly half of Hong Kong\u2019s population. Protesters had agreed on social media to pause their actions, creating the first teargas-free weekend since mid-August, to record the largest democratic participation that Hong Kong has ever seen, both in absolute numbers and in turnout rates. Pro-democracy politicians took control of nearly all of the city\u2019s 18 district councils in what analysts said was a unanimous vote of no confidence in the government. Joseph Cheng, retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong people had seized the opportunity to express their dissatisfaction in the government and wanted to put pressure on the government to respond to their political demands. \u201cThey have not given up on their support for the pro-democracy camp and the protesters,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThis is a slap on the cheek for Carrie Lam\u2019s administration who insisted that the silent majority was supporting the government.\u201d Cheng warned that if the government failed to respond, protests would not die down. \u201cTo simply suppress will not return society to normality. Carrie Lam does not have the policy to allow us to return to normality,\u201d he said. Cheng said the large numbers of arrests after the intense, violent conflicts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Polytechnic University in recent weeks had dented the increasingly radical anti-government movement but protests would continue if the government failed to address political demands. \u201cThe ball is in the government\u2019s court,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the government has this attitude that I can\u2019t satisfy your demands and I can\u2019t accept pressure from you.

Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the victory of the pro-democracy movement could be seen as a window of opportunity to find a way out of the political impasse and \u201cmay as well be a turning point if [the Beijing and Hong Kong governments] gracefully accept the verdict of the people\u201d. But he said the government could also \u201cignore the political meanings of the results altogether\u201d and \u201cthat will certainly provoke strong reactions which lead to a new round of street battles between the police and the protesters\u201d. \u201cIn any case, the first response from Carrie Lam is going to determine where Hong Kong is turning to, or still stuck in a gridlock and even new rounds of street level confrontation,\u201d he said. Cheng said the landslide victory would help lay the foundation for the 2020 legislative council elections, because the pro-democracy camp will have more resources for political campaigns after grabbing district election seats. Johnny Lau, a commentator on Chinese politics, said Beijing may make strategic adjustments to minimise sparking more negative public reactions and would continue to blame foreign meddling in local politics. But as it made clear in its Hong Kong policies announced in the Communist party\u2019s Fourth Plenum, it would tighten up its governance of Hong Kong through stepped-up control of its government and the police. It has also pledged to empower security agencies to enforce Chinese sovereignty in the city, and to intensify patriotic education, especially among young people and school children.

Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in.\u201d </p> \n<p>Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, had a similar verdict, saying the gap between the party\u2019s spending plans was huge.</p> \n<p>\u201cAusterity will end whoever wins this election, given previously announced increases to public service spending and Conservative manifesto plans for up to \u00a320bn of infrastructure spend. However, the country still faces a very big choice on the size of the state it wants in this election,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cConservative plans for a \u00a33bn increase in current spending contrast with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/24/labours-spending-plans-arent-especially-unusual-just-look-at-sweden\">Labour\u2019s proposed \u00a383bn increase</a> \u2013 which has increased to \u00a395bn following today\u2019s Waspi [Women Against State Pension Inequality] pledge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pressed about the contrast in the scale of Tory and Labour spending plans, Boris Johnson said he was ambitious about improving public services but it was \u201ctrue that we are doing it in a sensible way\u201d.</p> \n<p>On capital spending, the Conservatives said they would loosen their fiscal rules to allow more borrowing for infrastructure projects, such as roads and flood defences, and research and development. The Tories plan capital spend of \u00a33.2bn next year, rising to \u00a38bn by the end of the next parliament.</p> \n<p>Taking questions after the manifesto launch, Johnson floundered as he was pressed twice on whether he can be trusted, given that last week\u2019s debate audience laughed at him over the issue and the Conservative party has been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/tories-tweet-anti-labour-posts-under-factcheckuk-brand\">masquerading as a fact-checking service on Twitter</a>.</p> \n<p>Asked if the fake factcheck service had undermined trust in the Conservative party, Johnson rambled and wrongly claimed that Labour had done a similar thing. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that the Twittersphere is not really my province. But what I can say is that I\u2019m informed that Labour have some sort of operation, which is very similar to this but I haven\u2019t followed this Twitter stuff with perhaps the attention that you would like. I will apprise myself of the detail of this.\u201d</p>",

With two and a half weeks to go before polling day, Johnson released a restrained document that contained relatively little new policy and omitted several key pledges from his leadership campaign, including promised tax cuts for higher earners and any concrete solution to social care. The slimmed-down document appeared intended to minimise controversy, a response from Tory strategists to the disastrous launch that led to the evaporation of Theresa May\u2019s poll lead in 2017.

Some of the major policies that were confirmed in the Tory manifesto include: \u2022 A promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. \u2022 A pledge to increase police officer numbers by 20,000. \u2022 A rise in the national insurance threshold to \u00a39,500 next year with an ultimate ambition of \u00a312,500. \u2022 An extra \u00a32bn to fix potholes in roads. \u2022 A commitment to not extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. \u2022 Ending car-parking charges for the terminally ill and NHS staff on night shifts. \u2022 An expansion of free childcare to parents of three- and four-year-olds in the school holidays. \u2022 An end to the Fixed-term Parliament Act. The most notable absence was the lack of a plan solve the black hole in social care funding beyond an extra \u00a31bn a year and an aim to seek cross-party consensus. A promise that no one should have to lose their house to pay for care in old age was designed to head off the difficulties Theresa May had with her social care policy in 2017, which was branded a \u201cdementia tax\u201d. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive at the Health Foundation, said the lack of any clear policy on social care was a \u201cshameful omission for a party that\u2019s been in power for nearly a decade\u201d. Paul Johnson said some big spending had been announced in September but \u201ctaken at face value today\u2019s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that\u2019s it\u201d. He added: \u201cHealth and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in.\u201d Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, had a similar verdict, saying the gap between the party\u2019s spending plans was huge. \u201cAusterity will end whoever wins this election, given previously announced increases to public service spending and Conservative manifesto plans for up to \u00a320bn of infrastructure spend. However, the country still faces a very big choice on the size of the state it wants in this election,\u201d he said. \u201cConservative plans for a \u00a33bn increase in current spending contrast with Labour\u2019s proposed \u00a383bn increase \u2013 which has increased to \u00a395bn following today\u2019s Waspi [Women Against State Pension Inequality] pledge.\u201d Pressed about the contrast in the scale of Tory and Labour spending plans, Boris Johnson said he was ambitious about improving public services but it was \u201ctrue that we are doing it in a sensible way\u201d. On capital spending, the Conservatives said they would loosen their fiscal rules to allow more borrowing for infrastructure projects, such as roads and flood defences, and research and development. The Tories plan capital spend of \u00a33.2bn next year, rising to \u00a38bn by the end of the next parliament. Taking questions after the manifesto launch, Johnson floundered as he was pressed twice on whether he can be trusted, given that last week\u2019s debate audience laughed at him over the issue and the Conservative party has been criticised for masquerading as a fact-checking service on Twitter. Asked if the fake factcheck service had undermined trust in the Conservative party, Johnson rambled and wrongly claimed that Labour had done a similar thing. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that the Twittersphere is not really my province. But what I can say is that I\u2019m informed that Labour have some sort of operation, which is very similar to this but I haven\u2019t followed this Twitter stuff with perhaps the attention that you would like. I will apprise myself of the detail of this.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A glance at Claudia Hammond\u2019s <em>The Art of Rest</em> \u2013 and a skim of her chapter headings \u2013 might fool you into thinking that rest is a simple subject. There is something charming about a book that includes a chapter entitled A Nice Hot Bath (I hoped it might be followed by A Nice Cup of Tea) and I supposed that Hammond, a presenter of Radio 4\u2019s <em>All in the Mind</em>, was about to offer us a cosy self-help book.</p> <p>But <em>The Art of Rest</em> reveals that rest is not simple. This fascinating, entertaining and lucidly written book should be read by anyone ready to confess that rest is not their forte. We start to see that the subject is complicated partly because most of us are no good at resting. We are restless about rest. We feel guilty about it. We live in a culture obsessed with being busy \u2013 and this boasting about being busy is, Hammond argues, caught up with status. She summons Socrates to her side to warn us: \u201cBeware the barrenness of a busy life.\u201d</p> <p>There is a survey behind this book \u2013 the Rest Test, led by researchers from Durham University. It involved more than 18,000 people in 134 countries, who were asked to list what they found most restful. Most felt they were not getting enough rest. The book is organised around their top 10 in reverse order: mindfulness, watching TV, daydreaming, having a bath, taking a walk, doing nothing much, listening to music, being on your own, spending time in nature. Most surprising was that at No 1 was... reading.</p> <p>And it was while reading <em>The Art of Rest</em> that, by chance, I also dipped into Charlie Mackesy\u2019s new picture book for adults <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/09/boy-mole-fox-horse-christmas-bestseller-charlie-mackesy\" title=\"\"><em>The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse</em></a> (a more restful book, illuminated by the consolation of low expectations, could scarcely be imagined).

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> I rent in London and I\u2019m on a yearly wage of \u00a328,000. When I have saved enough to put down a deposit on a property (ironically I can save more in London as I have very cheap rent) I would like to move out of London and buy a home in Norfolk. My prospective wages in Norfolk would be \u00a326,000 and I would like to buy a flat for around \u00a380,000 to \u00a3100,000. I can\u2019t work out the logistics. Do I buy now with a deposit of \u00a310,000 or wait until I have a larger deposit of \u00a320,000? And do I get a mortgage based on my current wages or my prospective wages?</p> <p>I understand that mortgage lenders prefer that you\u2019ve been in the same job for a couple of years, so should I relocate now and work in Norfolk (and rent) for a couple of years? Or does the fact that I\u2019ve been in my current job in London for four years show that I\u2019m a good bet? <strong>RH</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you were to apply for a mortgage now, yes the four years in your current job would work in your favour. However, if you waited until you were in your new job before applying, the length of time you were with a former employer would make no difference. The good news is that many lenders are prepared to offer mortgages to people who have been in a new job for just 12 months although there are some who require three years employment in the same job. But according to Pete Mugleston, managing director of <a href=\"http://www.onlinemortgageadviser.co.uk\">Online Mortgage Advisor</a>, \u201cthere are lenders willing to consider your new job from day one and some even up to three months before you start if it\u2019s a permanent full-time position\u201d. So waiting until you get your new job in Norfolk may not be a problem but it would make sense to use a mortgage advisor able to identify a lender willing to lend to people in your circumstances. Waiting until you have a larger deposit of \u00a320,000 also makes sense as it\u2019ll help you to secure a competitive mortgage deal.</p> <p>If you had been about to become newly self-employed \u2013 rather than moving to a new job \u2013 the majority of lenders would turn you down until you have three years\u2019 worth of accounts or tax statements from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). But with the right sort of specialist help from advisers that Online Mortgage Advisor can put you in touch with, it is possible that even the newly self-employed can find a lender who will take them on. </p> <p><br></p>",

When I have saved enough to put down a deposit on a property (ironically I can save more in London as I have very cheap rent) I would like to move out of London and buy a home in Norfolk. My prospective wages in Norfolk would be \u00a326,000 and I would like to buy a flat for around \u00a380,000 to \u00a3100,000. I can\u2019t work out the logistics. Do I buy now with a deposit of \u00a310,000 or wait until I have a larger deposit of \u00a320,000? And do I get a mortgage based on my current wages or my prospective wages? I understand that mortgage lenders prefer that you\u2019ve been in the same job for a couple of years, so should I relocate now and work in Norfolk (and rent) for a couple of years? Or does the fact that I\u2019ve been in my current job in London for four years show that I\u2019m a good bet? RH A If you were to apply for a mortgage now, yes the four years in your current job would work in your favour. However, if you waited until you were in your new job before applying, the length of time you were with a former employer would make no difference. The good news is that many lenders are prepared to offer mortgages to people who have been in a new job for just 12 months although there are some who require three years employment in the same job. But according to Pete Mugleston, managing director of Online Mortgage Advisor, \u201cthere are lenders willing to consider your new job from day one and some even up to three months before you start if it\u2019s a permanent full-time position\u201d. So waiting until you get your new job in Norfolk may not be a problem but it would make sense to use a mortgage advisor able to identify a lender willing to lend to people in your circumstances. Waiting until you have a larger deposit of \u00a320,000 also makes sense as it\u2019ll help you to secure a competitive mortgage deal. If you had been about to become newly self-employed \u2013 rather than moving to a new job \u2013 the majority of lenders would turn you down until you have three years\u2019 worth of accounts or tax statements from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). But with the right sort of specialist help from advisers that Online Mortgage Advisor can put you in touch with, it is possible that even the newly self-employed can find a lender who will take them on.",

The hate crime was not made public by Britain\u2019s largest force at the time and the culprit has not been caught. The swastika was found in February drawn on an inside wall at Edmonton police station in Enfield, north London, in an area only accessible to officers and staff. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), said it had not been informed of the incident nor made aware of Scotland Yard\u2019s investigation into it. The Met said it had launched a thorough investigation into the swastika graffiti, which it had classed as a faith-based hate crime, but could not identify the perpetrator. The former chief superintendent Victor Olisa, head of diversity at Scotland Yard from 2016-17 and former commander of the borough of Haringey, said: \u201cHow can this happen in a part of the station where only officers and staff go, and someone feels confident enough to draw a swastika in a police station. \u201cPeople have been saying things are getting worse on diversity and equality in the Met. \u201cIt could be someone with far-right sympathies who is confident to express that in a secure part of a police station.\u201d Olisa said the incident would be \u201cdeeply shocking and upsetting\u201d for minority ethnic officers in the station. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why it is being treated as a faith-based hate crime.

The graffiti, in biro, was a swastika symbol.\u201d The Met said it treated the incident seriously, adding: \u201cThe incident was recorded as a faith hate crime and a senior investigating officer at detective chief inspector level was appointed to investigate the offence.\u201d The Met confirmed the area the swastika was found in was not accessible to the general public and could only be accessed by those who work for the force and have clearance: \u201cA thorough investigation was undertaken but no forensic opportunities were identified. As a result, it was not possible to identify who had drawn the graffiti.\u201d The Met declined to answer if any employee was spoken to or interviewed under caution, and added: \u201cWe take all hate crime seriously and have a zero tolerance approach.\u201d Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, a national project that documents hate crime, said: \u201cTo have a swastika, a Nazi symbol, in an area which police officers and staff alone have access to, is worrying. \u201cWhile this is an isolated incident, it is deeply concerning. This also raises questions about the institution and whether such incidents are truly isolated. \u201cThe local force should undertake a thorough investigation to reassure communities that there is zero tolerance towards any form of racism within the force.\u201d The former Met superintendent Leroy Logan said he had to deal with racist graffiti on his locker while serving in the 1980s and the news of the swastika incident left him worried that things were going backwards in the capital\u2019s police force. He said the potential effect on officers could be significant: \u201cIt stuns you, it makes you fearful and angry at the same time. You think: \u2018These are the people I work with, and my life may be in their hands.\u2019\u201d Logan said the incident would also undermine community confidence \u201cThese people [extremists] have infiltrated the police culture and can impact how a diverse population is served.\u201d Police rules ban officers or staff supporting extreme rightwing groups. A spokesperson for the IOPC said they had not been informed of the incident: \u201cPolice forces must refer the most serious incidents to us \u2013 whether someone has made a complaint or not. Police forces can also refer incidents to us if they have concerns, for instance about the conduct of their officers or staff.\u201d Olisa said: \u201cI\u2019m surprised it was not referred. You refer something to the IOPC where there is likely to be reputational damage, damage to public confidence or potential operational culpability. \u201cI am really surprised the Met has not dealt with it as robustly as I would have expected for an organisation that takes hate crime and integrity seriously.\u201d",

Philip Rycroft, the former permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the EU, told the Guardian: \u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a huge negotiation, probably four or five times bigger than the withdrawal agreement negotiation<strong> </strong>and will absorb a huge amount of government effort.\u201d </p> <p>Trade is a top priority for both sides. Rycroft, who oversaw post-Brexit planning at DexEU ahead of the original 29 March deadline, said the government had already done a huge amount of work. Some on the EU side wonder whether it will be enough. Lotta Nymann-Lindegren, a former diplomat, who followed Brexit for the Finnish government, said: \u201cThe discrepancy between the two sides will be bigger in phase two because the United Kingdom has not negotiated any trade agreements in the past 40 years or so.\u201d That \u201cexperience gap\u201d will be \u201ca challenge for the negotiations that will influence how fast we can go\u201d, she added.</p> <h2>Deadlines</h2> <p>On Brexit day, the countdown clocks will reset to a new deadline. If the UK leaves on 31 January, only 11 months remain to hammer out the basics of the future relationship. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, told the Guardian that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/michel-barnier-tells-uk-ignore-eu-regulatory-standards-at-your-peril\">it would be possible to negotiate a basic free-trade deal in that time</a>.</p> <p>In private, Brussels is much more sceptical. \u201cNot in my wildest dreams would I imagine that a possibility,\u201d one senior EU diplomat said of the 11-month timetable, citing the difficulties of agreeing a zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal if the UK seeks to diverge from EU standards on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.</p> <p>To woo Nigel Farage and Brexit party voters, the prime minister insists that he can negotiate the deal in 11 months, with no extension of the transition period. Labour wants a back-up plan and is pressing to avoid <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-50109643/keir-starmer-brexit-deal-a-trap-door-to-no-deal\">\u201cthe trap door to no</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-50109643/keir-starmer-brexit-deal-a-trap-door-to-no-deal\"> deal\u201d</a> on 31 December 2020. Under the transition, the UK remains part of the EU single market and customs union, without decision-making power or representation. The government has until 1 July 2020 to agree with the EU a one-off extension of the transition period, until the end of 2021 or 2022.</p> <p>If the next government seeks to extend the transition, it could soon run into trouble. Aside from a potential political backlash against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/02/word-of-the-week-steven-poole-vassal\">\u201cvassalage\u201d</a> and the inevitable extra payments to the EU budget that come with a longer transition, a decision on extension risks becoming hostage to a deal on fisheries.</p> <p>The two sides want to agree future fishing quotas by 1 July 2020. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, once described fisheries as \u201ca lever\u201d in the future negotiations \u2013 a sign of how seriously EU governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-fish-eu-trawlers-set-new-course-post-brexit\">treat this small, but politically-sensitive industry</a>. EU diplomats do not exclude that a fisheries deal may be a quid pro quo for extending the transition. \u201cGiven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/michel-barnier-eu-brexit-extension-boris-johnson-election\">how France acts now</a>, it\u2019s very likely that they will be a difficult partner,\u201d another senior diplomat told the Guardian.</p> <h2>It\u2019s much more than trade</h2> <p>Both sides want to prioritise security, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/brexit-could-bring-back-bad-old-days-of-costa-del-warns-mep\">a replacement for the European arrest warrant</a> and access to crime-fighting databases that are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/europol-chief-says-brexit-would-harm-uk-crime-fighting\"> used every day by British police</a>. While negotiators share the same goal, the terrain is strewn with political minefields, such as Brussels\u2019 insistence that database access is linked to EU rules on data protection and the oversight of the European court of justice, or Germany\u2019s constitutional ban on extraditing its nationals to non-EU countries.</p> <p>Beyond trade and security, there is <strong>\u2026 </strong>everything else. The political declaration agreed between Boris Johnson and the EU reveals what lies beneath the tip of the iceberg. The two sides want agreements or cooperation on aviation, carbon pricing, anti-money laundering, illegal migration, data protection, sanctions on rogue states, and much more.</p> <h2>The EU</h2> <p>The next Brexit chapter could be more testing for the EU. During phase one, the 27 had a shared interest in seeing the UK pay the Brexit bill and protect the rights of their nationals in the UK. Under phase two, their goals diverge somewhat: \u201cThe interests of the EU side are more diverse, whether [they focus on] industrial produce, whether it is the labour force they provide, whether it is fisheries,\u201d suggests Nymann-Lindegren. Other Brussels sources are more optimistic about maintaining unity, suggesting that member states will be united against any attempt by the European commission\u2019s trade department to run the British talks in secret.</p> <h2>What about schools and hospitals?</h2> <p>While British officials are racking up Eurostar miles, the main parties hope to return to the traditional domestic agenda on public services. But political time and capital will be spent on creating a new immigration system, laws on farming and fishing, competition and industry. Before the referendum, British sources predicted Brexit could dominate the annual Queen\u2019s speech for several years after the vote. Under the withdrawal act bill, 46 years of EU law will be copy-pasted on to the UK statute book.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt would be very odd if the conclusion of all of that is we are not going to do anything about it,\u201d Rycroft said. \u201cIt rather obviates the point of coming out.\u201d</p> <p>Just as the laws are repatriated, so are the controversies, especially over issues such as farm subsidies, GM crops or state aid. An extra layer of complexity will be tussles between Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast (if the Stormont assembly sits) over who gets to repatriate powers from the EU.</p> <h2>Looking for Global Britain</h2> <p>So far, the government has managed to negotiate 18 \u201ccontinuity\u201d deals covering 48 countries and 8% of UK trade, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47213842\">according to the BBC</a>. But these deals simply rollover existing agreements the UK enjoys as an EU member. For Brexiters, the prize is new trade deals, although the government\u2019s own analysis <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/will-uk-benefit-independent-trade-policy\">shows that gains will be marginal</a> at best. Looking at these \u201cspeculative\u201d gains in the middle distance, the UK\u2019s former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, has said: \u201cThere is just an immense volume of technical work, even to aim to stand still, not roll backwards, in the next few years.\u201d</p> <h2>Hard choices</h2> <p>The saga of withdrawal has obscured the debate on what Brexit means. EU officials worry that there is no British consensus on the post-Brexit future: whether it is a distant Canada-style free trade deal favoured by Boris Johnson, or the closer ties sought by Labour. Without consensus at Westminster, negotiations in Brussels could soon get stuck again. \u201cThe UK needs to have a majority for a vision of Brexit,\u201d the senior diplomat said. \u201cOtherwise we face the same problem. They need to know what their aim is.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">Donald Trump\u2019s verbal grenade lobbed into the British campaign</a> was a reminder that the UK has a choice: to follow European standards or embrace US regulatory norms. It is the chlorinated chicken conundrum: if the UK chooses to allow imports of US chlorine-washed chicken (and other produce) it will face much tighter controls on the food it can export to the EU, as well as price pressure on British farmers. There is no middle way between regulatory superpowers.</p> <p>Those unanswered questions are why those who were involved in withdrawal hope that Brexit will be at the centre of the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think the public is ready for [phase two],\u201d Rycroft said. He hopes that politicians \u201cwill level up with the public and give them a clear intention of what is coming down the track, because this story is by no means at an end\u201d.</p>",

But Taylor continued to stonewall, claiming he had already \u201cdealt\u201d with the matters in question.

The problem with that solution is it would put our security agencies in a position of power over the federal parliament and over the ministry, and fundamentally undermine one of the core tenets of the Westminster system. The only criteria to being appointed to the cabinet is to be first elected to the parliament and second to be chosen by a prime minister. The idea that you would need a tick-off from a security agency is going down the J Edgar Hoover path and that\u2019s not something that any Australian would be comfortable with.</p> <p><strong>Question</strong>: Can we be sure, can we be sure that there isn\u2019t an agent of a foreign government in this place?</p> <p><strong>JP</strong>: Unless there\u2019s evidence to suggest there is I think we can be confident that there isn\u2019t. It would be, I don\u2019t think we should make leaps to assume that there might be just because there\u2019s been an attempt in this case.</p> <p><strong>Question</strong>: It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have to comply with other checks on being in the executive or parliament. You have to declare about your citizenship and that can exclude you. Why isn\u2019t this something that we should be able to investigate?</p> <p><strong>JP</strong>: That\u2019s a constitutional requirement, which has been put there for a purpose many years ago. This would be introducing a new requirement that would be very unusual in our political system.</p> <p><strong>Question</strong>: You can\u2019t be bankrupt either. And that\u2019s something where you can be declared bankrupt by the ATO. That\u2019s a non-government \u2013</p> <p><strong>JP: </strong>Again, a constitutional requirement inserted for good reasons 100 years ago. This would be a brand new requirement for an arm of the executive government to have a say over the parliamentary wing of our democracy. I think that would be a retrograde step.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T23:57:05.869Z\">at 11.57pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ddb17738f087b800b6206e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T23:51:38.371Z\">11.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nek minnit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pablovinales/status/1198750220789510144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Do you really trust China?

His stance on this issue has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/09/liberals-mathias-cormann-andrew-hastie-peter-dutton-china-australia\">caused splits within the Liberal party room</a>, with <strong>Mathias Cormann</strong> having chastened him, but I would think that today Hastie will have a few knowing looks to throw Cormann\u2019s way.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T22:09:31.711Z\">at 10.09pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ddaf69e8f087b800b62066c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T21:32:07.625Z\">9.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Honestly, it is all anyone wants to talk about today, and understandably. <strong>Richard Marles</strong> says Labor has requested a briefing on the allegations:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, obviously, these are very concerning allegations that have been made.

That was quite the weekend, wasn\u2019t it?!</p> <p>It is not hyperbole to say that those within Parliament House have been pretty well rocked by confirmation Australia\u2019s spy agency is \u201cactively investigating\u201d claims China attempted to install a spy into the parliament.</p> <p>The director general of security casually dropped this tweet late last night:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MikePBurgess/status/1198560368185901056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s a statement I\u2019ve just issued <a href=\"https://t.co/qXyg3Q39DB\">https://t.co/qXyg3Q39DB</a></p>&mdash; Mike Burgess (@MikePBurgess) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikePBurgess/status/1198560368185901056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 24, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And what did that statement say?<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reporting on Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes contains allegations that Asio takes seriously. </p> <p>As the director general of security, I am committed to protecting Australia\u2019s democracy and sovereignty. </p> <p><strong>Australians can be reassured that Asio was previously aware of matters that have been reported today, and has been actively investigating them. </strong></p> <p>However, in accordance with long-standing practice, I will not comment on this particular operational matter, including any detail of the individuals involved.

Not only did Asio feel the need to issue a statement on the Nine story, it also confirmed it has been aware of it, and is investigating it. For Australia\u2019s notoriously secretive security agency, that is quite the step.</p> <p>It all relates to <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/china-tried-to-plant-its-candidate-in-federal-parliament-authorities-believe-20191122-p53d9x.html\">this story from Nine newspapers and 60 Minutes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australian authorities are investigating claims that a Chinese espionage ring tried to install an agent for Beijing in a seat in federal parliament.</p> <p>Sources with knowledge of the alleged plot believe the suspected Chinese intelligence group offered a million dollars to pay for the political campaign of Liberal party member and Melbourne luxury car dealer <strong>Bo \u201cNick\u201d Zhao</strong>, 32, to run for an eastern suburbs seat. The plot appears to be part of an operation to place a Chinese agent in parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>Zhao was found dead in a Mount Waverley motel room in March. Local police have not been able to conclude how he died, making his death the subject of a coronial investigation.</p> <p>Of course, that story came on top of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/23/defecting-chinese-spy-who-revealed-espionage-in-australia-has-legitimate-claim-for-asylum-labor-says\">the news that a man, who says he worked for Chinese intelligence, has defected to Australia.</a> <strong>Wang Liqiang </strong>has applied for asylum in Australia after he admitted he had been personally involved with Chinese espionage activities, including political interference operations within the region. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/defecting-former-chinese-spy-a-convicted-fraudster-shanghai-police-claim\">Beijing has denied his claims</a>, and says he is a convicted fraudster.

Medevac and ensuring integrity are still high on the government\u2019s wish list, but, as always the crossbench is the key. It looks like the government has agreed to Pauline Hanson\u2019s amendments for the union bill, but she is still holding out. Jacqui Lambie has a diary full of meetings when it comes to medevac. Keep a close eye on that one. Tonight, the Indonesian free-trade agreement will also pass the parliament. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s gone through when you hear Kim Carr\u2019s teeth grind. Tomorrow, all of the party room meetings will be held. We\u2019ll keep you up to date on that, and whatever else happens from now until the close of the blog tomorrow - partly because what else would we be doing than spending our short time on earth staring into the #auspol abyss, but also because you guys make it more than worth it. A massive thank-you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin for dragging me through another day. Also, a shout out to ibuprofen for making question time as bearable as possible when vodka is not available. But at the end of the day, at least none of us are the people who designed the new Parliament House coffee shop (replacing the coffee cart) to have the order window right next to the elevators, meaning it all has to be re-done and, after months of construction, still won\u2019t be open until next year. Onwards and upwards. And as always \u2013 take care of you. Something to watch out for, tomorrow Sarah Hanson-Young: When a man does the wrong thing he should apologise, and when he doesn\u2019t he should be called out. And that\u2019s what I did in this case - and I did it, not for me, but for every woman and girl across the country who has ever been told to stay silent, made to stay silent. Made to feel as if speaking out ... would cause more harm. It is absolutely important that every young girl knows they have the right to be treated with respect and treated equally ... in the classroom, the workplace, if she works in a shop, the front bar, or here in the nation\u2019s parliament ... I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over. This is a really important decision. What the judge has found is that Mr Leyonhjelm was motivated by malice, that he wanted to publicly shame me. I\u2019ve been awarded damages, they will be donated to two really important women\u2019s charities. [Plan International and the South Australian Working Women\u2019s Centre]... This is an important day for this parliament to put a line under this type of behaviour. It doesn\u2019t matter if you work in a shop or a factory floor or the parliament. Every woman deserves to be treated with respect. If you see someone doing the wrong thing - stand with that woman and help call it out.\u201d Hanson-Young became emotional during the press conference - this has been a pretty drawn out and rough road for the senator, who has often spoken about the example she wants to set for her daughter in calling out behaviour like this. Emotion never means weakness. Sometimes it is a necessary release. I am shocked, SHOCKED* at this news *Not shocked. At all. The latest family law inquiry is under way \u2013 but a Greens motion has just passed the Senate calling on it to be halted until the government can guarantee women who give evidence will have protections. That is because Pauline Hanson, the deputy chair, has already made her views known \u2013 asserting many women were \u201cliars\u201d in the court in order to get custody. From Larissa Waters: If the government persists in conducting the politicised family law inquiry, it is vital that more is done to keep women who participate safe from violence and harm. The Greens have reached across party lines and the Australian Senate has agreed the inquiry should not proceed until the government can guarantee strong protections for witnesses. This would include the ability for giving evidence in confidence or remotely, ensuring safe access to hearing venues, and strict media protocols. It would also mean support for survivors of violence, including funding specialist services to meet increased demand resulting from this inquiry. This toxic inquiry is unsafe for women and children. The establishment of the inquiry has already unleashed a torrent of victim-shaming and blaming women. The government should not be subjecting women who have experienced domestic violence and abuse to further trauma when the evidence is already available on the type of changes needed for improving the family court system. The government has yet to implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission review of the family law system or earlier inquiries. It should prioritise evidence-based strategies to make family law safer for victims and survivors of family violence, rather than allowing this compromised inquiry to go ahead. Julie Collins had a bit to say about the half-a-billion-dollar aged care package announced by the government today (Scott Morrison says this is a start, with more to come in the budget). Question: What do you make of the government\u2019s excuse for not rolling out the packages quickly, saying that would lead to a pink batts-style disaster? JC: The government has been there for six years. It has seen the home care package waitlist in the last two years blow out from 88,000 to 120,000 older Australians that are waiting. The government has had sitting on its desk, for more than a year, a report on the workforce that it commissioned. The government has been sitting on its hands. It\u2019s had six years, four ministers and ripped billions of dollars out of aged care. Question: Do you agree with the government that this is a more complicated scenario than just throwing more money at the system? That they do need to take the time to undertake potentially widespread reform to the system? JC: The government has known about the home care waitlist for two and half years almost. It is not acceptable to say we need to wait when the royal commissioners\u2019 number one urgent priority in its interim report was to fund more home care. When the royal commissioners said it was neglect not to fund more home care surely the royal commissioners who are doing the job the prime minister asked them to do are expecting the government to respond with more. Sarah Hanson-Young has followed up with a statement: I am pleased with the court\u2019s decision today. When men do the wrong thing, they should apologise. Most men do. But when they don\u2019t, they should be called out. Taking legal action was a hard decision to make, and one that could not have happened without the immense support from regular everyday Australians who want better treatment and respect for women in our workplaces, our homes and our community. All I ever wanted was for Mr Leyonhjelm to apologise for his hurtful remarks and bad behaviour. He refused. The court\u2019s decision today has vindicated my decision to stand up and call it out. Justice White found that the defences that Mr Leyonhjelm attempted failed. I was awarded substantial damages by the way of vindication, which I will donate to charity. The Court accepted that aspects of Mr Leyonhjelm\u2019s conduct warranted an order for aggravated damages. The court found that Mr Leyonhjelm was actuated by malice with the intention of publicly shaming me. No woman deserves to be bullied and harassed in her workplace - not on the shop floor, in the office, in the factory or in the Parliament. Not all women are able to stand up to the men that bully and harass them. As a member of parliament I am in a privileged position, and with privilege comes a responsibility to act for others. This is why I will be donating the money raised from this case to two important organisations that fight for women and girls every day. Plan International and the Working Women\u2019s Centre in South Australia; two organisations that work at the coalface of inequality and discrimination. Calling out bad behaviour and holding those who harass and belittle women to account is essential for society if we are to achieve true equality. I took this action because my daughter and her peers deserve to grow up in a society where women, young and old, married or single, rich or poor are treated with respect, free of discrimination, harassment and sexist slurs. Our nation\u2019s Parliament is an important and revered institution; it should set the standard of appropriate behaviour and model values of respect and equality for all. Bullies must be taken on and held to account, no matter where they work or what privileges their title brings. I would like to thank everyone who has donated to help this legal case happen. And to the many women, girls and decent men who have shared their stories of hurt, pain and hope with me, thank you for your support, trust and encouragement. It is for every woman and girl who has been told to or made to stay silent in the face of harassment and disrespect that I have taken this legal action. Today\u2019s ruling is a win for them. How Mike Bowers saw question time: Adam Bandt followed up on his question time query of Scott Morrison with this statement: The Prime Minister\u2019s refusal to apologise for his clearly misleading comments is insensitive and cruel. Australia is not some 1.3% minnow as the Prime Minister suggests. The PM cannot keep denying the truth that Australia is the world\u2019s third biggest exporter of pollution. The action we take on the climate crisis matters. Every day that Scott Morrison denies the destructive impact of Australia\u2019s pollution is another day he fails in his first duty to keep the Australian public safe.\u201d Barnaby Joyce was in the chamber today, so he has returned from wherever he tweeted this from: Sarah Hanson-Young will be holding a press conference on the court decision on her defamation case in the next 20 minutes. Mike Bowers has not stopped, all day And the results are in: Scott Morrison calls time. Lucky. It is 25 November \u2013 the VERY SAME DAY The Mousetrap opened at the Ambassadors theatre in London. Theatres have trapdoors. You can throw yourself down trapdoors. COINCIDENCE? Probably not to Angus Taylor. Tony Burke to Angus Taylor: When parliament last sat the minister said in relation to his letter to the Sydney lord mayor: \u201cThe document was drawn directly from the city of Sydney\u2019s website.\u201d Does the minister now accept that he was misleading the parliament? Taylor: I have already dealt with this and I will table a copy of my statement from 25 October. Now Mr Speaker, Labor and their mates have an insatiable appetite for gossip and smear. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. We won\u2019t be lectured to on integrity by the party of ... and boxes full of cash. I can advise the House that the manager of opposition business over there wrote to me on Friday about my statement. The very same day that Eddie Obeid was paroled. Now ... Burke stands up for a point of order, but Taylor has decided he has finished his answer, because Tony Burke tells him he can\u2019t talk about Labor. Ladies and gentlemen \u2013 your Rhodes scholar. Vince Connelly, whose main claim to fame so far is that he delivers each dixer like that kid that assumed every drama production lead role belonged to them because they saw Shakespeare in the Park that one time, gets up to inflict the HOW SAFE ARE YOU Peter Dutton special on the chamber. He gets cheers for standing, which is only going to encourage him. Oh \u2013 and you\u2019re like totes safe. BUT IMAGINE IF LABOR WAS IN POWER. Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: Exactly a year ago today the minister promised, on 21 March, 2019, the flash glucose monitor will be sudsidised on the PBS scheme. It still hasn\u2019t happened. Can the minister explain to Australia\u2019s 120,000 type 1 diabetics why not? Greg Hunt: And I\u2019m delighted to respond to the member for McMahon because as is frequently the case his supposition is false. We made the commitment that we would deliver flash glucose monitoring when the company met the terms and conditions of the available program. In particular, let me read from the Department of Health. \u2018The government also announced its intention to include the freestyle flash glucose monitoring ... subject to price negotiations with the product sponsor. Negotiations with the product sponsor are ongoing and further information will be provided once negotiations are complete or as the department also issued flash glucose monitoring subsidised. Flash GSN will be included subject to price negotiations with the product sponsor.\u2019 But, very interestingly, what we have done is what the previous government never did. What Labor never did. We have provided continuous glucose monitoring. Seven products, at an expected price of approximately $300 million, are now available. And significantly, as part of that, what that means is that for children and youths under 21 years of age we have flash continuous glow course monitoring which is available. Seven different products. We have also made sure that for pregnant mothers this program is available and we have also made sure that for people over the age of 21 on concessional cards, they also have access to that program. And at the same time we were absolutely clear in setting out the terms and conditions. And the reason why we do that is because we have advice from the medical experts that those are the terms and conditions. And one of the things that has been the hallmark of this government is we have taken the advice of the medical experts. He goes on, but Labor\u2019s main argument here is that the measure was announced without any caveats \u2013 and now there are caveats. The ASRC is also in parliament today. Its statement: The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) has sent a delegation to Parliament, including CEO Kon Karapanagiotidis to appeal to Senators, especially Senator Lambie to vote against Minister Dutton\u2019s full Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019. The ASRC has witnessed first hand the medical crisis and medical neglect of people held offshore, through visiting in 2017 and with our ongoing detention advocacy work over the past six years. Since 2016, Australia\u2019s human rights legal community in partnership with medical, refugee service and advocate communities have had to force the Coalition government to medically transfer critically sick children and their families and men and women to Australia to save their lives. The passing of the Medevac laws, with joint agreement from The Labor, Greens and cross bench in February 2019 meant an efficient and medically led process for the medevac of sick people. The power of the Medevac laws lie in the balance struck between doctors working to address medical need of offshore detention patients with preserving Ministerial veto of Medevac applications for specific reasons with evidence. All without affording political interference in doctors work. Medevac is working: The Minister has approved 86% of all doctors applications and no one has died in offshore processing from medical neglect since. Labor has asked how big the \u201csmall cohort\u201d of people who will have their robodebts reassessed is, with Senator Deb O\u2019Neill noting staff have been told it might be up to 600,000. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, replies that Services Australia is \u201cin the process of identifying those impacted by this particular measure\u201d: There is no value whatsoever in pre-empting that process. And it\u2019s important to note that income averaging does not occur in all debt determinations. Ruston claims that those who get debts based solely on income averaging tend to be those who have \u201cchosen not to engage\u201d when Centrelink contacts them. As we revealed in a feature at the weekend, Deanna Amato \u2013 one of the plaintiffs challenging the robodebt system \u2013 received repeated notices to an old address. So much for choosing not to engage with the system! Senator Jim Molan gets the next dixer, and is greeted with cries of \u201cHeeeee\u2019s back!\u201d from the Labor benches. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert: Given that the government has now suspended robodebt after three years of operation, is it because the Coalition government at the time of creating it either, a) didn\u2019t seek legal advice, or b) had inaccurate legal advice or c) received legal advice but just didn\u2019t think that Australians would notice the government unjustly enriching itself at the expense of the most vulnerable in Australian society? Robert: Let me say very categorically this government does not apologise for its efforts to protect the integrity of the welfare system. We will not apologise ... for ... [what] we are lawfully required to do. Now, just last week, we made a refinement to the income compliance project. Refinements that have been made over time. For example, on 15 June 2010 the then member for human services, the member for McMahon, said \u2018It\u2019s important the government explores different means of debt recovery to ensure those that have received more money than they are entitled to repay their debt.\u2019 A press release outlining the tax project. ... The current income compliance program started 29 June 2011 and has continued from that day. Refinements have been made to that program since that time. The refinement that was made last week, the refinement that was made last week, has strengthened the program whereby debts raised ... Income matching will require greater proof points. Just before the election the member for Maribyrnong made it very clear in his interview on 9 May that we want to make sure that people aren\u2019t receiving welfare to which they\u2019re not entitled and no one gets a leave pass on that. The member for Maribyrnong said that. And this government agrees 100 per cent. with the leader of the opposition \u2013 sorry, the former leader of the opposition. That no one gets a leave pass. No one at all. We have an absolute legal responsibility to collect debts owed to the commonwealth. The refinement that has now been [applied means] debts raised solely on income averaging will have greater proof points applied to them. It actually is. George Christensen summons Michael McCormack to the despatch box. McCormack, looking like the word oatmeal, somehow manages to make the carpet interesting. Speaking of the Naif (see a few posts down) Better. Mangoes. I mean ... Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: \u201cHow can 23 million breaches of the law be a matter for the board if you\u2019re a bank, but legislation before the parliament right now does say that three breaches of paperwork can get you deregistered \u2026 if you\u2019re a union. How can there be corporate equivalence if unions will get three chances and banks will get 23 million?\u201d Christian Porter gets the nod \u2013 and has seemingly forgotten how microphones work in the break since the House last sat: Well, the premise of the question, Mr Speaker, is just absolutely and utterly incorrect, and the question carries an assertion that somehow a union or a branch of a union would be deregistered for non-serious matters. Totally and absolutely wrong. When the opposition talk about paperwork, and when you look at what this bill is actually being targeted towards, assaulting police five times, assault by kicking five times, wilful trespass seven timings, resisting arrest five times, theft, attempted theft by deception and intent to coerce nine times. It\u2019s paperwork. And that was just one bloke! That was just one guy. That was just John Setka. But it\u2019s all paperwork. They\u2019re like the black knight in Monty Python. The head gets chopped off, it\u2019s a paper cut. It\u2019s a wound. Labor has asked a string of questions to Marise Payne about the estimates that Australians have lost $1.3bn from wage theft since 2009. Payne runs through the government\u2019s response \u2013 including a commitment to criminalise the most serious forms of deliberate or systemic underpayment; and consideration of a low-cost fast-track process in the Fair Work Commission to get compensation. After every Labor question and mention of \u201cwage theft\u201d, Liberal senator Eric Abetz interjects with \u201clike the ABC!\u201d \u2013 in reference to $23m of estimated underpayment of casual staff. Not quite sure what the takeaway here is ... if even the good folks at the ABC get it wrong, industrial law must be really difficult? Josh Frydenberg takes the next lickspittle question on how Labor is to blame for the economy. Labor was last in government six years ago, the next election isn\u2019t for at least two and a half years \u2013 but you do you. Adam Bandt has the crossbench question and it sends the whole house into meltdown: Prime minister, if exporting pollution was an Olympic sport you\u2019d be on the podium with a medal around your neck. We\u2019re not some 1.3% minnow, we\u2019re the world\u2019s third-largest exporter of climate pollution. Will you apologise for misleading the public by saying nothing we could do would make a difference to the climate crisis and catastrophic bushfires \u2013 and given you are failing in the government\u2019s first duty, which is to protect its people, will have you the courage to apologise to the victims of the bushfires by exporting record amounts of thermal coal? Michael McCormack: \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace, when are you going to apologise ...\u201d Ed Husic: \u201cThat\u2019s not very woke of you, Mike.\u201d McCormack doesn\u2019t look like he gets it. Which is a timeless McCormack statement. Scott Morrison: The government believes, and is taking action to address climate change. And the government should, and the government is, Mr Speaker, by 2020, which is when the Kyoto targets were set for, we have the target that was set by the Labor party when they were in government and we will meet it. And we won\u2019t just meet it, we\u2019ll beat it by 367 million tonnes. So, Mr Speaker, the Australian government is in that group of countries which is beating, beating the commitments that we have made to the world, and we will continue to do that, Mr Speaker, with the commitments we have retained for the Paris targets. So, Mr Speaker, Australia is doing its bit when it comes to dealing with climate change. What we won\u2019t do is engage in the reckless targets supported by the Greens and the Labor party under this false promise, and I think dishonest promise, that the member has been spruiking both in this place and outside of this place, and that is to suggest that there is some trade-off. That if the government had adopted economy wrecking, as the Business Council described it, emission reduction cuts that were put forward by the Labor party at the last election, then these fires would not have taken place. That is an outright lie, Mr Speaker. It is an untruth and misleading to those going through some of the most difficult times of their lives. They have misled them grievously. We will not do that. Our government knows about the need to taking a stand on climate change and our record demonstrates we are meeting and beating our commitment. What we won\u2019t do, Mr Speaker, is engage in the reckless targets that have been put forward by the Greens and happily along with the Labor party, Mr Speaker, which will take people\u2019s jobs \u2013 and we will not support those reckless deals. Ged Kearney to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister say the leadership of a bank is up to the board after it has broken the law 23 million times, when at the same time he wants to shut down entire unions for minor paperwork breaches? Why does the prime minister have one rule for banks and another for working people? The government benches go NUTS. (\u201cOne for the blooper reel,\u201d one yells.) Morrison: The next time some union thug breaks someone\u2019s arm ... at the emergency clinic will say it\u2019s just paperwork, because it\u2019s a paperwork breach, Mr Speaker. For goodness sake, Mr Speaker. The banks will be pursued by the full force of the law. They\u2019ll be pursued by investigative agencies such as Austrac, who have been given the resources and powers to get on with the job, and they will have the availability of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime to punt those who are responsible under the law \u2013 to be brought into this place, which can see bank executives sent to prison for up to 15 years. Now, those opposite, the Labor party, are looking for any excuse to walk away from what they know is the right thing to do, to ensure that militant unionism has no place in this country. Master builders have made it pretty clear \u2013 30% increase in costs because of militant unionism in this country. It just doesn\u2019t break people\u2019s arms, Mr Speaker, it breaks their businesses as well and breaks the jobs that are so important. We\u2019re investing $100 billion in infrastructure investments in this country. We\u2019re expending more in rural communities on our federal road programs and our stimulus programs through local councils. And we don\u2019t want to see that money jeopardised and wasted. That is apparently championed by those opposite because they will not do the right thing. They will not apply the same penalties to those in the corporate sector, Mr Speaker, to the union sector. They won\u2019t do it, Mr Speaker, because all of them are here. ... they are beholden to this union movement and they are here to do their bidding, not the bidding of the Australian people. While Scott Morrison takes the next dixer (honestly, just stab me and get it over with), Andrew Hastie and Tim Wilson are having quite the serious conversation on the backbenches. It\u2019s like a furrowed brow-off. Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: When 16,000 older Australians died in one year waiting to receive the home care package for which they\u2019d already been approved, why did the prime minister announce only 10,000 new home care places today and why did the prime minister today put back only half of the $1.2 billion his own budget papers confirm he cut from aged care? Morrison: Under our government we\u2019ve been increasing funding for aged care by $1 billion a year Mr Speaker. I invite members of the opposition to engage with the government in response to the royal commission into aged care, which includes a response to those young Australians who find themselves in aged care facilities, to join with the government in progressing with the reforms that are necessary to address the matters raised in the royal commission. This has been the practice of the Liberal and National parties. I remember when the previous government was in office and we worked with the aged care minister at the time to take through some very difficult reforms, and I\u2019d invite the opposition to engage with the government as we continue to address the issues in the royal commission that are necessary. Mr Speaker, the royal commission has made it clear that the issues that we are addressing deal with a generation, a generation, of issues within the aged care system that go back over many governments, and I note the very sharp response from the Australian public ... which has been exhibited by some, not all, from the opposition. When we came to government there were 60,000 in home places. There are 150,000 today, Mr Speaker, and since the 18-19 budget we have put 44,000 additional places into the home care system. Now on top of that, as the minister was just explaining, it isn\u2019t just a system of throwing more places into the system. The system has to be able to absorb them with the training and the support to ensure that those places are delivered in a way that is safe and supportive of those Australians who need them. And I hear the jeers from those opposite, Mr Speaker. And I would caution them again. I invite them to work with the government to ensure that all Australians get ... the aged care that they need. That\u2019s why we called the royal commission. We\u2019re prepared to address the issues that come out of the royal commission into aged care and I would invite the opposition to join with us in a bipartisan way to ensure that we can deliver the support that they need and deserve and not play partisan politics. Darren Chester has wandered over to the crossbench for a conversation with Rebekha Sharkie. Labor has asked what sort of institution is facing claims it committed 23m breaches of anti-money laundering provisions: a union or a bank. Marise Payne replies that \u201cit\u2019s Westpac\u201d \u2013 setting up Labor supplementaries asking why Scott Morrison has said the consequence of the alleged breaches is \u201ca matter for the board\u201d when unions face deregistration for three paperwork breaches under the Coalition\u2019s Ensuring Integrity bill. Payne replies that Morrison also said he was \u201cabsolutely appalled\u201d by the alleged breaches, and it will be up to the courts to determine the result of civil penalty proceedings brought by Austrac. \u201cYou\u2019d expect it will be dealt with through the courts. As will the [penalties created by the] Ensuring Integrity bill.\u201d I\u2019m not sure the answer really met the thrust of the Labor attack that there is a double standard at work here. We move onto the first dixer, which was a recount of the aged care annoucement. We also get this announcement: Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Last week it was reported that an organisation had broken money laundering laws 23 million times. Was it a union...[or another organisation] Morrison: Thank you Mr Speaker. It was a bank. And that\u2019s why, Mr Speaker, that\u2019s why when I was treasurer I introduced what is known as the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s what I introduced, Mr Speaker. I note... Asic are examining these matters but Mr Speaker when it comes to these matters under the BEAR the legislation I had introduced into this House which those opposite actually tried to oppose and prevent being passed in this place, they eventually voted for it, but they showed some hesitation. ...Under that, the civil penalty is a maximum of $210 million for large banks, $52.5 million for medium sized banks and $10.5 million for smaller banks. Individuals can be disqualification and their remuneration may be reduced. They may also fall foul of over laws and the government increased civil penalties up to $1.05 million to up to $945,000 also with criminal penalties carrying 15 years imprisonment for individuals and to a greater of $9.5 million or three times the benefit gained or 10 per cent of the annual turnover for the companies. I note the ensuring integrity bill, the penalty maybe up to $21,000 or two years imprisonment. I won\u2019t cop it from those opposite coming in here and say - make these accusations. I think banks should take account of their manifest failures and I think union thugs should also. The government benches yell out their \u2018hear, hears\u2019 to which someone from Labor yells \u201cexecutive thugs\u201d And at 2.33pm, we get to the questions. Anthony Albanese finishes his indulgence motion on the bushfires, with this: We know that the priority, the immediate priority, is of course, protecting life and protecting property. And we also know that we are so grateful to the emergency service personnel and volunteers. But the fire season is starting earlier and finishing later. Our emergency leaders agree that extreme weather events in Australia will only increase in their severity and their frequency. And that\u2019s why I have written to the prime minister constructively to say that we need to continue to examine our preparedness for natural disasters. I have suggested calling a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments that is due to look at some practical measures, steps towards a new national strategy for disaster preparedness, ensuring national services and national parks services are appropriately funded at a state and federal level, extending the of Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting centre and providing funding. Research into natural disaster response and mitigation. Attract, retain and appropriately reward volunteers and enable businesses to support their staff who choose a volunteer. Labor has started its Senate question time attack on the aged care package \u2013 with Penny Wong asking why the government had unveiled just 10,000 home care packages when 16,000 people died waiting for a package in the last year and the shortfall is 120,000. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck said while the government had taken action to address growing demand for home care packages it had concerns that a significant growth could create a circumstance like the home insulation program pink batts which was rolled out so quickly it \u201cbrought in shonky players\u201d. In response to supplementary questions, he acknowledged the government had asked people to be \u201cpatient\u201d, which sets the Labor members off. Murray Watt heckles \u201cknock him off Johnno\u201d \u2013 a reference to his theory that Jonathon Duniam, another Tasmanian Liberal, can (and should) replace Colbeck in the ministry. The first dixer is also to Colbeck \u2013 just rehashing details of the $537m package announced on Monday. Madeleine King\u2019s phone just went off, causing the panicked OMG WHERE IS THE MUTE BUTTON search. Practically every MP in this chamber then checked their phone to make sure it was on silent. Turns out this isn\u2019t the centre of the universe and most people don\u2019t understand 2pm is QT. As someone whose phone has been on silent since 2008, I do not understand people with ringtones. Also - just text me. Who has time for a phone call? And don\u2019t get me started on people who leave voicemail messages. Thank you for listening to my Ted talk. Labor has responded to the Morrison government\u2019s aged care announcement: The Aged Care Royal Commission\u2019s scathing interim report set a serious challenge for real action on aged care but the Morrison Government has fallen at the first hurdle. The 10,000 additional home care packages announced today is just a drop in the ocean. 16,000 older Australians died in just one year while waiting for home care. There are 120,000 older Australians waiting for home care, with many waiting more than two years for the care they have been approved for. There is absolutely no guarantee Scott Morrison\u2019s miserly package will mean these older Australians receive care sooner. Today\u2019s announcement falls well short of what is required but it is true to form for the Prime Minister. Scott Morrison was the man who ripped $1.2 billion from aged care in his first Budget. As the number of older Australians waiting for home care grew from 88,000 to 120,000 the Prime Minister hasn\u2019t provided the home care older Australians need. The interim report of the Royal Commission described the unacceptable number of older Australians waiting for home care as \u2018unsafe practice\u2019 and \u2018neglect\u2019. The Government has failed these older Australians. The question for the Prime Minister and his Government today is: will older Australians desperately waiting for care get their home package any sooner? The Government has also been forced into an embarrassing back down on getting young people out of residential aged care just weeks after the Minister said they were doing \u2018enough\u2019. The Liberals have been asleep at the wheel for six years, with four Ministers and billions ripped out while Australia\u2019s aged care system has lurched from one crisis to another. Older Australians deserve better. Adam Bandt and the Greens want to amend how the government awards research grants: The Greens will move in the House and the Senate to reverse the Liberal government\u2019s recent politicisation of Australian Research Council grants by requiring the minister to publicly release all successful grant applications in a timely manner and without other government MPs or candidates involved. The government recently changed the ARC rules so that grants could be announced by Coalition MPs \u2013 and only Coalition MPs \u2013 even when the successful grant was outside the government MP\u2019s electorate. We move from condolence motions to an indulgence motion on the bushfires. Gladys Liu has a #shetoo badge pinned to her shirt today. I think that is about this campaign. Question time starts with a condolence motion for Queensland Labor MP Ben Humphreys. We are in the chamber for question time. Which means it is time for Who is that MP? It\u2019s Craig Kelly. In some ways, it is always Craig Kelly. Mike Bowers has been busy this morning: Goodness. It is almost question time. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility still doesn\u2019t have a CEO. There is some sort of Northern Australia function on this week, so I guess we could get an announcement soonish. One would think. Murray Watt, though, is enjoying his time as current Naif watcher: Despite current CEO Laurie Walker announcing she would not renew her contract nearly five months ago, Minister for Northern Australia Matt Canavan is yet to announce her replacement. Given the scathing Auditor-General\u2019s report on the NAIF\u2019s lack of transparency and management of conflicts of interest, it is critical that the new CEO has the required experience and is truly independent of the Minister and the Government. The $5 billion NAIF is already notorious for Coalition friendly appointments to its board, including a prominent LNP donor and a former CLP Deputy Chief Minister. Both have recently had their board positions renewed by Minister Canavan. The failure to appoint a new CEO is just one example of Matt Canavan\u2019s NAIF failures, which include: the NAIF releasing less than 1% of its funds, and not one cent in Queensland, four years after its creation; continuing to promote a failed NAIF loan to a Western Australian mining company; being forced to delay the NAIF\u2019s largest loan to date; and announcing the NAIF\u2019s fourth review in three years. Minister Canavan must use this week\u2019s Northern Australia statement to advise where the CEO search is up to, and when we can expect a new CEO to be appointed. And finally, on Wang Liqiang: Question: Can you guarantee the safety of Mr Wang and his family while his asylum claim is processed? Scott Morrison: He\u2019s in Australia. He\u2019s in Australia. We have the rule of law in Australia. And as a result then you can expect the same protections to apply to anyone who is living in our country, whether on a visa or any other arrangement. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that the director general of Asio has issued a statement on this matter about how it\u2019s being handled, and that\u2019s exactly how it should be handled. So I can assure Australians that under our government the resources have never been stronger, the laws have never been tougher, and the government has never been more determined to keep Australians free and safe from foreign interference. Scott Morrison on the Donald Trump phone call (after he was asked if he brought up the China issue): I don\u2019t go into my private conversations with the president. What I can say \u2013I thank you for the question about speaking to President Trump this morning. It was a great opportunity to say thank you to the president for the amazing work done to get Tim Weeks out and to get him on his way home. We appreciate the tremendous case. We work with them on many such cases. He was interested to know how we were going in relation to the terrible bushfires in Australia. He was very aware of that, and had been very impressed by the firefighting efforts of Australians, and [I] thanked him for the participation from our friends from the United States \u2013 as we do from all the other countries \u2013 who are helping us. We talked broadly about strategic issues in the region, like we always do, because we both have a keen interest in those. And so that was pretty much a good summary ... (Reporters say he hasn\u2019t answered the specific question) Morrison: I think I\u2019ve answered the question in a way I was happy to do it. Question: You have spoken about the broad threats that Australia faces. Could you perhaps comment on the specifics of the allegation that China tried to infiltrate the political party you lead in order to corrupt \u2026 Australia\u2019s democracy? Scott Morrison: I find the allegations deeply disturbing and troubling. And I refer you to the director general\u2019s statement, which said that these matters were already under investigation, and those investigations are continuing. I would caution anyone leaping to any conclusions about these matters. And that\u2019s why we have these agencies. I\u2019m not. But I do find the allegations troubling and disturbing. Question: Will we consider asylum for Wang Liqiang regardless of any threats of retribution from our biggest trading partner? Morrison: Well, I think we have to separate the issues here. Asylum claims are assessed on the merits, run through the Department of Home Affairs. That is the same case for this person, or anyone else who may make such a claim. That claim would be assessed about what they would be \u2013 a reasonable fear of persecution in their home country. If they were to make judgements along these lines, that would necessarily mean that any allegations they\u2019ve made, true or untrue, it would simply go to the specific circumstances of that individual. Now, I expect the department to make their decisions in the ordinary course of events, and they will do that. We will honour our obligations, as we always do, under the Refugee Convention. The prime minister then borrows a little more from the \u201cwe are the best in the world\u201d political playbook we have seen lately: What I am referring to is that the resources and the regime has been put in place to do its job, and any improvements, any additional matters that we would need to look at, on the basis of advice to address that, and the government would obviously \u2013 based on our record and form \u2013 we would do that. So these laws and these resources \u2013 and these institutions \u2013 are world-class. I mean, when I speak to other leaders, they look at our laws and they say, \u2018We want more of what they are having\u2019, when it comes to protecting their countries. They want the integration we have between our agencies. They want the legal frameworks that we\u2019ve had the courage to establish, and defend \u2013 and defend \u2013 in response to criticism of those laws. So, I can assure Australians our government will never be lacking on the watch when it comes to protecting Australia\u2019s legitimate interests in this area. Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference moves on to China. He chooses his words very, very carefully here: What Australia has done under our government is to strengthen the legal regime, to strengthen both the integrity and capacity of our intelligence and our law enforcement agencies, and to ensure the government is informed through the National Security Committee on the impacts of foreign interference like no government has ever been advised and informed before. Significant investment, significant legal reform, significant resourcing, finding the best people in the world to do these jobs, and keep us equipped to keep Australians safe and to protect the Australia that we love \u2013 that\u2019s the assurance I give Australians. Is he surprised by how aggressive China has allegedly been? Well, I will make a more general comment. I mean, a range of allegations have been made. The director general of intelligence \u2013 of ASIO \u2013 has issued a statement, which says that these matters were already under examination and that will continue. So I\u2019m not going to draw any conclusions about that one way or the other, as is appropriate. What I can say is Australia is not naive to the threats that it faces more broadly. And I mean more broadly. More broadly. And that\u2019s why we strengthened the laws, why we increased the resources, that\u2019s why we established the Department of Home Affairs, to bring together all of this in a single portfolio, to ensure Australia was in the best possible position to deal with any threats that come our way broadly. Or specifically. The public health association of Australia is also lobbying to keep medevac in place: The Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA) and Doctors for Refugees (D4R) have joined the voices of peak health organisations around Australia to urge the government not to repeal the Medevac legislation. \u2018The law is working to save lives,\u2019 said Dr Barri Phatarfod, President of Doctors for Refugees. \u2018It does not impact on refugee determinations or any immigration decisions. It simply allows people to receive the care they need.\u2019 Twelve people died in the offshore detention system before this law was introduced, with treatment delay being cited as a factor by the Queensland Coroner Terry Ryan last year. Since the law was passed earlier this year there have been no deaths and instead an orderly system has seen the transfer of critically ill refugees to Australia to receive treatment. \u2018The Medevac legislation provides a clear, formal process with the government\u2019s establishment of an expert panel of clinicians with the power to review all decisions. The minister has the discretion to intervene at every step,\u2019 Dr Phatarfod said. Mr Terry Slevin, CEO of PHAA said, \u2018Doctors should be the ones deciding health management, not politicians. Australians rightly have confidence in the judgement of our health professionals; we should let them get on with their job.\u2019 The current arrangements reduce the risk of prolonged, unnecessary delays in providing urgent medical care. \u2018We previously saw countless cases of delay causing real medical harm,\u201d said Dr Phatarfod. \u2018A young girl was in a coma from encephalitis, while a man waited weeks with ruptured abdominal organs before he was transferred for extensive surgery. No one wants to see more deaths.\u2019 Mr Slevin said, \u2018The Medevac law also eliminates the costly court cases which are initiated by the government when the doctors on-site recommended a patient\u2019s urgent transfer. And every time the court found in favour of the patient. This is an unconscionable and ultimately futile misuse of our resources.\u2019 Stuart Robert on getting people under 45 out of aged care homes: The targets we have agreed with the royal commission, which are their interim targets, is all those under 45 \u2013 about 170 Australians \u2013 out by 2022 and no new Australians going in, which means extensive work with ACAT as well as providers. And then ensuring the rest or the bulk of other Australians are out by 2025, where it is their choice to do so, noting that under the NDIS participants have choice and control. There will be circumstances where younger people may wish to stay. An example would be a middle-aged Australian, with disability, who wants to stay with Mum who\u2019s in a nursing home, would be a good example of where they may exercise that choice and control to stay. Scott Morrison says there will be more coming in the budget \u2013 that this is just the \u201cimmediate\u201d response: I want to assure all Australians that we will deal with these issues as you would if you were standing in my shoes today. I know quite precisely the sorts of things that you are thinking about at the moment when it comes to the treatment of your loved ones in aged care. My family is no different to yours in that respect. And so I have a very deep understanding of the difficult decisions that you\u2019re having to make, the conversations you\u2019re having to have with the partners, husbands, wives of those loved ones going into care, other siblings. This is hard. And you just want to be assured that they\u2019re going to get the care [they need]. I want that as much for your family as I want it for mine. I want the response of our government to have the same level of deep care and responsibility. Scott Morrison has begun his press conference: One of my first acts as PM was to call a royal commission into the aged care sector. And also to look specifically at the issues of young Australians who find themselves in aged care facilities around the country. I said at the time that I believed it would be a very uncomfortable exercise for all Australians as we listen to the stories and were shocked and disturbed at the treatment of our older Australians in their moments of greatest vulnerability. I think there are few families around the country, my own included, who are not unfamiliar with the difficult decisions that are made about relatives and loved ones who are placed into aged care facilities, whether those residential facilities or they\u2019re accessing in home care. It\u2019s a very sensitive issue. And rightly so for all Australians. In commissioning the royal commission, my intent was to ensure that we could shine quite a bright light, that we could learn deeply from the experiences and the practices that the royal commission was able to identify, and to assist us and deal with an issue which is not new. The royal commission\u2019s interim report, as talked about settings and processes and issues that are not new, that go back over many administrations over a long period of time. But it befalls to our government to be able to address the issues that are being identified out of the royal commission. As we\u2019ve had the interim response report from the royal commission, it is now tasked to provide an immediate response to that interim report, as I promised I would do before the end of the year. Addressing the specific issues that they highlighted in that interim report. These responses together do go to those matters. But I want to stress again that what we really need to establish above and beyond everything else is a culture of respect for older Australians. That this cultural change that has once again been highlighted I think by the interim report of the royal commission, it is something that goes to each and every Australian home. We will do our part as part of making that shift in that culture and also to do the practical things that are necessary now. Meanwhile, doctors are hoping to convince Jacqui Lambie to let medevac remain: The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) urges the Senate to maintain the transparency and medical oversight provisions of the Medevac legislation when it considers this important issue in the coming days. RACP President, Associate Professor Mark Lane, said: \u2018The medevac legislation allows medical experts to make decisions about health care for seriously ill individuals and ensure that they receive the medical treatment that they need in a clinically appropriate timeframe. \u2018The Independent Health Advice Panel (IHAP) has improved clinical oversight and ensured that medical decisions are being made by medical professionals. The independent oversight and greater accountability provided by this legislation has been critical in providing vital information to the Parliament and the Australian public. \u2018We know that previous delays and failures to transfer ill asylum seekers resulted in preventable suffering. Medical decisions should be made by medical professionals. As doctors, we continue to put patients first and uphold the basic human right to healthcare,\u2019 Associate Prof Lane said. The release continues: As the commission moves forward, this is what the Morrison government imagines the response will look like: Key reforms continue The Royal Commission\u2019s final report is due on 12 November 2020, however the Government\u2019s rigorous oversight of the sector and reform program continues. The Government has established a new independent aged care watchdog in the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, upgraded Aged Care Quality Standards and introduced regulations to minimise the use of restraints, and we are developing a Serious Incident Response Scheme. The Government is also expanding the powers of the Commission, with the new Commissioner responsible for the approval of aged care providers, compliance and enforcement actions in relation to the care being provided, and the administration of the responsibilities of approved providers to report assaults. While we undertake these reforms we will continue to deliver record funding for older Australians of $21.7 billion in 2019-20, growing to an estimated $25.4 billion in 2022-23, up from $13.3 billion in 2012-13. There will be more work to do across aged care as we continue to listen and respond to the issues raised by the Royal Commission. Like every Australian, we were appalled by the revelations of the Interim Report, however we will do everything we can to build an aged care system of the highest quality. The release continues: Building on longer term reforms These measures will complement the major reforms the Morrison Government has been undertaking to improve standards, oversight, funding and transparency in the care of older Australians. In line with the long-term direction as identified by the Royal Commission, we will also progress further measures, including; \u2022 providing simpler aged care assessments by creating a single assessment workforce and network; and \u2022 establishing a single unified system for care of our elderly in the home. We will unify the Home Care and Commonwealth Home Support Programs, in line with the Royal Commission\u2019s direction to deliver a seamless system of care, tailoring services to the needs of the individual. These changes will be guided by the final recommendations of the Royal Commission and will have the goal of improving care and ending the wait for home care packages. Simplifying the system for consumers The Government will streamline assessment by creating a single assessment workforce and a single network of assessment organisations that are able to undertake all aged care eligibility assessments. This will help people to be connected to care sooner, reduce duplication and inefficiencies, and stop a revolving door of assessments where vulnerable older people get sent to multiple organisations depending on the programs for which they are eligible. The release continues: Younger people in residential aged care In March, the Government announced the Younger People in Residential Aged Care Action Plan. Since this time there has been a reduction in the number of younger people in residential aged care, including a decline in the number of younger people entering the aged-care system. However, in response to the Royal Commission, the Government will strengthen the initial targets of the Younger People in Residential Aged Care Action Plan. The new targets, apart from in exceptional circumstances, will seek to ensure there are; \u2022 No people under the age of 65 entering residential aged care by 2022; \u2022 No people under the age of 45 living in residential aged care by 2022; and \u2022 No people under the age of 65 living in residential aged care by 2025. The Government will invest $4.7 million to help remove young people from residential aged care and further support these goals by: \u2022 establishing a Joint Agency Taskforce (JATF) between the Department of Social Services, Department of Health and National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to develop a new strategy that builds on the Action Plan and takes action to ensure these new targets are met; \u2022 establishing a specialist team within the NDIA to prevent younger people with a disability who are eligible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme from entering aged care. The specialist team will grow to 80 complex support needs planners by end March 2020 to find suitable accommodation and match participants to vacancies; \u2022 working with industry to identify all available Specialist Disability Accommodation and Supported Independent Living supports across the country to develop a database of existing and new housing options available now and in the future; and \u2022 undertaking a detailed analysis of younger people currently living in aged care, as well as up to 2,000 young people at risk of entering aged care, to better inform new policies and pathways to find alternate accommodation. The release continues: Increasing the number of Home Care packages The additional 10,000 home care packages will be focused on the Royal Commission\u2019s identified areas of need and is strongly weighted towards level 3 and level 4 packages, which provide a high level of care. These packages will be rolled out from 1 December 2019. Since the 2018-19 Budget, the Government has invested $2.7 billion in 44,000 new home care packages. We have also more than doubled the number of home care packages available to a record 150,412 this financial year, up from 60,308 in 2012-13 under Labor. Better medication management and dementia training The Royal Commission has identified an over-reliance on chemical restraint in aged care, therefore from 1 January 2020, we will also establish stronger safeguards and restrictions for the prescribing of repeat prescriptions of risperidone. Doctors will still be able to prescribe it but will be required to apply for additional approval if risperidone is to be prescribed beyond an initial 12 week period. These changes have been developed following recommendations from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, and in collaboration with doctor\u2019s groups and the broader health sector. Education resources for prescribers will also be developed to support the appropriate use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in residential aged care and targeted letters will be sent to high prescribers. Funding for medication management programs will be increased by $25.5 million, including support for pharmacists to ensure more frequent medication reviews can occur. The Royal Commission directed that restraint must only be used as a last resort, and amendments to regulations will make this clear. The Government is also providing an additional $10 million over two years from 2019\u201320 to increase dementia training and support for aged care workers and health sector staff. This will better equip them to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, deliver best practice dementia care and comply with the new standards for reducing the use of physical and chemical restraints in aged care. We have also responded immediately to the Royal Commission\u2019s findings on antipsychotics in aged care facilities by declaring \u201cQuality Use of Medicines and Medicines Safety\u201d a National Health Priority. OK \u2013 the press conference is being held on the government\u2019s response to the aged care royal commission interim report: From the release: The Royal Commission\u2019s interim report is clear - as a country, the Government, the Aged Care Sector and the entire Australian community, we can and must do better in providing improved support for our older Australians. We will deliver a $537 million funding package to respond to the Interim Report, across the identified three priority areas, including; \u2022 investing $496.3 million for an additional 10,000 home care packages; \u2022 providing $25.5 million to improve medication management programs to reduce the use of medication as a chemical restraint on aged care residents and at home, and new restrictions and education for prescribers on the use of medication as a chemical restraint; \u2022 delivering $10 million for additional dementia training and support for aged care workers and providers, including to reduce the use of chemical restraint; and \u2022 investing $4.7 million to help meet new targets to remove younger people with disabilities from residential aged care. Tanya Plibersek has delivered a speech at the Whitlam Institute: I suppose the third lesson of the Whitlam legacy I would reflect on today is this: even when reforms have been carefully, painfully, won they can never be taken for granted. Today we have Medicare, not Medibank, because the Fraser government trashed it. Since then, we have seen Medicare under attack time and again by our opponents. 2013 was the last time the Australian government had a women\u2019s budget statement. The gender pay gap remains stubbornly stuck at 14% and we have slid from 15 down to 39 on the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap list. We must build on the achievements of our predecessors, but we can never take those earlier gains for granted. Medicare came from Medibank. Medibank came from the Curtin and Chifley governments\u2019 healthcare reforms. We must always fight to both defend and extend the victories won in the past. Gough himself described the purpose of the Whitlam Institute as: \u201cto help the great and continuing work of building a more equal, open, tolerant and independent Australia.\u201d Gough did that. I would like to think we can all play a role in achieving that goal \u2013 for the men and women of Australia. Scott Morrison has just called a press conference for 12.30. It\u2019s in the PM courtyard \u2013 the serious, serous press conference locale. More trade-related rumblings within Labor ahead of shadow cabinet deliberations tonight: Regular politics watchers know trade has become a sensitive subject in Labor ranks. In this final sitting fortnight, the parliament will consider an amendment to the Customs Act changing the way which the product specific rules of origin of six of Australia\u2019s free trade agreements are given effect domestically. In plain English, the change would limit scrutiny, making some regulations (including provisions covering dumping, where countries \u201cdump\u201d goods in other markets at super-cheap prices to try and expand market share) unable to be disallowed by the parliament. Some Labor MPs have concerns about this proposal. Labor members of a Senate committee scrutinising it said in a recent report: \u201cIn a democracy like Australia we should always be sceptical about any attempt to reduce parliamentary scrutiny.\u201d There was a discussion this morning in the relevant Labor caucus committee (some say lively, others say constructive), ahead of shadow cabinet consideration of this proposal tonight. I\u2019m told a number of MPs articulated the \u201cwe are worried about reducing parliamentary scrutiny\u201d point. Unions are also touchy about it. I hear there will be an attempt to resolve the impasse by Labor agreeing to pass the legislation but dealing with the substance of the internal complaints via an exchange of letters between the trade minister Simon Birmingham and the shadow trade minister Madeleine King, to the effect that any changes to dumping will always trigger a public inquiry by the JSCOT committee (the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties). This letter is apparently being drafted. So this landing point could either be peace, or it could be peace in our time. It will be interesting to see if this conversation drifts over into the regular caucus meeting tomorrow. So we didn\u2019t get any speeches in defence of Angus Taylor from the government, just a call to division. I am told that is because they want this division wrapped up quickly, but there is also the matter of not wanting too many images. Ayes 68 Noes 71 Christian Porter is back in the main chair \u2013 the motion has been denied, so we are off to a division. Let the running of the government MPs begin. \u201cThe minister has been devious or bumbling, or both,\u201d says Mark Butler. Butler says the $15m travel bill Angus Taylor erroneously attributed to the City of Sydney worked out to $28,000 per councillor, per week. He says a Rhodes scholar could probably have done the maths. For those who don\u2019t know, Taylor is a former Rhodes scholar. Tony Burke says that if the government doesn\u2019t demand Angus Taylor come in and explain himself over where the figures came from, \u201cthere are no standards left\u201d. Mark Butler is now seconding the motion. We are getting speeches on this because the government usually just shuts this stuff down during question time, because that is when people are actually listening. It is also why Labor is doing it a bit earlier \u2013 so that it can get a bit of a run with its comments. But Labor does not have the numbers to suspend standing orders, so this won\u2019t go anywhere \u2013 beyond Labor having it on the Hansard. Tony Burke: For someone who we are told, and from time to time, gets reported, is one of the most talented members of the government - now that only tells us one of two things, it only tells us one of two things. Either that is true, and it says something pretty depressing about the government, or that information was given to the media by the same person who published the words \u2018fantastic work, well done Angus. \u201cIt\u2019s A or B. It could be both, this is true.\u201d Tony Burke says the Angus Taylor issue is the \u201cmost clear cut example I have ever seen\u201d of a member misleading the House. \u201cThere are very few standards these days that ministers actually get held to \u2013 and the last one is the minister does not mislead the House,\u201d Burke said in parliament. He is basing this on Taylor\u2019s claim that the document was drawn \u201cdirectly\u201d from the City of Sydney website which, based on metadata, showed had not altered the report since it was loaded in November 2018. Tony Burke is attempting to move a motion to suspend standing orders over Angus Taylor: That the House: notes that: on the evening of 23 October 2019, the Guardian reported the Minister for Emissions Reduction had used incorrect figures from the City of Sydney Annual Report 2017-18 in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Sydney; the next day, the Minister told the House: \u201cThe document was drawn directly from the City of Sydney\u2019s website\u201d; despite the Minister\u2019s claim, all the evidence to date is that no such document ever existed on the website, the altered document has only ever been produced by the Minister\u2019s office and the doctored figures have only ever been used by the Minister in his official Ministerial correspondence, including: City of Sydney metadata which shows the Annual Report on its website has not been altered since it was published on 27 November 2018; public archives which show the Annual Report published on the City of Sydney website contained the correct travel figures on 27 March, 20 April, 19 June and 24 October 2019; a Daily Telegraph report that \u201cMr Taylor\u2019s office had sent The Daily Telegraph the altered document\u201d; and the draft letter the Minister\u2019s Department submitted to the Minister\u2019s office contained no travel figures at all; deliberately misleading the Parliament is both a contempt of the Parliament and a breach of the Ministerial Standards; and therefore, calls on the Minister for Emissions Reduction to make a full and frank statement to the House before it rises tonight explaining how he has not deliberately misled the Parliament. Expect more of this sort of trolling this week. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is in a full-court press urging the crossbench to block the ensuring integrity bill. At a press conference in Canberra, representatives from eight unions (but not the Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union) explained the impact of penalties such as deregistration for breaches including unprotected industrial action. The ACTU president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, said it was not just the construction union in the frame, as campaigns including the nurses\u2019 push for nurse-to-patient ratios could result in union deregistration. She said: The provisions in terms of deregistration are clear ... nurses, if they stopped work, and took industrial action in support of safer workplaces for nurses and for patients, then that is a breach that could lead to the whole union being shut down. To suggest that the amendments stop that is absolutely wrong ... Christian Porter and now Centre Alliance are trying to represent this bill as somehow being fair \u2013 there is nothing fair about unions being shut down for standing up for safety. O\u2019Neill said if the bill went through \u201cunions will always stand up for justice and fairness\u201d \u2013 suggesting the bill won\u2019t be the end of all forms of unprotected industrial action. But she refused to be drawn about what the consequences would be of deregistering the CFMMEU and what the movement\u2019s next steps would be. She praised Jacqui Lambie and Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation for continuing to engage on the bill. One of the press gallery keepers of all knowledge has just let me know the camels are on their way as part of one man\u2019s crusade to raise awareness of melanomas. John Elliott has walked from Perth to Canberra with the camels. Mike Bowers has just received a phone call saying there are camels being led across the Kings Avenue bridge looking as though they are on their way to parliament. There\u2019s three of them. No word on wise men, or any spotting of gold, frankincense or myrrh. Just another week in parliament. Peter Dutton has an update on the industry advisory group which will \u201chelp guide the development of Australia\u2019s 2020 cyber security strategy\u201d. Its first meeting was today: The panel is chaired by Andrew Penn, CEO of Telstra; with Robert Mansfield, Chair of Vocus Group; Robyn Denholm, Chair of Tesla; Chris Deeble, Chief Executive of Northrop Grumman Australia and Darren Kane, Chief Security Officer NBN Co as members. Just a few quick notes on the Trump call, via officials. Apparently the conversation was initiated by Scott Morrison, and the Australian PM conveyed his deep appreciation for the efforts of the administration in securing the release of Timothy Weeks, the professor held hostage by the Taliban. The two leaders spoke about the bushfires, with Morrison thanking the US for sending firefighters. Morrison also expressed support for Trump trying to end the trade dispute with China, and there was a discussion about Australian and US economies. The Parliament House Christmas tree will be officially lit up in the marble foyer in about 15 minutes. The beneficiaries of this year\u2019s giving tree will be announced shortly afterwards. Katharine Murphy tells me that Scott Morrison has just got off the phone to Donald Trump. She\u2019ll have some more on that for you in just a moment. The ACTU and other unions are in town \u201cimploring\u201d crossbenchers to oppose the ensuring integrity bill. As reported last week, Pauline Hanson is being coy about her vote \u2013 she is not locked in. Nor is Jacqui Lambie. The government needs at least one of those two to come over the line to pass it. He\u2019s baaaaccccckkkkkkk. Jim Molan won the preselection battle to replace Arthur Sinodinos, after telling the committee he would vacate the spot at the next election. Rex Patrick says the bill he wanted on security checks wouldn\u2019t stop someone from being a MP but would mean the prime minister received security advice on the MPs in parliament, and could make decisions (on committees, ministries, access) from there. The thing is, we don\u2019t know if that already happens or not. Here was James Paterson this morning, again talking to Sky (it\u2019s been a busy morning) about why he doesn\u2019t agree with the bill: JP: I don\u2019t agree with Rex\u2019s proposed solution, although I agree with him we have a serious problem here. The problem with that solution is it would put our security agencies in a position of power over the federal parliament and over the ministry, and fundamentally undermine one of the core tenets of the Westminster system. The only criteria to being appointed to the cabinet is to be first elected to the parliament and second to be chosen by a prime minister. The idea that you would need a tick-off from a security agency is going down the J Edgar Hoover path and that\u2019s not something that any Australian would be comfortable with. Question: Can we be sure, can we be sure that there isn\u2019t an agent of a foreign government in this place? JP: Unless there\u2019s evidence to suggest there is I think we can be confident that there isn\u2019t. It would be, I don\u2019t think we should make leaps to assume that there might be just because there\u2019s been an attempt in this case. Question: It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have to comply with other checks on being in the executive or parliament. You have to declare about your citizenship and that can exclude you. Why isn\u2019t this something that we should be able to investigate? JP: That\u2019s a constitutional requirement, which has been put there for a purpose many years ago. This would be introducing a new requirement that would be very unusual in our political system. Question: You can\u2019t be bankrupt either. And that\u2019s something where you can be declared bankrupt by the ATO. That\u2019s a non-government \u2013 JP: Again, a constitutional requirement inserted for good reasons 100 years ago. This would be a brand new requirement for an arm of the executive government to have a say over the parliamentary wing of our democracy. I think that would be a retrograde step. Nek minnit. Barnaby Joyce was on Sunrise this morning, talking about the Chinese story, and, well, he went places: Well, obviously, we are seeing a very active China and, unfortunately I think, we are seeing a transition of the whole world from a Liberal rules-based place that we\u2019ve had the benefit of for 100 or 200 or so years into one that an autocratic form of government presides and the strong will survive and the weak and naive will be crushed, and I think what we are seeing is \u2013 I don\u2019t doubt it \u2013 that I know that the Chinese have in one way or another been trying to infiltrate our parliament, whether it be online and whether it\u2019s by direct inducements to politicians \u2013 Sam Dastyari being noted as one. And this is something that we\u2019ve just got to accept and we\u2019ve got to be strong, and we\u2019ve got to be resolute, and we cannot be naive, and we\u2019ve got to realise that this is the new world order we are living in. I believe Mr Zhao\u2019s death should be investigated. Pauline Hanson has \u201cno concerns\u201d about any current member of parliament, in terms of their Chinese links. She told Sky News: I thought we had been through all of that with Gladys Liu \u2013 you know, you can\u2019t put a light on everyone just because of their ethnic background. Let her prove [herself] through her actions ... I am not going to ridicule her, I don\u2019t know the truth. Let\u2019s hope that we have the authorities that will further investigate that, if it needs further investigation, that we do know the truth, that we have not been infiltrated in our parliament. Comments should be opening again very soon. Pauline Hanson, whose \u201cheart is with this country\u201d is continuing to attack Bridget McKenzie over the dairy industry code of conduct. Hanson is living her best life at the moment. Pauline Hanson has just told Sky News she will be \u201ctaking her time\u201d on the ensuring integrity bill. \u201cI am not going to be pushed or badgered or bullied or threatened by anyone - I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s the government or the unions - I will make a decision that I think is right for the people of this country. She has a few amendments of her own she wants to go through. \u201cI am not here to rubber stamp government legislation,\u201d Hanson says. A decision is expected in the defamation case Sarah Hanson-Young brought against the former senator David Leyonhjelm this afternoon (about 3.30pm). Rex Patrick, talking to Sky News, had a little to say about Jacqui Lambie\u2019s position on the medevac bill. Centre Alliance have a loose coalition with Lambie, where they share information on bills they agree on (and then go their separate way on bills they don\u2019t). I have spoken to Jacqui, and she is not supporting a repeal of the legislation, she is considering amending the legislation. I don\u2019t know the details of what she is proposing and I understand she is talking with the government, but it is my understanding that she is not seeking to repeal that bill. The bells are ringing \u2013 Jim Molan will be back in the Senate in a matter of minutes. Mathias Cormann was back on Sky just a few minutes ago, talking about balancing Australia\u2019s relationship with China: We have an important economic relationship with China. We have an important overall relationship with China. Of course, we are interested and committed to having a constructive relationship, the best possible relationship. But by the same token it has to be a relationship between sovereign nations and we will continue to call out any issues and deal with any issues as they arise. Rex Patrick is on Sky News talking about Gladys Liu. He makes it clear he is not making any allegations, but says he wants to know if the Chisholm MP has received funds from any Chinese organisations which are linked to the Chinese Communist party. Tim Wilson was out and about early this morning, getting ahead of any Liu mention: Obviously we are talking about the same electorate. But if anybody has any evidence to bring forward then they should do so. Otherwise to draw this specious allegation is actually outrageous, frankly, just simply because of someone\u2019s ethnic heritage. Jacqui Lambie was grabbed at the Canberra airport as she arrived in the capital last night and asked about her plans for medevac. She still hasn\u2019t given any indication of where she is going, but she did say this (as reported by AAP): Senator Lambie will meet with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday to discuss amendments that could ease her concerns about dismantling the medevac regime. The Senate crossbencher is also expected to meet with Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. \u201cAnything that\u2019s got to do with humanity is always really, really difficult to have to take a vote on, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m taking a little bit longer than I know that many people would have hoped,\u201d Senator Lambie said on Sunday. \u201cHopefully, over the next few days, between myself and Peter Dutton, we can get this sorted and certainly get a vote taken.\u201d Senator Lambie has indicated she wants to land a deal that amends the system, without giving the government the full repeal that it wants. \u201cI think what you\u2019ll find with medevac is it may not look like it does today,\u201d she said. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has been running a bit of a crusade to have Australian politicians go through a security check before they are allowed to sit for parliament. His argument is that staffers and public servants have to go through checks before they are allowed to take up their jobs, but our MPs, who have access to a lot more information and well, access, do not. That\u2019s a lot to do with democracy \u2013 the Australian people elect people, so the only people who can remove them are either the Australian people, or the high court, if a MP falls foul of the constitution. A group of climate protesters have gathered outside Parliament House this morning. Adam Bandt addressed the rally: We are seeing bushfire seasons get longer which affects the ability to do things like preventative burnings. We are seeing water starting to run out and we have not invested in our firefighters and our firefighting capacity to come and match the looming climate catastrophe that is potentially around the corner this summer. For what it is worth, Jeremy Clarkson, who has spent the best part of 30 years calling climate change a load of hooey, has recently come round \u2013 after he was forced to basically wade through part of the Mekong. While we are talking about an alleged Chinese plot to infiltrate the Australian parliament, there was an interesting story in the weekend Fin about Australia attempting to address China\u2019s soft power in the region. From the Tom McIlroy report: Australia will loan Papua New Guinea $US300 million ($442 million) in direct budget assistance, designed to secure essential government services and rebuff financial overtures from China. The Morrison government agreed to the loan request from PNG Prime Minister James Marape, offering immediate financial support linked to his plans for longer-term economic reforms in the struggling nation. A deal was agreed on Friday, Minister for International Development and the Pacific Alex Hawke said. Provided by Export Finance Australia through its national interest account, the loan will be structured to incur no cost to the Australian taxpayer or the federal budget bottom line. There has been a lot of criticism and warnings about what the cut in Australia\u2019s aid would mean long term for the Pacific region, in terms of China increasing its influence. It looks like the Morrison government is now working to address at least part of the issue. But without a lot of fanfare. Jim Chalmers also had a bit to say about the ensuring integrity bill this morning \u2013 given that the Westpac drama is still playing out. Scott Morrison\u2019s priorities are all wrong. He spends no time coming up with a plan for the economy and spends all of his time dividing Australians and trying to distract from the fact that since the parliament last sat unemployment\u2019s gone up, wages growth has slowed, the retail sector is in real strife, the economy is floundering and a bank has been sprung with more bad behaviour that Scott Morrison has spent so much of his time over the last six years of this government trying to prevent from coming to light \u2026 The government\u2019s argument is that it\u2019s their job to be firing union leaders. That\u2019s the inconsistency that we\u2019re pointing out here. In the last parliamentary sitting fortnight of the year they want to make this their primary focus. The government wants to crack down on a union which might get its paperwork wrong three times at the same time as we\u2019ve got one of the big four banks engaged in 23m alleged breaches of the law. The government will always prioritise picking on workers and their unions over cracking down on the big banks. Mathias Cormann was on Sky News this morning and said it may be a little too early for the Australian government to be raising the Chinese spy plot claims with Beijing (although, of course that is happening): Right now it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. Some allegations have been aired in the media. We take them very seriously as a government and Asio indeed has confirmed through a statement by the director general that they\u2019ve been made aware. Anthony Albanese stopped by the doors this morning. He wasn\u2019t talking doors \u2013 instead he focused on the two bills the government hopes to pass this fortnight. On medevac, Albanese questioned whether anything the government claimed would happen, did: Have a look at what the government said would happen if Medevac was passed. Was that true? No is the answer. The fact is the legislation has operated smoothly. Where the minister has had objections, those objections have been upheld, by and large. And the truth is it hasn\u2019t undermined border protection. What it\u2019s done is just put in place a commonsense regime whereby people who need medical assistance have been able to get it. Jacqui Lambie is the swing vote there. And on ensuring integrity, Albanese says Labor is still working on making sure it doesn\u2019t pass (that\u2019s up to One Nation at this stage). Well, look, we\u2019ll look at all amendments. But we want to defeat this legislation because it\u2019s bad legislation. It can\u2019t be made better. There is, of course, a hypocrisy in the government, which has said that it would have the National Integrity Commission in place by this time now. And that hasn\u2019t happened. So that on the one hand, they\u2019ve been hopeless when it comes to the having a National Integrity Commission, it\u2019s all too hard for them. But they are too busy pursuing unions. And I think there\u2019s a fair point to be made about the hypocrisy in the government\u2019s position. We\u2019ve just had to close comments for a little bit, as we wait for the moderator changeover. Of course, the big concern for how the government deals with its relationship with Beijing, comes down to trade. The Fin reported last month that was now worth $117bn. But the weekend\u2019s allegations are going to throw a spanner in the works. We have seen it before, with thermal coal and wine \u2013 and we are likely to see it again. Australian coal has been delayed in Chinese ports, while Russia and Indonesia seem to have no problems getting their exports through. Simon Birmingham was asked about that on ABC breakfast TV this morning as well: Yes, there have been instances of delays in relation to thermal coal. We are around a point in time in the year where for the last two years we have seen some particular delays in relation to thermal coal and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see some again this year. That is a pattern that relates more to domestic matters in China and restrictions they\u2019re facing overall in terms of imports around this time of year. OK, but really? When we look at the pattern around the same time of year, each year, for if it happens again this year, the third year in a row then I think we can say that there are certain, we will call them uniquely market factors that are more government influence occurring and they are not directly targeting Australia in that case, but there are other concerns which we have raised in terms of the lack of processing in relation to applications by Australian beef abattoirs and processors, a lack of processing of their applications for new permits into China: that comes with at a time when we have seen record volumes and value of Australian meat and beef exports into China. So it is not holding back the amount that\u2019s going in, but there are administrative bugbears that we have raised directly with Chinese authorities and indeed in relation to our barley growers. We continue to be frustrated by the fact that there is an anti-dumping investigation into Australian barley going into China which we think has no basis and which, whilst we respect China\u2019s right to conduct the investigation, we urge for its conclusion as quickly as possible because it is very important, not just for our barley producers, but for Chinese businesses who rely upon Australian products. On the domestic front, there is also a little bit on. The government is hoping to get medevac repealed and also get One Nation across the line for its \u201censuring integrity\u201d bill, which would put in place mechanisms to be able to de-register unions and union officials. Stay tuned on that one. But Labor is also looking to continue its prosecution of Angus Taylor after the Guardian\u2019s reporting on what has become known as the \u201cdoctored documents\u201d saga. You can read about that here. There is of course, the Grasslands issue as well.I recommend this podcast. Simon Birmingham was sent out by the Coalition to talk about it this morning. Here\u2019s what he had to tell the ABC: What we have sought to do as a government and again this is what Australians care about, is what we do as a government in response to the threats we face. Our intelligence agencies have publicly revealed before that there is an unprecedented level of foreign interference and activity that they see. Not just from one country, but indeed, a range of different actions and activities that we have to counter. That\u2019s why as a government over the years, we have provided those agencies with more resourcing. We have brought new laws to the parliament to establish the type of protections and frameworks around foreign influence and interference that are necessary and that we have put in place greater protections in terms of certain areas of foreign investment as well. So, it is critical to know that we\u2019ve taken the steps necessary to date to provide the protection and I am confident that Australia\u2019s democracy is as robust as ever, but also is vibrant and is driven very much by grassroots members of political organisations in Australia engaging in those political activities and we should also note that they come from all walks of life and that it is important on a day like today when we\u2019re talking about these matters of people or other nations that we do welcome new Australians and their involvement in our democracy according to the established values of that democracy. Birmingham was the Coalition\u2019s main spokesman during the election campaign, and he has never really been able to relinquish that role. Under Malcolm Turnbull, the job belonged to Mathias Cormann. The finance minister does still get out and about a bit \u2013 but nowhere near as much as he used to. The Liberal MP who heads parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee, Andrew Hastie, was featured on the 60 Minutes program last night. He has previously warned of Chinese interference, and has been public about it. He had this to say about the allegations: [It is] like something out of a spy novel happening in Melbourne with impunity and very, very concerning. This isn\u2019t just cash in a bag, you know, given for favours. This is a state-sponsored attempt to infiltrate our parliament using an Australian citizen and basically run them as an agent of foreign influence in our democratic system. So this is really significant and Australians should be very, very concerned about this.\u201d Hastie was part of an Australian delegation which was meant to travel to China \u2013 it was cancelled before they even got to the airport. His stance on this issue has previously caused splits within the Liberal party room, with Mathias Cormann having chastened him, but I would think that today Hastie will have a few knowing looks to throw Cormann\u2019s way. Honestly, it is all anyone wants to talk about today, and understandably. Richard Marles says Labor has requested a briefing on the allegations: Well, obviously, these are very concerning allegations that have been made. The fact that we\u2019ve now seen a very rare statement from Asio in the aftermath of that adds to the concern that, I think, we would all feel in relation to this. Anthony Albanese has sought a briefing from our agencies as soon as possible but it\u2019s really important that we\u2019re now hearing from the government, from the prime minister, from the relevant ministers about this matter as soon as possible. Well. That was quite the weekend, wasn\u2019t it?! It is not hyperbole to say that those within Parliament House have been pretty well rocked by confirmation Australia\u2019s spy agency is \u201cactively investigating\u201d claims China attempted to install a spy into the parliament. The director general of security casually dropped this tweet late last night: And what did that statement say? The reporting on Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes contains allegations that Asio takes seriously. As the director general of security, I am committed to protecting Australia\u2019s democracy and sovereignty. Australians can be reassured that Asio was previously aware of matters that have been reported today, and has been actively investigating them. However, in accordance with long-standing practice, I will not comment on this particular operational matter, including any detail of the individuals involved. Given that the matter in question is subject to a coronial inquiry, and as not to prejudice our investigations, it would be inappropriate to comment further. Hostile foreign intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security. Asio will continue to confront and counter foreign interference and espionage in Australia. That is quite extraordinary. Not only did Asio feel the need to issue a statement on the Nine story, it also confirmed it has been aware of it, and is investigating it. For Australia\u2019s notoriously secretive security agency, that is quite the step. It all relates to this story from Nine newspapers and 60 Minutes: Australian authorities are investigating claims that a Chinese espionage ring tried to install an agent for Beijing in a seat in federal parliament. Sources with knowledge of the alleged plot believe the suspected Chinese intelligence group offered a million dollars to pay for the political campaign of Liberal party member and Melbourne luxury car dealer Bo \u201cNick\u201d Zhao, 32, to run for an eastern suburbs seat. The plot appears to be part of an operation to place a Chinese agent in parliament. Zhao was found dead in a Mount Waverley motel room in March. Local police have not been able to conclude how he died, making his death the subject of a coronial investigation. Of course, that story came on top of the news that a man, who says he worked for Chinese intelligence, has defected to Australia. Wang Liqiang has applied for asylum in Australia after he admitted he had been personally involved with Chinese espionage activities, including political interference operations within the region. Beijing has denied his claims, and says he is a convicted fraudster. Our agencies are taking him seriously. And with that backdrop, we start the final two weeks of parliament. Mike Bowers is out and about, and you\u2019ll have the full Canberra contingent along for the ride as well. Plus the rest of the Guardian brains trust. There is not enough coffee in the world for me today, but you know, small potatoes. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

But early on Monday morning, he was pleasantly surprised to find that he had secured 3,177 votes, nearly 900 more than his opponent, the incumbent deputy chairman of the Yuen Long district council, who hails from a powerful local family. Cheung told the Guardian that his victory was less to do with the success of his personal campaign than the fact that Hong Kong people desperately wanted to make their voices heard and their political demands satisfied. \u201cIt has little to do with me \u2013 it is the tsunami of public opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cPro-democracy candidates have won in all the districts.\u201d Months of pro-democracy protests, from a two million-strong peaceful march in June over a controversial extradition bill, to increasingly violent street demonstrations that culminated in a siege of a city-centre university, has turned the previously sleepy district council elections into a proxy referendum on the Hong Kong government. There is widespread dissatisfaction on the government\u2019s refusal to negotiate or compromise with the protesters, but instead used the police force to deal with the escalation of the increasingly radical protests. Many seats in previous elections were uncontested and for years were packed by well-funded pro-Beijing candidates who promised residents better local services and benefits. Cheung, a non-local, does not have the wealth of resources like the pro-Beijing or pro-government candidates, but his political campaign promised to investigate an incident on 21 July when dozens of white-clad thugs carried out an indiscriminate attack on commuters and protesters at the Yuen Long metro station. Only six have been charged over the incident that is widely seen as the collusion between thugs and the police to punish protesters returning to Yuen Long from a mass protest in town late that night. \u201cThe July 21 incident has antagonised a lot of local residents and they voted to voice their dissatisfaction,\u201d Cheung said. His campaign also pushed for \u201cgenuine universal suffrage\u201d, as he and other candidates want the government to launch democratic reforms \u2013 a demand that failed in the 2014 Umbrella movement. Cheung, a student at the time, was found guilty of charges including \u201cinciting others to cause public nuisance\u201d and sentenced to a community service order of 200 hours this year.

      "bodyText": "David Leyonhjelm will be forced to pay Sarah Hanson-Young $120,000 plus interest after a judge ruled the former senator defamed her in a series of interviews last year. On Monday the federal court justice Richard White ruled in favour of Hanson-Young, agreeing that Leyonhjelm\u2019s comments in a series of interviews did carry the imputation the Greens senator was a misandrist and a hypocrite. White found Leyonhjelm\u2019s defence of justification and qualified privilege had failed and awarded Hanson-Young $120,000 in damages, with interest and costs to be decided at a hearing in December. At a press conference outside of parliament on Monday Hanson-Young said the victory was for women who had been \u201cmade to stay silent\u201d. \u201cWhen a man does the wrong thing he should apologise, and when he doesn\u2019t he should be called out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did in this case - and I did it, not for me, but for every woman and girl across the country who has ever been told to stay silent, made to stay silent. \u201cMade to feel as if speaking out ... would cause more harm. It is absolutely important that every young girl knows they have the right to be treated with respect and treated equally ... in the classroom, the workplace, if she works in a shop, the front bar, or here in the nation\u2019s parliament.\u201d Hanson-Young has said she will donate the damages to two women\u2019s groups \u2013 Plan International and the South Australian Working Women\u2019s Centre. \u201cThis is an important day for this parliament to put a line under this type of behaviour,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you work in a shop or a factory floor or the parliament. Every woman deserves to be treated with respect. If you see someone doing the wrong thing stand with that woman and help call it out.\u201d The Greens senator sued Leyonhjelm after a feud in the Senate in June last year which began after a debate about women\u2019s safety. During the debate, Leyonhjelm told Hanson-Young to \u201cstop shagging men\u201d. The Greens senator accused Leyonhjelm of \u201cslut-shaming\u201d her after his comments drew widespread condemnation and sparked a national debate about discourse in the Australia\u2019s parliament. She later filed defamation proceedings against Leyonhjelm after he refused to apologise for the comments, saying he had defamed her in a series of interviews he gave between 28 June and 2 July last year to Sky News, the Melbourne radio station 3AW and the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program, and in a media statement posted on 28 June. In his published reasons, White ruled that Hanson-Young \u201cdid not speak words along the lines\u201d which Leyonhjelm attributed to her. Instead, he found, it was likely the former Liberal Democrats senator heard \u201cthat which he was predisposed to hear by reason of his pre-existing opinion\u201d of Hanson-Young. He found the Leyonhjelm\u2019s \u201cfailure to check the accuracy of his belief as to what the applicant had said\u201d meant his conduct was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and that he was \u201cactuated by malice in that he published his claim concerning the applicant to a mass audience with the intention of publicly shaming her\u201d. Leyonhjelm had argued that his comments were not defamatory because as politicians people would already have formed \u201cfirm views about them.\u201d But White found that while the \u201cpolitical environment\u201d was \u201ca relevant consideration\u201d in assessing damages, the \u201cpersistence\u201d with which Leyonhjelm made the comments across a number of interviews \u201cmeant that ordinary reasonable persons would have been led to think less of the applicant\u201d. \u201cI have also accepted that some of the harm suffered by the applicant was caused by an imputation on which the applicant did not sue,\u201d White said. \u201cThe parties referred to this imputation in the trial as the \u2018promiscuity imputation\u2019.\u201d Hanson-Young said she had been defamed by Leyonhjelm\u2019s portrayal of her as a hypocrite and misandrist, in that he alleged she said words in parliament that were \u201ctantamount\u201d to claiming all men are rapists but \u201cnevertheless had sexual relations with them\u201d. During the April trial, Hanson-Young accused the former senator of sexism during cross-examination, saying he \u201ccalled me a hypocrite because I have sex with men\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s sexist about that?\u201d Leyonhjelm\u2019s barrister, Tony Morris QC, asked during the trial. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t say it to a man,\u201d she replied.",

We have a roundup for you of the election news and the best of the rest.

That\u2019s when a government wants to bury a story and publishes it while the attention of voters is elsewhere. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/boris-launches-manifesto-so-devoid-of-substance-you-cant-tear-it-apart\">John Crace suggest this strategy was at play</a> when the Conservatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/boris-johnson-launches-conservative-manifesto-with-50000-nurses-pledge\">launched their campaign manifesto</a> on a Sunday, \u201ca day when almost everyone would either be watching football, Sir David Attenborough or Countryfile\u201d. Crace writes that the Tories managed to deliver \u201ca manifesto with almost nothing in it\u201d.</p> \n<p>The manifesto is conspicuous for its lack of eye-catching policies, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/boris-johnson-plays-for-time-with-a-cautious-tepid-manifesto\">Larry Elliott writing</a> that Johnson is \u201cseeking to run down the clock\u201d with a \u201ccautious, tepid manifesto\u201d. One thing it does tell us is the stark difference between the public spending plans outlined by the two parties, with Johnson promising to fork out \u00a32.9bn more a year, against the \u00a383bn outlined by Jeremy Corbyn. Among the headline promises is that the Conservatives would deliver 50,000 nurses, a line that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/will-a-conservative-government-deliver-50000-more-nurses\">we have fact-checked</a> and found somewhat wanting.</p> \n<p>Corbyn will be in the East Midlands today talking about the housing crisis, as Labour prepares to announce a plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/jeremy-corbyn-vows-to-take-on-exploitative-landlords-if-elected-pm\">compel property developers to meet the costs of building at least 50,000 discounted homes</a> as part of a package of measures to help renters and first-time buyers.</p> \n<h2>At a glance</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Johnson talked about Fermat\u2019s last theorem and croutons but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/boris-johnson-fails-to-give-answer-for-factcheckuk-stunt\">refused to give a straightforward answer</a> when asked to justify why the Conservative party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/twitter-accuses-tories-of-misleading-public-in-factcheck-row\">masqueraded as an independent fact-checking service on Twitter</a>.</p></li> \n <li><p>\u201cSort this out!\u201d say hostel residents registering to vote, as charities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/sort-homeless-hostel-residents-register-vote-crisis\">make a concerted effort to help homeless people</a> participate in the election.</p></li> \n <li><p>Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/grime4corbyn-rize-up-young-register-vote\">Grime4Corbyn campaign is being relaunched</a> with a refreshed roster of artists.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>The day ahead</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Corbyn will be in the East Midlands announcing Labour\u2019s housing policy.</p></li> \n <li><p>Chuka Umunna will be delivering a speech for the Lib Dems this morning.</p></li> \n <li><p>The Tories have a Welsh campaign launch at 3pm in north Wales.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2019/nov/12/sign-up-for-andrew-sparrows-election-briefing\">Sign up here</a> to receive Andrew Sparrow\u2019s afternoon round-up from the campaign trail \u2013 direct to your email inbox.</em></p> \n<h2>Best of the rest</h2> \n<p>&gt; Hong Kong\u2019s voters have turned out in record numbers to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">landslide for pro-democracy campaigners in local elections</a>, handing them control of every one of the region\u2019s 18 councils for the first time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3f6fbadb-d7d7-4a95-9d1c-07f4bba88724\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3tyMr2DwLc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The results are a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/25/turning-point-ball-in-beijings-court-after-hong-kongs-decisive-vote\">rebuke to China\u2019s government and its Hong Kong CEO </a>in a vote widely seen as a proxy referendum on the city\u2019s protest movement.

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to your Monday morning briefing. We are at the midway point of the election campaign \u2013 two and a half weeks down, two and a half to go. We have a roundup for you of the election news and the best of the rest. You can follow our rolling politics news on the liveblog. What\u2019s going on? You\u2019ve heard of take-out-the-trash day? That\u2019s when a government wants to bury a story and publishes it while the attention of voters is elsewhere. John Crace suggest this strategy was at play when the Conservatives launched their campaign manifesto on a Sunday, \u201ca day when almost everyone would either be watching football, Sir David Attenborough or Countryfile\u201d. Crace writes that the Tories managed to deliver \u201ca manifesto with almost nothing in it\u201d. The manifesto is conspicuous for its lack of eye-catching policies, with Larry Elliott writing that Johnson is \u201cseeking to run down the clock\u201d with a \u201ccautious, tepid manifesto\u201d. One thing it does tell us is the stark difference between the public spending plans outlined by the two parties, with Johnson promising to fork out \u00a32.9bn more a year, against the \u00a383bn outlined by Jeremy Corbyn. Among the headline promises is that the Conservatives would deliver 50,000 nurses, a line that we have fact-checked and found somewhat wanting. Corbyn will be in the East Midlands today talking about the housing crisis, as Labour prepares to announce a plan to compel property developers to meet the costs of building at least 50,000 discounted homes as part of a package of measures to help renters and first-time buyers. At a glance Johnson talked about Fermat\u2019s last theorem and croutons but refused to give a straightforward answer when asked to justify why the Conservative party masqueraded as an independent fact-checking service on Twitter. \u201cSort this out!\u201d say hostel residents registering to vote, as charities make a concerted effort to help homeless people participate in the election. Labour\u2019s Grime4Corbyn campaign is being relaunched with a refreshed roster of artists. The day ahead Corbyn will be in the East Midlands announcing Labour\u2019s housing policy. Chuka Umunna will be delivering a speech for the Lib Dems this morning. The Tories have a Welsh campaign launch at 3pm in north Wales. Sign up here to receive Andrew Sparrow\u2019s afternoon round-up from the campaign trail \u2013 direct to your email inbox. Best of the rest &gt; Hong Kong\u2019s voters have turned out in record numbers to deliver a landslide for pro-democracy campaigners in local elections, handing them control of every one of the region\u2019s 18 councils for the first time. The results are a rebuke to China\u2019s government and its Hong Kong CEO in a vote widely seen as a proxy referendum on the city\u2019s protest movement. Prominent pro-Beijing candidates were evicted from previously safe seats. &gt; Leaked Communist party files show the internal workings of the vast chain of internment camps China has used to detain at least a million people from Muslim minorities. Some of the rules for what China says are vocational training centres: \u201cNever allow escapes, never allow trouble \u2026 There must be full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms \u2026 Adhere to the daily concentrated study of the national language (Mandarin).\u201d The papers reveal how China maintains a vast database on people it sees as threats, including dual nationals moving in and out of the country \u2013 even using a particular file-sharing app can get you flagged for \u201cre-education\u201d. Closer to home, extensive links between British universities and Chinese defence companies, including missile manufacturers, could threaten UK national security interests, says an analysis. &gt; Congressional Republicans have dug in to defend Donald Trump, no matter what untruths they need to tell to try and undermine the impeachment inquiry, while the White House is preparing for a senate trial that would determine whether the president stays in office. Meanwhile the US navy secretary, Richard Spencer, has been removed after a row with the White House over his handling of the case of Edward Gallagher, a Navy Seal officer convicted for posing with an Isis fighter\u2019s corpse. Today in Focus podcast: Netflix and the empire of debt Mark Lawson and Dan Milmo discuss the sustainability of the streaming service. Plus: Lara Spirit on why you should register to vote before Tuesday\u2019s deadline. Lunchtime read: Dennis Quaid on new love and new roles The Hollywood star talks to Martha Hayes about his much-discussed engagement to a PhD student, why TV is now more interesting than film \u2013 and how he hopes to see the end of casting-couch culture. Sport Manchester United came back from 2-0 down to take the lead against Sheffield United, but Oli McBurnie\u2019s 90th-minute goal survived a VAR check to clinch a point for the Blades. The comeback, though, masked an abysmal display from Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side, writes Jonathan Wilson. Vicky Jepson said Liverpool \u201chave too much quality in our squad to worry,\u201d after a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal extended their WSL run to seven games without a win. Two cherished Spaniards, Rafael Nadal and Roberto Bautista Agut, beat Canada 2-0 to win the 2019 Davis Cup in front of a capacity home crowd on a night of soaring emotions in the aptly named Caja M\u00e1gica. Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola look set to boost Saracens\u2019 Premiership survival bid with the director of rugby, Mark McCall, revealing the England trio are closing in on their returns for the club. Tom Curry made his first club appearance after the World Cup as Sale won their European Champions\u2019 Cup game 25-15 against La Rochelle, who had one red card and two yellows. Roman Abramovich has rejected bidders who think they can buy Chelsea at a \u201cbargain\u201d price and remains just as involved in the club as he has ever been, chairman Bruce Buck says. And celebrations of Flamengo\u2019s Copa Libertadores victory came to an abrupt end in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, when clashes erupted between a group of supporters and police. Business Asian shares have mostly moved higher, from Sydney to Tokyo. Local election results in Hong Kong might not be market-friendly, as the rebuke to Carrie Lam\u2019s leadership could bring up political uncertainties, but could also mark a turning point in stopping the violent clashes, said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. The pound clocks on for the week at $1.284 and \u20ac1.165 while the FTSE is trending 0.38% higher at time of writing. The papers The start of the week is a lockout for Johnson and the Tory manifesto. \u201cStakes have never been higher\u201d was the quote that leapt out at the Metro\u2019s front page desk. The FT begs to differ, calling it a \u201clow-risk pitch to voters\u201d. The Guardian goes with \u201cJohnson stakes just \u00a32.9bn in public spending gamble\u201d \u2013 contrasted with the \u00a383bn outlined by Corbyn. \u201cJohnson places NHS at heart of \u2018critical\u2019 election\u201d says the Times. \u201cBoris pledges 50,000 extra nurses\u201d is how the Express welcomes the manifesto. \u201cJohnson sets out health and safety manifesto\u201d \u2013 seasonal corny wordplay narrowly averted in the i.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to Granite City Scotland\u2019s third-largest city is known as Granite City, and has a wealth of beautiful architecture: either on the Granite heritage trail or just by having a wander around and looking up. Styles and eras vary greatly, from the three Victorian domes of His Majesty\u2019s Theatre, the Central Library and St Mark\u2019s Church, to the neo-gothic Marischal College, and the brutalist tower blocks \u2013 which have inspired accessories by local design collective Look Inside. While you\u2019re taking in the refurbished Aberdeen Art Gallery (among other events, a Martin Parr photography exhibition runs until 23 February 2020), check out the 28 different-coloured granite columns in the main hall \u2013 they came from quarries around the area. Stroll the sandy shore Aberdeen is also called \u201cthe silver city with the golden sands\u201d, and has fantastic beaches. You can walk the coastal stretch from Footdee, a fishing village at the mouth of the large harbour, to the dunes at Balmedie in around three hours, then get the 54 bus back into town. Close to the harbour, Aberdeen Maritime Museum (free) offers a great way to learn about the city\u2019s relationship with the sea \u2013 from the early days of clippers and shipbuilding to the North Sea oil and gas industry \u2013 and includes a 1:33 scale model of an oil rig. Independent eating For a vegan dinner Foodstory Cafe on central Thistle Street is a laid-back space, with live music, workshops and pop-up shops, such as plant sales. It serves wraps, soups, raw brownies and bowls filled with chilli, sushi or falafel \u2013 and it\u2019s BYOB in the evening. Spin-off zero-waste cafe, Food Story Zero, is on the university campus in Old Aberdeen, an area that\u2019s worth a wander. More centrally, Melt 2 calls itself the \u201chome of grilled cheese\u201d and does toasted sandwiches with gooey cheese, pickles, meats (including haggis) or veggie chilli (from \u00a34). The Green is home to the monthly Inspired Nights street food market in warmer months (restarts April 2020); Cafe 52 serves tapas and modern British (mains \u00a310) in an atmospheric old building; and try Contour for coffee and cake. Walk the arty streets There is a wealth of street art across Aberdeen, a lot of which was created as part of the Nuart street art festival, which takes place every April. It has been a big deal for Aberdeen since it started three years ago \u2013 with works created around the city by an array of international artists. Download a map of the art here and look out for (in particular) Jan Vormann\u2019s Dispatchwork \u2013 several small Lego installations in the walls around The Green, the city centre marketplace \u2013 and the Gl\u00f6bel Brothers\u2019 mural on Willowbank Road gable end, in the style of a retro advertisement. Free walking tours also run from January to September. Other festivals on Aberdeen\u2019s calendar include the Spectra festival of light in February, Dance Live in October, and the Sound festival of new music in November. Seasonal (and very local) ice-cream For a taste of something truly Aberdonian, ice-cream maker Mackie\u2019s has a cafe on Marischal Square, called Mackie\u2019s 19.2 after the distance in miles to the family farm and factory in to the north-west. The company is always coming up with new seasonal flavours \u2013 for Burns Night this year it created a remarkable haggis and orange marmalade edition, and last Christmas it was minted brussels sprouts, gingerbread and Christmas pudding flavours. There was also a special rowie (a buttery roll, like a savoury croissant) and jam version, made for Aberdeen Performing Arts, which runs three local theatres. \u2022 mackies.co.uk Discover indie designs Lesser-known art spaces have been popping-up around the city in recent years. Among them is the Look Again Project Space on St Andrew Street, which was an empty shop that has been repurposed as an exhibition space. It showcases contemporary art and design by local artists through an initiative with Gray\u2019s School of Art, part of the Robert Gordon University. Five minutes away on Queen Street, the Anatomy Rooms artists\u2019 studios run public events, such as makers\u2019 fairs and workshops, as well as classes and performances by in-house contemporary dance company City Moves. On Rosemount Place, the independent, artist-run Kekun Studio runs exhibitions and workshops. Go to hospital You wouldn\u2019t normally think about going to see art in a hospital but Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has a fantastic changing collection on display on its corridor walls, as well as a dedicated in-house gallery, the Suttie Arts Space. It\u2019s run in conjunction with the Grampian Hospitals Arts Trust and is open to the public as well as patients. Unique shopping Curated Stories on Claremont Street, at the western end of main drag Union Street, does a range of Scandi-inspired gifts and clothing, plus antiques \u2013 and hosts pop-up shops from the likes of vintage homewares seller Hume. Back on The Green, independent clothing boutique Hanon sells limited-edition trainers and T-shirts printed for Nuart. There are also lots of unique items being sold in the new Aberdeen Art Gallery shop \u2013 prints from Martin Parr\u2019s Think Of Scotland exhibition, as well as jewellery made from reclaimed granite from the old, pre-refurbished gallery space. Beer and bicycles With beers called Peloton, Velo and Bombini, it\u2019s no surprise that the owner of Belgian-style microbrewery Six\u00b0North, Robert Lindsay, is a keen cyclist who also runs a cycle sportive as part of the Midsummer Beer Happening, which takes place a few miles south in Stonehaven each June. The brewery first opened south of the city in 2013, and five bars followed across Scotland, starting with the one on Aberdeen\u2019s Littlejohn Street.

Dolphin spotting Last used for defence in the second world war, the historic Torry Battery site is now a popular spot for dolphin watching. A pod of bottlenoses live at the mouth of the harbour and can be spotted throughout the year. The view from here also takes in the promenade, where Aberdeen meets the North Sea. It really feels like the edge of Scotland \u2013 the next stop is Norway. There are also seabirds, seals, otters and whales to spot. A project called Greyhope Bay is planning to add a viewing platform, a cafe and outdoor exhibits to the battery, and hold special events.

Investors take these matters seriously and will be engaging with the board ahead of the AGM.\u201d</p> <p>Westpac\u2019s AGM is due to be held on 12 December.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s issued a report saying: \u201cThe allegations are credit-negative because of the damage to the bank\u2019s reputation and the adverse financial impact from potential fines and costs related to remedial actions. \u201c</p> <p>While Moody\u2019s said it was too early to estimate the value of any potential penalties, it noted that Commonwealth Bank has been fined $700 million by Austrac in relation to its breaches.</p> <p>The ratings agency concluded that a similar sized fine would be manageable for the smaller Westpac, given the $6.8 billion profit the bank reported for the fiscal year ending 30 June (fiscal 2019).</p>",

Both the Australian Securities and Investments commission (Asic), which has responsibility for corporate conduct and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (Apra), which oversees the governance and financial health of deposit taking institutions, have stepped in. \u201cAsic can confirm that it commenced an investigation on Thursday, 21 November 2019, concerning possible breaches of legislation it administers arising from Austrac\u2019s actions in relation to Westpac,\u201d a spokesperson said. The investigation is likely to consider whether Westpac directors have breached their duties as directors, whether there have been breaches of the continuous disclosure rules, which require public companies to inform the market of all matters that could affect the share price, and whether there are any other corporate conduct matters that contravene legislation. Aside from the question of whether the directors performed their duties as stewards of the company on behalf of the shareholders, there will be other questions as well. Two weeks ago Westpac announced a $2.5 billion capital raising which it said would be used to bolster its balance sheet. $2bn was raised from institutional shareholders and a further $500m was raised from retail investors, at a generous discount to the then share price. But investors who took up the placement are now significantly underwater following the precipitous slide in the share price since last Wednesday\u2019s bombshell revelations. Offer documents disclosed the Austrac investigation as a key risk, but did not say the matter involved 23m possible breaches. Asic is also responsible for issuing financial services licences, which Westpac and other banks hold. Those licences carry a requirement to act honestly and fairly and this too is set to be investigated by Asic. Meanwhile, the law firm Phi Finney McDonald is investigating a class action against Westpac on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares before 19 November 2019. It will allege the bank breached its continuous disclosure obligations. \u201cAustrac\u2019s allegations against Westpac are deeply troubling,\u201d said Tim Finney, Phi Finney McDonald director. \u201cModern institutional investors take corporate governance issues extremely seriously. The suggestion that a major bank could be so lax with its anti-money laundering systems that it potentially facilitated child abuse and exploitation is about as serious as it gets.\u201d The Apra investigation is likely to focus on governance issues and whether the actions of Westpac transgressed the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (Bear). The Bear, which establishes heightened standards of accountability among authorised deposit-taking institutions such as the major banks, came into force in July 2018 as a response to the revelations in the banking royal commission. It spells out the responsibilities of directors and executives of financial institutions and is the main way the government hoped to restore some faith in the battered sector. It also includes enhanced prudential reporting and controls, which could hit Westpac\u2019s bottom line. While the bulk of breaches are alleged to have occurred before the Bear came into effect, Austrac claims some continued as recently as Wednesday, when it filed its lawsuit. \u201cApra confirms it is looking into governance issues at Westpac following the Austrac action,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cApra is considering whether the alleged breaches (and any potential penalties) have implications under Bear, or raise other prudential concerns that require a response from Apra. \u201cHowever, as the treasurer noted, the Bear is not retrospective, and therefore its potential application may hinge on the timing of the alleged offences,\u201d it said. But sources said Apra could potentially take action under other pre-existing powers. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In July, Apra made Westpac add an extra $500m to its prudential capital buffer for identified weaknesses in Westpac\u2019s governance and non-financial risk management, following a self-assessment by the three other banks in the wake of the CBA revelations of breaches of the money-laundering laws. \u201cApra is currently monitoring a major remediation program the bank is carrying out to address identified weaknesses,\u201d the regulator\u2019s spokesman said. On Sunday Westpac\u2019s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, broke his silence on the crisis gripping the bank, issuing an update on the bank\u2019s response to the Austrac investigations. Among the actions he flagged were an immediate closure of LitePay, which was allegedly used by paedophile networks to send payments to the Philippines, without raising any red flags, and doubling the number of staff working in financial crime to 750 people. Maxsted said it would add $80m to the bank\u2019s costs in 2020. But contrary to reports that executive bonuses had been scrapped, the release said that 2019 short-term variable bonuses had been \u201cwithheld\u201d for the full executive team, \u201csubject to the assessment of accountability\u201d. Meanwhile, Westpac\u2019s executives and the board have scheduled crisis meetings with institutional investors, which include many of the largest superannuation funds. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents $2.2 trillion invested in Australian companies, is one of the bodies which will be seeking answers before it makes recommendations to its member companies on actions they can take. Chief executive Louise Davidson said the failure of the board alleged by Austrac was \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d, especially in light of the long time period over which these issues occurred. \u201cWe expect the board and CEO of Westpac to clearly explain how the issues identified by Austrac occurred and where accountability will fall. Investors take these matters seriously and will be engaging with the board ahead of the AGM.\u201d Westpac\u2019s AGM is due to be held on 12 December. Moody\u2019s issued a report saying: \u201cThe allegations are credit-negative because of the damage to the bank\u2019s reputation and the adverse financial impact from potential fines and costs related to remedial actions. \u201c While Moody\u2019s said it was too early to estimate the value of any potential penalties, it noted that Commonwealth Bank has been fined $700 million by Austrac in relation to its breaches. The ratings agency concluded that a similar sized fine would be manageable for the smaller Westpac, given the $6.8 billion profit the bank reported for the fiscal year ending 30 June (fiscal 2019).",

      "bodyText": "Wilson Security has settled out of court with a refugee who alleges she was raped while being held in detention on Nauru. The company was contracted by the Australian government to manage and operate security at the Manus Island and Nauru regional processing centres, where asylum seekers who arrived in Australia by boat were sent under the government\u2019s controversial offshore processing regime. The case, brought on behalf of the now 32-year-old woman represented by Maurice Blackburn, was scheduled to begin in the Victorian supreme court on Monday but the parties reached a settlement before it started. Details of the settlement \u2013 including whether it involves any admissions of fault \u2013 are unknown. A spokeswoman for Wilson Security said the case was dismissed with no costs order. The woman alleged she was raped by a security guard in 2014 and was sexually harassed on other occasions, causing ongoing trauma and physiological harm. The statement of claim \u2013 a redacted form of which Guardian Australia has seen \u2013 claimed that Wilson Security knew or ought to have known that its employees \u201cengaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour and/or sexual misconduct in the course of their duties [or] whilst they were permitted to be at the [detention centre]\u201d, or that they permitted other inappropriate sexual behaviour and/or misconduct to go unreported or unpunished. It said Wilson knew some time before 5 June 2014 that guards were trading items with detainees in return for sexual favours, and that a subsequent investigation would have given them even further knowledge of the practice. But the following month, according to the statement of claim, the young woman \u2013 who was then an asylum seeker \u2013 was raped at night in the detention centre women\u2019s sleeping area by a man who was an \u201cemployee, servant or agent\u201d of Wilson Security. It was alleged Wilson Security allowed male officers to enter the women\u2019s sleeping area alone, and allowed the centre to be an unsafe place for female detainees. Wilson Security ended its contract with the Australian government in 2016, saying it was \u201cnot in line with Wilson Security\u2019s long-term strategic priorities\u201d. That year Guardian Australia reported the Nauru Files, a cache of thousands of leaked incident reports from the detention centre which included allegations of Wilson employees physically and sexually assaulting asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 allegedly including women and children. The reports also revealed that Wilson guards pressured other workers on the island to downgrade incident reports, even when obviously critical, and that company officials failed to fully reveal to the Senate the number of assaults on children inside the Nauru detention centre. Wilson Security said the company had been defending the claim by the woman since 2017. \u201cWilson Security, while sympathetic to the incident the plaintiff described, has been unable to substantiate the allegations, no perpetrator has to date been identified and Wilson is adamant none of its employees were involved,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWilson Security does not tolerate any misconduct by its staff, whether on Nauru or otherwise. Any criminal behaviour if substantiated, particularly of the kind alleged by the plaintiff, would have resulted in immediate dismissal and referral to the relevant authorities.\u201d \u2022 This story was amended on 26 November 2019 to add a response from Wilson Security.",

      "body": "<p>Dennis Quaid is tired of talking about the cocaine addiction that landed him in rehab in 1990 and stunted his Hollywood career after a promising start in 80s films The Right Stuff, The Big Easy and Great Balls of Fire. \u201cIt always winds up being the centrepiece of an article,\u201d sighs the 65-year-old actor. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the centrepiece of my life any more.\u201d</p> <p>Quaid\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/22/dennis-quaid-why-i-worry-about-men-who-marry-women-40-years-younger-than-them\" title=\"\">engagement to 26-year-old PhD student Laura Savoie</a> should put paid to that. It has been a while since The Parent Trap star commanded quite so many column inches. Not to mention multiple memes and a heated debate around age-gaps in relationships.</p> <p>We are meeting at a Beverly Hills hotel to talk about his latest project for Netflix, and are joined on the sofa by his snoring miniature English bulldog, Peaches. I\u2019m half expecting his forthcoming nuptials to be off limits \u2013 but far from it. \u201cThat was really a laugh,\u201d he says, of the press attention he and his new fiance have been receiving. \u201cI thought it was wonderful, actually.\u201d</p> <p>But some of the attention isn\u2019t very kind. Does it bother him that age gaps are considered such a taboo in today\u2019s society? \u201cNo, it really doesn\u2019t bother us,\u201d he shrugs. Quaid has been married three times, most famously to Meg Ryan, with whom he has a 27-year-old son, Jack. \u201cEveryone comes from the perspective of their own life and so I can\u2019t comment on the way they feel; I can\u2019t even get angry.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go out looking for an age gap or someone really younger than me. I met her at a business event and then the relationship developed. You have no control over who you fall in love with. I don\u2019t fall in love easy. But I can\u2019t let what a few people think control all that. I\u2019ve been married three times and this is the final one, I know it is. I feel like I have a real partner in life.\u201d</p> <p>As much of the comment has noted, this is a case of life imitating art. In 1998\u2019s The Parent Trap, Quaid\u2019s character, Nick, gets engaged to a 26-year-old PR, Meredith Blake (played by Elaine Hendrix) \u2013 and it is excused as a midlife crisis. Quaid was only 44 then. In fact, one of the tweets that went viral in response to Quaid\u2019s announcement was by Hendrix. \u201cWatch out for those twins,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elaine4animals/status/1186349536609996800?lang=en\" title=\"\">she wrote</a>, in reference to the 11-year-old sisters in the film who do not approve of Meredith. Quaid himself has 11-year-old twins with his third wife, Kimberly Buffington.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd97f152008bad1162c94b517d979ac26b446023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd97f152008bad1162c94b517d979ac26b446023/0_120_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quaid with Natasha Richardson and Lindsay Lohan (twice) in The Parent Trap.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quaid with Natasha Richardson and Lindsay Lohan (twice) in The Parent Trap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Walt Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Again, Quaid insists he found it funny. \u201cIn fact, that very day, we went to the Staglin Family Vineyard, where we filmed The Parent Trap,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been there since 1996. So we went and they offered us the opportunity to get married there.\u201d And will they? \u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t you? For sure!\u201d Have they set a date? \u201cI think you have to get married within a year of asking.\u201d</p> <p>Hollywood stars don\u2019t usually like talking about this kind of stuff \u2013 and Quaid hasn\u2019t always been so forthcoming \u2013 but perhaps he has got to a point in his life where he no longer cares about things that are out of his hands. Fame, he admits, hasn\u2019t always been easy; he has had four decades of it. He was 25 when his first film, Breaking Away, was released and he can still remember feeling \u201cvery freaked out\u201d after being followed up and down a pharmacy aisle by a woman and her kids.</p> <p>Things escalated when he married Ryan in 1991 after they fell in love on the set of D.O.A. \u201cIt was out of control, being followed all the time, wherever you went, kind of stalked basically,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was champagne problems, you know, but looking back it was very intrusive. Meg had a couple of stalkers. It felt like a fish bowl. An actor\u2019s job is to engage with life \u2013 that\u2019s what you draw from \u2013 but when you\u2019re being observed, it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>\u201cEventually, I was immune to it. I\u2019m a people person, really. And it takes the onus off it; it\u2019s kind of an opportunity to engage. Constantly turning away from it starts to make you feel bad.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to his acting career, Quaid claims he has more fire in his belly now than ever before. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to win an Oscar. I\u2019m not trying to get a bigger career. I\u2019m not trying to make it.\u201d The turning point, he says, was in 2003, after he failed to get an Oscar nomination for Todd Haynes\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/mar/07/artsfeatures2\" title=\"\">period drama Far From Heaven</a>, despite being led to believe he was a shoo-in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e3e8bd7847a993e577fd1c1e5e8ac0ef154d577\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e3e8bd7847a993e577fd1c1e5e8ac0ef154d577/0_0_2010_3000/670.jpg\" alt=\"With Meg Ryan in D.O.A.\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Meg Ryan in D.O.A.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Touchstone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI felt embarrassed and a little humiliated,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut then I thought, it\u2019s silly putting my self-worth in any of this; this is not why I started doing it. The only real joy I get out of acting is when I\u2019m on set. All the rest of it is a circus. I think it started to change from there.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Far From Heaven, and The Rookie (2012) \u2013 a Disney sports drama in which he played the lead \u2013 signalled a successful new era for Quaid and he has worked consistently, albeit with a slightly lower profile, ever since.</p> <p>He says he never again experienced a lull (or what he calls \u201cHollywood jail\u201d) quite like the one after coming out of rehab in 1990. \u201cI was always supposedly just one movie away from having a huge career,\u201d he says with an eye roll. \u201cIn Hollywood, if you take a year off, they\u2019ll find somebody else. So I had to hustle. Parent Trap was the first time I started playing dads, which I resisted \u2013 you know, \u2018I wanna be the cool guy dressed in black\u2019 \u2013 but I learned to trust my agent. At that time, I really needed to let someone else make decisions for me.\u201d</p> <p>Does he worry about not having his pick of roles any more? That what he is making won\u2019t match the success he has had before? \u201cI don\u2019t really look at the box office. Sure, I want every film to have huge success. I love that feeling of having huge success \u2013 like with The Day After Tomorrow or The Rookie \u2013 but a movie comes out and that wonderful feeling lasts for about 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Quaid has turned down some hugely successful films, including the Tom Hanks 80s smash Big. Does he have any regrets? \u201cOh yeah, of course. I turned down Tom Hanks\u2019 career! I turned down League of Their Own. Sleepless in Seattle was mine. And yet, all of a sudden, it wasn\u2019t. I turned it down because of the director on it at the time. I said: \u2018You should get Nora Ephron.\u2019 But because I turned it down, they were free to do anything they wanted, so I wound up out of it [even though Ephron did direct] and my wife at the time [Ryan] was in it!\u201d</p> <p>Quaid\u2019s latest project, an eight-part comedy sitcom for Netflix called Merry Happy Whatever, seems like an odd choice, but he has his reasons. \u201cWhen I get offered something and fear shoots up my spine then I think I should probably do it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The series \u2013 in which he plays Don Quinn, the \u201cgruff and opinionated\u201d patriarch of a family reunited in a suburban town for the Christmas holidays \u2013 doesn\u2019t feel like it would be a challenge for Quaid. \u201cBut it was terrifying at first,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d never done a sitcom before. I felt like the weakest member of the cast for a couple of weeks. I\u2019ve never had a strategy for my career except to try as many different things as possible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc7017848b53049a070a9a35d72d544b32e07deb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc7017848b53049a070a9a35d72d544b32e07deb/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Garcelle Beauvais in the new Netflix show Merry Happy Whatever.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Garcelle Beauvais in the new Netflix show Merry Happy Whatever.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Rose/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is that why he\u2019s an executive producer on the show? \u201cI got us a couple of days off as a cast, other than that it was a vanity title,\u201d he admits. \u201cNext year \u2013 God willing we get a second season \u2013 I will be able to really executive produce, now that I\u2019ve found my legs.\u201d</p> <p>As someone who has made a living starring in films rather than on television, I wonder if he can understand why parts of the industry are resistant to streaming platforms. \u201cTo tell you the truth,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m bored for the most part, with studio films, these days. I go to the movies and watch the trailers and they all look like the same movie.</p> <p>\u201cStudios used to make 40 to 50 films a year; now they make eight to 10. They\u2019re all tent poles, which is fine \u2013 I\u2019m not complaining \u2013 but it\u2019s become more corporate, and that started with Star Wars. What\u2019s happening with streaming television is very much like what was happening with movies in the 1970s where the inmates had taken over the asylum and anything could happen. I think it\u2019s a golden age, I really do.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, it was announced that Quaid would play Ronald Reagan in a highly touted biopic directed by Sean McNamara (whom Quaid previously worked with on Soul Surfer in 2011). No stranger to American presidents, having portrayed Bill Clinton opposite Michael Sheen\u2019s Tony Blair in Peter Morgan\u2019s The Special Relationship (2010), Quaid couldn\u2019t wait to get his teeth into the role.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m saying it: it\u2019s not happening,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have the money. I was really looking forward to it because I got a shiver of fear up my spine about it. He was my favourite president of the 20th century. I didn\u2019t agree with him politically on a few things, but he was emblematic of my mother and father\u2019s generation and a great communicator. It\u2019s a really good script. I\u2019m feeling cheated.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f56b08ef804275df141b1738119b28a7590b6217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f56b08ef804275df141b1738119b28a7590b6217/0_570_4985_2991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019ll go in the voting booth and have to make a decision.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ll go in the voting booth and have to make a decision.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind the scenes, Quaid doesn\u2019t align himself with a political party. \u201cI\u2019ve voted both sides all my life according to where the pendulum is,\u201d he says. Which way is it swinging next? \u201cI really don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just so fed up with it.\u201d What will he do in the next election? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go in the voting booth and have to make a decision. I vote every time.\u201d</p> <p>After our interview, Quaid is going straight to the Dominican Republic to shoot his next film. Before he leaves, I ask him about the impact Harvey Weinstein has had on Hollywood. He worked with him on two Miramax films, Playing By Heart (1998) and Smart People (2008).</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was about women with Harvey. It was about men and women; it was a power thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he was the guy in school that could never get the girl and so he extracted revenge over four decades and there\u2019s a price to be paid. It\u2019s kind of pathetic that we\u2019ve gotten to this point. It used to be called common courtesy, the way you were supposed to behave, and it takes a little zing out of the relationship between men and women.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s really good that this [the #MeToo movement] happened because the casting couch was a very real thing and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want my daughter to put up with that bullshit. It\u2019s a reintroduction to common courtesy; the way that we should treat everybody in life.\u201d</p>",

The series \u2013 in which he plays Don Quinn, the \u201cgruff and opinionated\u201d patriarch of a family reunited in a suburban town for the Christmas holidays \u2013 doesn\u2019t feel like it would be a challenge for Quaid. \u201cBut it was terrifying at first,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d never done a sitcom before. I felt like the weakest member of the cast for a couple of weeks. I\u2019ve never had a strategy for my career except to try as many different things as possible.\u201d Is that why he\u2019s an executive producer on the show? \u201cI got us a couple of days off as a cast, other than that it was a vanity title,\u201d he admits. \u201cNext year \u2013 God willing we get a second season \u2013 I will be able to really executive produce, now that I\u2019ve found my legs.\u201d As someone who has made a living starring in films rather than on television, I wonder if he can understand why parts of the industry are resistant to streaming platforms. \u201cTo tell you the truth,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m bored for the most part, with studio films, these days. I go to the movies and watch the trailers and they all look like the same movie. \u201cStudios used to make 40 to 50 films a year; now they make eight to 10. They\u2019re all tent poles, which is fine \u2013 I\u2019m not complaining \u2013 but it\u2019s become more corporate, and that started with Star Wars. What\u2019s happening with streaming television is very much like what was happening with movies in the 1970s where the inmates had taken over the asylum and anything could happen. I think it\u2019s a golden age, I really do.\u201d Last year, it was announced that Quaid would play Ronald Reagan in a highly touted biopic directed by Sean McNamara (whom Quaid previously worked with on Soul Surfer in 2011). No stranger to American presidents, having portrayed Bill Clinton opposite Michael Sheen\u2019s Tony Blair in Peter Morgan\u2019s The Special Relationship (2010), Quaid couldn\u2019t wait to get his teeth into the role. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m saying it: it\u2019s not happening,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have the money. I was really looking forward to it because I got a shiver of fear up my spine about it. He was my favourite president of the 20th century. I didn\u2019t agree with him politically on a few things, but he was emblematic of my mother and father\u2019s generation and a great communicator. It\u2019s a really good script. I\u2019m feeling cheated.\u201d Behind the scenes, Quaid doesn\u2019t align himself with a political party. \u201cI\u2019ve voted both sides all my life according to where the pendulum is,\u201d he says. Which way is it swinging next? \u201cI really don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just so fed up with it.\u201d What will he do in the next election? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go in the voting booth and have to make a decision. I vote every time.\u201d After our interview, Quaid is going straight to the Dominican Republic to shoot his next film. Before he leaves, I ask him about the impact Harvey Weinstein has had on Hollywood. He worked with him on two Miramax films, Playing By Heart (1998) and Smart People (2008). \u201cI don\u2019t think it was about women with Harvey. It was about men and women; it was a power thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he was the guy in school that could never get the girl and so he extracted revenge over four decades and there\u2019s a price to be paid. It\u2019s kind of pathetic that we\u2019ve gotten to this point. It used to be called common courtesy, the way you were supposed to behave, and it takes a little zing out of the relationship between men and women. \u201cBut it\u2019s really good that this [the #MeToo movement] happened because the casting couch was a very real thing and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want my daughter to put up with that bullshit. It\u2019s a reintroduction to common courtesy; the way that we should treat everybody in life.\u201d",

The charity Crisis is running a pop-up event encouraging homeless people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/how-do-i-register-to-vote-in-the-12-december-2019-general-election\">register so they can have their say</a> in the upcoming election.</p> <p>Crisis and other charities have been making a concerted effort to help those without a permanent address exert their democratic right. Advice desks, such as this one in Birmingham, have been set up and outreach workers have been helping homeless people register to vote across the country.</p> <p>Those without a fixed address can <a href=\"https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/people-no-fixed-address\">register at a place where they spend a lot of time</a> or have some link through a \u201cdeclaration of local connection\u201d form. Homeless people can also register the address of a night or day shelter.</p> <p>Despite this, data indicates the numbers of homeless voters is low. Figures from the Electoral Commission found that 2,963 individuals registered under \u201cdeclaration of local connection\u201d in 2016, the only year data was recorded. This is a fraction of the estimated 320,000 homeless population.</p> <p>The problem of homelessness has come into increasing focus. Rough sleeping has continued to rise in London and other big cities; 726 homeless people died in England and Wales last year on the streets and in temporary accommodation.</p> <p>Last week, two homeless people died: one man who was found next to a Hilton hotel in Nottingham city centre, and another man who was found dead in a tent in West Yorkshire. Despite this, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/19/rage-and-responsibility-nine-months-of-reporting-homeless-deaths-why-isnt-it-election-priority\">issue has not been a priority for leading parties in their election pledges</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97c5f28cd8d5c19046e4c68172ade442d7c497a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97c5f28cd8d5c19046e4c68172ade442d7c497a0/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters go up in accommodation areas of the Salvation Army\u2019s Birmingham hostel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters are put up in accommodation areas of the Salvation Army\u2019s Birmingham hostel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Birmingham, a man on crutches walks past the Crisis stand and a leaflet that says: \u201cYour Vote Matters\u201d. He has not voted for a long time, he says, but after a brief chat decides to register his name.</p> <p>Amy Fleming, the public affairs officer at St Mungo\u2019s, says: \u201cThe most important thing is going out to where clients are and going into services and trying to encourage them to register to vote but also having general chats about the election.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not going to immediately get someone to register but once you give them the space and opportunity to talk about politics, you find out their opinions and let them know their opinions are valued, that can help.</p> <p>\u201cThe expectation is that it will be a long process but if someone is staying in temporary accommodation they can use that address to register and then they only need their date of birth and national insurance number.\u201d</p> <p>Charities say there appears to be high engagement this year. \u201cMy sense is that this year there is an increased appetite to vote,\u201d says Steve Lee, senior campaigns officer for Crisis. \u201cIt could be because things have come to such a point \u2013 things are so bad now, they are beyond ignoring. People\u2019s individual experiences tells them something has to change and homelessness cannot continue to rise as has done and homeless services cannot be cut as they have been.\u201d</p> <p>Fleming says: \u201cI do feel homeless people are quite engaged. Maybe not at first, when you first go in, there is often \u2018Oh not again [another election]\u2019.

      "bodyText": "This is the first time Brent Hayward has found himself homeless and it is also the first time he has registered to vote. \u201cSomething is telling me to vote,\u201d says Hayward, 52, sitting in a Salvation Army-run hostel in Birmingham. \u201cSomething is telling me to do it. \u201cI am not keen on politicians but every four years the same people come in and out of power and promise you the world and nothing happens,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut the NHS needs help, people like us here [need help]. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been in a hostel but the people here are brilliant.\u201d It\u2019s teatime at the Salvation Army William Booth centre Lifehouse, and talk has turned to politics. The charity Crisis is running a pop-up event encouraging homeless people to register so they can have their say in the upcoming election. Crisis and other charities have been making a concerted effort to help those without a permanent address exert their democratic right. Advice desks, such as this one in Birmingham, have been set up and outreach workers have been helping homeless people register to vote across the country. Those without a fixed address can register at a place where they spend a lot of time or have some link through a \u201cdeclaration of local connection\u201d form. Homeless people can also register the address of a night or day shelter. Despite this, data indicates the numbers of homeless voters is low. Figures from the Electoral Commission found that 2,963 individuals registered under \u201cdeclaration of local connection\u201d in 2016, the only year data was recorded. This is a fraction of the estimated 320,000 homeless population. The problem of homelessness has come into increasing focus. Rough sleeping has continued to rise in London and other big cities; 726 homeless people died in England and Wales last year on the streets and in temporary accommodation. Last week, two homeless people died: one man who was found next to a Hilton hotel in Nottingham city centre, and another man who was found dead in a tent in West Yorkshire. Despite this, the issue has not been a priority for leading parties in their election pledges. In Birmingham, a man on crutches walks past the Crisis stand and a leaflet that says: \u201cYour Vote Matters\u201d. He has not voted for a long time, he says, but after a brief chat decides to register his name. Amy Fleming, the public affairs officer at St Mungo\u2019s, says: \u201cThe most important thing is going out to where clients are and going into services and trying to encourage them to register to vote but also having general chats about the election. \u201cYou are not going to immediately get someone to register but once you give them the space and opportunity to talk about politics, you find out their opinions and let them know their opinions are valued, that can help. \u201cThe expectation is that it will be a long process but if someone is staying in temporary accommodation they can use that address to register and then they only need their date of birth and national insurance number.\u201d Charities say there appears to be high engagement this year. \u201cMy sense is that this year there is an increased appetite to vote,\u201d says Steve Lee, senior campaigns officer for Crisis. \u201cIt could be because things have come to such a point \u2013 things are so bad now, they are beyond ignoring. People\u2019s individual experiences tells them something has to change and homelessness cannot continue to rise as has done and homeless services cannot be cut as they have been.\u201d Fleming says: \u201cI do feel homeless people are quite engaged. Maybe not at first, when you first go in, there is often \u2018Oh not again [another election]\u2019. There is a sense from clients sometimes things won\u2019t change and they feel let down by the system and it isn\u2019t working for them. But if we do get into debates and conversations about it there is definitely interest.\u201d Last month, it was leaked that the Conservatives planned to make showing ID such as driving licences or passports at the ballot box a requirement. Charities are worried about its impact on voters without an address. \u201cIt could make it harder for homeless people and \u2026 obviously a lot of our clients don\u2019t have ID and that is one of the things people are pleased about when you go to register,\u201d says Fleming. Jon Sparkes, chief executive at Crisis, says: \u201cIt is very difficult for anyone to keep documents safe when they have no fixed address.

      "body": "<p>Take no chances. Make no mistakes. Maintain strict message discipline. Like a football team two up with 20 minutes to play, the Conservatives think the only way they can lose the election is if they throw it away.</p> <p>The contrast between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/boris-johnson-launches-conservative-manifesto-with-50000-nurses-pledge\">manifesto</a> launched by Boris Johnson and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-to-slap-11bn-tax-on-oil-and-gas-firms-to-fund-green-plan\">Labour\u2019s last week</a> was marked. Behind in the polls and with only three weeks to go before election day, Jeremy Corbyn has gambled that voters are ready for radicalism. In sporting terms, he has thrown on three strikers as subs and sent his centre half up from the back in the hope of getting back in the game.</p> <p>The prime minister, by contrast, is seeking to run down the clock until 12 December, relying on the fact that his \u201cget Brexit done\u201d line has cut through. Things started to go pear-shaped for Theresa May in 2017 when her manifesto plans for social care were dubbed a \u201cdementia tax\u201d. This time, the Conservatives have said the answer is to build a long-term, cross-party consensus.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s pitch throughout the campaign has been that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will unleash a wave of pent-up investment and, by ending the uncertainty, lead to faster economic growth.</p> <p>But there is no guarantee that this will happen, particularly since even if Brexit does go ahead on 31 January next year, the rest of 2020 will be spent trying to conclude a trade deal with the EU before the transition period ends. The forecasts for growth and borrowing that will be provided by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility for the budget that will take place once the election is over will not make pretty reading.</p> <p>So while Johnson was upbeat at the manifesto launch, the document itself was a much more cautious affair. While a Labour government would be spending \u00a383bn a year more on day-to-day spending by the end of the next parliament, the Conservatives would limit themselves to a \u00a33bn a year increase. The two parties are also a long way apart on capital spending: both would borrow to invest but Labour would be prepared to borrow an addition \u00a380bn each year, the Conservatives \u00a33bn next year rising to \u00a38bn by 2023.</p> <p>One reason for that is that most of the spending increases announced in the manifesto were announced by the prime minister shortly after he arrived in Downing Street and were included in September\u2019s spending round. There is more money for the NHS but as Paul Johnson, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019\">Institute for Fiscal Studies </a>noted, only a big rise when compared to the tight settlements of the past decade. Over a longer period, the past 40-50 years, it will be a smaller than average increase.</p> <p>The safety first approach has its risks. Pledging to spend more on hospitals, schools and the police has been a recognition that voters have wearied of austerity and want a change of course. This is an election that is being fought on ground that suits Labour.</p> <p>To counter that disadvantage, Johnson has offered modest increases in spending in areas that focus groups have suggested are politically sensitive: such as the time it takes to get a GP appointment and the poor state of Britain\u2019s roads. He has shelved plans to raise the threshold at which the 40% income tax bracket kicks in, choosing instead to raise gradually the level at which national insurance contributions are levied. In addition, he has promised a triple tax lock: no increases in income tax, NICs or VAT rates over the next parliament. \u201cBrexit is happening\u201d, said Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation think tank, \u201cbut big tax cuts aren\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Corbyn said the manifesto was a package for billionaires, the Conservatives hope it will go down well with the electorate, especially former Labour voters in the Midlands and the North of England. Johnson thinks the public remains suspicious of parties making big spending commitments that rely on substantial extra borrowing.</p> <p>After saying Labour\u2019s manifesto lacked credibility, the IFS\u2019s Johnson said the Conservative offering was notable for its lack of ambition. \u201cIf a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>This is a risk because teams that are two up with 15 minutes to go and play it safe sometimes lose. Not often, but often enough for Johnson to keep glancing at the clock.</p>",

Behind in the polls and with only three weeks to go before election day, Jeremy Corbyn has gambled that voters are ready for radicalism. In sporting terms, he has thrown on three strikers as subs and sent his centre half up from the back in the hope of getting back in the game. The prime minister, by contrast, is seeking to run down the clock until 12 December, relying on the fact that his \u201cget Brexit done\u201d line has cut through. Things started to go pear-shaped for Theresa May in 2017 when her manifesto plans for social care were dubbed a \u201cdementia tax\u201d. This time, the Conservatives have said the answer is to build a long-term, cross-party consensus. Johnson\u2019s pitch throughout the campaign has been that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will unleash a wave of pent-up investment and, by ending the uncertainty, lead to faster economic growth. But there is no guarantee that this will happen, particularly since even if Brexit does go ahead on 31 January next year, the rest of 2020 will be spent trying to conclude a trade deal with the EU before the transition period ends. The forecasts for growth and borrowing that will be provided by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility for the budget that will take place once the election is over will not make pretty reading. So while Johnson was upbeat at the manifesto launch, the document itself was a much more cautious affair. While a Labour government would be spending \u00a383bn a year more on day-to-day spending by the end of the next parliament, the Conservatives would limit themselves to a \u00a33bn a year increase. The two parties are also a long way apart on capital spending: both would borrow to invest but Labour would be prepared to borrow an addition \u00a380bn each year, the Conservatives \u00a33bn next year rising to \u00a38bn by 2023. One reason for that is that most of the spending increases announced in the manifesto were announced by the prime minister shortly after he arrived in Downing Street and were included in September\u2019s spending round. There is more money for the NHS but as Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted, only a big rise when compared to the tight settlements of the past decade. Over a longer period, the past 40-50 years, it will be a smaller than average increase. The safety first approach has its risks. Pledging to spend more on hospitals, schools and the police has been a recognition that voters have wearied of austerity and want a change of course. This is an election that is being fought on ground that suits Labour. To counter that disadvantage, Johnson has offered modest increases in spending in areas that focus groups have suggested are politically sensitive: such as the time it takes to get a GP appointment and the poor state of Britain\u2019s roads. He has shelved plans to raise the threshold at which the 40% income tax bracket kicks in, choosing instead to raise gradually the level at which national insurance contributions are levied. In addition, he has promised a triple tax lock: no increases in income tax, NICs or VAT rates over the next parliament. \u201cBrexit is happening\u201d, said Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation think tank, \u201cbut big tax cuts aren\u2019t.\u201d While Corbyn said the manifesto was a package for billionaires, the Conservatives hope it will go down well with the electorate, especially former Labour voters in the Midlands and the North of England. Johnson thinks the public remains suspicious of parties making big spending commitments that rely on substantial extra borrowing. After saying Labour\u2019s manifesto lacked credibility, the IFS\u2019s Johnson said the Conservative offering was notable for its lack of ambition. \u201cIf a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.\u201d This is a risk because teams that are two up with 15 minutes to go and play it safe sometimes lose. Not often, but often enough for Johnson to keep glancing at the clock.",

The report will go to the House judiciary committee, which will determine if and on what grounds an impeachment vote will be held. A Senate trial could offer an opportunity to obtain testimony from witnesses who have not cooperated with the House investigation, including Mulvaney, the former national security adviser John Bolton and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, Schiff said.

The review found implementation was \u201clargely effective\u201d, but revealed the government agency could not guarantee that all \u201cemergency access\u201d requests to view an individual\u2019s record were legitimate, and that four privacy reviews funded since it became an \u201copt-out\u201d system were never finished. The Australian National Audit Office review said the cybersecurity and privacy risks were not properly managed or considered by the Australian Digital Health Agency, which oversees the national electronic heath records. The database, which relies on doctors and medical practices to upload clinical information about patients, seeks to ensure continuity of care for patients with all medical information centralised. It was opt-in from 2012, but converted to opt-out this year. Despite widespread privacy concerns and some revelations of software bugs, 90% of Australians now have a My Health record. Less than a quarter of Australia\u2019s healthcare provider organisations are using the system. The audit office review, commissioned to review implementation under the \u201copt-out\u201d model, found that the system had \u201clargely appropriate\u201d systems to manage cybersecurity risks within itself, but had failed to provide appropriate protections against shared risk with third-party sites and apps, and health provider organisations. \u201cManagement of shared cybersecurity risks was not appropriate and should be improved with respect to those risks that are shared with third-party software vendors and healthcare provider organisations,\u201d the report said. The audit office said that at the time of writing the report the ADHA had not conducted an end-to-end privacy risk assessment of the system\u2019s operation under the opt-out model. The most recent privacy impact assessment was in 2017, and the four privacy reviews between October 2017 and June 2019, which cost $3.6m, were not completed.

However, the audit office found the ADHA could not provide assurances that all instances of \u201cemergency access\u201d to an individual\u2019s health record were not an interference with that person\u2019s privacy. Monthly use of emergency accesses increased from 80 in July 2018 to 205 in March 2019. The review found that only 8.2% of requests met guidelines. The review said while the ADHA monitored emergency access and requesting responses from the accessing organisation, it had no procedure for what to do next. In a number of instances the ADHA received no response, and had not notified the information commissioner about any of the accesses. In early 2016 the ADHA identified \u201cnation states and criminal actors as the greatest threat to the My Health Record system, with hacktivists and trusted insiders posing a medium threat and cyberterrorists posing a low threat\u201d. The audit office also reported that not all Australian healthcare providers achieved minimum cybersecurity levels, and that the sector reported the most notifiable data breaches of any industry sector in 2018. More than 40% of data breaches reported to the information commissioner from the private health service provider sector were due to \u201cmalicious or criminal attacks\u201d, of which almost half were cyber-incidents, it said. The review also found cybersecurity risk oversight could be stronger, as the ADHA board received dedicated briefings just four times between July 2016 and February 2019, and had not considered the updated cybersecurity five-year strategic plan, which was finalised last year.

      "body": "<p>Greece is poised to create \u201cprison\u201d island camps, say aid groups amid growing criticism of government plans to overhaul refugee reception centres on Aegean outposts facing Turkey.</p> <p>As the UN refugee agency\u2019s top official, Filippo Grandi, prepared this week to fly to Lesbos, where almost 16,000 people are crammed into a single facility, Athens was criticised for adopting legislation in contravention of basic human rights.</p> <p>Disquiet mounted as the centre-right administration, which was elected on a tough law and order platform in July, declared that the country again at the forefront of the migration crisis had \u201creached its limits\u201d.</p> <p>Announcing measures to tackle a significant increase in arrivals, not seen at such levels since 2015 when nearly a million Syrians entered Europe via the isles, it promised future policies would be defined by deterrence.</p> <p>Under the scheme, closed installations will replace vastly overcrowded, open-air camps; land and sea borders will be reinforced with about 1,200 more guards and extra patrol vessels and deportations stepped up.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the eye of the storm,\u201d said the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, conceding that pressure on Greece to patrol its eastern frontiers had risen dramatically in the wake of Europe\u2019s decision to seal off the nation\u2019s northern borders against migrant flows. \u201cThe country needs a national strategy.\u201d</p> <p>With the new structures, which will be built to hold no more than 5,000 people, the era \u201cof shameful scenes\u201d spawned by the deplorable conditions of notorious island camps would, he vowed, finally be replaced \u201cby images of modern, properly functioning installations\u201d.</p> <p>But international aid groups have overwhelmingly condemned the measures. After criticising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/01/greece-passes-asylum-law-aimed-at-curbing-migrant-arrivals\">asylum legislation also passed this month</a>, they predicted the remodelled facilities would only exacerbate the humanitarian disaster unfolding on Europe\u2019s frontiers.</p> <p>Martha Roussou, senior advocacy officer for the International Rescue Committee in Greece, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s announcements represent a blatant disregard for human rights. The creation of closed facilities will simply mean that extremely vulnerable people, including children, will be kept in prison-like conditions, without having committed any crime.\u201d</p> <p>The Greek branch of Amnesty International called the plans \u201coutrageous\u201d. Likening Lesbos\u2019s infamous Moria refugee camp to a \u201chuman rights black hole\u201d, it said: \u201cIn reality, we are talking about the creation of contemporary jails with inhumane consequences for asylum seekers, and more widely, negative consequences for the Aegean islands and their inhabitants.\u201d</p> <p>About 37,000 asylum seekers are trapped on islands that since the summer have been targeted with renewed vigour by traffickers.</p> <p>With Greece being lashed by rainstorms as winter intensifies, groups have increasingly raised the alarm over what many are calling a humanitarian disaster. Officially, reception facilities on Samos, Lesbos, Chios, Kos and Leros have a capacity to accommodate about 5,400 people.</p> <p>The number of men, women and children making the treacherous sea crossing from Turkey has risen by 73% this year, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. It said the vast majority are refugees fleeing persecution and war.</p> <p>The influx marks the biggest jump in arrivals since March 2016 when the EU struck a landmark accord with Ankara to curb flows. The deal, which until this year resulted in the number of arrivals dropping significantly, forced asylum seekers to remain on islands until their claims were cleared. Overwhelmed services are dealing with a backlog of 70,000 asylum requests nationwide.</p> <p>After visiting the camps last week, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2019 international president, Christos Christou, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been truly shocked and devastated by the extent of the emergency. Men, women and children are trapped in endless drama \u2026 In Moria on Lesbos there\u2019s one latrine per 200 people. In Samos, one latrine per 300. This human tragedy needs to end now and it can if Greece and Europe choose to enact a responsible migration system and end these containment policies.\u201d</p> <p>With local island communities equally under pressure, Mitsotakis has pledged that by early next year 20,000 people will be transferred to newly built camps on the mainland. Asylum processing is also to be accelerated, with an extra 500 staff hired to vet procedures.</p> <p>On Sunday, Mitsotakis addressed the issue of unaccompanied minors, thought to number more than 4,000. He said special steps would be taken to \u201cclose the wound\u201d of youngsters also in Greece.</p> <p>But while those measures are considered long overdue, the government\u2019s plan to replace camps with closed facilities, that will detain asylum seekers alongside those whose claims have been rejected, has faced particular criticism.</p> <p>The UNHCR\u2019s representative in Greece, Philippe Leclerc, told the Guardian he was particularly concerned by the message of deterrence the new policies conveyed.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe need the islands to be decongested for asylum procedures to be processed and so welcome such action. But we don\u2019t see the need for asylum seekers to be kept in closed centres. Most of those coming in are from Afghanistan and Syria. They have the profiles of refugees and are deserving of asylum.\u201d</p> <p>In a nation that had previously exhibited sympathy and compassion towards refugees, attitudes are hardening.

      "bodyText": "Greece is poised to create \u201cprison\u201d island camps, say aid groups amid growing criticism of government plans to overhaul refugee reception centres on Aegean outposts facing Turkey. As the UN refugee agency\u2019s top official, Filippo Grandi, prepared this week to fly to Lesbos, where almost 16,000 people are crammed into a single facility, Athens was criticised for adopting legislation in contravention of basic human rights. Disquiet mounted as the centre-right administration, which was elected on a tough law and order platform in July, declared that the country again at the forefront of the migration crisis had \u201creached its limits\u201d. Announcing measures to tackle a significant increase in arrivals, not seen at such levels since 2015 when nearly a million Syrians entered Europe via the isles, it promised future policies would be defined by deterrence. Under the scheme, closed installations will replace vastly overcrowded, open-air camps; land and sea borders will be reinforced with about 1,200 more guards and extra patrol vessels and deportations stepped up. \u201cWe are in the eye of the storm,\u201d said the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, conceding that pressure on Greece to patrol its eastern frontiers had risen dramatically in the wake of Europe\u2019s decision to seal off the nation\u2019s northern borders against migrant flows. \u201cThe country needs a national strategy.\u201d With the new structures, which will be built to hold no more than 5,000 people, the era \u201cof shameful scenes\u201d spawned by the deplorable conditions of notorious island camps would, he vowed, finally be replaced \u201cby images of modern, properly functioning installations\u201d. But international aid groups have overwhelmingly condemned the measures. After criticising asylum legislation also passed this month, they predicted the remodelled facilities would only exacerbate the humanitarian disaster unfolding on Europe\u2019s frontiers. Martha Roussou, senior advocacy officer for the International Rescue Committee in Greece, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s announcements represent a blatant disregard for human rights. The creation of closed facilities will simply mean that extremely vulnerable people, including children, will be kept in prison-like conditions, without having committed any crime.\u201d The Greek branch of Amnesty International called the plans \u201coutrageous\u201d. Likening Lesbos\u2019s infamous Moria refugee camp to a \u201chuman rights black hole\u201d, it said: \u201cIn reality, we are talking about the creation of contemporary jails with inhumane consequences for asylum seekers, and more widely, negative consequences for the Aegean islands and their inhabitants.\u201d About 37,000 asylum seekers are trapped on islands that since the summer have been targeted with renewed vigour by traffickers. With Greece being lashed by rainstorms as winter intensifies, groups have increasingly raised the alarm over what many are calling a humanitarian disaster. Officially, reception facilities on Samos, Lesbos, Chios, Kos and Leros have a capacity to accommodate about 5,400 people. The number of men, women and children making the treacherous sea crossing from Turkey has risen by 73% this year, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. It said the vast majority are refugees fleeing persecution and war. The influx marks the biggest jump in arrivals since March 2016 when the EU struck a landmark accord with Ankara to curb flows. The deal, which until this year resulted in the number of arrivals dropping significantly, forced asylum seekers to remain on islands until their claims were cleared. Overwhelmed services are dealing with a backlog of 70,000 asylum requests nationwide. After visiting the camps last week, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2019 international president, Christos Christou, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been truly shocked and devastated by the extent of the emergency. Men, women and children are trapped in endless drama \u2026 In Moria on Lesbos there\u2019s one latrine per 200 people. In Samos, one latrine per 300. This human tragedy needs to end now and it can if Greece and Europe choose to enact a responsible migration system and end these containment policies.\u201d With local island communities equally under pressure, Mitsotakis has pledged that by early next year 20,000 people will be transferred to newly built camps on the mainland. Asylum processing is also to be accelerated, with an extra 500 staff hired to vet procedures. On Sunday, Mitsotakis addressed the issue of unaccompanied minors, thought to number more than 4,000. He said special steps would be taken to \u201cclose the wound\u201d of youngsters also in Greece. But while those measures are considered long overdue, the government\u2019s plan to replace camps with closed facilities, that will detain asylum seekers alongside those whose claims have been rejected, has faced particular criticism. The UNHCR\u2019s representative in Greece, Philippe Leclerc, told the Guardian he was particularly concerned by the message of deterrence the new policies conveyed. He said: \u201cWe need the islands to be decongested for asylum procedures to be processed and so welcome such action. But we don\u2019t see the need for asylum seekers to be kept in closed centres. Most of those coming in are from Afghanistan and Syria. They have the profiles of refugees and are deserving of asylum.\u201d In a nation that had previously exhibited sympathy and compassion towards refugees, attitudes are hardening. In sharp contrast to its leftist predecessor, the Mitsotakis government is determined to stop would-be migrants in their tracks. Government spokesman Stelios Petsas outlined the measures last week: \u201cA clear message should be sent to those planning, or thinking of coming to the country illegally when they aren\u2019t entitled to asylum. They should realise \u2026 if they give money to a trafficker to bring them to Greece they will lose it.\u201d With the influx showing no sign of abating \u2013 about 643 refugees and migrants were rescued in the Aegean over the last 24 hours \u2013 arrivals are outpacing transfers, and the government also faces tough resistance from Greeks. In Chios, Lesbos and on the mainland, the prospect of the new detention centres has been met with anger, with locals staging protests, blockading the arrival of coaches carrying refugees and promising to step up opposition in the months ahead.",

Officials were instructed to subject the 23 Australians \u2013 and 52 other people believed to have second passports and be inside China \u2013 to identity verification \u201cone by one\u201d and then to either deport or detain them. The revelations come from documents, which include four \u201cbulletins\u201d, that provide rare insight into the structure, daily life and ideological framework behind centres in north-western Xinjiang region that have provoked international condemnation. The documents date from 2017 and were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared them with the Guardian and 16 other media partners. Experts who have reviewed them believe them to be authentic. The documents reveal that by June 2017, China had identified 1,535 Xinjiang natives with second passports, and 4,341 people who had \u201cobtained identity documents\u201d in Chinese embassies, according to one bulletin entitled \u201cBackflow prevention\u201d. Of these, 75 were dual nationals thought to be active inside China. They include 23 Australians, 26 Turkish nationals, two UK citizens, two New Zealanders, five Canadians, three Americans and a handful from other countries including Sweden, Finland, France, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Those people who were found to have renounced their Chinese citizenship were to be deported, said the bulletin. \u201cFor those who haven\u2019t cancelled their [Chinese] citizenship yet, and for whom suspected terrorism cannot be ruled out, they should first be placed into concentrated education and training and examined,\u201d the bulletin said. China considers anyone who has not explicitly renounced their Chinese nationality to remain a Chinese citizen. The document also said that those who contacted embassies while abroad should be flagged for border checks on their return. \u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing and it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Fatimah Abdulghafur, who is active in the Sydney Uighur community. \u201cBecause those people trusted in their Australian passport, that\u2019s why they were so bold to go back to China, they thought the passport would protect them, Australia would protect them. And it\u2019s not just one or two, it\u2019s 23.\u201d Abdulghafur said she was pleased to see the release of the cables as it confirmed what expatriate Uighur community members had been hearing for years, but that seeing the details of the treatment of her people in those documents was \u201chorrifying\u201d. Muslims in Xinjiang with contacts outside China have already reported being targets of Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown. Dual nationals have been rounded up and detained, despite protests from foreign relatives or diplomats representing their second nationality. Those in Xinjiang are questioned about relatives in other countries, and communication with loved ones abroad has ground to a virtual halt. Uighurs in Australia have told the Guardian that their family members in Xinjiang have begged them not to contact them, as receiving phone calls from people outside China can raise suspicion and be grounds for arrest and detention. Uighurs living abroad have described attempts to lure them home, often through requests from relatives, or to pressure them into spying on neighbours. Those who return to China frequently disappear into the camps. Australia has one of the largest Uighur communities outside of China and central Asia. Its 3,000-strong Uighur community has been calling on the government in Canberra to secure the release of Australian residents detained in Xinjiang, in camps, under house arrest or unable to leave the country. The Guardian revealed in April that five Australian children were detained in Xinjiang, unable to return to Australia and to be reunited with their Australian parents. In 2018, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that three Australian citizens were detained and released from China\u2019s political re-education camps in Xinjiang province in the past year. At the same time, members of Australia\u2019s Uighur population have reported serious harassment by Chinese authorities on Australian soil, including intimidating phone calls and requests to send over personal data, with the threat of reprisals against family if they do not comply. The \u201cbulletins\u201d also highlight the power and reach of China\u2019s surveillance dragnet, which combines data scooped up from automated online monitoring, with information collected in more old-fashioned ways, by officials who use an app to input it by hand. The Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) combines all this information in a detailed database of everything from an individual\u2019s exact height and electricity use, to the colour of their car, whether they socialise with neighbours and even if they prefer to use the front or back door to their house. The cables reveal that in a single week in June 2017, IJOP flagged up 24,412 \u201csuspicious\u201d individuals in one part of southern Xinjiang alone. Of these, more than 15,000 were sent to re-education camps, and a further 706 were jailed. That rate of detentions, if matched across the region and continued over time, would explain how hundreds of thousands of people have been swept into camps already.",

I have a nine o\u2019clock in Glasgow in the morning I don\u2019t feel confident about. But enough about my problems, don\u2019t you think it is ironic that when Denly and Stokes were batting with such ease and application, every passing ball made Root\u2019s dismissal look worse by comparison? And yet, a continuation of that might have saved the match, the series and thus Root\u2019s captaincy.</em></p> <p><em>Instead we have confirmation that batting on the fifth day is hard. So what should exculpate Root will actually be what condemns him. Or something.

I think it is very unlikely that Silverwood would get rid of Root after this tour, especially with the South Africa series coming so quickly on its toes. Perhaps Root himself can reconsider at the end of that tour, depending on events. All might seem much better then. Anyway, who could replace him?<br></p> <p>Interesting. Root has just said Archer has to realise, <em>\u201cThat the energy has to be there all the time.

In the past, their dominance of both cricket balls was even more evident, as your own reminiscing of the 80s and 90s can probably indicate. Anyway, point being, good bowlers can still take plenty of wickets with a Kookaburra ball by bowling accurately, using the bounce, and getting small but significant variations in the air and off the pitch.

New Zealand need something. </p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s missing in the simplistic question \u201cIs x better than y?\u201d is timeframe,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cFrank Tyson might have been a better bowler than Jimmy Anderson - briefly - but he didn\u2019t end up with 575 test wickets. Neither Botham nor Flintoff looked after their bodies as well as they should. You would hope that with Stokes\u2019 fitness ethic his real value to England might be solving the all-rounder problem for many years to come yet. For me this would make him as good if not better than the other two. And he\u2019d probably make a better captain (eventually) than the other two as well.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, of course - context is important. Flintoff was a brilliant fast bowler for quite a while, though - for longer than Stokes has been consistent so far. And Botham took what, 383 Test wickets - more than anyone until Hadlee overtook him - so Stokes doing him on longevity seems unlikely. I think there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d make a good captain, but a better chance they won\u2019t risk finding out - he\u2019s too important to compromise. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ddb28f48f087b800b62073a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T01:07:49.474Z\">1.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>66th over: England 116-4 (Denly 25, Stokes 27) </strong>After four dots, Denly turns Santner into the on side and they run one.

If they play sensibly, concentrate hard and deny themselves pleasure, they will pull it off. New Zealand do have some handy bowlers, it\u2019s true, but that\u2019s so of England too, and we saw what happened to them. </p> <p>As we all know, sport is like, like life, yeah \u2013 and never has that been more so than it is so today.

      "bodyText": "Ali Martin\u2019s match report from Bay Oval: Mike Atherton sums up this New Zealand team perfectly, \u201cmore than the sum of its parts.\u201d Congratulations to them all, to Santner, to Wagner, to Watling. And that\u2019s it from me. Time for bed. See you again soon in Hamilton, which kicks off at 11am NZ time on November 29. Good night! Jeremy is on a sleeper train. Greetings from a worryingly late-to-depart Caledonian \u201cSleeper\u201d. I have a nine o\u2019clock in Glasgow in the morning I don\u2019t feel confident about. But enough about my problems, don\u2019t you think it is ironic that when Denly and Stokes were batting with such ease and application, every passing ball made Root\u2019s dismissal look worse by comparison? And yet, a continuation of that might have saved the match, the series and thus Root\u2019s captaincy. Instead we have confirmation that batting on the fifth day is hard. So what should exculpate Root will actually be what condemns him. Or something. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to sleep on a train and think straight at the same time. I\u2019m hoping it will all seem a bit better in the light of day. I think it is very unlikely that Silverwood would get rid of Root after this tour, especially with the South Africa series coming so quickly on its toes. Perhaps Root himself can reconsider at the end of that tour, depending on events. All might seem much better then. Anyway, who could replace him? Interesting. Root has just said Archer has to realise, \u201cThat the energy has to be there all the time. But having too high expectations of him so early in his career is very dangerous.\u201d I think he\u2019s getting better with the press, its just his batting that is the worry. And the odd tactical bad call. Man of the match BJ Watling is modest: \u201cit was very satisfying, a very tough Test match and we had some valuable contributions throughout.\u201d Joe Root is honest:\u201cI think we missed an opportunity in the first innings, we could have done with making those big scores and using the scoreboard pressure as another fielder. I thought we did a lot of good stuff, its quite different from the style of cricket we\u2019ve been playing of late. It ended up being a good wicket in terms of five days, I look back at the toss, it was probably the right decision but that first innings cost us the game. We have to be honest with ourselves over the next few days, not panic, continue to work very hard.\u201d Chris Silverwood is nowhere to be seen on screen right now, not the dream start he was after in his first game as supremo. What a lip-smacking win by New Zealand. Wagner takes the spoils with 5-44, but a team performance from top to tail by a bunch of unshowy cricketers who know what it takes to win games on home soil. England all out 197, a brave flourish from Curran and Archer at the end, and impressive graft by Denly, but more than a handful of those dismissals weren\u2019t too pretty. Wagner decides on a low full toss and Broad is hit plump on the pads. There is not a chance that isn\u2019t out, but Broad reviews because, well, what the heck. A golden duck, and that, my friends, is that! Arghg! A flourish too many. Wagner digs one in, Archer swivels and hits the ball off his hip to backward square leg where he is well caught by Henry with backwards hands . The partnership of 59 in 16 overs is no more. 95th over: England 197-8 (Archer 30, Curran 29) Another Santner maiden negociated, though not without risk. Now just 22 overs left in the game, England 65 runs behind and Ian Forth has thoughts: If we fast forward an hour, I suppose runs might start to count double, as per Cardiff 2009. However that would count as getting a little ahead of ourselves. 95th over: England 197-8 (Archer 30, Curran 29) Williamson walks off the field clutching his back, but not before throwing the ball to Wagner. Wagner immediately bowls a fat, wide, juicy one that Archer flings the bat at and drives through the covers, with a follow-through for the ages. Gorgeous. 94th over: England 193-8 (Archer 24, Curran 29) Santner twists on his axel as he fires the ball into the rough outside Curran\u2019s stumps.Curran resists. Peter dangles the bait from Wellington. If we (NZ) agree to walk off now and call it a draw, will England agree to replay the rugby WC semi? Oh go on then. Has the period of national mourning ended yet by the way? 93rd over: England 193-8 (Archer 24, Curran 29) Southee in again, England defend, Archer cover-drives stylishly for a couple. Time for a spot of de Grandhomme? Michael Vaughan stirs the pot. 92nd over: England 190-8 (Archer 24, Curran 28) Sorry I spilt my coffee so didn\u2019t see a ball, but they\u2019re both still there. 91st over: England 189-8 (Archer 24, Curran 27) And on the runs flow. I can\u2019t work out if this is too risky a strategy, but it is certainly working at the moment. The fifty partnership comes up in 64 balls. Tim muses from Lombok Hi Tanya. Hi Tim! Strikes me that England\u2019s biggest error, in the whole Test, was squandering Leach\u2019s wicket last night. Just when you need him to score one off his hip in 90 mins he\u2019s feet up with a good book. What was Root thinking? So true, Leach is just the person to calm this flighty pair. 90th over: England 182-8 (Archer 23, Curran 21) A reminder that Boult has his feet up in the dressing room, off the pitch with a rib injury. Five dot balls from Santner, then Archer turns a full toss down to the boundary. 89th over: England 170-8 (Archer 19, Curran 17) Now, this is interesting, the ball is suddenly keeping very low. Three of the six deliveries from Santner are your old-fashioned daisy-trimmers, but none of them on target. Off the others, Curran slaps a couple of handsome boundaries. An email! From Tony Hastings: My two cents on the ball debate is that there\u2019s nothing more English than complaining that the ball doesn\u2019t offer the bowlers enough while simultaneously being a decidedly awful 480 for 17 for the match.Can I also say as an Aussie I\u2019m very much looking forward to playing this terrific Kiwi team this summer. Should be a ripper series. Now, now Tony, not the old whingeing poms trope. Not at this time in the morning, not when our country is such a laughing stock. Have some understanding. 88th over: England 170-8 (Archer 19, Curran 13) Archer drives and thick edges Santner through the slips for four. Possibly not the shot they talked about at tea. Ah, that\u2019s better, a short one from Santner and Archer rocks back and carves through the covers. Huge lbw shout next ball .. they\u2019re reviewing .... the ball straightens, hits Archer on the back pad ... ooof, and that\u2019s umpire\u2019s call. New Zealand lose a review. 87th over: England 162-8 (Archer 11, Curran 13) Southee gives Archer a spoon of his own medicine by digging one into his ribs, Archer flaps at it and it lands riskily on the leg side. Curran then tries to cover drive, and misses, a shot that screams edge to slip. He survives and I munch on the digestives that my husband had tried to hide in the cupboard - better luck next time! 86th over: England 161-8 (Archer 10, Curran 13) Santner has Curran in about three minds as one spits off the pitch, Curran loses it completely and is hit high on the arm . Then a huge lbw appeal - New Zealand review but we don\u2019t even get as far as hot-spot as Santner has sent down a no ball. Ah, now we see that it wouldn\u2019t have been out anyway. On TMS, Agnew notices that Curran has changed his guard to leg-stump . He safely plays out the rest of the over, and that\u2019s TEA. New Zealand have taken 4-63 in that session and take a brew quite the happiest of the two teams. With just Broad left in the dressing room, this flashy pair are England\u2019s final hope. Meanwhile, Gary Naylor is still awake and has Jos Buttler in his sights. 85th over: England 160-8 (Archer 10, Curran 13) Archer down on one knee, driving Wagner where fourth slip might be and down to third man for four- what panache! (LESS OF THE PANACHE PLEASE!) 84th over: England 153-8 (Archer 3, Curran 13). Archer dabs prettily for a couple, then shows a straight bat, before Southee sends a short one through that bounces over both a gently ducking Archer and a leaping Watling. Four byes Ten minutes or so till tea. Simon writes in, continuing a discussion that Daniel was chairing earlier. The best Captain that never was was Shane Warne. Taylor &amp; Waugh owed most of their success to his cricketing nous...and 750 Test wickets...and so did Hampshire and the Rajastan Royals. Playboy, diuretic user, waffly commentator, gambler and average poker player.. yes. Helper of fellow spinners too ! Cricketing genius... Probably. I think you\u2019re right, though I suspect his reign would have been a short one, he\u2019d never have kept his powder dry to do a Waugh-ish stint at the wicket. And I wonder how understanding he\u2019d have been of the journeymen in the team? 83rd over: England 147-8 (Archer 1, Curran 13) Wagner again. Curran decides that the best form of defence is glorious attack. He flicks a straight one down to the long leg boundary before getting down on one knee and pings it through cover for four. This promises to be pretty. 82nd over: England 139-8 (Archer 1, Curran 5) Southee gets the honour of the new ball at the other end, and the over doesn\u2019t have quite the threat that Wagner carried. A succession of outswingers; a maiden. Off the pitch we see a family strolling across the grass, eager to find a picnic spot to watch England\u2019s famous tail-end resistance. Remember, of course, that Leach has already batted. So, is it such an advantage batting first? writes Bill Pennington. This week we have seen three Test matches played more or less simultaneously (AUS v PAK, BAN v IND and NZ v ENG), where the team that lost the toss and batted second has won (or will likely win in the current case) by an innings or more. Quite unusual, I would venture. 81st over: England 139-8 (Archer 1, Curran 5) They keep replaying that shot by Buttler - it\u2019s not a leave for the ages. Oh my, then Archer is hit on the pad, and now Curran has been given out lbw but he reviews immediately and sure enough a fat bat blob beams on hot spot. The end of an eventful over. Should it come to pass, this would only be the third time that New Zealand have beaten England by an innings. And the second new ball claims a victim in its very first delivery. Wagner sends the ball from very wide, Buttler sees, leaves it, plays no shot, and has to stand and watch as the ball swings in and clops the bottom of his off stump. Not one for the scrapbook. 80th over: England 138-7 (Buttler 0, Curran 5) Curran steps back and slides the ball down to the boundary. Abhijato Sensarma, in a hangover from yesterday, sends through a limerick: An escape from this precarious position would have been heavenly But England have only gone on and lost DenlyThe task at hand might seem too much nowBut Buttler is known for his heroics, and howEngland are known as the most Pakistani team after Pakistan for a reasonDon\u2019t give up hope just yet, because in cricket every season\u2019s a miracle season! Thanks Abhijato ! 79th over: England 134-7 (Buttler 0, Curran 1) Wagner\u2019s carrying a cape of venom in this spell. Shortish man, biggish attitude . He bowls a good length and Curran jabs down and ball flies interestingly close at backward short leg-ish. One over to the new ball. 78th over: England 133-7 (Buttler 0, Curran 0) Santner\u2019s the man. His long fingers, long arms, long legs, he sends in a succession of balls full of potential, one of t hem steaming out of the rough to cut across Buttler. A maiden. Unhappy reading for Ollie Pope: 77th over: England 133-7 (Buttler 0, Curran 0) Just like to point out that I have had nothing whatsoever to do with the fall of these wickets. New Zealand are buzzing now, there\u2019s a real zip-a-dee-doo to their gait, Watling behind the stumps can\u2019t stop smiling. So Buttler and Curran enter the waiting room of history - they both could do it... Oh dear. Pope sees a wide full toss and in a moment of madness decides the best shot is to stretch uncomfortably wider and ping the ball to short extra cover where that man Santner grabs a blinder with his diving right hand. 76th over: England 133-6 (Buttler 0, Pope 6) Just a single from the over. 75th over: England 132-6 (Buttler 0, Pope 5) Hello y\u2019all. So I thought I\u2019d just be sweeping up the cobwebs and emptying the bins. Denly so unlucky there, a ball behaving uncharacteristically, and after an innings of great tenacity too.That\u2019s England\u2019s second wicket since lunch and things are all rather crunchy now. Wagner charges, whangs one in, it pings off the pitch and, as it rises, clips the edge of Denly\u2019s gloves as he desperately lifts his hands and tries to get them out of the way. A leaping Watling catches high abover his head. The umpire originally says not out but New Zealand are cock-a-ho0p and, despite Denly\u2019s poker face, the decision is reversed by the third umpire. Aaand that\u2019s us done - Tanya Aldred is here to call England home. 74th over: England 128-5 (Denly 31, Pope 5) Santner gets an over at Pope, whose dressing-room nickname must surely be \u201cOlivia\u201d. After five dangerousosh dots, Pope makes room to cut a long hop through point for four; confidence oozes through him, but he needs to take care because it helped him get himself out in the first innings. That\u2019s drinks. 73rd over: England 124-5 (Denly 31, Pope 1) With Southee\u2019s job done, Wagner returns and Denly shoves his loosener towards point for two. These are the only runs from the over. 72nd over: England 122-5 (Denly 29, Pope 1) Santner goes a little straighter Pope, but I\u2019d be surprised if the overarching plan isn\u2019t to get him driving at wider ones. But, first up, he\u2019s being made to play, and pads up at an arm ball; there\u2019s another geshray, but Watling knows it was bouncing over the top. Maiden. \u201cThis \u2018use the Duke ball everywhere\u2019 stuff?\u201d asks Andy Roberts. \u201cPretty sure that Australia consistently take 20 wickets on Australian wickets with a Kookaburra ball. They just marmalised Pakistan yesterday for your most recent piece of evidence. And while in this century advantages have generally gone to the home team, they just showed that they could adapt to the Duke when required. In the past, their dominance of both cricket balls was even more evident, as your own reminiscing of the 80s and 90s can probably indicate. Anyway, point being, good bowlers can still take plenty of wickets with a Kookaburra ball by bowling accurately, using the bounce, and getting small but significant variations in the air and off the pitch. Perhaps the problem is either a) the pitch they are playing on today, or b) English bowlers generally don\u2019t adapt to a different ball as well as other bowlers do?\u201d It\u2019s not an England thing, and the problem in this Test, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is more the pitch. I don\u2019t mind variations - it\u2019s a beauty of the game - but two sides who can bat, on a flat track and with a Kookaburra ball, is not a good mix. 71st over: England 122-5 (Denly 29, Pope 1) Southee\u2019s second ball tails in and raps the pad - there\u2019s a long, drawn-out geshrey - but that was clearly sliding down. Pope then gets off the mark with a dab to point - there\u2019s just about a run there, but only just about. 70th over: England 121-5 (Denly 29, Pope 0) Denly does Pope a solid, seeing off another maiden from Santner. That\u2019s 14 for him in this innings now. \u201cAnyway, it was a thought that hadn\u2019t occurred to me before,\u201d says Malcolm Parfitt. \u201cBrearley, Close and Illingworth were successful captains *because* they weren\u2019t the best players in any discipline in their team. One less pressure.\u201d I guess Strauss was the last England captain chosen for what we might call \u201cleadership skills\u201d, though there weren\u2019t many options at the time. The thing about picking your best player isn\u2019t just that they\u2019re the most likely to inspire with deed, but they don\u2019t have to worry about being worth their place in the side. Ultimately there\u2019s no formula, but it\u2019s looking increasingly like Root needs to give it up or have it given up for him. 69th over: England 121-5 (Denly 29, Pope 0) So, what is Ollie Pope made of of what is Ollie Pope made? Can he handle this? He starts by seeing away two dots. Is that the crucial blow?! Benjamin Andrew Stokes, what have you done! A wide one keeps lowish and Stokes has a thrash, dragging on! That is very naughty behaviour, and New Zealand are firm favourites now! 69th over: England 121-4 (Denly 29, Stokes 28) Southee persuades one to keep low, which rushes past Stokes\u2019 edge and off stump. 68th over: England 121-4 (Denly 29, Stokes 28) Stokes bunts a single, the only run from the other - though he swipes its final delivery to cover. This extremely impressive from him - he knows he can do anything, which is a nifty piece of psychological scaffolding to own, and also that his dreams will not come to him easily. \u201cMy point was, if the captain had a bad hour/session/day/match,\u201d rejoinders Malcolm Parfitt, \u201cif they\u2019re not the best at what they do (of course they have to be good enough) it doesn\u2019t overwhelmingly affect team morale. That doesn\u2019t work with wicketkeepers.\u201d I get that, but I think about it more the other way around: is the team able to wear losing its best player, as has happened to England with Root and as happened to lesser degree but nonetheless, with Cook. In retrospect, making Broad captain when he turned it in would\u2019ve been smart - and funny - but it\u2019s too late now. 67th over: England 120-4 (Denly 29, Stokes 27) Cricinfo note that Boult will go for an MRI tomorrow - that doesn\u2019t sound much like he\u2019ll play at Hamilton. Back in the middle, two twos to Denly raise the 50 partnership - off 143 balls, noch - and this is good from England. New Zealand need something. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing in the simplistic question \u201cIs x better than y?\u201d is timeframe,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cFrank Tyson might have been a better bowler than Jimmy Anderson - briefly - but he didn\u2019t end up with 575 test wickets. Neither Botham nor Flintoff looked after their bodies as well as they should. You would hope that with Stokes\u2019 fitness ethic his real value to England might be solving the all-rounder problem for many years to come yet. For me this would make him as good if not better than the other two. And he\u2019d probably make a better captain (eventually) than the other two as well.\u201d Yes, of course - context is important. Flintoff was a brilliant fast bowler for quite a while, though - for longer than Stokes has been consistent so far. And Botham took what, 383 Test wickets - more than anyone until Hadlee overtook him - so Stokes doing him on longevity seems unlikely. I think there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d make a good captain, but a better chance they won\u2019t risk finding out - he\u2019s too important to compromise. 66th over: England 116-4 (Denly 25, Stokes 27) After four dots, Denly turns Santner into the on side and they run one. I think we can fairly say that he is now established in the team. 65th over: England 115-4 (Denly 24, Stokes 27) The batsmen take a single apiece from Southee\u2019s first two balls and New Zealand will be starting to wonder. It does seem like they\u2019re relying on errors not jaffas, but as I type that, Stokes leaves on that jags in pretty sharply; I think his stumps were covered. And to make amends, he swipes at the next delivery, edging up and over the slips for four. That wasn\u2019t dissimilar to the shot that got him out in the first innings, but because he committed to it - unlike Root - it wasn\u2019t all that risky. 64th over: England 109-4 (Denly 23, Stokes 22) Denly plays out a maiden from Santner. \u201cWould Morgan have been a better option as Captain even for a couple of years?\u201d asks James Fitzpatrick. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a notion floated on here by his Robness Smyth, and I do see that too. When Morgan was dropped from the Test team it was fair enough, but since then various others have come in without a fraction of his ability - he\u2019s been unfortunate not to get another go. I guess his full focus was desired elsewhere. 63rd over: England 109-4 (Denly 23, Stokes 22) Stokes edges four past slip, the only runs off the over. \u201cI remember when Yorkshire chose their first professional captain,\u201d emails Malcolm Parfitt. \u201cBest batsman was Phil Sharpe, best bowler was Fred. Choice was Brian Close. Nobody out-argued Close. Yorkshire stopped winning the championship when he left. Similarly Mike Brearley was a great captain. Maybe there\u2019s a benefit in captain not being best player, because loss of form is important, but in being a strong enough character to boss diva batsmen and bowlers, but not \u2018the main man\u2019. Broad batting 11 and bowling first change?\u201d I see this angle, though the captain has to be assured of their place in the team and, as I said, leading from the front is more important than funk. Brearley was a one-off and it\u2019s probably a bit late for Broad, much as I appreciate the rationale - realistically, we\u2019re talking about Buttler. 62nd over: England 105-4 (Denly 23, Stokes 18) We see a graphic of the shots Stokes has played, and it\u2019s telling: with one single exception, he\u2019s either been all the way forward or all the way back. He nurdles a single into the on side, then Denly sees out the rest of the over. England look decent out there which means we\u2019re about due a ludicrous and self-indulgent hoik. 61st over: England 104-4 (Denly 23, Stokes 17) Southee takes the ball from the other end but Denly looks solid in defence. I admit I was sceptical when England picked him but what you get when you pick someone slightly older is someone who knows their game. They don\u2019t have anything to work out, they\u2019re either good enough or they\u2019re not. Anyway, he\u2019s sawn in half by one that zips past his outside edge - he\u2019s done well with those today - then turns two to midwicket. 60th over: England 102-4 (Denly 21, Stokes 17) Santner will get us underway again, Stokes facing, and immediately he flips what\u2019s almost a half-volley from off to the midwicket fence. Stokes batted beautifully in the first innings - he looks in such control at the moment you\u2019re surprised when he doesn\u2019t get runs. Someone asked me the other day if I thought he was better than Flintoff, and I was forced to say no - he\u2019s a better batsman, obviously, but at his peak Flintoff was as good as any bowler around. But both had and have the ability to refocus a game so it becomes all about them. Right, off we go again. If England can lose two wickets or fewer this session, they\u2019ve a decent chance of saving this. Well that was a strange kind of session. New Zealand would have wanted more than one wicket, but will still fancy themselves, while England know that if they apply themselves, they can save this. The pressure was not as intense as you\u2019d expect on a day 5 pitch because there\u2019s not much help for the bowlers; they\u2019re relying on batsmen getting themselves out, more than anything. 59th over: England 98-4 (Denly 21, Stokes 13) Williamson brings himself on for what\u2019s probably the final over of the session and Denly clips his first ball to midwicket; they run three. Stokes then turns two to midwicket, and the final delivery of the session is squirted behind square on the off side for a single. 58th over: England 92-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 10) Santner lands one in the footmarks and Stokes half plays, probably inside the line on purpose. And the next ball, i don\u2019t even know - it doesn\u2019t land in the rough but it doesn\u2019t bounce either, scuttling by Watling for four byes. strangely, the last ball, which does land in the footmarks, is also a grubber and it\u2019s not far at all from bowling Stokes around his legs, but he manages to prod it away with his toe-end. That is great news for New Zealand: if there\u2019s an area which can stop the ball from bouncing, England are in all sorts. 57th over: England 88-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 10) Wagner forces one by Denly\u2019s outside edge, who couldn\u2019t help but wave at that; it was right in his slot, so nature took him to it but nurture pulled him back. Another maiden, and England have two, maybe three overs until lunch. 56th over: England 88-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 10) Boult has a side situation and will stay off until lunch. Meanwhile, Stokes sees away another maiden from Santner, but only just - the final delivery, a fuller one, grips and bounces as Stokes plays at its imaginary twin, just avoiding with with handle and gloves. 55th over: England 88-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 10) Eeek! Wagner bangs one in and Denly hangs into it, top-handling to silly point ... but there\u2019s no one there. Then, the final ball kisses his helmet, but it\u2019s a fleeting meeting. Maiden. \u201cYou might find that Hobbs\u2019 captaincy prospects had as much to do with the class system as his tactical acuity,\u201d says Frank Stark. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t \u2018one of us\u2019.\u201d No, agreed. I first learnt about him when Jossy\u2019s Giants did Question of Sport and were asked who was known as \u201cThe Master\u201d. Glenda got it right. 54th over: England 88-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 10) Santner is pressed straight back into duty and Stokes drives his, er, loosener? tightener? to cover for two. I wonder, is it easier to bowl spin if you\u2019re tall or short? I imagine you have better flighting options if you\u2019re short and better darting options if you\u2019re tall. 53rd over: England 86-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 8) Boult appears to have wandered off and the concern is that he\u2019s got a back or side issue; in commentary, they\u2019re feart that he\u2019s not coming back anytime soon because of how slowly he went up the stairs. Back in the middle Denly pushes forward to Wagner and misses with the face, causing himself a momentary coronary as the ball squirts off his inside edge ... but he\u2019s ok. Maiden. Meanwhile, the OBO\u2019s Tim de Lisle graciously sends in a shot of that Stokes shot. 52nd over: England 86-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 8) Boult comes at Stokes from over the wicket and his final delivery gives just a little bit of width, so Stokes cracks it to the cover boundary. He\u2019s in. 51st over: England 82-4 (Denly 18, Stokes 4) Five dots, then Denly twizzles two to midwicket. Boult is warming up, and by the looks of things will take over from Santner, who\u2019s bowled a 20-over spell. \u201cDid Ken Barrington ever captain England?\u201d asks John Beaven. \u201cIf not, there\u2019s your answer.\u201d No, and nor did Jack Hobbs now I come to think about it. 50th over: England 80-4 (Denly 16, Stokes 4) Denly has looked alright this morning, and knows he gave it away first innings when he looked set for a maiden ton, so this is a chance for him because he looks in touch. He takes a single into the off side, then Santner drops short and Stokes rocks back to force him to the cover fence. But have a look! Next up, Stokes defends off the back foot, and watches with horror as the ball megs him then rolls back towards the stumps, missing by a fraction! He peers between his legs to check the damage, but he\u2019s good. 49th over: England 75-4 (Denly 15, Stokes 0) Wagner into the attack and he\u2019s over the wicket to Stokes, who leaves a ball that passes his bails by a whisper. Stokes has now faced 24 balls without scoring, meaning that this is another maiden and we consider once again the trick question of how best to bat in such circumstances. On the one hand, if you don\u2019t play a shot you can get out but on the other, if it\u2019s natural to you to maybe you should, at the same time as putting the bowler under pressure. 48th over: England 75-4 (Denly 15, Stokes 0) Santner is bowling pretty quickly now, to a slip, a gully, a short leg and a silly point. Denly plays out a maiden, and this is intense, affirming stuff. \u201cSo who was the best England batsman who was never the captain?\u201d asks John Starbuck. \u201cAnd can we learn anything from this?\u201d In my time, Marcus Trescothick and Ian Bell. Most batsmen don\u2019t play as well once they\u2019re running ting as well, so it\u2019s a tricky thing. 47th over: England 75-4 (Denly 15, Stokes 0) Denly shoves to leg and they run one, giving Colin five balls at Stokes. He handles them well, and I wonder if it\u2019s time for Boult. 46th over: England 74-4 (Denly 14, Stokes 0) Stokes sees away a maiden from Santner comfortably enough. He batted beautifully in the first innings, and I can\u2019t decide if he was culpable for getting himself out. He was seeing it and the ball was there to hit - there\u2019s a risk with every shot - but if he\u2019d not played it, or played it well, it wouldn\u2019t\u2019 have got him out. 45th over: England 74-4 (Denly 14, Stokes 0) Denly looks to play into the off side and instead finagles four to long leg. But Joe Root - that dismissal was so weird because it was the dismissal of a frazzled man who couldn\u2019t decide whether to leave, defend or attack, even though he\u2019d look in control all morning. Something needs to happen at some point, because good though he is, he should be so much better. \u201cIs anyone mentioning the fact Root now averages less than 31 in his last 21 tests?\u201d tweets Tony Fitzgerlad. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to ruin a great batsman in exchange for a sub-par captain.\u201d I actually wrote about this last summer, so excuse me while I quote myself. \u201cIt is now a full year since Joe Root scored a Test century, which is to say that he has failed so to do in 24 innings against a cross-section of Test-match attacks. In the meantime, England have been thrashed by Australia, beaten by New Zealand, and held to a home draw by Pakistan. Though he has still delivered a consistent diet of 50s, a batsman of his epochal brilliance is obliged to do more. Like Alastair Cook before him, he was appointed captain not because he has a natural feel for the game or its players, but because, even in cricket, the most important element of leadership is consistent excellence of individual performance. So if, like almost every captain before him, the demands of the job are compromising his standards \u2013 it is a long time since he\u2019s looked as uncomfortable at the crease as lately \u2013 then he, Ed Smith as the national selector and Trevor Bayliss as the head coach must have a long, painful talk, because England are nowhere near good enough to do without their best player playing his best.\u201d 44th over: England 70-4 (Denly 9, Stokes 0) Denly glances Santner\u2019s first ball extremely close to short leg - what was he thinking? They run one, and immediately Santner finds the footmarks - Stokes will need a plan to combat that. He sees away five dots, and that\u2019ll be drinks. 43rd over: England 69-4 (Denly 9, Stokes 0) Santner will be chuffed to see the left-handed Stokes at the wicket, and he plays two dots from De Grandhomme to get himself down the other end. \u201cPretty damn sick about the whining re the Kookaburra ball,\u201d says Dave Arthur. \u201cIt requires the bowler to put work on the ball by either hard spinning (not a gentle roll out of the fingers) or the ability to cut the ball at pace (\u00e0 la the great Lillee). Just putting it up there and waiting for the seam to do the work just doesn\u2019t cut it. No one ever said bowling was meant to be easy!\u201d No, agree with that last point, and also that bad spinners can\u2019t blame the ball. But you want the bowlers to be in the game and I\u2019m pretty sure that Ian Austin and Mark Ealham would struggle in the southern hemisphere even with a Dukes. Say it ain\u2019t so Joe! Colin surprises him with a bouncer and all he can do is help it directly to gully, cross-batted. I\u2019m afraid that was classic Root: untroubled, then out. 43rd over: England 69-3 (Denly 9, Root 11) De Grnadhomme cedes a wide, and... 42nd over: England 68-3 (Denly 9, Root 11) Santner gets a go at Denly and brings in a silly point for the bat-pad. Then his second ball nudges an edge, but hasn\u2019t got the legs to reach gully, and his final one is one a really good line, tight on off; Denly does well to get close to it, then let it go by at the last second. Maiden. 41st over: England 68-3 (Denly 9, Root 11) Ah, there we go! Colin brings one in that then rinses away from the bat! Denly did well not to follow that. Then, next ball, he drives airily through the covers but evades the fielders and they run one. \u201cThe Kookaburra is designed to suit the (generally) hard wickets of Australia,\u201d says Ian Loiterton. \u201cI suspect the high seam of the Duke wouldn\u2019t last any time at all in those conditions - but I could be wrong. Either way, bowling with the Kookaburra on flat pitches has its own skill - something England struggled to find on days 3-4.\u201d Yes, I agree - and it was a facility not just of the ball but of the pitch, likewise what we\u2019ve seen so far this morning. 40th over: England 67-3 (Denly 8, Root 11) Santner overpitches so Root comes forward to glide four down to long on, the only runs from the over. There\u2019s not really been the sniff of a wicket which, in mine, isn\u2019t great given a fifth-day track and a team renowned for collapsing right under the pump. \u201cI agree that some other countries should use Dukes,\u201d says Shariq Gilani, \u201cbut a lot of Ttests in England would probably be better with Kookabooras, or another ball which doesn\u2019t move as extravagantly.\u201d Yes, I can see that. I would say that we\u2019ve seen some great series in England in recent summers, but agree the ball has been too dominant at times. I tended to blame it on the application of the batsmen. 39th over: England 63-3 (Denly 8, Root 7) Denly is standing pretty far out of his crease, taking the major cracks - which are close to the crease - out of the game. Denly sees away a fourth consecutive maiden, and this looks a lot like yesterday morning: batsmen not scoring, but comfortable in so doing, though for very different reasons. 38th over: England 63-3 (Denly 8, Root 7) Root is resolved - he looks right up for this, and he plays out yet another maiden from Santner. 37th over: England 63-3 (Denly 8, Root 7) De Grandhomme replaces Southee and galumphs through another maiden. If England aren\u2019t lulled into a sense of false security by his lack of apparent threat, they should be good to see him away. \u201cI recall reading a few articles about the Duke ball over the years,\u201d emails John Starbuck, \u201cbut has anyone investigated the manufacturers of the Kookaburra to find out what pressures are placed on them to develop such an inoffensive (to us) ball? Who gets to decide the supplier anyway?\u201d The home team decides, and I guess Kookabura are satisfying a demand. 36th over: England 63-3 (Denly 8, Root 7) Root is looking good against Santner, playing out another maiden. He\u2019s looking to defend straight, score off the back foot and leave wherever possible. 35th over: England 63-3 (Denly 8, Root 7) Five dots from Southee before Root takes one to midwicket. \u201cWow, cricket is only interesting when England get to use their own ball?\u201d emails Geoff King. \u201cThere I was thinking Test matches all over were doing well at being exciting and getting results. Bur ultimately, we should play in manner that suits England best I guess.\u201d Er, that\u2019s not what I said. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially parochial to say that, in my opinion, cricket is better when the ball is in the ascendancy. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019 s especially controversial to say that days 3 and 4 were not especially enjoyable to watch. you might think something different - my opinion doesn\u2019t have to be your opinion - but it\u2019s possible that we both have valid reasons for thinking as we do. 34th over: England 62-3 (Denly 8, Root 6) Santner probes, with two slips, a leg slip and short leg, and his third delivery does on with the arm ... as Denly leaves it! That was very close to his off stump, which is to say what perfect judgment from the Whitstable wonder. 33rd over: England 62-3 (Denly 8, Root 6) New Zealand will remember that twice in this match, they\u2019ve looked to have had bad sessions with the ball, then turned them into good ones at the end. So they won\u2019t be concerned by a fairly slow start to the day; Southee has ploughed through another largely unthreatening maiden. Root looks settled now. \u201cJust to echo your sentiments about the ball,\u201d says David Seare. \u201cEven if they didn\u2019t have the Duke ball everywhere, they could at least put a seam on that bag of sand everyone else uses. Also, England don\u2019t always prosper in those tricky \u2018concentration needed\u2019 situations so I\u2019m showing terrible bias as well.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s hard to be English and make that point without it sounding partisan. But I didn\u2019t find most of the last two days dull because England took a tanning, I found them dull because they were dull. 32nd over: England 62-3 (Denly 8, Root 6) Santner gives Root just a soup\u00e7on of width and he goes back and across to stroke for four. He seems to have a plan today - back foot where possible to play the ball late and close - and looks comfortable out there. But then he usually does - his problem has been getting in and getting out. There\u2019s one little warning - the fourth ball absolutely rags, and though it ends up at slip, it\u2019ll now be in the batsman\u2019s mind. 31st over: England 57-3 (Denly 8, Root 1) Southee is mainly shaping them away, which is probably how Denly prefers it. He own\u2019t be tempted to drive anything silly, so can just keep em peeled, Shaw Taylor-style, for the in-ducker. Anyroad up, Denly takes one off his pads and then Root gets off the mark in similar fashion. 30th over: England 55-3 (Denly 7, Root 0) Perhaps the pitch is doing something after all - it\u2019s funny how it\u2019s death and reincarnation coincide with England batting on it. Santner, who had such a day out yesterday, has the ball, and already looks more dangerous than did Leach, firing darts in nice and full. Root, though, is watchful, playing mainly off the back foot, and sees a way another maiden. 29th over: England 55-3 (Denly 7, Root 0) Southee begins, and Denly drives his third delivery gently to cover. Otherwise, he\u2019s able to leave well alone ... until a little extra bounce from a nip-backer sees him cut in half and tickled on the ribs. Maiden. Oh yes! A group of England fans are singing Jerusalem, doing actions, prior to applauding themselves! I\u2019m choking up here, and Joe Root has called for a hanky. Right then, here we go! \u201cThat so very English experience,\u201d tweets Guy Hornsby. \u201cGoing to bed without any idea what the score will be when the alarm goes off. Hoping for obduracy and survival, expecting somewhere between capitulation and disappointment, with a brief glimmer of hope on the side.\u201d I\u2019m a big fan of sleep with the earphone in. Especially when Mood Enhancer has been taken, there\u2019s nothing more relaxing, until the score is disbursed. \u201cLike most of your readers I\u2019ve just spent the day writing about the different phenomenological approaches of Levinas and Derrida,\u201d confesses Peter Salmon. \u201cKnocked off to relax with OBO and first link is to Talmudic Hermeneutics. Oy vey! Will I never be free?\u201d Foucault would say no. Talking of which, is there a reason the Dukes isn\u2019t mandatory everywhere ? You still get your local conditions, but you also get a more entertaining game. He thinks that county matches need to be on flatter tracks \u2013 obviously problematic, given it\u2019s shunted to early and late in the season, with the driest time given over to T20. Talking about Jofra Archer, he says that he needs time \u2013 this is his first Test overseas and his first go with the Kookaburra ball. Jos Buttler tells Sky that England have a big job to do, but if they apply themselves they can bat time. He says that if you look to play shots you get into better positions to defend, and blames the batting for the predicament not the bowling. In the studio, they think Wagner will be tough to face, but my money is on Boult. He didn\u2019t bowl well in the first innings, so by law of averages it\u2019s unlikely he won\u2019t be better in the second, he\u2019ll know he\u2019s good enough to be the hero, and he\u2019ll be attacking the stumps. The cracks that were at one end yesterday have grown a little bit, but there\u2019s still nothing to worry the batsmen but the situation. Teams rarely get out of this predicament because pressure tells. If anyone\u2019s ever needed a captain\u2019s knock, it\u2019s Joe Root. As we discussed yesterday, leading from the front is the best attribute any captain can have, but kal vachomer, how much more so, if they\u2019re not great at the other stuff. A flawless 65 won\u2019t do it here - England need tachlis, substance. It\u2019s been almost subcontinental, this Test: slow, slow, quick, slow slow quick and potentially very quick. Except this track, as well as offering nowt to the quicks has offered nowt to the spinners either. Today, though, will be a trip. Those of you who remember the 80s will be exceedingly au fait with what we are about to see, namely England getting whacked in a Test match. And you will also be familiar with the game of Othello, along with its strapline: \u201ca minute to learn, a lifetime to master\u201d. On Thursday and Friday, England reversed this maxim, first proving that they can actually bat properly, then ceasing to bat properly because once you\u2019ve mastered it, what\u2019s the point? The thing is, England really should save this match, given batsmen whose highest level is extremely high and a ball that does almost nothing on a pitch that\u2019s doing absolutely nothing. If they play sensibly, concentrate hard and deny themselves pleasure, they will pull it off. New Zealand do have some handy bowlers, it\u2019s true, but that\u2019s so of England too, and we saw what happened to them. As we all know, sport is like, like life, yeah \u2013 and never has that been more so than it is so today. England are faced, not with a test of skill but a test of will, and as such we will see how they respond when confronted with the single, thorny question that taxes every single one of us on every day of our lives: can I be arsed? Play: 11am local time, 10pm GMT.",

Guardian Australia understands at least 20 medevac cases have not been given \u201cuplift\u201d approval by the Nauru government, which has a documented history of resisting attempts by Australia to take sick people off the island for treatment. Guardian Australia has spoken to a number of people on Nauru who have been approved for transfer by the Australian minister for immigration, and one who was approved for resettlement in the US, but whose cases appear to have stalled.

However, International Health and Medical Services reports note she has reported acute back pain and shows severe mental illness. In August Yosef, who also suffers type two diabetes, was approved for medevac transfer to Australia, accompanied by both his wife and daughter, as he required surgery for a chronic elbow dislocation.

The majority of the package ($496.3m) will be spent on 10,000 home-care packages, with the rest spent on improving medication management to reduce use of chemical restraints ($25.5m), extra dementia training ($10m) and measures to speed up targets to remove younger people from aged care ($4.7m). Scott Morrison told reporters on Monday the measures are an \u201cinitial response\u201d but \u201cthere is more to be done and more will be done\u201d, suggesting if the aged care royal commission proposes major sector-wide reform then \u201cwe\u2019re up for that\u201d. He also noted the government is aware of \u201cspecific cases where the viability questions\u201d arise and aged care providers are at risk of collapse. The aged-care minister, Richard Colbeck, said the current method of funding aged care is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d so the government is trialling a new model to pay providers \u201cmore on the basis of assessing the care needs of the individuals\u201d to deal with the structural change of residents needing more care, imperilling providers\u2019 viability. In October the aged care royal commission delivered an interim report accusing the aged care system of being \u201cunkind and uncaring\u201d, with the waiting list of 120,000 Australians waiting for home-care packages just one measure of \u201ca shocking tale of neglect\u201d. Clearing the waiting list is estimated to cost $2.5bn. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Monday in a joint statement, Morrison, health minister Greg Hunt and Colbeck said the report was \u201cclear \u2026 we can and must do better in providing improved support for our older Australians\u201d. \u201cLike every Australian, we were appalled by the revelations of the interim report, however we will do everything we can to build an aged care system of the highest quality.\u201d The 10,000 extra home-care packages will be strongly weighted towards level 3 and level 4 packages, which provide a high level of care, and will start with 5,500 places rolled out from 1 December. From 1 January, the government will \u201cestablish stronger safeguards and restrictions for the prescribing of repeat prescriptions of [the antipsychotic drug] risperidone\u201d, the ministers said. \u201cThe royal commission directed that restraint must only be used as a last resort, and amendments to regulations will make this clear.\u201d Under the new rules doctors will be required to apply for additional approval to prescribe risperidone beyond an initial 12-week period. The government will provide information for doctors prescribing antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in residential aged care, with \u201ctargeted letters\u201d sent to high prescribers. The interim report recommended the government commit that no more younger people should enter aged care by 2022 and all younger people in care should be out by 2025, subject to limited exemptions. Under new targets to address younger people with disabilities in aged care, the government committed that no people under the age of 65 will enter residential aged care by 2022, none under the age of 45 will live in residential aged care by 2022; and none under the age of 65 will in residential aged care by 2025. The $4.7m program will include establishment of a joint agency taskforce between the departments of health, social services and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and a specialist team in the NDIA to prevent young people with a disability who are eligible for the disability insurance scheme from entering aged care. Labor\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, described the government response as \u201cinadequate\u201d and just a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d of what is required to counter the neglect identified by the interim report. She cited the fact that 16,000 older Australians died in just one year while waiting for home care and many wait more than two years for the care they have been approved for. Labor has pressed the Coalition to increase spending on aged care, warning that for every week that the government delayed action, 300 older Australians die without their home care package. Complaints about aged-care providers have doubled in the past four years, from 3,936 in 2015-16 to 7,828 in 2019. Earlier in November, the government services minister, Stuart Robert, told the National Press Club that between March 2017 and June 2019 the number of younger people in residential aged care had decreased by 11%, from 6,287 to 5,606. Robert said that removing all younger people from aged care \u201crequires a huge number of houses to be built, providers to be identified and to be able to provide the support so lots of things have to work together\u201d.",

In February and March of 2020, the moon will be at its closest distance to Earth \u2013 called a super moon. The eight-hour tour includes meals, and is priced at $160 per adult.</p> <p>If you can\u2019t time your visit with a moon rise, the National Parks and Wildlife Service offers several <a href=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/guided-tours/mungo-walk-the-walls-of-china-tour/learn-more\">guided tours of the Walls of China</a>, including sunset tours, with prices starting from $50 per adult.</p> <p><strong>Where to sleep: </strong><a href=\"https://mungolodge.com.au/\">Mungo Lodge </a>is a comfortable ecolodge and restaurant on the edge of the park, with its own landing strip for those who want to fly straight in. It offers a range of accomodation from deluxe cabins to a budget bunkhouse, caravan and camping sites. Prices start from $45 per person per night for budget accomodation, and from $295 per night for self-contained twin cabins. Inside the main building, which was constructed from local materials in 1992, you can relax in front of the fire or enjoy a meal in the large dining room and bar. The lodge also organises scenic flights and tours.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.visitmungo.com.au/accommodation#main-camp\">The main camp in Mungo national park</a> has 30 spots for caravans, trailers and tents, but you must come prepared with drinking water, cooking water and firewood because it is a remote site with scarce mobile coverage and no power. It costs $8.50 per adult on top of the park entry fees.</p> <p><strong>Nearest hot meal: </strong><a href=\"https://mungolodge.com.au/mungo-bar-and-bistro/\">The Mungo Lodge bar and bistro </a>is open seven days a week for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p> <p>Good pub meals can also be had en route to the national park, at the <a href=\"http://www.crownhotelwentworth.com.au/newsite/\">Crown Hotel, </a>some 130km away in Wentworth. The charming old pub opened in 1861, and the historic photographs on the walls tell some of the story of the town.</p> <p><strong>When to go: </strong>The best time to visit Mungo is during the cooler months as the temperature climbs well over 30C in the summer. The perfect time would be autumn or spring. Mungo Lodge closes over the Christmas period, from the 22 to 27 December.</p> <p><strong>Logistics: </strong>Mungo national park is a 9.5 hour drive from Melbourne, a 13 hour drive from Sydney, or an 8.5 hour drive from Adelaide.</p> <p>The nearest airport, Mildura, is a 90-minute drive from the park on unsealed roads (although your sat nav or maps app will tell you it takes four hours). Mildura has direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Broken Hill, and there are car rental options at the airport.</p> <p>Bring a topographic map and a compass if you\u2019re camping or exploring on foot or bicycle. If self-driving, a four-wheel drive is recommended.</p> <p>Take your best camera for unforgettable landscapes. A quick drive to Mungo lookout is a must as it offers the best views across the lake bed.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Guardian Australia was a guest of <a href=\"https://destinationnsw.com.au/\">Destination NSW</a>. </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been more than 50 years since the ancient dry lake bed of Mungo revealed human remains which corroborated a truth Indigenous Australians already knew. When a geologist found the remains of Mungo Lady in 1968 and then Mungo Man in 1974, the findings showed that people had been living on the continent for more than 40,000 years. If you want to walk in the footsteps of an ancient culture at the very spot where proof of their longevity was found, then Mungo national park is the place to do it. The lake bed is still giving up its mysteries. A walk across the white sand to spot an artefact is the highlight of our trip to the Willandra Lakes region world heritage area in south-west New South Wales. Once a month, you can take a Full Moon tour of Mungo national park to experience the thrill of watching a full moon rising over the Walls of China, a 17km stretch of sand and silt deposited over tens of thousands of years. These layers have been eroded by wind and rain to form a crescent-shaped lunette on the eastern shore of the lake. Once in the restricted area of the lunette, our tour guide points out a midden with scattered shells and animal bones recently uncovered by the shiftings sands. The find indicates the inhabitants had cooked abundant seafood from the once-thriving lake before it dried up some 20,000 years ago. When the lake was full it was a haven for wildlife and vegetation. Megafauna such as the diprotodon, a hippopotamus-sized relative of wombats and koalas, strolled the foreshore. As the lake dried up due to extreme climate change, much of the fauna and flora became extinct. To stand in that vast, eerie landscape at sunset is to gain a tiny window into the ancient history of the continent. The artefacts in this area are unique. They have been exposed not by archaeologists but by erosion, making it one of the best places on Earth to study ancient human life. The area\u2019s three tribal groups, Mutthi Mutthi, Paakantji and Ngyiampaa, have given permission for guided tours of some restricted areas. Our guide advises us to look, not touch, and certainly not to remove anything. Not everyone heeds this warning. In the museum at the Mungo visitor centre, which houses a life-sized model of a diprotodon, there are letters from apologetic travellers who decided to send back the sand, leaves, shells or bones they\u2019d collected. Aside the visitor\u2019s centre sits the Mungo Woolshed, an extraordinary 200-year-old building which documents the region\u2019s pastoral history. The highlight of the visitor\u2019s centre is a collection of human footprints said to be 20,000 years old. They were uncovered in 2003 during a routine survey of archaeological sites and carefully transported to where they now stand, preserved as they were found. They are the oldest footprints ever found in Australia and afford scientists rich clues as to how people lived at the time. Flora and fauna you\u2019ll meet: Red kangaroos, emus, wedge-tailed eagles, pink cockatoos and the stunning green-and-gold mallee ringneck parrot all inhabit the park. The arid landscape is speckled with saltbush, providing nourishment for the animals with its spear-shaped, succulent leaves. Don\u2019t miss: The star of this region is the lunette, or Walls of China. Outback Geo Adventures offer a monthly full moon tour of the area, starting at sunset. In February and March of 2020, the moon will be at its closest distance to Earth \u2013 called a super moon. The eight-hour tour includes meals, and is priced at $160 per adult. If you can\u2019t time your visit with a moon rise, the National Parks and Wildlife Service offers several guided tours of the Walls of China, including sunset tours, with prices starting from $50 per adult. Where to sleep: Mungo Lodge is a comfortable ecolodge and restaurant on the edge of the park, with its own landing strip for those who want to fly straight in. It offers a range of accomodation from deluxe cabins to a budget bunkhouse, caravan and camping sites. Prices start from $45 per person per night for budget accomodation, and from $295 per night for self-contained twin cabins. Inside the main building, which was constructed from local materials in 1992, you can relax in front of the fire or enjoy a meal in the large dining room and bar. The lodge also organises scenic flights and tours. The main camp in Mungo national park has 30 spots for caravans, trailers and tents, but you must come prepared with drinking water, cooking water and firewood because it is a remote site with scarce mobile coverage and no power. It costs $8.50 per adult on top of the park entry fees. Nearest hot meal: The Mungo Lodge bar and bistro is open seven days a week for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good pub meals can also be had en route to the national park, at the Crown Hotel, some 130km away in Wentworth. The charming old pub opened in 1861, and the historic photographs on the walls tell some of the story of the town. When to go: The best time to visit Mungo is during the cooler months as the temperature climbs well over 30C in the summer. The perfect time would be autumn or spring. Mungo Lodge closes over the Christmas period, from the 22 to 27 December. Logistics: Mungo national park is a 9.5 hour drive from Melbourne, a 13 hour drive from Sydney, or an 8.5 hour drive from Adelaide. The nearest airport, Mildura, is a 90-minute drive from the park on unsealed roads (although your sat nav or maps app will tell you it takes four hours). Mildura has direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Broken Hill, and there are car rental options at the airport. Bring a topographic map and a compass if you\u2019re camping or exploring on foot or bicycle. If self-driving, a four-wheel drive is recommended. Take your best camera for unforgettable landscapes. A quick drive to Mungo lookout is a must as it offers the best views across the lake bed. \u2022 Guardian Australia was a guest of Destination NSW.",

      "bodyText": "Women are being ignored in medical trials and reports, according to a report which calls for more Australian medical research to include gender-specific data. Failing to account for the different effects a drug may have on men and women compromises quality of care for women, according to the report published in the Medical Journal of Australia on Monday. \u201cHistorically and consistently across a broad range of health domains, data have been collected from men and generalised to women,\u201d the authors of Sex and Gender in Health Research: Updating Policy to Reflect Evidence wrote. The result is a gender bias in medicine, leading to poorer outcomes for women across illnesses common in both men and women and a lack of knowledge on conditions that mainly affect women. \u201cFailure to appreciate the differences between and across the sex and gender spectrum risks compromising the quality of care and increasing costs due to inappropriate allocation of resources,\u201d the authors write. Co-author and neurologist Dr Cheryl Carcel said the federal government needed to ensure sex and gender differences were included in future research. Clinical trials \u201cquite often\u201d don\u2019t report specific results for males and females, according to Carcel. Drugs which may be effective for both men and women could cause worse side effects in women. Of the 10 prescription drugs taken off the market by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1997 and 2000 due to severe adverse effects, eight caused greater health risks in women. A 2018 study found this was a result of \u201cserious male biases in basic, preclinical and clinical research\u201d.

The study also found the justification that researchers gave for excluding female animals \u2013 that it introduced too much variability in results \u2013 to be \u201cwithout foundation\u201d. Monday\u2019s report by Carcel and Dr Zoe Wainer recommended health bodies, researchers and governments develop guidelines and regulations on the issue. \u201cThis is not simply a women\u2019s or men\u2019s health issue, but an issue for all Australians,\u201d it said. Carcel, a senior fellow at the George Institute for Global Health, said some medical research only tested male genes. She pointed to a HIV treatment drug in the United States that was approved only for men because researchers never tested it on women. In Australia, Carcel said they found women were not getting checked as much as men for cardiovascular disease risks. A report published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 2018 found that women who suffered a serious heart attack were half as likely to be treated properly in an Australian hospital as men and twice as likely to die six months after discharge. The paper also said researchers should get extra funding to ensure sex and gender data was included. In response to increasing knowledge of the gender health gap worldwide, other countries have implemented changes to ensure clinical trials include women, preclinical trials include female rodents and that results are analysed by sex and gender. The implementation of sex and gender analyses should be managed as an ethical issue by university and higher education ethics committees, Carcel and Wainer said, and medical colleges should include evidence-based sex and gender integration in clinical guidelines and funding for research and training. \u201cIn the absence of implementing these, there is a risk that Australia will fail to keep pace with the rest of the world and, in turn, will become increasingly less competitive when applying for funding from international bodies and will reduce international partnership opportunities with overseas organisations,\u201d the paper said. Carcel said funding bodies and medical journals should require the medical researchers deliver data on both men and women. Asked when all of this needs to happen, Carcel simply said \u201cyesterday\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s taken Australia this long to get on board because it\u2019s certainly been happening in other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we are really lagging behind.\u201d The Medical Journal of Australia said a growing number of countries had already begun requiring the integration of sex and gender analyses in journal publications and competitive research grants. All applicants for grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research must answer sex and gender questions in their proposals, and the institutes also provide training modules on sex and gender in biomedical research for scientists and peer reviewers. Australia\u2019s National Health and Medical Research Council and the Diabetes Australia organisation both have policies on collecting, analysing and reporting sex and gender-specific health data, but only the council specifically recommends reporting. Four of the 10 Australian journals interviewed by the researchers did not have such policies. Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

The report criticises the regulatory regime in the UK for allowing schoolchildren to inhale levels of airborne asbestos so much higher than are accepted elsewhere. It argued that the technology used to measure airborne asbestos fibres in the UK is far less accurate than the techniques used in other countries. \u201cA child inhales between five and 10 cubic metres of air per day, meaning the permitted levels of airborne asbestos in the UK can expose a child to 100,000 fibres per day, compared with 10,000 fibres in Germany,\u201d the report said. According to figures from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) released in July, in 2017 there were 2,523 deaths from mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the organs caused almost exclusively by the inhalation of asbestos fibres. It is estimated that a similar number of people die from asbestos-related lung cancers.According to figures from the ONS, since 2001 at least 305 teaching and education professionals have died of mesothelioma. A 2018 study suggested that there were five times more deaths from mesothelioma among teachers and three times more among nurses than expected in populations not exposed to the substance. The thinktank recommends that the UK government bring requirements for the management of asbestos up to the highest international standards, which it says are practiced in Germany, the Netherlands and France. \u201cThe assumption is that the harm caused by asbestos is a historical issue relating to traditionally hazardous occupations and industries,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors. \u201cHowever, this view underestimates the dangers of chronic low-level exposure resulting from working in buildings containing asbestos. Mesothelioma can develop from exposure to only a small concentration of asbestos fibres, making secondary exposure no less a cause for concern.\u201d Between 1920 and 2000, Europe accounted for more than 50% of all asbestos traded throughout the world. The UK imported more asbestos per capita than any other country and has the highest rates of asbestos-related deaths in Europe. The report also argues for the creation of a central register of all asbestosin public buildings across the UK \u2013 which should identify precise location, type and condition \u2013 and calls on the government to commission a cost-benefit analysis of the removal of all asbestos from them. UK regulations state that asbestos should be maintained in situ rather than removed, provided it is in a \u201cgood condition and well protected either by its position or physical protection\u201d. This approach has been criticised by unions for putting people at risk. The director of ResPublica, Phillip Blond, said toxic material being allowed to sit in an increasing state of decay in our schools and hospitals coupled with the death rates among nurses and teachers were \u201ca tragic indictment of the current system of containment and control\u201d. \u201cThe inability of our current health and safety regime to recognise and respond to the true extent of the dangers posed is even more worrying,\u201d he said, adding that a \u201cnational health crisis awaits us and our children if we do not act now.\u201d A HSE spokesperson said there were stringent legal requirements for those responsible for public buildings in Britain to protect against the risks of asbestos. \u201cThere is only a significant risk if any asbestos already within the building fabric is disturbed,\u201d they said. \u201cGreat Britain led the way in 2002 to reduce these risks, when it introduced a new duty on those responsible for non-domestic buildings to locate and manage asbestos materials where it is decided it can be safely left in situ rather than removed.\u201d",
