Meanwhile, emergency services, councils and other bodies worked to protect property, infrastructure and residents. Many towns and villages were braced for further flooding as water ran off already saturated hills and fields along the western half of Britain. Hundreds of homes have been flooded.</p> <p>The Environment Agency in England and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had put in place 106 flood warnings by last night, stretching from north to south and east to west, and a further 239 flood alerts.</p> <p>In Pontypridd, the community had only just started to recover from the last flood. In the Trallwn community centre higher up the valley, volunteers were distributing donated cleaning products, toiletries, food and clothes to families devastated by the floods. Groups of young people in yellow vests dashed out to clean up flood-damaged properties and clear abandoned furniture and kitchens from front gardens.</p> <p>A local Plaid Cymru councillor, Heledd Fychan, who represents one of the worst-affected town-centre wards, said the Red Cross was on standby on Saturday night in case remaining residents such as Linda and Howard Davis had to be evacuated into the centre. \u201cThere was huge anxiety last night,\u201d she said, as volunteers helped residents find buckets and bottles of bleach to disinfect their homes. \u201cMany of the flood defences are broken \u2013 the walls have come down.

It is so astronomical. It is between \u00a370 and \u00a3100 a month for home insurance.\u201d</p> <p>Florence Heritage, 28, and Cosmo Valseca, 48, have no insurance. They live in a rented house close to the river and are staying put for now. \u201cWe stayed here last night. I\u2019m pregnant and I\u2019ve got a four-year-old,\u201d said Heritage. \u201cI was in a massive panic. The whole town was in a massive panic. We were literally a foot away from the river bursting its banks again.\u201d</p> <p>They were also flooded two weeks ago and have only just managed to clean up. They lost almost all their furniture and their oven is broken but, so far, they have received only \u00a3500 from Rhondda Cynon Taf council. \u201cI\u2019ve been scrubbing on my hands and knees to get it looking like this, and I\u2019m 10 weeks pregnant. It would break my back to have to do it again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She was full of praise for Pontypridd. \u201cPeople have been bringing around food parcels and giving away sofas, fridge freezers and TVs. This town is the best thing.\u201d</p> <p>But she was most concerned that the bill now facing the council would lead to further cuts to local services: \u201cThey are begging Westminster for money but we have got Boris Johnson, so that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>In the town centre, the Clwb Y Bont bar and venue, which is owned by a cooperative, was flooded again on Friday night. Geraint Day, 48, the chair of the cooperative, which exists to promote the Welsh language and culture, said it was sad to see the place in such a state. \u201cIt is an integral part of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to raise \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 before we can reopen.\u201d</p> <p>The Met Office said the UK had an average rainfall of 202.1mm last month, beating the February 1990 figure of 193.4mm.</p>",

Meanwhile, emergency services, councils and other bodies worked to protect property, infrastructure and residents. Many towns and villages were braced for further flooding as water ran off already saturated hills and fields along the western half of Britain. Hundreds of homes have been flooded. The Environment Agency in England and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had put in place 106 flood warnings by last night, stretching from north to south and east to west, and a further 239 flood alerts. In Pontypridd, the community had only just started to recover from the last flood. In the Trallwn community centre higher up the valley, volunteers were distributing donated cleaning products, toiletries, food and clothes to families devastated by the floods. Groups of young people in yellow vests dashed out to clean up flood-damaged properties and clear abandoned furniture and kitchens from front gardens. A local Plaid Cymru councillor, Heledd Fychan, who represents one of the worst-affected town-centre wards, said the Red Cross was on standby on Saturday night in case remaining residents such as Linda and Howard Davis had to be evacuated into the centre. \u201cThere was huge anxiety last night,\u201d she said, as volunteers helped residents find buckets and bottles of bleach to disinfect their homes. \u201cMany of the flood defences are broken \u2013 the walls have come down. It could happen again.\u201d Fychan said it was a poor community, with many of the 680 affected families lacking insurance to cover the cost of replacing wrecked belongings. \u201cPeople are being costed out of insurance. It is so astronomical. It is between \u00a370 and \u00a3100 a month for home insurance.\u201d Florence Heritage, 28, and Cosmo Valseca, 48, have no insurance. They live in a rented house close to the river and are staying put for now. \u201cWe stayed here last night. I\u2019m pregnant and I\u2019ve got a four-year-old,\u201d said Heritage. \u201cI was in a massive panic. The whole town was in a massive panic. We were literally a foot away from the river bursting its banks again.\u201d They were also flooded two weeks ago and have only just managed to clean up. They lost almost all their furniture and their oven is broken but, so far, they have received only \u00a3500 from Rhondda Cynon Taf council. \u201cI\u2019ve been scrubbing on my hands and knees to get it looking like this, and I\u2019m 10 weeks pregnant. It would break my back to have to do it again,\u201d she said. She was full of praise for Pontypridd. \u201cPeople have been bringing around food parcels and giving away sofas, fridge freezers and TVs. This town is the best thing.\u201d But she was most concerned that the bill now facing the council would lead to further cuts to local services: \u201cThey are begging Westminster for money but we have got Boris Johnson, so that won\u2019t happen.\u201d In the town centre, the Clwb Y Bont bar and venue, which is owned by a cooperative, was flooded again on Friday night. Geraint Day, 48, the chair of the cooperative, which exists to promote the Welsh language and culture, said it was sad to see the place in such a state. \u201cIt is an integral part of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to raise \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 before we can reopen.\u201d The Met Office said the UK had an average rainfall of 202.1mm last month, beating the February 1990 figure of 193.4mm.",

But we have a history, a massive culture, here with the cup games and to go against that is difficult.\u201d He suggested the effects of an unexpected development such as the coronavirus outbreak, which has caused high-profile postponements in Serie A this weekend, could point up the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s very condensed and if any event happens that is not considered, like for example the coronavirus, then it will be even more complicated.\u201d The tie at Fratton Park will be Arsenal\u2019s 40th game of a season whose demands admittedly look less onerous given their surprise Europa League exit to OlympiakosArteta refused to look upon the very real prospect of a 2020-21 season without European football as a possible blessing in disguise \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s been nonstop but I think this club has to play four competitions every year, that\u2019s the demands\u201d \u2013 and referenced the efforts he has made to lift his players\u2019 spirits after that disappointment. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang cut a particularly devastated figure at full time after missing a last-gasp chance to avert disaster, although his earlier bicycle kick had seemed to salvage the tie. \u201cHe was gutted,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cObviously he scored a wonder goal that [almost] put us through, and with the last kick he had the best chance of the game and he felt very responsible about that. We\u2019ll try to be right behind him. He\u2019s been phenomenal all season for us and now the players have to support him, we have to support him.\u201d",

It is expected that Rutnam will demand a public hearing at which he can outline his case against Patel. Penman added: \u201cThe Home Office now needs to find new leadership at a time when it needs stability. Those who engage in anonymous briefings need to bear the responsibility for this destructive behaviour.\u201d Doubts over the home secretary\u2019s ability to survive come less than three weeks after Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation as chancellor, when he refused to bow to demands from Boris Johnson and the PM\u2019s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, to sack all his advisers. It also emerged recently that a former adviser to Javid, Sonia Khan, is pursuing a case for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination after she was sacked by Cummings and marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer last September. Patel has already resigned once from the cabinet, when in 2017 she had to quit as international development secretary, having failed to be candid about unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, business executives and a senior lobbyist. Lord Kerslake, who was head of the civil service from the end of 2011 until September 2014, said he knew Rutnam well and had been involved in appointing him to his first post as permanent secretary at the Department for Transport in 2012. \u201cFor him to do this means he must have been driven to the limit and beyond,\u201d Kerslake said. \u201cTo resign is serious enough, but then to take legal action is quite extraordinary. I think it will send bad signals through the civil service. It speaks of some very toxic relationships at the heart of government.\u201d Kerslake said he would expect Patel to resign if Rutnam won his case for constructive dismissal. Lord Turnbull, a former cabinet secretary, said such personnel disputes were normally settled quietly behind the scenes. \u201cWhen there is an issue, a way would normally be found to secure a judicious job swap or some other route would be found to resolve the difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this to have got to this stage is extraordinary and potentially extremely damaging for the civil service.\u201d When asked if Johnson retained full confidence in his home secretary, a Downing Street official said: \u201cThe prime minister has complete confidence in all of his cabinet.\u201d Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a member of the home affairs select committee, said Patel\u2019s position was now in doubt \u201cfollowing this chaos\u201d. He added: \u201cThis utterly extraordinary statement by a senior civil servant is clear evidence of just how dangerously dysfunctional relationships are becoming at the heart of this government \u2013 driven by a toxic culture at the very top.\u201d The tensions between Patel and her permanent secretary surfaced last weekend. Reports suggested she had clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and was distrusted by intelligence chiefs. One report suggested Patel had tried to move Rutnam from her department after the rows. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said the row reflected \u201cextremely badly on the government\u201d. She said: \u201cTo end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government. \u201cFor the home secretary and prime minister to have allowed things to reach this point is appalling, especially at a time when the Home Office faces crucial challenges with rising violent crime, forthcoming counter-terror legislation, new immigration laws, and sensitive negotiations on post-Brexit security cooperation.\u201d",

News of the potential \u201cDad\u2019s army\u201d deployment comes as NHS bosses warn that the service will struggle if Covid-19 takes hold in Britain. Yesterday a further three people in England tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 23. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy, while the other had returned from Asia, according to the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. The three cases \u2013 in Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire \u2013 are being investigated, and any individuals who had contact with them are being traced. The update came as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, geared up to launch what the Department of Health described as an \u201cenhanced government approach\u201d to pandemic preparation in a bid to assure the public that it had a grip on the situation. The plans will a designated ministerial virus lead for every government department, a cross-government \u201cwar room\u201d of communications experts and scientists ahead of a new public information campaign and an increase in the number of Cobra emergency meetings. Currently the UK is in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase, where isolated cases are hospitalised and detailed tracing of those they have come into contact with is carried out. However, if the virus begins to spread the Department of Health said the next phase could see broader measures to keep the public safe and relieve pressure on the NHS. These could include the emergency registration of retired health professionals, the introduction of emergency indemnity coverage for healthcare workers providing care or diagnostic services and a relaxation of rules around staff-to-pupil ratios in schools and nurseries. The government is also considering encouraging more home working and discouraging unnecessary travel as part of a \u201csocial distancing\u201d strategy that it says would delay the peak of the outbreak until later in the year, when warmer weather could help in combating the virus.

Many observers counselled caution and pointed to a difficult road ahead. Most pointed out that the deal leaves peace in Afghanistan to be negotiated between the Taliban and an Afghan government the militants have always denounced as a puppet. Many voiced concerns about safeguarding human rights advances, particularly concerning the lives of Afghan women, made since the US invasion in 2001 which also denied al-Qaida terrorists their base for the 9/11 attacks.

Last August, one of Rutnam\u2019s most senior colleagues, Mark Thomson, the director general of UK Visas and Immigration, announced that he was leaving. He told the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) that Patel was \u201ccoming in and doing things we weren\u2019t comfortable with\u201d. The Home Office claims that Thomson had decided to resign before Patel arrived, but has not provided evidence for this.</p> <p>By late October, Thomson had met with union officials and discussed a \u201cbreakdown\u201d in relationships between Patel and senior civil servants. Tensions continued to rise. As the general election was announced, Patel wanted to appoint a new Home Office team, one that appreciated her hardline outlook on issues such as immigration. Members of her team now admit, with hindsight, that \u201cperhaps we could have gone a bit slower\u201d.</p> <p>As it was, Andy Tighe, who had been at the Home Office since 2011, and was communications director from 2017, felt he had become a target. The former BBC journalist, who was highly regarded by journalists in the parliamentary lobby, was considered by Patel\u2019s team to have become \u201ctoo hands-off\u201d. Patel reportedly tried to sack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/27/priti-patel-tried-to-have-home-office-official-sacked-on-christmas-eve\" title=\"\">Tighe on Christmas Eve</a>. Rutnam was aghast, and though Tighe tried to hold on, he left in February.</p> <p>\u201cThere was nothing personal against Andy, though I think it was taken like that, which I understand,\u201d said a Whitehall source.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just the kind of person a minister needs in a department like the Home Office</p> <footer> <cite>Lord Kerslake on Rutnam</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Others have said that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s closest aide, who has promised to reform the entire Whitehall machine \u2013 which he says acts as a break on radicalism \u2013 further emboldened Patel to take on Rutnam following the election.</p> <p>\u201cIn focus groups, they say it\u2019s good that the civil service is working hard, and that is what Dom Cummings basically says,\u201d said an advocate of Patel. Cummings is currently under pressure to give evidence under oath to an unfair dismissal employment tribunal involving the former Treasury aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/sajid-javid-was-not-told-in-advance-of-advisers-sacking-by-cummings\" title=\"\">Sonia Khan, who was sacked and marched out of Downing Street by an armed policeman</a>.</p> <p>The new year brought little respite for Rutnam and his colleagues. In early February, another \u201cheated\u201d meeting with Patel and senior immigration officials over a deportation court case to Jamaica saw a high-ranking civil servant collapse after working overnight. The incident is said to have left officials in despair.</p> <p>Briefings against Patel became more pointed. One report suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/mi5-rejects-claims-withhold-intelligence-priti-patel\" title=\"\">MI5 did not trust</a> the home secretary, though MI5 has disputed this. Patel\u2019s supporters fought back, launching what Rutnam dubbed a \u201cvicious and orchestrated\u201d campaign against him.</p> <p>Any semblance of protocol has been abandoned. Usually such clashes are managed quietly behind the scenes until the civil servant is discreetly ushered into a new role. Sources pointed to the case of Helen Ghosh, who, as permanent secretary at the Home Office, reportedly clashed with May, the then home secretary. The situation was neatly resolved when Ghosh stepped down in November 2012 to become director general of the National Trust.</p> <p>The former cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull, who was head of the civil service and cabinet secretary between 2002 and 2005, said he had never heard of a dispute involving a secretary of state and permanent secretary being allowed to intensify in a way that held such potentially serious consequences for the civil service.</p> <p>\u201cNormally when there is an issue, a way would be found to secure a judicious job swap or some other route to resolve the difficulty. For this to have got to this stage is extraordinary and potentially extremely damaging,\u201d said Turnbull.</p> <p>Rutnam, too, could have bided his time and held on for a new position. Or he could have resigned and gone quietly with financial compensation. It appears he had seen too much. His unprecedented salvo yesterday was clearly designed to topple Patel. For those Home Office civil servants left behind, some of whom yesterday praised Rutnam\u2019s \u201ccourage and integrity\u201d, the issue is not if a successor to Patel is announced \u2013 but when. </p>",

The incident is said to have left officials in despair. Briefings against Patel became more pointed. One report suggested that MI5 did not trust the home secretary, though MI5 has disputed this. Patel\u2019s supporters fought back, launching what Rutnam dubbed a \u201cvicious and orchestrated\u201d campaign against him. Any semblance of protocol has been abandoned. Usually such clashes are managed quietly behind the scenes until the civil servant is discreetly ushered into a new role. Sources pointed to the case of Helen Ghosh, who, as permanent secretary at the Home Office, reportedly clashed with May, the then home secretary. The situation was neatly resolved when Ghosh stepped down in November 2012 to become director general of the National Trust. The former cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull, who was head of the civil service and cabinet secretary between 2002 and 2005, said he had never heard of a dispute involving a secretary of state and permanent secretary being allowed to intensify in a way that held such potentially serious consequences for the civil service. \u201cNormally when there is an issue, a way would be found to secure a judicious job swap or some other route to resolve the difficulty. For this to have got to this stage is extraordinary and potentially extremely damaging,\u201d said Turnbull. Rutnam, too, could have bided his time and held on for a new position. Or he could have resigned and gone quietly with financial compensation. It appears he had seen too much. His unprecedented salvo yesterday was clearly designed to topple Patel. For those Home Office civil servants left behind, some of whom yesterday praised Rutnam\u2019s \u201ccourage and integrity\u201d, the issue is not if a successor to Patel is announced \u2013 but when.",

Our first game against India was not the way we wanted to start our campaign and we were all very aware that our tournament was riding on that next game. But I don\u2019t think pressure is always a bad thing.</p> <p>We know, for instance that getting the world record crowd that everyone is talking about at the MCG next Sunday really depends on us being there. We can\u2019t hide from that. But crowd or no crowd, we\u2019re already putting that pressure on ourselves to be in the final, because that\u2019s why we\u2019re playing in this World Cup. We have high expectations of ourselves \u2013 if we don\u2019t go into a tournament expecting to win, why are we even playing?</p> <p>I don\u2019t mind admitting that there were some nerves in the first game. But when we walked off after India\u2019s innings, I know I felt really confident. I wasn\u2019t happy with my own performance, but as a team I felt we bowled well and I knew our batters had the ability to chase that score down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/27/australia-ease-to-86-run-win-over-bangladesh-at-women-t20-world-cup\">Australia ease to big win over Bangladesh at Women's T20 World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The nerves started to ramp up as more wickets fell. We\u2019d been in that situation in the past and our middle order has been able to dig us out of trouble, but this time we just weren\u2019t adjusting to Poonam Yadav.</p> <p>I think it was a really smart move by India not using her in the tri-series We should have been ready for her, she\u2019s caused us trouble in the past and our batters tried to prepare in the nets, but nothing really replicates that dip and the height she comes from. They didn\u2019t give us a good look at her before the World Cup and that worked for them.</p> <p>And then we came up against Sri Lanka and we still weren\u2019t playing the free cricket that I know we\u2019re capable of. The pressure was on and we weren\u2019t responding to it in the best way. One of our team tag lines is \u2018fearless\u2019 and we didn\u2019t play fearless cricket in that game. The fear of losing got to us and we couldn\u2019t put together a convincing win.</p> <p>But the fact that we came from a position where we were three down with only 21 runs from the powerplay and we were able to grind out a win, that was something we were really proud of. We knew we didn\u2019t play our best and when the game ended, we were feeling relief more than anything that we\u2019d kept our tournament alive.

      "bodyText": "Pressure is a funny thing. I\u2019d be lying if I said we weren\u2019t feeling the pressure going into our second match of the World Cup against Sri Lanka. Our first game against India was not the way we wanted to start our campaign and we were all very aware that our tournament was riding on that next game. But I don\u2019t think pressure is always a bad thing. We know, for instance that getting the world record crowd that everyone is talking about at the MCG next Sunday really depends on us being there. We can\u2019t hide from that. But crowd or no crowd, we\u2019re already putting that pressure on ourselves to be in the final, because that\u2019s why we\u2019re playing in this World Cup. We have high expectations of ourselves \u2013 if we don\u2019t go into a tournament expecting to win, why are we even playing? I don\u2019t mind admitting that there were some nerves in the first game. But when we walked off after India\u2019s innings, I know I felt really confident. I wasn\u2019t happy with my own performance, but as a team I felt we bowled well and I knew our batters had the ability to chase that score down. The nerves started to ramp up as more wickets fell. We\u2019d been in that situation in the past and our middle order has been able to dig us out of trouble, but this time we just weren\u2019t adjusting to Poonam Yadav. I think it was a really smart move by India not using her in the tri-series We should have been ready for her, she\u2019s caused us trouble in the past and our batters tried to prepare in the nets, but nothing really replicates that dip and the height she comes from. They didn\u2019t give us a good look at her before the World Cup and that worked for them. And then we came up against Sri Lanka and we still weren\u2019t playing the free cricket that I know we\u2019re capable of. The pressure was on and we weren\u2019t responding to it in the best way. One of our team tag lines is \u2018fearless\u2019 and we didn\u2019t play fearless cricket in that game. The fear of losing got to us and we couldn\u2019t put together a convincing win. But the fact that we came from a position where we were three down with only 21 runs from the powerplay and we were able to grind out a win, that was something we were really proud of. We knew we didn\u2019t play our best and when the game ended, we were feeling relief more than anything that we\u2019d kept our tournament alive. But once we had time to process, we were happy with the result and the way we\u2019d responded to the pressure and turned the game around. That happiness within the camp has fuelled us. It was no coincidence that our top order fired against Bangladesh in Canberra. The whole mood of the squad has lifted and we were all feeling really happy that day. It helps that we had never played Bangladesh before. We didn\u2019t know what to expect and we liked that. As a bowler I have plans for how I\u2019m going to bowl to teams like New Zealand and England that we come up against all the time. But playing Bangladesh was going into the unknown and it made it really fresh and exciting. I think it re-energised all of us. That said, our next challenge is New Zealand \u2013 our old foe from over the ditch. I\u2019m not sure about anyone else in the team, but I\u2019m approaching it like a quarter final.

One of them lost a family member because of the virus. Their arrival prompted fears among local residents in the midst of the rapidly spreading outbreak. They had to be repeatedly tested before concerns about their condition abated.</em></p> <p><em>It hasn\u2019t been easy for the nearly 50 members of the Wuhan Zall team, but on Sunday they will get some reprieve from their ordeal by attending the Spanish league cl\u00e1sico between Real Madrid and Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. The team will also tour the famed venue in Madrid on Monday.</em></p> <p><em>Its really a well-deserved reward for them, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, the team\u2019s Spanish coach, told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. It will be an experience that without a doubt they will never forget. They have been training and training day after day, distracted by the situation back home, so it will be a nice break for them to watch a game like this between Real Madrid and Barcelona.</em></p> <p><em>The team will be at the Bernab\u00e9u on an invitation from Real Madrid and La Liga, which has a partnership with the Chinese Super League, the country\u2019s main soccer competition. The league has been suspended because of the coronavirus and is not expected to resume until mid-April. Wuhan Zall was originally scheduled to stay in its preseason base in southern Spain until mid-February, just before the leagues planned start. Now it is expected to remain in the country at least until the end of March.</em></p> <p><em>Other Chinese clubs are in a similar situation in countries like Thailand, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, though Wuhan Zall is actually based in the city at the centre of the outbreak that has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide, most of them in China.</em></p> <p><em>Wuhan Zall arrived in Spain at the end of January but previously practiced in the Chinese city of Guanghzou, nearly 1,000 621 miles away from Wuhan. Although the team was far from the initial outbreak, Spanish health authorities had to come out publicly to say there was no reason for local citizens to be concerned about the squads arrival. Three players arrived from China later and had to stay in quarantine and be tested for the virus before joining the rest of the group.</em></p> <p><em>The fear of the unknown obviously always exists, Gonz\u00e1lez said. I understood those who were reticent about the team coming to Spain. But with time it became clear that there was no problem with the team being here.</em></p> <p><em>Gonz\u00e1lez, a former striker who had played in China, said his focus has been to take the players minds away from the situation at home.

Even if China\u2018s factory production can recover in March, it will still face the risk of a low level of export orders. This is because the supply chain will continue to be broken, this time in South Korea, Japan, Europe, and the US, where Covid-19 has begun to spread.\u201d</p> <p>Unofficial reports show that factories outside Hubei province, where the virus started, could be working at no more than 75% of their capacity and many nearer 25% to 50% while millions of workers remain trapped in their home province, unable to travel back to their place of work.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T14:02:02.109Z\">at 2.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5a5e508f08e1332474c978\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T12:58:31.500Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Qatari national who is the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in the Gulf state is a 36 year-old who returned recently from Iran and is in a stable condition, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.</p> <p>The UAE education ministry also announced the suspension of nursery school classes, as the regional business hub and major transit point for air travellers stepped up its contingency plans.

He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re still in the containment phase of this disease. We have been pretty good at containing it thus far. And the chief medical officer has been very clear that there is no reason to think that we shouldn\u2019t be able to continue containing it, so that\u2019s what our focus is on.</p> </blockquote> <p>England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has spoken publicly about the possibility of ramping up measures to protect the public. But Agar said there was no reason to curtail mass events. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Whitty] said decisions on large events and whether they should go ahead will be taken at the time on the basis of the evidence. He\u2019s not saying there is a need for that now. </p> <p>Similarly, with school closures. He\u2019s been clear there is no reason or need for schools en masse to close. If there are particular incidents, Public Health England and local teams will give advice. </p> <p>So what Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has been saying is, these are all things that, in responsible contingency planning for the future, we will be looking at. </p> <p>But we are clear that these are not needed at the moment and that we believe, as he said, that we will not need to move to that phase on the base of where we are at the moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Argar refused to comment on reports that the first person to contract coronavirus in the UK also passed it on to their doctor. The Guardian has been told there are fears that a doctor from the patient\u2019s surgery may also have been infected with the virus. If confirmed, this would prompt particular concern as the GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m aware of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/fears-that-surrey-gp-is-uks-latest-coronavirus-victim\">the Guardian report</a>, but I\u2019m going on the basis of what I\u2019ve been told.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had any details of that and I think it would be wrong to comment on speculation in the press without that detailed advice from the chief medical officer. </p> <p>I have not been briefed on anything beyond the detail that the chief medical officer and others have given me about this individual case. </p> <p>It is a new development but the chief medical officer has also said we are still doing the contact tracing around that and we are still looking into the details of that case, so it is probably a bit premature to say more than that at the moment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T11:45:11.583Z\">at 11.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5a22108f086a28115b4edf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T08:42:42.334Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">South Korea reports another 219 new infections</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>South Korea has reported 219 new coronavirus cases, bringing the country\u2019s total infections to 3,150, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports. <br></p> <p> The new cases are in addition to the 594 confirmed earlier in the day.

      "bodyText": "With the Trump press conference over, we\u2019ll wrap up this blog for the day. In summary, in terms of coronavirus news in the US: The first US coronavirus death has been reported in Washington state. There has been some confusion over the gender of the person who died. Donald Trump has rejected criticism for his remarks at a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, in which he referred to the coronavirus outbreak as a hoax. In the White House briefing room, the president told reporters he had been referring to Democratic criticism of his administration\u2019s response, not to the virus itself. Mike Pence has rejected, or at least skirted, criticism of his appointment to oversee the federal response to the outbreak given his record in office as governor of Indiana, where there was a major HIV outbreak in 2015 which critics said was affected by the conservative Christian\u2019s ideological approach to science-based policy and events. Also, Pence has detailed new US moves: Additional travel restrictions on Iran An increase to the highest level for the advisory that Americans should not travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea State department co-ordinated screening in those countries of individuals coming to America 30m face masks a week being added to US stocks. We\u2019ll report more as the day goes on, of course. In the meantime, here\u2019s a selection of further Guardian reading: \u2026and with questions from a Russian-sounding reporter about possible arms control talks to come and another on the Afghanistan deal, Trump says \u201cwe\u2019ll be doing this quite often\u201d \u2013 meaning answering questions in the White House briefing room which no longer hosts White House press briefings \u2013 \u201cto keep you abreast of the facts\u201d. The markets are \u201cnot a good situation\u201d, Trump says, but \u201cthe markets will take care of themselves\u201d in a strong economy. He skips a question about reports he might consider tax cuts to ease the coronavirus-related pain but says there will be a \u201cvery major middle income tax cut\u201d proposal soon. Trump is now asked about the economic impact on the US by the coronavirus outbreak and what the Federal Reserve might do as the markets plunge. The Fed has an important psychological role to play, Trump says, and says it should have acted more strongly sooner. He wants lower interest rates. And the Fed should be a \u201cleader not a follower\u201d. \u201cOur Fed has not been a leader at all,\u201d he repeats. Now on to the mentioned meeting with pharmaceutical companies on Monday to discuss a vaccine, although the meeting was set up previously to discuss drug prices. An aide says the development of said medicines can be expedited. Here\u2019s a question about Mike Pence and the 2015 HIV outbreak in Indiana, and how that pertains to the VP\u2019s role in running the coronavirus response. \u201cWhen it came to healthcare Indiana has been a leader,\u201d Trump says, claiming it was started \u201cwith others\u201d by Pence. Pence says Indiana had two experiences with the spread of infectious diseases. He mentions MERS in 2014 and says he then learned of the extraordinary capabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and dealt with the issue effectively. In 2015, he says, the outbreak of HIV was in a \u201cvery small town\u201d and he \u201cimmediately deployed health resources\u201d. The state of Indiana did not allow for needle exchanges, he says, but he declared an emergency and made a needle exchange avaialable, treating the patients and ending the outbreak. Here\u2019s some Guardian coverage of that outbreak, for further reading: Trump says he has been in very close contact with China and President Xi Jinping over the outbreak and again cites US companies re-opening there as proof of Chinese progress: Starbucks and Apple. A health official says there is no evidence of link to travel or contact in the woman who died in Washington state. A question about why Trump would consider closing the border with Mexico, which seems to have little to do with the coronavirus outbreak. Trump says he is not considering closing ports of entry, but is thinking about \u201call borders\u201d in general. \u201cThis too will end,\u201d says Trump about the outbreak. Is the White House taking precautions regarding the president\u2019s travels? Trump thinks so, referring to his \u201ctremendous rally\u201d in South Carolina and all the other travel he does. Dr Fauci now answers a question about the dangers or not to people who get coronavirus, and repeats that the elderly and those with chronic health conditions are most likely to die. Every once in a while there will be a one-off, he says, when a healthy 25-year-old will get ill. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna happen, that happens with influenza,\u201d he says. It also seems that being infected and recovering means one cannot get the virus again. Now a question about the Afghanistan deal and the nomination of John Ratcliffe for director of national intelligence, which is controversial. Now to questions: Trump is asked about his remarks in Charleston about the outbreak being a hoax. \u201cHoax referred to the action they [Democrats] tried to take to try to pin this on somebody,\u201d he says, \u201ccertainly not\u201d to the coronavirus. Was Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 standing next to president \u2013 ever muzzled? \u201cThat\u2019s a very dishonest question,\u201d says Trump, adding: \u201cHe was never muzzled.\u201d Fauci doesn\u2019t seem keen to speak but he clarifies that \u201chas never been muzzled ever\u201d. He says he merely stood down on some media appearances to clarify what he should be doing and when. Will the southern border be closed? Trump says it\u2019s being looked at \u2013 the new cases overnight were reported at the other end of the country, in the north west. Should Americans change their daily routine? Trump and officials say no. A South Korean question about US troops there: \u201cWe care very much for the troops,\u201d Trump says. It\u2019s all working out fine, he says. Back to the word \u201choax\u201d. Could it make people think he is saying the virus was a hoax even if he wasn\u2019t? He says no, then spins to talking about how well his administration has performed on coronavirus so far. Alex Azar is also expressing sympathy for the family of the Washington state patient who died, referring to her as a woman. He repeats official guidance about the risks from coronavirus and says the government wants to follow a \u201cbasic containment strategy\u201d in terms of travel. Next, Dr Anthony Fauci who does not refer to the gender of the person who died. And in fact, Governor Inslee\u2019s statement has been changed to remove reference to the gender of the person who died too. Pence is up now. He expresses condolences to the family of the \u201cwoman in Washington state who has lost her life to the coronavirus\u201d. Here\u2019s Governor Inslee\u2019s statement saying the person who died was a man: Pence commends Trump for his guidance of course and then announces: Additional travel restrictions on Iran An increase to the highest level for the advisory that Americans should not travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea The state department will co-ordinate screening in those countries of individuals coming to America Pence then commends the members of his task force for their work and says he has spoken to congressional leaders about a supplementary funding bill for federal agencies and for state and local authorities. \u201cThe average American does not need to go out and buy a mask,\u201d Pence says. But 3M will produce 30m more masks a month nonetheless and availability will be increased. Risks remain low, Pence says, but Trump\u2019s actions \u201cgive evidence to the fact that at his direction we\u2019re going to continue to lead in this effort\u201d. Trump says his administration has taken \u201cthe most aggressive action in modern history to confront this disease\u201d and says moving quickly has put the US ahead of the game. China seems to be making tremendous progress, he says, and \u201ctheir numbers are way down\u201d. Trump is repeating his \u201cmost aggressive\u201d claim for the US response, in comparison to all other countries. On Monday, he says, he\u2019ll be meeting pharmaceutical companies to discuss a developing a vaccine \u201cvery rapidly\u201d. \u201cTremendous amounts of supplies are already on hand,\u201d he says \u2013 there have been problems with federal testing kits. Pence led a task force meeting this morning, Trump says, and they came up with some \u201cpretty strict edicts\u201d. \u201cOur country is prepared for any circumstance, we hope it\u2019s not going to be a major circumstance,\u201d he says, asking the media and politicians not to do \u201canything to incite panic at all\u201d. Here\u2019s what Trump said at a rally last night: Trump is addressing the press flanked by Mike Pence, the vice-president he put in charge of coronavirus response efforts to not-universal acclaim, and federal health officials. It\u2019s a long preamble on Afghanistan, in which Trump said he would personally meet Taliban leaders soon and said the US could yet go back in \u201cwith a force like nobody\u2019s ever seen\u201d. So much for that. The coronavirus outbreak is very important to many people, Trump says, paying tribute to the officials with him and others in a more than usually husky voice. A lot of progress has been made, he says, and he will update us here. Remember, the first US death was confirmed just before he came out. There are 22 patients in the US \u2013 the president says one person died overnight and it was a woman in her late 50s. Washington state governor Jay Inslee just announced it was a man. Trump begins by congratulating the \u201cincredible people\u201d who have worked so long on \u201cour longest war\u201d in Afghanistan for what he says is 20 years. It\u2019s actually a little more than 18 since the invasion in 2001 but regardless an agreement was signed in Doha this morning with the Taliban, committing the US to troop withdrawals if the Taliban keeps the peace. We\u2019ll concentrate on the coronavirus news here of course, so here\u2019s our report on the Afghanistan deal: Here in the US the first coronavirus death has been confirmed, in Washington state out on the west coast. I\u2019m in New York City but the president is at the White House in Washington DC and he is about to give a news conference. We\u2019ll blog it live. Here he comes. US confirms first death from the coronavirus in King county in Washington state. Reuters reports that the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Italy has climbed above 1,000, according to an official who said the number of deaths had surged to 29. This is from the Associated Press. Its been a tough journey for the first-division soccer club from Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the virus outbreak in China.The team came to Spain for preseason training and doesn\u2019t know when it will be able to return home. Players haven\u2019t seen their relatives in more than two months. One of them lost a family member because of the virus. Their arrival prompted fears among local residents in the midst of the rapidly spreading outbreak. They had to be repeatedly tested before concerns about their condition abated. It hasn\u2019t been easy for the nearly 50 members of the Wuhan Zall team, but on Sunday they will get some reprieve from their ordeal by attending the Spanish league cl\u00e1sico between Real Madrid and Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. The team will also tour the famed venue in Madrid on Monday. Its really a well-deserved reward for them, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, the team\u2019s Spanish coach, told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. It will be an experience that without a doubt they will never forget. They have been training and training day after day, distracted by the situation back home, so it will be a nice break for them to watch a game like this between Real Madrid and Barcelona. The team will be at the Bernab\u00e9u on an invitation from Real Madrid and La Liga, which has a partnership with the Chinese Super League, the country\u2019s main soccer competition. The league has been suspended because of the coronavirus and is not expected to resume until mid-April. Wuhan Zall was originally scheduled to stay in its preseason base in southern Spain until mid-February, just before the leagues planned start. Now it is expected to remain in the country at least until the end of March. Other Chinese clubs are in a similar situation in countries like Thailand, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, though Wuhan Zall is actually based in the city at the centre of the outbreak that has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide, most of them in China. Wuhan Zall arrived in Spain at the end of January but previously practiced in the Chinese city of Guanghzou, nearly 1,000 621 miles away from Wuhan. Although the team was far from the initial outbreak, Spanish health authorities had to come out publicly to say there was no reason for local citizens to be concerned about the squads arrival. Three players arrived from China later and had to stay in quarantine and be tested for the virus before joining the rest of the group. The fear of the unknown obviously always exists, Gonz\u00e1lez said. I understood those who were reticent about the team coming to Spain. But with time it became clear that there was no problem with the team being here. Gonz\u00e1lez, a former striker who had played in China, said his focus has been to take the players minds away from the situation at home. Going to the cl\u00e1sico was one way of doing that, as was the decision to give them 10 days of vacation while in Spain. I honestly try to talk about the subject (virus) as little as possible, he said. Because they are already talking about it all the time, in their rooms, with their relatives back home. I dont want to talk about it as well every time I see them. I try to make training as fun as possible so I can see them smiling a bit. Iraq has detected five new cases of the coronavirus, four in Baghdad and one in the central Babel province, the country\u2019s health ministry has announced, taking the total number of cases in the country to 13. The patients were placed in quarantine, days after Iraq banned public gatherings and barred entry by travellers from Kuwait and Bahrain. It has now prohibited travel to or from a total of nine countries. Iraq has cultural and religious ties with Iran and annually receives millions of Iranian pilgrims. An Iraqi family of four, the first known Iraqis to have caught the disease, who returned from Iran tested positive for the coronavirus in Kirkuk province on Tuesday. However, it was not immediately clear if the five new cases announced on Saturday were people who had recently been in Iran. The Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland has said the region\u2019s first case of coronavirus, which was announced on Thursday, has now been confirmed by laboratory tests. The case was initially announced as a \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d on the basis of tests carried out in Northern Ireland. A sample was then sent to a Public Health England reference laboratory for confirmation. Ruth Hutchinson, interim director of public health for Surrey County Council, said the council remains in \u201ccontinuous contact\u201d with Public Health England (PHE) after a confirmed case in the county on Friday. Hutchinson said in a statement: PHE updated me on their work and steps they have taken since the case was confirmed. They are already urgently contacting anyone that has been in close contact with the individual to provide them with advice about what to do if they start feel unwell and how to manage if they are told to self-isolate. I appreciate that news like this can be a cause for concern, so I would reassure everyone that Surrey County Council, together with the NHS and PHE, is taking every necessary measure to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading. In the few minutes since I last posted, I have already had a number of emails from readers about the essentials they are stocking up their cupboards with in the event that the coronavirus outbreak leads to a major public health crisis in the UK. Many of those who have written have said they are getting in provisions because they live alone and so if they have to self-isolate they will not be able to send anyone else out to the shops in their behalf. Others have pre-existing health issues and so they are preparing for the potential of extended periods away from human contact, in order to avoid contracting Covid-19. One reader writes: As someone who works in local govt, the emergency preparedness plans being put in place and resilience forum talk terrify me, as well as having friends in the NHS that know full well they wouldn\u2019t cope ... So my purchasing is for - Disinfectants and alcohol gels/isopropyl alcohol, as well as bleaches etc. This is to quickly apply to hands or pieces of clothing or masks to disinfect. Most pharmacy shops are sold out and have notices up so I went to a DIY shop. Medications as I have [an autoimmune disease], and most of the precursors for my drugs are made in China. I\u2019ve been told there was a long delay for some of the drugs I need, especially liquid nutrition drinks which replace my solid food intake. Some food that is non perishable and doesn\u2019t need gas/water/electricity to be eaten as, if the documents I\u2019ve seen (similar to the leaked ones on the news a few days ago) are true, infrastructure will be patchy. This is more for neighbours and family as nobody is brave enough to say \u201cOK, this is serious\u201d and act on it. The same correspondent, who preferred to go unidentified, does later admit to having been \u201ca quasi prepper for some years. \u201cFeels like my stuff may be put to use, unfortunately.\u201d Other readers are simply bolstering existing stockpiles that they had already built up amid fears of chaos caused by a hard Brexit. Writes one: I don\u2019t think you could call it panic buying. I did augment my hard Brexit stocks in January when the first reports came from China. Now it\u2019s just a case of stock control and eating according to expiry date if shops run out. I thought we should do this ahead of time, so that we wouldn\u2019t add to the problem by competing for items at the last minute. We also had seasonal flu jabs - not because we thought it would protect us from Covid-19, but because a) we didn\u2019t want to have to contend with two viruses, either together or consecutively b) in the event of a bad case of flu, we didn\u2019t want to inflict a preventable burden on an over-stretched NHS. And Stu Goulden tweeted to me: With the number of confirmed coronavirus infections rising in the UK, and quarantine zones springing up across Europe, are people in Britain beginning to panic buy groceries? This customer circular email from Ocado, the online retailer, suggests they are. Ocado says it is \u201cexperiencing exceptionally high demand\u201d from customers who \u201cseem to be placing particularly large orders.\u201d Here is the email: Dear xxx We want to let you know that we\u2019re experiencing exceptionally high demand at the moment. More people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders. As a result, delivery slots are selling out quicker than expected. We suggest following these useful tips to avoid any disappointment: Place your order a little further in advance than you might normally. Ideally, try two or three days before. If you can be flexible, book yourself a weekday delivery (Monday\u2013Thursday) instead of a weekend one. We\u2019re unusually busy Friday to Saturday at the moment. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Ocado Customer Service team Are you panic buying in anticipation of the possibility of quarantine rules being imposed in your area? If you are send me a message telling me why, and what kinds of things you are buying in. Remember, you can reach me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. The Paris half-marathon, which was scheduled for Sunday with 44,000 registered runners, has been cancelled over fears of coronavirus, French news agency AFP reports. The announcement came after the French government ordered the cancellation of \u201cgatherings of more than 5,000 people\u201d in enclosed areas as well as some external events. French Health Minister Olivier Veran said the cancellations of external events would affect gatherings in open areas where there would be \u201cintermingling with populations from areas affected by the virus\u201d. The weekend programme of French Ligue 1 football matches is unaffected and will go ahead as planned, he said. The weekend games are not taking place in areas of France most affected by the virus, the Oise region north of Paris and La Balme-de-Sillingy village in the southeastern Haute-Savoie region. Veran said there were 16 new cases of coronavirus in France, taking to 73 the number of people affected since the end of January. Two people have died, a 60-year-old French teacher and an 80-year-old Chinese tourist. The number of people tested for coronavirus in Scotland has risen by more than 100 in a day, with no confirmed cases, PA reports. A total of 630 tests had been carried out by Saturday in Scotland, up from 500 on Friday. All have so far proved negative. On Friday, NHS Lothian announced it has introduced a \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing centre for the virus. Some patients with an appointment are being tested for coronavirus in their cars at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. NHS Lothian medical director Dr Tracey Gillies said: \u201cThis service is for patients who have been assessed by the specialist team, so it is an appointment-only service. \u201cIt is not a drop-in clinic and it is important to stress that patients cannot be seen without an appointment. \u201cThe drive-through facility and the community testing teams allow us to test patients without them coming into healthcare facilities. \u201cPatients will be referred on by their GP or NHS 24 if they are at risk of the virus and meet the clinical criteria. \u201cThey will then be referred on to our teams, who will decide whether they need to be tested in their own homes or if they are well enough and can use their own transport to drive to the Western General Hospital.\u201d Three more patients have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total here to 23. Two of the latest diagnosed patients had just returned from Italy, and the third from Asia, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. The cases are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire, the PA News Agency reports. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: \u201cAll three are being investigated and contact tracing has begun.\u201d The French government banned public gatherings with more than 5,000 people on Saturday due to the coronavirus outbreak as France reported 16 new cases, Reuters reports. \u201cAll public gatherings of more than 5,000 people in a confined space are temporarily banned across France,\u201d Health Minister Olivier Veran told journalists. He also that the number of confirmed cases had risen to 73 and that there had been no new deaths. Health officials are tracing anyone who has been in contact with a coronavirus patient who became the first to catch the illness within the UK, PA News Agency reports. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said it was not clear if the patient had contracted the virus \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. The new diagnosis brought the total number of UK cases to 20 on Friday, while a man who had been on a quarantined cruise ship became the first Briton to die from the virus. Public Health England (PHE) said that one of the latest coronavirus cases was a resident in Surrey and it was working with the county council to manage the situation. Haslemere Health Centre in the county has reopened after it was temporarily closed for cleaning as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d on Friday. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, MP for South West Surrey, said on Twitter he was thinking of \u201cclinicians, staff and patients\u201d at the surgery during this \u201cworrying time\u201d. He added: \u201cThoughts today with new Covid19 patient and local GP with symptoms alongside their families.\u201d Reuters is reporting that the French health minister has said the number of confirmed coronavirus-infected patients in the country has risen to 73. Chevron Corp said on Saturday that an employee in its Canary Wharf office in London who reported a flu-like illness, prompting the oil firm to send its staff home, has tested negative for the coronavirus, Reuters reports. On Tuesday Chevron asked about 300 British employees to work temporarily from home after an employee in its Canary Wharf office in London developed flu symptoms after returning from Northern Italy. It said it was proceeding with plans to have its staff return to the office. Switzerland is up to 17 cases of coronavirus infection - 12 confirmed and five awaiting confirmation - according to local media. Several areas, including the canton of Bern, have tightened preventive measures first announced on Friday, including a ban on public assemblies of more than 1,000 people, RTS reports. Event cancellations include Moutier carnival, which had been expected to go ahead because less than a thousand visitors were expected. A major real estate exhibition in Cannes has delayed for three months due to growing concern over the spread of the coronavirus. MIPIM, which describes itself as the world\u2019s leading property market, was expected to take place between March 10-13 dates, but it has been pushed back to early June in the hope the threat posed by the coronavirus will have reduced. Paul Zilk, chief executive of Reed MIDEM which organises the event, said: The well-being of our clients and staff is our priority. Given the evolving context, the best course of action is to postpone MIPIM to June. This is not a decision we have taken lightly. We believe these new dates will provide the international MIPIM community with the opportunity to achieve their business objectives. We are grateful to our clients for their support and constructive input during this challenging period, and we look forward to talking with them in the coming days about MIPIM in June. Italy\u2019s tourism industry has been dealt its final blow, the head of its hotel federation has lamented, after the US advised its citizens to reconsider travelling to the country. Hotel reservation cancellations have already reached about 90% in Rome, while Venice has seen bookings plummet after regional officials cancelled the final two days of carnival celebrations this week in an unprecedented move in modern times. On Friday, the US government issued a level three advisory, the second-highest level of warning for the whole of Italy, and announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended avoiding non-essential travel to the Mediterranean country. We had already registered a slowdown of Americans coming to Italy in recent days, Federalberghi president Bernabo Bocca said in a statement on Saturday, adding that the final blow had now arrived. Bocca criticised measures to help the tourism industry, including delaying deadlines for tax payments and pausing mortgage repayments, as insufficient. He urged further help to guarantee cash flow to tourism operators to \u201cavoid the collapse\u201d of an industry which operates 300,000 businesses and employs 1.5m people. More than 5.6 million Americans visit Italy every year, the second-largest national group behind Germans, representing 9% of foreign tourists in Italy. Americans are among the biggest spenders at an average of \u20ac140 euros a day for a collective total of \u20ac5bn euros a year, the hotel federation Federalberghi said. Other major countries have only issued warnings about defined areas of northern Italy where most cases of the coronavirus have been recorded. Italy has currently confirmed almost 900 cases, by far the highest figure outside Asia. There have been 21 deaths among people with the virus. World stock markets are expected to fall further next week after the first surveys of China\u2019s economic health since the coronavirus outbreak showed factory output plunged and the country\u2019s service sectors contracted. Illustrating how the virus could wreck the economic forecasts of other affected countries, the world\u2019s second largest economy reported that manufacturing production levels dropped to record lows this month. Stock markets tumbled last week as the virus spread to four continents and UN health officials upgraded the level of threat from the virus to \u201cvery high\u201d. It is likely the fresh data, which measures the economic impact of Beijing\u2019s efforts to clampdown on the virus, will further spook investors who sent global markets tumbling 11% last week in the worst seven-day period for stocks since the 2008 financial crash. With factories forced to remain closed after the traditional lunar new year holiday shutdown, China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), a widely-watched measure of economic activity, fell further this month than at any time in the last 12 years, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said. The bureau found a worrying collapse in domestic and export orders and a contraction of the country\u2019s burgeoning service sector. Similar surveys expected next month covering Japan and South Korea, both badly affected by the coronavirus outbreak, could prolong the rout on global stock markets, analysts said. The outbreak has already disrupted supplies to factories in Europe, where companies have struggled to access vital components sourced from the far east. Investors expect to find out in the next few days whether the outbreak is accelerating in the United States, the world\u2019s biggest economy, and how far central banks and governments are prepared to go to deal with an epidemic. \u201cRight now the market is saying that this is unbounded. We don\u2019t know what the limits are and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to peak,\u201d said Graham Tanaka, chief investment officer at New York-based Tanaka Capital. Stock markets globally lost about $5tn of value last week, as measured by the MSCI all-country index. Last weekend, president Xi Jinping told local officials that low-risk areas should \u201cresume full production and normal life\u201d. The government reported that larger factories\u2019 reached 85.6%of their capacity by the middle of last week. Analysts at ING said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t as positive as it sounds. Even if China\u2018s factory production can recover in March, it will still face the risk of a low level of export orders. This is because the supply chain will continue to be broken, this time in South Korea, Japan, Europe, and the US, where Covid-19 has begun to spread.\u201d Unofficial reports show that factories outside Hubei province, where the virus started, could be working at no more than 75% of their capacity and many nearer 25% to 50% while millions of workers remain trapped in their home province, unable to travel back to their place of work. The Qatari national who is the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in the Gulf state is a 36 year-old who returned recently from Iran and is in a stable condition, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. The UAE education ministry also announced the suspension of nursery school classes, as the regional business hub and major transit point for air travellers stepped up its contingency plans. Saudi Arabia is now the only Gulf country not to have signalled any cases of the coronavirus. Iran is preparing for the possibility of testing tens of thousands of people for the coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases in the country spiked once again, according to an official quoted by the Associated Press. The virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have killed 43 people out of 593 confirmed cases in Iran, health ministry spokesperson Kianoush Jahanpour said, disputing reports that four times as many people have died. The death rate from the virus in Iran, about 7%, has caused global consternation and fuelled speculation that the country could be underreporting the number of cases affecting it. However, Jahanpour attempted to put the public health crisis into perspective. He said that more than 480 people in Iran had been killed in traffic accidents, but no one noticed them. Saturday\u2019s new toll of 593 confirmed cases represents a jump of 205 cases, a 52% increase from the 388 reported the day before. Jahanpour has warned that large increases in the number of confirmed cases would happen as Iran now has 15 laboratories testing for the virus, as spray trucks and fumigators into the streets are sent into streets. He went on to suggest tens of thousands could seek testing for the coronavirus, while encouraging people to continue to avoid mass gatherings, even funerals for those who died of the virus. The safest place is our homes and our cities, he said. South Korea has reported a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in its battle against coronavirus transmission after 813 new cases were detected in the country in a single day. The northern Japanese island of Hokkaidao has announced a three-week state of emergency, part of a number of measures implemented in Japan to slow the outbreak. The US has reported three new cases of the virus where the infection if of unknown origin. The patients in California, Washington state and Oregon had not travelled overseas or come into close contact with known carriers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will have new coronavirus testing kits delivered to all states by the end of the week, after the first lot of tests were faulty. Mainland China reported the lowest number of new cases in a month, with 427 new cases reported, of which all but four were in Hubei province. There were 47 new deaths reported. Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases of Covid-19 and some 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries. Qatar\u2019s health ministry reported on Saturday the first case of coronavirus infection in the country, Reuters reports the state-run Qatar News Agency as saying. More than 85,000 people around the world have been confirmed to have been infected with coronavirus according to the latest figures, based on World Health Organisation and national counts: Mainland China: 2,835 deaths among 79,251 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 94 cases, 2 deaths Macao: 10 cases South Korea: 3,150 cases, 17 deaths Japan: 941 cases, including 705 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 11 deaths Italy: 888 cases, 18 deaths Iran: 593 cases, 43 deaths Singapore: 98 cases United States: 62 France: 57 cases, 2 deaths Germany: 57 cases Spain: 46 Kuwait: 45 Thailand: 42 Taiwan: 39 cases, 1 death Bahrain: 38 cases Malaysia: 24 Australia: 23 United Kingdom: 20 cases, 1 death United Arab Emirates: 19 cases Vietnam: 16 Canada: 14 Sweden: 12 Switzerland: 10 Iraq: 8 Norway: 6 Oman: 6 Austria: 5 Russia: 5 Croatia: 5 Israel: 5 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death Finland: 3 cases Greece: 3 India: 3 Lebanon: 3 Romania: 3 Norway: 2 Pakistan: 2 Denmark: 2 Netherlands: 2 Georgia: 2 Mexico: 2 Egypt: 1 Algeria: 1 Afghanistan: 1 North Macedonia: 1 Estonia: 1 Lithuania: 1 Belgium: 1 Belarus: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Cambodia: 1 Brazil: 1 New Zealand: 1 Nigeria: 1 Azerbaijan: 1 Monaco: 1 (Data collated by the Associated Press) The latest patient to be diagnosed with the virus and the GP who is feared to have it were both detected because the surgery where the doctor works is one of 100 practices where patients with breathing problems are now being routinely screened for Covid-19, the Guardian has been told. They were identified as a result of mouth and nasal swabs that were being taken from every patient attending the surgery with flu-like symptoms by staff from Surrey University who specialise in the spread and epidemiology of influenza. The northern Japanese island of Hokkaido has declared a three-week state of emergency, urging residents to stay home as much as possible until 19 March, NHK News reports. Speaking to reporters on Friday, [Hokkaido governor] Naomichi Suzuki said the situation is getting more serious. He urged residents to refrain from going out until March 19, and especially over this weekend. Suzuki said many people go out on weekends, and he wants people to refrain from going out this weekend to reduce the possibility of a surge in infections. He also said he wants children not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary, adding that nothing is more important than life and wellbeing. Pope Francis has cancelled official engagements for a third day in a row, the Associated Press reports. He last appeared in public on Wednesday, when he was seen coughing and blowing his nose. According to AP: The 83-year-old pope, who lost part of a lung to a respiratory illness as a young man, has never cancelled so many official audiences or events in his seven-year papacy. Francis is, however, continuing to work from his residence at the Vatican\u2019s Santa Marta hotel and is receiving people in private, the Vatican press office said. On Saturday, those private meetings were with the head of the Vatican\u2019s bishops\u2019 office, Francis\u2019 ambassadors to Lebanon and France and a Ukrainian archbishop. Cancelled were his two planned official audiences formal affairs in the Apostolic Palace where Francis would have delivered a speech and greeted a great number of people at the end. Those were to include an audience with an international bioethics organisation and with members of the scandal-marred Legion of Christ religious order. On Sunday, Francis is expected to leave the Vatican with top Holy See bureaucrats for a week of spiritual exercises in the Roman countryside, an annual retreat that the pope attends at the start of each Lent. The official death toll from coronavirus in Iran has reached 43, Reuters reports. There have been unofficial claims that the true figure is much higher. Reuters quoted a health official, Kianush Jahanpur, as telling state TV: Unfortunately nine people died of the virus in the last 24 hours. The death toll is 43 now. The new confirmed infected cases since yesterday is 205 that makes the total number of confirmed infected people 593. The Reuters report continues: Iran, which has the highest death toll outside China, has ordered the shutting of schools until Tuesday and the government has extended the closure of universities and a ban on concerts and sports events for a week. Several high-ranking officials, including a vice-minister, deputy health minister and five lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus as the rapid spread of the outbreak forced the government to call on people to stay at home. Iranian media reported on Saturday that one lawmaker, elected in Iran\u2019s 21 Februaru polls, had died of the coronavirus. Iran\u2019s government spokesman will hold his weekly news conference online due to the outbreak, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. The Chinese laboratory that first sequenced and shared the coronavirus genome publicly has been closed down by the authorities for \u201crectification\u201d, the South China Morning Post reports. On 12 January, a day after the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre\u2019s laboratory shared the information online \u2013 a move that helped companies to devise new diagnostic kits for the virulent respiratory illness \u2013 officials from the Shanghai Health Commission ordered it to close. The PHCC lab is a level-three biosafety facility that had only last month passed its annual inspections. It had obtained the necessary credentials and permissions to research the coronavirus, SCMP reported. It seems that scientists at the laboratory acted unilaterally in releasing the virus because they thought authorities were taking too long to act. The SCMP said the team at the lab, led by Prof Zhang Yongzhen, had isolated and finished the genome sequence of the then-unknown virus on 5 January and reported its findings to the China\u2019s national health commission the same day. SCMP cited an unnamed source linked to the centre as saying: The centre was not given any specific reasons why the laboratory was closed for rectification. [We have submitted] four reports [asking for permission] to reopen but we have not received any replies. The closure has greatly affected the scientists and their research when they should be racing against the clock to find the means to help put the novel coronavirus outbreak under control. An entire Italian Serie C football team is in quarantine after three players and an official tested positive for coronavirus. Players from Pianese, a side based in Tuscany, began to exhibit symptoms last Saturday, while the team played away against Allesandria. The Siena-based club said in a statement: At the moment those infected are four \u2013 three players and a team official. The first is a young player who had started to experience a slight rise in temperature and headache last Saturday, when the team was away to Alessandria to play a championship game. The second player is in self-isolation at his home, while not showing any symptoms, as well as the third player who is slightly feverish. The fourth person tested positive for the swab is a club official who this morning, after spending the night in a feverish state, was transported by ambulance to the hospital in Siena. Currently all the players, the technical staff and the managers present during the trip last weekend are in a 15-day quarantine. Vietnam has announced that all 16 infected coronavirus patients detected in the country have been discharged from hospital and declared cured, Al Jazeera reports. According to the broadcaster, the Vietnamese government has detected no new cases of coronavirus for the past 15 days. For the past 15 days, including on Friday, the government also detected no new cases of infections, the last one having been reported on 13 February. \u201cIf fighting Covid-19 has been a war, then we have won the first round but not the entire war because the situation can be very unpredictable,\u201d the deputy prime minister, Vu Duc Dam, was quoted as saying. Vietnam has taken strict measures to halt the spread of the virus, including shutting down schools across the country. A village north of Hanoi remains under lockdown. An expat teacher in Vietnam tells the Guardian: Ho Chi Minh officials in Vietnam have announced they are closing the schools for another two weeks, after already being closed for the month of February. Kindergartens and younger levels will not return until the 15th [of March] whilst secondary students can return on the 8th. Hanoi have also announced another week off school for all levels until the 8th. Many expat teachers have been out of work now for a month with many returning to their home country whilst the others stick it out. The health minister Edward Argar has said the UK continues to be in a \u201ccontainment phase\u201d of coronavirus spread, and said cancelling events would not be considered unless the outbreak worsened. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: We\u2019re still in the containment phase of this disease. We have been pretty good at containing it thus far. And the chief medical officer has been very clear that there is no reason to think that we shouldn\u2019t be able to continue containing it, so that\u2019s what our focus is on. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has spoken publicly about the possibility of ramping up measures to protect the public. But Agar said there was no reason to curtail mass events. [Whitty] said decisions on large events and whether they should go ahead will be taken at the time on the basis of the evidence. He\u2019s not saying there is a need for that now. Similarly, with school closures. He\u2019s been clear there is no reason or need for schools en masse to close. If there are particular incidents, Public Health England and local teams will give advice. So what Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has been saying is, these are all things that, in responsible contingency planning for the future, we will be looking at. But we are clear that these are not needed at the moment and that we believe, as he said, that we will not need to move to that phase on the base of where we are at the moment. Argar refused to comment on reports that the first person to contract coronavirus in the UK also passed it on to their doctor. The Guardian has been told there are fears that a doctor from the patient\u2019s surgery may also have been infected with the virus. If confirmed, this would prompt particular concern as the GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week. I\u2019m aware of the Guardian report, but I\u2019m going on the basis of what I\u2019ve been told. I haven\u2019t had any details of that and I think it would be wrong to comment on speculation in the press without that detailed advice from the chief medical officer. I have not been briefed on anything beyond the detail that the chief medical officer and others have given me about this individual case. It is a new development but the chief medical officer has also said we are still doing the contact tracing around that and we are still looking into the details of that case, so it is probably a bit premature to say more than that at the moment. South Korea has reported 219 new coronavirus cases, bringing the country\u2019s total infections to 3,150, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday, Reuters reports. The new cases are in addition to the 594 confirmed earlier in the day. Together they logged a record daily increase in infections since South Korea confirmed its first patient on 20 January. Earlier (5.27am), we reported how South Korean authorities had asked residents to stay at home this weekend to help contain the spread of the coronavirus. Large swathes of Seoul and other cities appear to be largely deserted. Health officials in the US have identified four \u201cpresumptive\u201d coronavirus cases believed to have been infected within the country, in a turning point in efforts to contain Covid-19 there, Reuters is reporting. Three new cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the US west coast. They span nearly 900 miles, from California\u2019s Silicon Valley region to the Puget Sound near Seattle. The agency reported a U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statement on Friday citing three new diagnoses \u2013 one each in California, Oregon and Washington state. If confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with a person known to be infected. The three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said. A fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is \u201clikely travel-related,\u201d the CDC said.

Australia has announced a travel ban to Iran, placing travellers from that country on the same restrictions as people seeking to travel to Australia from China. Australian citizens and permanent residents returning from either country will be required to self-isolate for 14 days, and foreign nationals seeking to enter Australia will not be able to do so until at least 14 days after they have left China or Iran. It comes as authorities in Queensland are trying to trace up to 40 people who may have received a beauty treatment from a Gold Coast beautician who returned from Iran on Monday and later became ill. She has since tested positive to coronavirus. Iran has the highest number of deaths from the novel coronavirus outside of China. Some 34 deaths have been reported, but the real figure is believed to be much higher. The US has also strengthened its travel advice, raising Iran and Italy to a level three, advising people to \u201cavoid nonessential travel.\u201d The US has reported three new cases of the virus where the infection if of unknown origin. A woman in California, a high school student in Washington state and an elementary school worker in Portland, Oregon have been diagnosed with the virus despite not having travelled overseas or come into close contact with someone who is at known risk. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will have new coronavirus testing kits delivered to all states by the end of the week, after the first lot of tests were faulty. US authorities have postponed a planned ASEAN meeting in Las Vegas on 14 March over coronavirus fears, and the UN has recommended ministers and diplomats avoid travelling to New York for a meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women next week. Authorities in South Korea have asked residents to stay home this weekend in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, after the country reported the biggest rise of cases in a single day since the virus was first detected in the country on 20 January. Some 594 cases were reported on Saturday, and the country\u2019s death toll has risen to 17. Mainland China reported the lowest number of new cases in a month, with 427 new cases reported, of which all but four were in Hubei province. There were 47 new deaths reported. Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases of Covid-19 and some 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries. You can read a wrap of these developments here. \u2018It just seems sensible\u2019 Some Australians have begun stockpiling food and medication in anticipation of a coronavirus outbreak. Gary Nunn reports that the threat of a pandemic, coming so soon after a horrific summer of bushfires that left many communities cut off for weeks, has made preppers out of people who would previously have laughed at the idea. One Sydney couple have already gathered three months worth of supplies. But experts say it is not necessary. Professor Nigel McMillan, the director of infectious diseases and immunology at the Menzies Health Institute at Griffith University in Queensland, says: There\u2019s no need to stockpile food, medicine, petrol or anything at this stage. We don\u2019t wish to induce panic buying when, for 95 to 99% of the population, this\u2019ll be a mild cold, nothing more. Plus, once we\u2019ve had this strain, we\u2019ll become immune to it. You can read the full piece here. Theme parks and sports stadiums in Japan have been closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Australian government has issued a statement on the travel ban to Iran, saying it is \u201cpart of our ongoing strategy of containment and minimising risk to the Australian community as detailed in our pandemic preparedness plan.\u201d As of 1 March 2020: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will raise the level of the travel advisory for Iran from level 3 to level 4 \u2013 do not travel; Foreign nationals (excluding permanent residents of Australia) who are in Iran on or after 1 March 2020, will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days, from the time they have left or transited through Iran; Australian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members (spouses, legal guardians or dependants only). They will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days from the day they left Iran. In a joint statement, prime minister Scott Morrison, health minister Greg Hunt and foreign minister Marine Payne said the travel advice was lifted on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Guardian Australia\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief, Melissa Davey, explained those reasons here. The United States has updated its travel advice for Iran and Italy, warning people to \u201cavoid nonessential travel\u201d due to the increased spread of coronavirus. It comes as Australia placed a travel ban on Iran, putting it on the same restrictions as China. \u201cAvoid nonessential travel\u201d is a level three warning. China and South Korea were already under the same warning. The ratings for Italy and Iran were updated by the CDC on Friday. The upgraded travel advice for Italy in particular is expected to have implications for businesses that have policies against allowing staff to travel to countries with a level three warning in place. There is no additional travel warning for Hong Kong, and Japan currently sits at a level two, which means travellers are advised to practice \u201cenhanced precautions.\u201d Coronavirus cases from \u2018unknown\u2019 sources concern health officials Health officials in the US are reportedly worried that the novel coronavirus is spreading through communities on the west coast, after three patients \u2014 one in Oregon, one in California and one in Washington \u2014 were infected through unknown means. This report from Associated Press. The patients are: An older woman in northern California with chronic health conditions A high school student in Everett, Washington An employee at an elementary school in Portland, Oregon None of the patients had recently travelled overseas or had any known close contact with a traveller or an infected person, authorities said. Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area also reported two cases where the source of infection wasn\u2019t known, AP reported. The new coronavirus cases of unknown origin marks an escalation of the worldwide outbreak in the U.S. because it means the virus could spread beyond the reach of preventative measures like quarantines, though state health officials said that was inevitable and that the risk of widespread transmission remains low. California public health officials on Friday said more than 9,380 people are self-monitoring after arriving on commercial flights from China through Los Angeles and San Francisco. That\u2019s up from the 8,400 that Gov. Gavin Newsom cited on Thursday, though officials said the number increases daily as more flights arrive. Officials are not too worried, for now, about casual contact, because federal officials think the coronavirus is spread only through \u201cclose contact, being within six feet of somebody for what they\u2019re calling a prolonged period of time,\u201d said Dr. James Watt, interim state epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health. The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads. Cherry blossom festivals in Japan have been cancelled due to fears around the coronavirus. From AFP: The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to seeing the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April. \u201cWe are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing ... but please give us your understanding,\u201d the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday. Other cherry blossom events - feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists - are likely to follow suit, according to local media. Organisers of Tokyo\u2019s Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival said people could still enjoy the blooming trees that grow along public roads. Trees in Tokyo will soon be in full bloom, with friends, families and colleagues typically flocking to parks for sometimes raucous, alcohol-fuelled celebrations. The cancellations come as authorities step up efforts to tackle the outbreak in Japan, which has reported more than 230 infections and five deaths. Schools are closed and the government is urging people to work from home or commute during off-peak hours and avoid large gatherings. The operator of Tokyo\u2019s two Disney resorts - Disneyland and DisneySea - said Friday the parks would be closed for around two weeks due to the virus. Universal Studios Japan in Osaka has also shuttered for a fortnight. Tiger Ye, a 21-year-old student in Wuhan, contracted the novel coronavirus. He wrote about the experience in The Guardian. By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life. You can read the full story here: Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, says people should not stockpile face masks. We know that people stockpiling masks has caused an issue with mask supply around Australia, and we don\u2019t support that. Australia has implemented a travel ban against Iran, placing it under the same restrictions as China, because of an increased risk of coronavirus. It follows the first case in Australia of a person who had travelled to Iran. Health minister Greg Hunt is explaining the ban to reporters in Melbourne at the moment. From tomorrow, 1 March, people who have travelled to Iran are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon return to Australia. Also, from tomorrow, non-citizens or permanent residents, and people who are not family members of citizens or permanent residents, will be prevented from entering Australia unless they left Iran at least 14 days before entering Australia. Hunt said the level 4 travel advice on Iran is identical to travel advice already in place for China. The Smartraveller website is yet to be updated. They [Iran] have the highest death rate, I think the latest advice we have is 34 deaths, outside of Hubei. There is likely at this stage a high level of undetected cases and therefore those cases . won\u2019t be intercepted or detected on departure from Iran. As of Saturday, more than 85,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed and 2,900 people have died. The virus has now spread to 58 countries. Chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said it was \u201cnot possible to isolate Australia further\u201d and place travel bans on every country where the virus had been detected. But he said his office had recommended the increased travel warning against Iran, due to the nature of the outbreak there. Thailand has reported one new case of coronavirus, bringing its total to 42, Reuters reports. South Korean authorities have asked residents to stay at home this weekend to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, and it seems that advice has been heeded. This shopping area in Seoul is usually busy. Today it was empty. Quarantine operations are underway in Daegu, the city at the centre of the outbreak in South Korea. Current advice for Australia Just to recap on the situation as it currently stands in Australia: the total number of cases confirmed in Australia is 25. Fifteen of these people are reported to have recovered and the remaining are in a stable condition. Nine are passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. People who become ill after travelling to China or a region with reported coronavirus cases are advised to isolate themselves and call their doctor. There is no need for people to buy and wear face masks \u2014 and authorities ask that you don\u2019t buy up supplies \u2014 but extra careful hand washing is advised. The current travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is for Australians to not travel to mainland China. They also advise that Australians \u201creconsider\u201d travel to Iran and \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d in regions of northern Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Mongolia. The Australian government\u2019s official up-to-date advice is here. South Korea has urged its citizens to stay indoors and warned it is facing a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in its battle against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. It comes as the country records its biggest daily jump in the number of cases reported since it reported its first case on 20 January, with 594 new cases reported on Saturday. The total number of cases is 2,931. Another person is confirmed to have died from the virus bringing the death toll to 17. Vice health minister Kim Kang-lip told a briefing on Saturday that residents were advised to stay home. We have asked you to refrain from taking part in public events, including a religious gathering or protest, this weekend. He said it was a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in curbing the spread of the virus. Please stay at home and refrain from going outside and minimise contact with other people. Many of the new cases have been linked to a church. More from Reuters: As many as 476 of the new cases were from southeastern Daegu city, the site of a church at the centre of the outbreak, and 60 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as \u201cPatient 31\u201d attended religious services there before testing positive. More than 88% have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added. Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to \u201cslander and oppression\u201d of its followers. Kim said the government was working with the municipal authorities to check if the church provided an incomplete list. A court rejected a plan by conservative groups critical of President Moon Jae-in for a massive weekend rally in downtown Seoul, citing health concerns. Speaking of airports \u2014 Guardian Australian news editor Mike Ticher reports that about 50% of all passengers and staff at Singapore airport are wearing masks, despite the Singapore government\u2019s instruction that there is no need to do so unless people are feeling unwell. He writes: There are few outward signs of unease about coronavirus at Singapore airport, although the waiting areas seem sparsely populated on Saturday morning. Traffic at the airport was reported to be 25% down in the first two weeks of February. Singapore is one of the countries identified by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee where the coronavirus situation is of particular concern. In LAX, the flight crews are wearing masks. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has recommended that ministers and diplomats skip travelling to a meeting in New York of the Commission on the Status of Women due to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. More than 7,000 people usually attend the annual meeting, officials said, which is dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. It is due to be held from March 9 to 20. However, in a letter to UN member states from the chair of the commission, Armenia\u2019s UN Ambassador Mher Margaryan said Guterres had recommended that member states \u201cshorten and scale down the session\u201d and cancel dozens of side events. \u201cHe also strongly recommended that capital-based representatives refrain from traveling to headquarters for the session,\u201d Margaryan wrote. The bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women proposed that member states agree to Guterres\u2019 recommendations at a meeting on Monday. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres made the recommendations given the \u201cfast-evolving situation\u201d with the coronavirus and the need to \u201cbalance the UN\u2019s critical work and public health concerns.\u201d The most recent coronavirus case in the United States has led to the temporary closure of an elementary school in Portland after authorities confirmed that the infected person worked at the school. The new case in Oregon \u2014 the first in that state \u2014 was reported on Friday. It\u2019s the third case of unknown origin in the US. More from AP: \u201cThe case was not a person under monitoring or a person under investigation. The individual had neither a history of travel to a country where the virus was circulating, nor is believed to have had a close contact with another confirmed case the two most common sources of exposure,\u201d the Oregon Health Authority said in a statement. The Lake Oswego School District sent a robocall to parents saying that Forest Hills Elementary will be closed until Wednesday so it can be deep-cleaned by maintenance workers. Health authorities planned to spend the weekend scrambling to find everyone the unidentified person, who has been hospitalised, had been in contact with. Hours before the case emerged, the state ramped up efforts to combat an outbreak amid potential challenges, including closing schools, businesses and events, and sustained shortages of medical supplies. At a hastily called news conference, state health officials did not release details on the person, citing patient privacy. But they said the person had spent time at the elementary school, located in a Portland suburb. \u201cState and local authorities are responding quickly to this case,\u201d Oregon Gov. Kate Brown told the Portland news conference. Brown urged people not to panic. Authorities are monitoring 78 people in Oregon for signs of the virus. Another 178 have completed monitoring without developing systems. Two more developed symptoms but tested negative. The case brings the number of people in the US with the novel coronavirus to 62. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, held a meeting of party officials on Friday calling for stronger efforts to control the novel coronavirus, saying there would be serious consequences if it spread into his country. South Korea has the second highest number of infections outside mainland China, but North Korea is yet to report a confirmed case. This image was released by Korea\u2019s Central News Agency, showing Kim Jong Un observing a Korean People\u2019s Army joint strike drill at an undisclosed location. Workers in North Korea were disinfecting checkout counters on Friday. Only one of the 61 (or 62, the numbers are unclear) confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States represents a patient who is still in hospital, vice president Mike Pence said on Friday. There have been 15 confirmed cases in the US and 46 \u2014 or 47, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 cases among people who returned to the country from overseas and were quarantined. Reuters says a CDC spokeswoman was not able to explain the difference in the numbers. Pence said in a news conference with Florida governor Ron DeSantis on Friday that: \u201cIn every case, people are being treated and by all accounts are doing well.\u201d Meanwhile, Orange County officials say federal authorities have dropped a plan to transfer passengers returning from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to the Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa. Officials were looking at using the centre to house passengers from the cruise ship who were evacuated from the ship to Travis Air Force Base in Northern California, had tested positive for the virus, but did not need hospital care. Third case of unknown origin in the US There has been another case of unknown origin reported in the United States, bringing the total number of cases of unknown origin to three. The Oregon health authority declared its first presumptive case of novel coronavirus on Friday. More from Reuters: According to the statement, the infected individual identified as a resident of Washington County neither had history of travel to a country where the virus was circulating, nor is believed to have had a close contact with another confirmed case. Public health officials are considering it a likely community-transmitted case, which means that the origin of the infection is unknown, the statement added. Two other cases of unknown origin have been reported in California. Queensland Health has just sent through a press statement with a few more details on that Gold Coast case. The beauty salon was Hair Plus at the Australia Fair shopping centre. But the woman in question did facials and other beauty treatments \u2014 not haircuts. That\u2019s significant because beauty treatments, in this salon, were much shorter appointments. The biggest concern is people who had a beauty appointment lasting more than 15 minutes, or who may have been in the room for two or more hours. Anyone who attended Hair Plus from 11am onwards on Thursday, 27 February, has been asked to go to the Gold Coast University Hospital. People who were at the Australia Fair shopping centre, but not the beauty salon, on Thursday have been told there is \u201cno need for concern\u201d but they can call 13HEALTH for advice. Health minister Steven Miles said the risk of the virus spreading in Queensland remained very low. There are nine confirmed cases in Queensland. This latest case brings the number of confirmed cases in Australia to 25. Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said that with the novel coronavirus spreading to an increasing number of countries, anyone who feels unwell shortly after arriving in Australia from overseas should contact their doctor for advice. The number of affected countries has spread to 49, and the World Health Organisation has elevated the risk of spread of the virus to \u201cvery high\u201d. A pandemic has not been declared, but Young said it would happen. We know we will be seeing an epidemic here in Queensland eventually. We would like to contain that as much as possible, as we have been. Young said that more than 80% of all recorded cases of the Covid-19 virus were mild, and the mortality rate had fallen from 2-3% when the virus was first reported, as more mild cases are detected. It\u2019s now estimated to be about 1%. Said Young: I am very very confident here in Queensland, because of the. warning that we have been given.... that we will see [mortality] rates even lower than that. Young said the demographic at the highest risk from the virus were the elderly and those with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular conditions. She said children had a \u201cminimal risk\u201d \u2014 not an elevated risk, as they have with other respiratory conditions like the flu \u2014 and the risk to pregnant women is understood to be the same as the general population. Miles said Queensland had asked the federal government to declare the coronavirus a disaster, because of its broader economic impacts. We are doing everything we can from a health perspective to contain the virus but it is impacting on business, it is impacting on the economy.... in the same way that a disaster does. The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, spoke just now in Brisbane now about the latest coronavirus case in Australia, which is a 63-year-old woman who recently returned from Iran. The woman flew back on Monday 24 February, and was not unwell on the flight. She began to feel unwell on Thursday 27 February, and authorities are trying to trace anyone who may have come into contact with the woman while she was working as a beautician on the Gold Coast on Thursday. The beauty salon is at the Australia Fair shopping centre on the Gold Coast. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said they believe she saw 30 to 40 clients on Thursday, mostly for very short appointments. Interactions of less than 15 minutes have a low risk of transmitting the virus, Young said. Young said the woman mainly gave facials, and that customers often did not book and paid cash \u2014 so they have made a public call-out for anyone who attended the beauty salon on Thursday to come forward. On the risk of transmission, Young said: It\u2019s a very brief interaction so the risk is very low. She said there was \u201cno need to have any concerns prior to that,\u201d because the woman was not symptomatic. She said that once she began to feel unwell, the woman immediately notified her doctor that she had returned from Iran \u2014 which has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside of mainland China \u2014 and was at risk. If you didn\u2019t go to that salon then there is no need to have any concern at all. If you are unsure about the seriousness of the coronavirus \u2014 and there has been some fairly confused information about this \u2014 science correspondent Hannah Devlin has busted some of the most common myths. For one, she writes that while we do not know a precise fatality rate for Covid-19, current estimates are a fatality rate of about 1%. Hannah writes: This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. So: worse than flu.

Postponing the ASEAN summit a \u2018difficult decision\u2019: US officials Here is a bit more on that announcement from the United States to delay a regional ASEAN summit scheduled to take place in Las Vegas in two weeks time. From AFP: The United States has delayed a regional ASEAN summit scheduled to take place in Las Vegas next month due to fears of the coronavirus, a senior administration official said Friday. \u201cAs the international community works together to defeat the novel coronavirus, the United States, in consultation with ASEAN partners, has made the difficult decision to postpone the ASEAN leaders meeting,\u201d said the official on condition of not being named. Leaders from the Association of South East Asian Nations had been due to be hosted by President Donald Trump on March 14. The official said the United States \u201cvalues our relationships with the nations of this critical region, and looks forward to future meetings.\u201d The announcement came as health officials in California confirmed the United States\u2019 second case believed to have been transmitted to a person who did not travel overseas or come in contact with anyone known to be ill. The Las Vegas meeting was scheduled after US president Donald Trump skipped the ASEAN summit in Thailand in November. More from AFP: Trump had skipped an ASEAN summit and parallel East Asia Summit last year in Bangkok. He instead sent his national security advisor Robert O\u2019Brien, in the lowest-level participation ever by the United States in the East Asia Summit. The move came after years of US efforts to show that the United States is committed to Asia in the face of a rising China. Hello and welcome to our continued live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. This is where the situation stands: The World Health Organisation says that the coronavirus could reach most \u201cif not all countries.\u201d It has already spread to 49 countries. You can check our map of the outbreak here. The latest figures from mainland China report 427 new cases, all but four of which were in Hubei province. There have been about 80,000 confirmed cases in mainland China. The death toll rose by 47, bringing the total number of deaths to 2,835. South Korea reported 594 new cases on Saturday, the biggest increase to date for the country, taking the national total to 2,931 infections. 90% of the cases are in the outbreak centre of Daegu. Three women are confirmed to have died, taking the national death toll to 16. The US government will reportedly suspend a planned meeting of Asean leaders in Las Vegas on 14 March over coronavirus fears. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen to 20, with the first death of a UK citizen \u2014 a 70-year-old passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who lived abroad \u2014 confirmed on Friday. Australian authorities have reported two new confirmed cases, including a 63-year-old woman now in hospital on the Gold Coast who travelled to Queensland from Iran, where infection rates are suspected to be much higher than reported.

Chelsea players a celebrating at the opposite side of the pitch to their fans, which is a bit odd. This probably needed better planning. The Arsenal players have taken their silver medals and now the Chelsea players have theirs around necks. Berger: \u201cIt feels unbelievable. I think everyone put in a great shift. I am proud of my team.\u201d England: \u201cWe like to make it hard to ourselves, but credit to the girls. \u201cI am over the moon to get the winner. I thought Arsenal were great today - they kept pushing.\u201d Kerr: \u201cIt was a team performance. There was always going to be pressure but that\u2019s because we put pressure on ourselves.\u201d Here is the winner! A sign of Arsenal\u2019s injury problems was provided by the fact they were unable to make a single substitution. That is the first time Chelsea have celebrated their first Continental Cup trophy. They certainly battled for their victory, showing how much they wanted it, despite their manager\u2019s general lack of interest in the competition. What a finish! Arsenal really deserved to win it but their finishing was pretty dreadful for the for the majority of the match, although Chelsea\u2019s Berger also made some crucial saves throughout. England showed what a composed striker is worth to a team with being in the right place at the right time when it mattered. England gets in at the back post to slide the ball home after some great work by Kerr and then Mjelde. Chelsea have won it! 90 mins: Five minutes added on! 89 mins: Nobbs takes the ball down the right and swings in a cross for Miedema to attack but Berger takes hold the ball, only to take a nudge to her painful stomach from the Dutch striker. 87 mins: Arsenal are going at Chelsea now! The ball is played through to Miedema in the box but she is crowded out and the ball cleared out to Foord, who smashes her shot towards goal but it is deflected wide by a defender. The corner is pumped to the back post, then Nobbs lifts it over Berger and Eriksson just beats Quinn to it to prevent a certain goal. The resulting corner from Berger\u2019s save bounces around in the box, allowing Williamson to divert the ball into the bottom corner from six yards out. 83 mins: What an incredible save! Foord fires a cross to Miedema, who controls it and smashes a shot from a couple of yards out straight into the stomach of Berger, saving a certain goal but causing the goalkeeper plenty of pain. 81 mins: Miedema gets to the byline and volleys a cross to the back post but Foord can\u2019t complete the job and has her effort headed clear. McCabe is the latest to go into the book for kicking Kerr in the knee. 79 mins: Thorisdottir\u2019s first impact is to stand on Quinn\u2019s foot. It looks like a nasty one but he referee gives nothing. 77 mins: Chelsea make the first sub of the game, as Thorisdottir replaces Ji in a defensive change. Cuthbert flies into a challenge with McCabe and catches the Arsenal defender relatively late around the ankle, resulting in a booking. 75 mins: A Chelsea corner goes through to Evans at the back post and despite having time to clear she sends the ball straight to Bright, who fires a shot just wide. Dirk van de Graaf says: \u201cI think that Montemurro is too rigid in his instructions, that\u2019s why Arsenal is so poor in finishing against good teams. To compare with Klopp: the players know how to adapt to win.\u201d 73 mins: Berger is down on the ground awaiting treatment. She seems to have a problem with her ankle. I am not sure how that has happened ... 71 mins: A corner is swung in from the left by Chelsea, which Zinsberger flaps at but gets enough on it to clear away from the danger area. Foord hits a shot but it lands on the head of Miedema who directs the ball towards the bottom corner, only to see Berger fingertip the header wide. 69 mins: Evans plays in an inch-perfect pass into Nobbs, who spins on the edge of the area and fires wide. 67 mins: Nobbs curls in a dangerous cross from the left but no Arsenal player makes an attempt to get on the end of it. I wish Arsenal players would take a bit of a risk and gamble on scoring. 65 mins: Another cross into the box from Arsenal and another inept attempt to score as Miedema fails to beat the much shorter Mjelde in the air. Down at the other end, Kerr is played through by Reiten but Zinsberger is out quickly, blocking the original shot and the Australian can only squirt the follow up wide. 63 mins: Mjedle is dispossessed 25 yards from her own goal and the ball is played into Miedema but her drag back is poorly executed and Chelsea win the ball back. Cuthbert moans about being caught by Nobbs, the Chelsea player takes a stud to the ankle but there is nothing in it. 61 mins: Arsenal are enjoying another healthy spell of possession in the final third but Miedema snatches at a shot and it is blocked. She then hits a more vicious shot from further out but it goes just wide. 59 mins: Even Nobbs is making errors. McCabe sends the ball down the line for her but she fails to control it, allowing the ball to go under her foot and out of play. Van de Donk receives the ball into her feet but is pulled back by Eriksson 20 yards from goal, resulting in the defender being rightly booked. 57 mins: A ball is lifted over the top for England to chase but Zinsberger reads it well and comes out to clear the danger just ahead of the Chelsea striker. 55 mins: Miedema has had one half chance and not much else. You would not expect such a quiet game from someone with her record. Can she up it? 53 mins: Ingle and Reiten combine well on the edge of the box, allowing the latter to get a shot off, only to see it fly just over the bar. 51 mins: Roord directs play 25 yards from goal, knocks it to Evans who slips it through the defence in the hope of completing a one-two but the midfielder does not make the run and the ball drifts out of play. 49 mins: Arsenal once again fall at the final hurdle as Miedema sends a pass out to McCabe in space but her low cross is straight at a Chelsea defender. This must be highly frustrating to watch for any Arsenal fan. 47 mins: A free-kick is lifted into the box, which Eriksson gets flicks towards goal but Zinsberger grabs hold of the header. Here we go again! Arsenal do not have many options on the bench but they are playing well, they just need to find a little extra in the final third. Can they do it? Adam Kline-Schoder has emailed in with some proper analysis: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me how much the tactical setup from Chelsea is similar to when the thrashing they dished out to Arsenal earlier in the season. Ingle and Ji are both staying deep to stop Miedema and Nobbs from finding space. Kerr and England are drifting into pockets of space and causing all sorts of confusion in Arsenal\u2019s backline; what a partnership that\u2019s turned out to be. Perhaps I\u2019m oversimplifying -- and am happy to take that criticism -- but given how similar Chelsea are set up, thus far this doesn\u2019t exactly speak volumes of Montemurro\u2019s tactical nous and flexibility.\u201d Arsenal have looked good on the ball but utterly dreadful in the final third. Chelsea, on the other hand, have put in a solid performance and England did the business when it matter. 45 mins: One minute added on. 44 mins: Kerr and England are two-on-two with the Arsenal centre-backs. The Australian finds her strike partner who drives into the area but her vicious shot is blocked by a covering defender. 42 mins: Some truly incompetent attacking and defending from a Chelsea corner. First Miedema misses her header at the front post, allowing it to bounce to the back where a header is blocked by an Arsenal defender but then the fail to clear the ball and Ingle is allowed to fire a shot from 25 yards which flashes wide. 40 mins: Kerr battles in the box with Schnaderbeck and just manages to get away a shot when she has not right to but Zinsberger spreads herself well to block it. Ji then whacks the rebound into Kerr\u2019s back. Miedema finds plenty of space in the area but hits an early shot into the side netting. 38 mins: There a couple of nutmegs in a row but the play is curtailed by a foul on Nobbs. Roord then brings down Ji to even the foul count up and end a scrappy spell of play. Arsenal try to play out from the back, which is a nice idea but it just seems to get them into a panic. Schnaderbeck receives the ball 20 yards from her own goal and immediately gives it away. 36 mins: The Gunners are on top here but are really struggling when it matters. Foord is the latest to overplay a through ball, sending it 10 yards ahead of Miedema. Even Usain Bolt would not catch such a dreadful pass. 34 mins: Arsenal knock it around on the edge of the box until a cross is lumped into the area, which Berger punches clear. Arsenal having all of the ball but never look like scoring. 32 mins: Nobbs and Van de Donk play around 10 passes between the two players, which shows how Arsenal have lacked a slight cutting edge in the final third. 30 mins: Almost a second for England, as she sprints to get onto the end of a Reiten cross but the unmarked striker heads it a yard wide. 28 mins: Arsenal produce a slick move, with Foord flicking a pass through to Evans, whose pullback is turned behind by Chelsea. Moments later, McCabe punts a long ball into the box, finding the head of Quinn who steers it slowly wide. 26 mins: Roord collects the ball 20 yards from goal, gets it out of her feet but drags her shot from the edge of the area just wide of the net. Down the other end, Cuthbert lifts a cross into the box but it is too high for England, who heads it well wide. 24 mins: England is hassling the whole Arsenal team and takes a late tackle from McCabe, which could be a sign of the frustration the Gunners are feeling. 22 mins: Evans almost has too many options when dribbling towards the area but fails to find a red shirt, instead passing the ball straight to Reiten, who is all to happy to clear the ball. 20 mins: Miedema goes round the outside and hits a powerful shot from an acute angle which Berger palms over the bar with minimal fuss. The resulting corner swings straight out of play without touching anyone. 18 mins: Arsenal do look the livelier despite being behind but they have played some mediocre final balls. 16 mins: There is some pinball in the Arsenal box as neither strikers nor defenders manage to control the situation. In the end, Kerr flicks an Ingle cross wide to end a dangerous spell. 14 mins: Foord slips the ball through to a marauding Nobbs but her first-time strike with her left foot is repelled by Berger. 12 mins: Arsenal appeal for a penalty after Williamson controls a free-kick in the box but then has her feet taken away from her by Ji. It looks like a penalty but the referee shakes her head. Seconds later, McCabe whips in a cross which Quinn heads towards goal but Berger is well positioned and palms clear. 10 mins: How will Arsenal recover from going behind early on? They have suffered at the hands of Chelsea already this season and could fear another heavy loss. Reiten looks set to give Chelsea the lead after drifting into space in the area but with the goal gaping, an Arsenal defender gets in a good block. Arsenal fail to clear the ball and Andersson lifts a cross to the back post for Mjedle to knock down to England, who sweeps home. 6 mins: Bright whacks a long pass down but it bounces into the arms of the Arsenal goalkeeper. 4 mins: Foord wins a corner off Eriksson, but the set-piece does not beat the first defender. Arsenal are playing the better stuff early on and look to be operating at a higher intensity. 2 mins: Keer spins Williamson but her cross is straight into the hands of Zinsberger. During the pre-match handshakes, Leah Williamson gave her jacket to a mascot to keep them warm in what will be seen as a \u2018nice touch\u2019. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The stands at the City Ground are reasonably well populated but not all of them are open. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear we\u2019ve never made this final,\u201d Emma Hayes points out. \u201cWe are absolutely here to win it.\u201d The final frontier. Unloved, you say? Warming up ... It looks breezy in Nottingham and Clare Balding is wearing a bobble hat. More as we get it. Sam Kerr starts for Chelsea today. Her manager, Emma Hayes, thinks it will be a few months before we see the best of her. It would be a big boost if she can have a telling impact on today\u2019s match. Gunning for glory ... In terms of team news, you have got to admit that the Arsenal bench looks very weak. Due to injuries they are unable to fill it and have been forced to call upon three teenagers to fill up some of the space. Brian Clough continues to inspire ... Arsenal: Zinsberger, Evans, Quinn, Schnaderbeck, McCabe, Williams, Roord, Van de Donk, Nobbs, Miedema, Foord Subs: Peyraud-Magnin, Maier, Filis, Grant, Mace Chelsea: Berger, Bright, Ingle, England, Ji, Reiten, Eriksson, Mjedle, Kerr, Cuthbert, Andersson Subs: Telford, Thorisdottir, Blundell, Carter, Cooper, Spence, Bachmann Good afternoon! The first piece of silverware of the season is up for grabs at the City Ground. Arsenal and Chelsea are in the mix for the WSL title, so will be hoping to earn a psychological edge for the run-in by lifting the trophy today. Arsenal are without Kim Little, Beth Mead and Lia W\u00e4lti, which is a a blow, especially considering the last time the two sides met, Chelsea ran out 4-1 winners. Jordan Nobbs will lead out Arsenal in Little\u2019s absence and will be aiming for glory to make up for a prolonged period out of the side last season due to a serious knee injury. Few would back against another Arsenal triumph, seeing as they have won the competition on five previous occasions. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes has previously said \u201cget rid of the Continental Cup\u201d, so she must really be looking to this showpiece event. One suspects Hayes might be slightly giddier if her team are victorious. Although she seems intent on downplaying her side\u2019s chances. \u201cThis is Arsenal\u2019s trophy,\u201d she said in the buildup to the match. Anyway ... should be a cracker!",

Even allowing for the received wisdom that football is a funny old game, it would be seriously bizarre if Liverpool were denied their first title for 30 years because of a pandemic.</p> <p>If the coronavirus does not end the season early, Liverpool need 12 points from their last 11 games to clinch their first Premier League title. They could still do it at Everton on 16 March, the third of those 11 games, should Manchester City drop points in the meantime. For the time being, their focus is on beating Watford and extending their lead to 25 points. Yawn, meh, 25 points.</p> <p>Hang on, <em>25 points?!</em> I\u2019m not sure Liverpool are getting enough credit. You might not like them, you might think the Premier League is a bit naff, you might be sick of the sight of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s teeth, but come on: they\u2019ve won 35 of their last 36 league games FFS! That has never happened before in Europe\u2019s biggest leagues. In fact, their record this season - P27 W26 D1 L0 - belongs in Sunday League football.</p> <p>There is one difference. A team with 26 wins from 27 in Sunday League football would have a goal difference of around +200. Liverpool\u2019s is a mere +47, and 13 of their 26 victories this season have been by a single goal \u2013 many of them requiring late winners. That might be the reason for the slightly muted response to win after win after win; it feels like Manchester City received more effusive praise two years ago when they regularly thumped teams by four or five. </p> <p>I also think there\u2019s an element of everyone - even Liverpool fans - struggling to get their head around such unprecedented threepointery. Or maybe the world is full of Expected Goals disciples. <a href=\"https://understat.com/league/EPL/2019\">Liverpool are second in the xG table</a>, although an Expected Win tonight will move them within two Expected Points of Manchester City.</p> <p>I\u2019d argue that Liverpool having to work so hard for many wius actually enhances rather than diminishes their achievement. The soundbites may be cheesy but they\u2019re also true: Liverpool <em>are</em> mentality monsters, the toughest in English football for a long while. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/liverpool-watford-premier-league-match-report\">Watford played well in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield in December</a>, so you never know what might happen tonight. But 106 points from the last 108 available should give you a pretty good idea.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 5.30pm.</strong> </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T16:37:51.969Z\">at 4.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Sachin Nakrani\u2019s match report has landed, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight. Jurgen Klopp shakes hands with all the Watford players before leaving the field. You\u2019d have to be desperately one-eyed to begrudge Watford that victory. They were the better team throughout and got their rewards in the second half. Ismaila Sarr scored two quickfire goals, the second a beauty, and set up the third for Troy Deeney. Liverpool\u2019s winning run ends at a record-equalling 18 games, and their unbeaten run at 44. They are still going to win the league at a canter, and that\u2019s all that really matters. The real significance of this result is at the bottom, where Watford jump out of the relegation places. They were simply brilliant, with and without the ball, and look far too something to go down. Peep peep! Watford complete a slightly surreal but thoroughly deserved victory over Liverpool. Three-nil! 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. Liverpool are about to lose a Premier League game for the first time in 422 days. 90 min It\u2019s just one defeat, let\u2019s not over-reac- oh. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if Lovren ever plays another game for Liverpool,\u201d says Rolf Wilhelm. \u201cMilner is a much better option for centre-back, or any of the kids.\u201d 89 min van Dijk wafts a shot over the bar from 30 yards. Before play resumes, the excellent Abdoulaye Doucoure - who made the first goal - is replaced by NathanIel Chalobah. 88 min \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair for Liverpool\u2019s undefeated season to end this way. I mean, to make the players wear 40-pound costumes as they walked out onto the field has obviously fatigued them something terrible.\u201d 86 min Watford\u2019s fans are getting greedy: they are now desperate not just for victory but also a clean sheet. Whatever happens in the last few minutes, they\u2019ll talk about this night forever. 85 min Jordan Henderson has been Liverpool\u2019s player of the match. 84 min Robertson, the only Liverpool outfield player who has performed to his usual standard, picks out Lallana. His shot is blocked. 83 min Had Sarr scored it would have gone to VAR for a possible offside. It was very tight, not that it matters now. 82 min Sarr misses a brilliant chance to score a legendary hat-trick! He was put through by Capoue and curled just wide of the far post. It\u2019s his last touch: he leaves the field to a standing ovation, and a brollocking for Alexander-Arnold for not rushing straight off the field. Ignacio Pussetto replaces him. 80 min A 3-0 win would take Watford out of the relegation zone, ahead of Bournemouth on goal difference. It\u2019s deliciously tight down there. 79 min Liverpool make their last change, with Roberto Firmino replaced by Takumi Minamino. 77 min Watford have been fantastic tonight. There has been so much to admire: the work rate, spirit, defensive organisation and most of all their controlled, purposeful attacking. 76 min Mane gets away with a little kick at Masina, who had shepherded the ball out of play. 75 min \u201cTroy Deeney,\u201d says Graham Fulcher, \u201cis an Arsenal legend. I never thought I would write that and be happy about it.\u201d Even Nigel Pearson is shaking his head in disbelief. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s short backpass was intercepted by Sarr, who went round Alisson. The angle was too tight so he turned back, looked up and fed Deeney, who sidefooted the ball calmly over the head of van Dijk on the line. I say. It\u2019s Watford 3 (THREE), Liverpool 0 (NIL)! 72 min It\u2019s all Liverpool now, although Watford\u2019s defensive organisation remains very impressive. 71 min Liverpool are now playing 4-2-4: Origi left, Mane right, Salah and Firmino up front. 70 min \u201cAs all any Arsenal have now is our past,\u201d says Andrew Hurley, \u201chere\u2019s hoping Watford can preserve our two unbeaten records!\u201d 69 min Liverpool are starting to put Watford under serious pressure for the first time in the match. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s whipped free-kick from the right is headed away by Cathcart. 66 min: Lallana hits the post! It was a beautiful effort. A headed clearance came to him 25 yards out, left of centre; he chested the ball down, waited for it to bounce and cut across a left-footed shot that hit the outside of the far post. Foster was beaten. 65 min Divock Origi replaces the disappointing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. 64 min Almost a third goal! After a lazy Liverpool clearance, Hughes\u2019s first-time shot hits his team-mate Sarr in the six-yard box. That might have been going in. 61 min Adam Lallana comes on to replace Wijnaldum. That was a lovely finish. Deeney, on halfway by the right touchline, curled a speculative pass around the defence, and all of a sudden Sarr was away. He had too much pace for van Dijk and Lovren and was calm enough to flip the ball gently over the outrushing Alisson. What a fine goal. Ismaila Sarr gets his second! 58 min Robertson\u2019s excellent cross into the six-yard box is put behind by Cathcart. Liverpool have an affronted look on their collective coupon, which is possibly bad news for Watford. 56 min It\u2019s probably no coincidence that Ismaila Sarr has been injured for most of Watford\u2019s poor recent run. He was brilliant during their excellent start under Nigel Pearson, and has been a pain in Liverpool\u2019s derriere tonight. It came from a long throw on the left. Deeney allowed it to bounce through to Doucoure, who chested it down on the run and knocked the ball across the six-yard box. Sarr reacted quickest, getting in front of Robertson to poke the ball into the net. Watford take the lead! 53 min Liverpool have their first shot on target. Van Dijk slides an excellent pass down the inside-left channel to Robertson, whose shot is beaten away at the near post by Foster. 52 min Liverpool have attacked with greater urgency since half-time. 50 min As you were: the full-backs have returned to their usual positions. Bit weird. 49 min Salah\u2019s long-range shot is headed away by Kabasele. 47 min Liverpool have switched their full-backs at half-time, with Robertson on the right and Alexander-Arnold on the left. Very interesting. 46 min Sarr forces a save from Alisson in the first minute of the second half. Pereyra played a nice through ball to Sarr, who took the shot first time from the edge of the D. It was well struck but straight at Alisson, who pushed it over the bar. 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool were out early for the second half, which hints at a not inconsiderable brollocking from Jurgen Klopp. \u201cSorry if you\u2019ve been deluged with emails saying we (LFC) are missing Hendo,\u201d says Simon Breed. \u201cBut boy are we missing Hendo\u2019s drive and follow ups...\u201d Half-time reading Peep peep! No goals, and no shots on target until that Deeney opportunity a moment ago. A sluggish Liverpool haven\u2019t really troubled a resilient Watford defence, and the only other incident of note was a nasty-looking knee injury to Gerard Deulofeu. See you in 15 minutes for the second half. 45+5 min Deeney was being wrestled by Lovren in the penalty area just before that chance, but Michael Oliver and VAR weren\u2019t interested. That could easily have been given. 45+5 min Deeney misses an excellent chance! Alisson dropped a bouncing ball at the feet of Deeney, who turned and chipped towards goal. Alisson recovered to save, and Deeney\u2019s follow-up was shepherded wide by van Dijk. 45 min Five added minutes because of the Deulofeu injury. 44 min Wijnaldum reacts aggressively after a foul from Hughes. It looked a bit of a snide one from Hughes, so you can understand why Wijnaldum was so hacked off. 43 min After a confident run, Sarr shoots high over from the edge of the box. 43 min \u201cA grim XI there, Millings,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cPresumably, Troy \u2018Dead\u2019 Parrott was left out on account of the fact that he may not actually exist beyond the fevered imagination of Spurs fans and journalists.\u201d 42 min Deeney is lucky not to be booked for a late tackle on Alexander-Arnold. 41 min This performance isn\u2019t going to do much for Liverpool\u2019s xG. 38 min \u201cI think Liverpool are running on fumes at the moment,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201c They know they\u2019ve won the league so in the players\u2019 minds there is less mental urgency than was there earlier in the season. They\u2019ve come close to defeat recently against teams in the relegation battle or mid-table and seemed to find it very hard to raise their game after the winter break in the CL against Atletico. I think neutral and Liverpool fans are hoping they can eclipse the Invincibles and stay unbeaten the whole season, but they could just get unlucky.\u201d 37 min Deulofeu is finally stretchered off, with Pereyra replacing him. 34 min Roberto Pereyra is getting ready to replace Deulofeu, who is going to be stretchered off. The poor bloke is in all sorts of distress. 32 min Deulofeu is down, holding his knee, after being eased to the floor by van Dijk. No foul was given, but Michael Oliver stopped play when he realised that Deulofeu was in a lot of pain. His foot got stuck as he fell and he twisted his knee. This doesn\u2019t look good. 29 min Wijnaldum, facing his own goal, hacks the ball clear under pressure from Doucoure. Watford continue to make life difficult for Liverpool, which will make their eventual defeat all the more frustrating. 27 min \u201cIs it just me or does Klopp overplay his front three?\u201d says Zafar Sobhan. \u201cHe does such a good job of rotating elsewhere; his overuse of his forward line is baffling to me. It won\u2019t matter this year - except maybe in Europe - but in past years they have been susceptible to injury and fatigue in the run in.\u201d I used to think that as well, but it doesn\u2019t seem to do much harm. They seem immune to fatigue. 24 min Nothing much to report. Watford have done pretty well so far, and have certainly had the better opportunities. 20 min A Liverpool corner is half-cleared to Oxlade-Chamberlain. He lifts a speculative pass over the outrushing defence that eventually reaches Salah, and he spanks a right-footed half-volley into the side netting. It was a pretty difficult chance. 18 min Lovren hammers a brilliant crossfield pass to Robertson, who tries to run Sarr inside the area and is doggedly dispossessed. 18 min Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s pass towards Robertson goes straight out of play. Liverpool are not on their game, at least not yet. 16 min Nothing happens from the corner. 15 min Deulofeu plays a one-two with Deeney and picks out an excellent cutback to Doucoure, whose first-time shot is blocked almost disdainfully by van Dijk. Corner to Watford. 14 min Watford are playing like the away side, allowing Liverpool to have the ball and then springing forward in numbers when they win it. Liverpool\u2019s passing has been a bit slow by their standards. 12 min \u201cI take it Mac Millings\u2019 Death XI play their home matches at Croak Park?\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no room in the squad for Virgil Van Dijd, Jordan Enderson, and No Mo\u2019 Salah?\u201d Well this is cheery. No Mo! 11 min Wijnaldum is this close to being robbed by Hughes in his own area. Watford are a threat going forward. 10 min A much better effort from Deulofeu. He runs at Alexander-Arnold on the edge of the box, cuts inside and whips a curling shot towards the far corner that goes just over the bar. I\u2019m not sure Alisson had that one covered. 8 min \u201cSitting in theology seminar reading MBM, hoping not to be caught,\u201d writes YOU THERE I KNOW YOU\u2019RE READING THE MBM ARE MY SEMINARS THAT BLOODY BORING. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Reds need a prayer from me to spank Watford, god bless their yellow hearts. Onward Liverpool!!\u201d I think this will be a tough game for Liverpool, and they\u2019ll win 3-1. 7 min Liverpool enjoy an extended spell of possession. Eventually Alexander-Arnold lofts an excellent pass to Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right side of the box. He is held up but returns the ball to Alexander-Arnold, whose cross goes out of play. I think he was pushed but nothing was given. 5 min Deulofeu cuts infield from the left and hit a low shot that goes a few yards wide of the near post. Alisson had it covered. 4 min A quiet start. Has Jurgen Klopp taken Liverpool as far as he can? 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool kick off from left to right as I watch. They are in red; Watford are sporting yellow. The players emerge from the tunnel on a chilly evening in Watford. Let\u2019s watch some football. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bore you with my whole train of thought,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cBut I was going to do a Leap Year XI, and then the afternoon results came in, and Watford are playing Liverpool, and I ended up doing a Death one instead. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine, and everything is going to be fine: Pepe Reinacarnation Johnny Heavens Cemeterry Butcher Robert Huthanasia Gunnar Valhalle Death Johnson Johnny Met God Djibril Deciss\u00e9 St. Peter Crouch Purgatore Andr\u00e9 Flo Luis Boa Mortality. Johnny Met God. Yeah, I like that. If Liverpool win tonight, they will set a new record for consecutive victories in the top flight: 19. Pre-match reading Watford (4-2-3-1) Foster; Kiko Femenia, Kabasele, Cathcart, Masina; Hughes, Capoue; Sarr, Doucoure, Deulofeu; Deeney. Substitutes: Gomes, Dawson, Chalobah, Pussetto, Pereyra, Welbeck, Gray. Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Adrian, Matip, Hoever, Lallana, Jones, Minamino, Origi. Referee Michael Oliver. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Watford v Liverpool from Vicarage Road. Even allowing for the received wisdom that football is a funny old game, it would be seriously bizarre if Liverpool were denied their first title for 30 years because of a pandemic. If the coronavirus does not end the season early, Liverpool need 12 points from their last 11 games to clinch their first Premier League title. They could still do it at Everton on 16 March, the third of those 11 games, should Manchester City drop points in the meantime. For the time being, their focus is on beating Watford and extending their lead to 25 points. Yawn, meh, 25 points. Hang on, 25 points?! I\u2019m not sure Liverpool are getting enough credit. You might not like them, you might think the Premier League is a bit naff, you might be sick of the sight of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s teeth, but come on: they\u2019ve won 35 of their last 36 league games FFS! That has never happened before in Europe\u2019s biggest leagues. In fact, their record this season - P27 W26 D1 L0 - belongs in Sunday League football. There is one difference. A team with 26 wins from 27 in Sunday League football would have a goal difference of around +200. Liverpool\u2019s is a mere +47, and 13 of their 26 victories this season have been by a single goal \u2013 many of them requiring late winners. That might be the reason for the slightly muted response to win after win after win; it feels like Manchester City received more effusive praise two years ago when they regularly thumped teams by four or five. I also think there\u2019s an element of everyone - even Liverpool fans - struggling to get their head around such unprecedented threepointery. Or maybe the world is full of Expected Goals disciples. Liverpool are second in the xG table, although an Expected Win tonight will move them within two Expected Points of Manchester City. I\u2019d argue that Liverpool having to work so hard for many wius actually enhances rather than diminishes their achievement. The soundbites may be cheesy but they\u2019re also true: Liverpool are mentality monsters, the toughest in English football for a long while. Watford played well in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield in December, so you never know what might happen tonight. But 106 points from the last 108 available should give you a pretty good idea. Kick off is at 5.30pm.",

      "bodyText": "The news that Boris Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, is pregnant has been Westminster\u2019s worst kept secret for some weeks. Symonds had not been seen in public since election night. The pair then took a highly private 12-day break on the Caribbean island of Mustique just after Christmas, and subsequently disappeared together to Chequers for another 10-day break at half term. As speculation grew among MPs and political commentators, the rumours of Symonds\u2019s pregnancy began to emerge publicly on the Guido Fawkes blog and from the PoliticalPics Twitter account of one of the photographers who works outside No 10. And now Johnson has confirmed the news through a brief statement saying the couple are engaged and their baby is expected in early summer. The congratulations poured in but the announcement comes at a particularly tricky time for Johnson\u2019s government as it feels the heat over its handling of coronavirus, with its home secretary at war with her top civil servant, and flooding devastating parts of England. Having spent so much time away from Downing Street in recent weeks, Johnson has been accused by the opposition of being a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d whose mind is not focused on the job. Johnson has fought back against that charge, saying he runs a cabinet with other ministers more than capable of leading responses to big events in their portfolios, such as the flooding. However, there have been growing rumblings among Johnson\u2019s Tory colleagues that they feel he has been distracted in recent weeks and would like to see him more visibly engaged with running the country. Any developments in Johnson\u2019s private life also carry something of a risk for the prime minister. Inevitably, it turns attention on to his chequered history of relationships, and repeated refusal to say how many children he has. The prime minister\u2019s divorce from his second wife, Marina Wheeler, is not yet finalised, and his third marriage to Symonds will be the first wedding of a sitting prime minister in 200 years. Yet some of Johnson\u2019s supporters believe the news of a new arrival in Downing Street could provide a \u201cbaby bounce\u201d of good cheer for the country \u2013 at a time of uncertainty and anxiety over coronavirus in particular. And in the short term at least, the announcement will have the effect \u2013 intended or not \u2013 of taking up column inches in the Sunday newspapers that might otherwise be devoted to the government\u2019s difficulties.",

Just how irrelevant spending is can be seen by the fact that spending in 2010-11 was lower than it was last year, and yet last year there was a balanced budget, while in 2010-11 the deficit was 3.4% of GDP. So let us stop pretending a budget surplus is about management. At the fringes it might be, but mostly Australian governments are hostage to events \u2013 which the Morrison government has now discovered to their detriment. Their much-boasted-about budget surplus looks to be gone. That Frydenberg and Morrison crowed they had delivered a surplus before actually doing so just means they are guilty of extreme levels of hubris rather than budget mismanagement. The real budget debate should be over the size of the deficit (or surplus). A budget deficit stimulates the economy; a budget surplus slows the economy down. Right now the big problem is not the lack of a budget surplus but the fact our economy was already struggling even before the coronavirus showed up. A budget deficit right now would allow for a strong fiscal response to help counter the impact of the virus. But Scott Morrison said this week: \u201cI can assure taxpayers \u2026 that we\u2019re not a government that engages in extreme fiscal responses.\u201d Why not? Does he believe a situation where our tourism, education and mining sectors are being hit by a possible worldwide pandemic is not extreme enough? Data this week showed that even before the impact of the coronavirus, construction and investment was falling across the economy. The annual growth of both total and full-time employment is now the slowest it has been since 2017. And the underutilisation rate of workers has risen from 13.0% in February last year to 13.9% \u2013 the fastest jump for three years. The economy is limping and the coronavirus is in danger of turning the limp into a break. By Thursday the prime minister was talking of \u201ctargeted, modest and scalable\u201d stimulus, though with no actual explanation of what that might involve other than \u201clooking ahead over the next few months\u201d. Alas, previous economic downturns have shown that \u201cthe next few months\u201d will likely be too late. The past 35 years show us that whether a government delivers a surplus is due mostly to luck and good revenue; not management. Real economic management is not about worrying about whether the budget is in surplus but what you do while the economy slows and looks in danger of grinding to a halt.

      "bodyText": "Kabay Tamu slows his dusty white ute to walking speed on the dirt road that runs along the south-western shoreline of Warraber, a tiny coral cay in the Torres Strait that is home to about 250 people. \u201cThis was the best spot for a day out,\u201d 28-year-old Tamu says, recalling his childhood. Most of the beach where Tamu used to play is gone, along with several enormous wongai trees that were a barrier of sorts, protecting the dirt road and the nearby dam, which supplies the island\u2019s drinking water, from the sea. Warraber is just 1.4km long, and half as wide, but shrinking fast. Some data suggests that sea levels in the Torres Strait could be rising at twice the global rate. Now, Islanders dump their green waste to hold back the rising sea. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that by 2100 tides will rise 30\u201360cm with immediate cuts to carbon emissions, and 61-110cm without. A 2010 report by researchers from James Cook University found that \u201ccontinued erosion may necessitate further action in the medium-term\u201d to protect Warraber\u2019s dam. If saltwater breaches it, life would be difficult to maintain. \u201cBeing removed, forcibly removed, from here, just because of rising sea levels and the effect of climate change, and becoming climate change refugees, it\u2019s just something that really haunts my mind,\u201d Tamu says. He pulls his ute up on the north-eastern side of the island, where the cemetery and church are protected by a haphazard, failing defence made up of rocks, coral, split sandbags and tyres. Warraber man Danny Billy is worried that the waves will soon inundate his parents\u2019 graves. He says he cannot bear the thought of leaving his ancestors behind. \u201cIt\u2019s our right to be here, to have a voice, to be recognised, and to make others realise this is our home \u2026 We have the right to live a healthy life, here, on our island.\u201d The Billy family also live on nearby Poruma island, where Danny spent part of his childhood. Just a 15-minute flight away, Poruma is smaller and thinner. On the western shore, a road and buildings are threatened, and 250 coconut trees \u2013 a source of food, shelter and leaves used in traditional ceremonies \u2013 have already been washed away. Local man Phillemon Mosby feels that loss keenly. The picturesque plantation should be a place to share with children and grandchildren, who would ordinarily take over the nurturing of the site. \u201cThat experience was taken away because of climate change, because of the rising sea levels. We\u2019ve seen areas where we used to go fishing that are no longer there. We\u2019ve seen rocks where people used to go diving that are covered.\u201d Community elder Uncle Frank Fauid says being denied the opportunity to walk, garden and fish in peace on homelands would be devastating. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave our community and go live down south. The living system \u2026 is totally not the way we live up here.\u201d Tamu, Billy and Uncle Frank\u2019s cousin, Nazareth Fauid, are among the eight Torres Strait Islanders who lodged a complaint with the United Nations human rights committee last May against the Australian government, alleging that its failure to reduce emissions or pursue proper adaptation measures across the region impedes their human rights to culture and life.

They both remember the Wild Turkey in Chatswood as a grungy sort of place with shavings on the floor. He was working and she\u2019d just started university.

You\u2019ve got girlfriends at the bar and you\u2019d be chatting to someone on the dance floor but you\u2019d be pashing and dashing and keen to get back to your friends.\u201d</p> <p>They exchanged numbers and began dating. Jaclyn still wasn\u2019t taking it too seriously but David was keen. They both remember a night when she suggested a break and he was not having it. \u201cI liked him, but I was not interested in anything long term [and] I remember him saying: \u2018No. We\u2019re a good thing; this is too good.\u2019 So David did recognise that early on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9ecafcd8dfb54c6c260d562e0d2288bcf20009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9ecafcd8dfb54c6c260d562e0d2288bcf20009/0_138_1849_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David and Jaclyn Kalcher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David and Jaclyn Kalcher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Jaclyn Kalcher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For David, their connection was effortless and undeniable. The young couple would spend hours together, talking on the phone or hanging out. He was quickly absorbed into her family life, with her father happy to have a young man to help out. \u201cI remember he\u2019d always say: \u2018Well if David\u2019s going to come up, just tell him to come up a few hours beforehand,\u2019 \u201d says Jaclyn. \u201cThen David would be outside in the backyard doing hours of landscaping. [It got] to the point we\u2019d all be sitting down for lunch and my boyfriend is moving rubble and digging.\u201d</p> <p>Despite all his hard work, her dad was still strict and forbade them from spending time alone in her bedroom together. Still David persisted, determined to win him over: \u201cIt was like a challenge and it just made it more worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>David\u2019s family also adored Jaclyn, although his mother was protective of her son. As a mother of two young boys, this is something Jaclyn understands now: \u201cThere is that saying you lose your sons to their partners and to their partners\u2019 families. I probably wasn\u2019t as sensitive to that with my mother-in-law, and because David was just so willing to come along and do what I wanted to do and be where I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/23/how-we-stay-together-we-debate-absolutely-everything-but-we-fight-fair\">How we stay together: we debate absolutely everything \u2013 but we fight fair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After dating for about seven years they got engaged and then married five months later. Jaclyn was 24 and for her it wasn\u2019t an obvious decision. But it was an easy one. \u201cFor me it wasn\u2019t a decision about wanting to get married, it was a decision that I knew that we were going to be together forever,\u201d she says. \u201cOur lives have always felt like that \u2013 they have had a nice rhythm and that things have naturally happened when they have meant to happen.\u201d</p> <p>David saw it as the next logical step: \u201cI absolutely adore Jaclyn.

But over the years they\u2019ve learned to adapt. <em>\u201c</em>[David likes to] have set those future goals, particularly when it comes to finances or career goals. I now recognise that in David, and I do adopt some of those behaviour patterns myself. And likewise, David with some more spontaneity and living in the moment.\u201d</p> <p>After they\u2019d renovated a house together, Jaclyn fell pregnant with twin boys. This changed things for the couple. \u201cHaving the boys probably were some of the toughest times,\u201d says Jaclyn<strong>. </strong>She was 28 and felt very isolated. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shift going from being a 20-something corporate high-flying girl to being at home with twin babies.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the first of our group to get married,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were certainly the first of our group of friends to have children. I didn\u2019t know anyone else with one baby, let alone twin babies.\u201d</p> <p>When she went back to work after a year of family leave things came to a head: \u201cThat was when I really suffered with depression and anxiety. If I think of the hardest time of our lives, that would\u2019ve been it. I don\u2019t remember there being a lot of financial pressure to go back to work, but really feeling a societal pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Family life was demanding, work was demanding and it became too much: \u201cI was back for a year before I literally landed in a heap and just said: \u2018This is not what I signed up for.

It just came to me when she said that. I went right, that was scary, and it became a focus. What can we do to make sure Jacs is OK?\u201d</p> <p>Jaclyn says it was difficult for her to admit she wasn\u2019t coping, particularly to her husband who she felt had always seen her as confident and capable. She also felt embarrassed and ashamed that she\u2019d quit her job.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go back to work for four years, a very long time.

      "bodyText": "Names: Jaclyn and David Kalcher Years together: 25 Occupations: HR consultant and general manager Their friends jokingly refer to Jaclyn and David Kalcher as the couple who forgot to break up. \u201cEveryone\u2019s had the six months relationship or they\u2019d moved on to another boyfriend,\u201d says Jaclyn. \u201cDavid and I were always there and always together.\u201d The Sydney couple were 17 and 19 when they met at a local bar. They both remember the Wild Turkey in Chatswood as a grungy sort of place with shavings on the floor. He was working and she\u2019d just started university. Initially he tried to chat up her friend, who instead pointed him in Jaclyn\u2019s direction telling him he might have better luck with her. For Jaclyn it was all a bit of a laugh: \u201cIt was back in the days of pash and dash. You\u2019ve got girlfriends at the bar and you\u2019d be chatting to someone on the dance floor but you\u2019d be pashing and dashing and keen to get back to your friends.\u201d They exchanged numbers and began dating. Jaclyn still wasn\u2019t taking it too seriously but David was keen. They both remember a night when she suggested a break and he was not having it. \u201cI liked him, but I was not interested in anything long term [and] I remember him saying: \u2018No. We\u2019re a good thing; this is too good.\u2019 So David did recognise that early on.\u201d For David, their connection was effortless and undeniable. The young couple would spend hours together, talking on the phone or hanging out. He was quickly absorbed into her family life, with her father happy to have a young man to help out. \u201cI remember he\u2019d always say: \u2018Well if David\u2019s going to come up, just tell him to come up a few hours beforehand,\u2019 \u201d says Jaclyn. \u201cThen David would be outside in the backyard doing hours of landscaping. [It got] to the point we\u2019d all be sitting down for lunch and my boyfriend is moving rubble and digging.\u201d Despite all his hard work, her dad was still strict and forbade them from spending time alone in her bedroom together. Still David persisted, determined to win him over: \u201cIt was like a challenge and it just made it more worthwhile.\u201d David\u2019s family also adored Jaclyn, although his mother was protective of her son. As a mother of two young boys, this is something Jaclyn understands now: \u201cThere is that saying you lose your sons to their partners and to their partners\u2019 families. I probably wasn\u2019t as sensitive to that with my mother-in-law, and because David was just so willing to come along and do what I wanted to do and be where I wanted to be.\u201d After dating for about seven years they got engaged and then married five months later. Jaclyn was 24 and for her it wasn\u2019t an obvious decision. But it was an easy one. \u201cFor me it wasn\u2019t a decision about wanting to get married, it was a decision that I knew that we were going to be together forever,\u201d she says. \u201cOur lives have always felt like that \u2013 they have had a nice rhythm and that things have naturally happened when they have meant to happen.\u201d David saw it as the next logical step: \u201cI absolutely adore Jaclyn. I loved her with all my heart [and] I wanted to start a family so [I was] a bit of a traditionalist in that sense.\u201d This is one of the couple\u2019s natural differences: she\u2019s spontaneous, he\u2019s a planner. But over the years they\u2019ve learned to adapt. \u201c[David likes to] have set those future goals, particularly when it comes to finances or career goals. I now recognise that in David, and I do adopt some of those behaviour patterns myself. And likewise, David with some more spontaneity and living in the moment.\u201d After they\u2019d renovated a house together, Jaclyn fell pregnant with twin boys. This changed things for the couple. \u201cHaving the boys probably were some of the toughest times,\u201d says Jaclyn. She was 28 and felt very isolated. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shift going from being a 20-something corporate high-flying girl to being at home with twin babies. \u201cWe were the first of our group to get married,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were certainly the first of our group of friends to have children. I didn\u2019t know anyone else with one baby, let alone twin babies.\u201d When she went back to work after a year of family leave things came to a head: \u201cThat was when I really suffered with depression and anxiety. If I think of the hardest time of our lives, that would\u2019ve been it. I don\u2019t remember there being a lot of financial pressure to go back to work, but really feeling a societal pressure.\u201d Family life was demanding, work was demanding and it became too much: \u201cI was back for a year before I literally landed in a heap and just said: \u2018This is not what I signed up for. I hate myself, I hate my life.\u2019 \u201d David was very worried: \u201cIt was very confronting \u2026 I remember being in bed and Jacs just told me how she was really feeling, and I just couldn\u2019t believe what was being said.\u201d Once he realised, he was determined to fix it: \u201cIt [had] all landed on Jacs to be the one to do drop-offs and pick-ups and then cook. It just came to me when she said that. I went right, that was scary, and it became a focus. What can we do to make sure Jacs is OK?\u201d Jaclyn says it was difficult for her to admit she wasn\u2019t coping, particularly to her husband who she felt had always seen her as confident and capable. She also felt embarrassed and ashamed that she\u2019d quit her job. \u201cI didn\u2019t go back to work for four years, a very long time. I wasn\u2019t unwell for four years, but I was unwell for a significant period of time, but then the shame, embarrassment and fear of what had happened, how I had walked out of a job and fallen in a heap.\u201d When the time came, she admits she was scared about going back. \u201cI was really fearful of getting myself back into a situation where things were going to be untenable, where I was going to find myself back into a depressive state.\u201d Luckily that didn\u2019t happen, and they both say they learned from the situation. Now they make sure to check in with each other, reserving Friday nights as their fun night together. \u201cJacs and I have a few drinks and have a lovely dinner together and we always just have made sure that we keep a watch on each other. And the kids benefit because they\u2019ve got two loving parents who are still together and are still there.\u201d Although they rarely have big arguments, they are quick to acknowledge and apologise if there are missteps. \u201cHaving children in our house makes me really conscious,\u201d says Jaclyn. \u201cI want to demonstrate how adults can communicate through turbulence or through difficulty and demonstrating some of those relationship behaviours is really important as part of parenting. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m really proud of my marriage and when you are proud of something, you actually want to take care of it. It is a living and breathing thing. It changes and morphs, but it is very special.\u201d Their commitment to each other has never faltered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see my life without her, so to me that\u2019s my commitment,\u201d says David. \u201cI absolutely adore her. She\u2019s my world and without her life would really suck, to be honest. So I\u2019ll do everything and anything to make sure that, that stays.\u201d Jaclyn agrees, saying commitment has never been difficult because at the heart of it all they have a strong friendship. They both laughingly demur when asked for the secret to their enduring relationship. \u201cThe funny thing is, no one could ever ask us for relationship advice, and I think that\u2019s because whilst we do have a good relationship, we\u2019ve only ever been with each other,\u201d Jaclyn says. But she does have one thought: \u201cIf I was to give anyone relationship advice, it would be choose a partner that you actually like.

Seti\u00e9n and Sarabia flew back the next afternoon, armed with additional insight on their opponents.</p> <p>There is much to analyse, not least what has happened to Madrid over the last month. They have won one of their last five games. They were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/real-madrid-sociedad-copa-del-rey-match-report\" title=\"\">knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Real Sociedad</a>, conceding four at the Bernab\u00e9u, while a draw against Celta and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/levante-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\" title=\"\">defeat at Levante</a> last weekend produced a five-point swing in seven days and let Barcelona go two points clear. After defeat at Levante Zinedine Zidane said: \u201cOur season is at stake this week\u201d \u2013 first City, then Barcelona. It was a time for <em>\u201ct\u00edos\u201d</em>, Sergio Ramos said: blokes, real men.

With Seti\u00e9n watching, City beat them, the first part of the season at stake slipping away. Guardiola, whistled throughout, won at the Bernab\u00e9u for the sixth time. And now comes Messi. \u201cIf football was a religion, Messi would be our God,\u201d Martin Braithwaite, the emergency signing from Legan\u00e9s, said. For Madrid the Argentinian is the antichrist, the player who has done them more damage than anyone else ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d91ed0cab30005fb3a810409cd94bcc0b180545b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d91ed0cab30005fb3a810409cd94bcc0b180545b/20_123_3480_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karim Benzema and Real Madrid have been struggling for goals of late.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karim Benzema and Real Madrid have been struggling for goals of late.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leanardo Prieto/Action Plus/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a time such as this, too. The memory of this time last season already lingered; now it is on their minds even more. A year ago Madrid lost it all in eight Bernab\u00e9u days, their season over three months early: knocked out of the cup by Barcelona and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/05/real-madrid-ajax-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Champions League by Ajax</a>, they lost the <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> 1-0, extinguishing any hope in the league. It was a significant exaggeration when <em>Marca</em> called memories of that a \u201cpsychosis\u201d on Monday; it was less of one by Thursday.</p> <p>The solidity and reliability that had defined Madrid, unbeaten in 15 league games until going to Levante, gave way to a vulnerability that is even more of a problem considering how few goals they are scoring: Karim Benzema has two in 13 games, Gareth Bale has three in 25, Luka Jovic two in 23, Vin\u00edcius three in 37. Eden Hazard, injured against Levante, will miss two months. On the same day Messi scored four and Barcelona fans discovered that Braithwaite might be useful after all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/27/there-is-something-shifting-at-real-madrid-some-sense-of-vulnerability\">There is something shifting at Real Madrid, some sense of vulnerability | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barcelona have scored 16 goals more in the league alone. The Bernab\u00e9u, where Jorge Valdano said opponents routinely suffered \u201cstrange fright\u201d, is now a place where Ramos admits \u201cthe lack of tranquillity the fans have reaches players too\u201d. Madrid have won only nine of 17 home games this season.</p> <p>Nor is it only this season. Barcelona have won their last four league visits, eight of their last 11 trips in all competitions. That run includes a 6-2, a 2-0, a 3-0, a 3-1 and a 4-0. Add another defeat and Madrid would be five points behind, plus the head-to-head record, with 12 games to go. As for Seti\u00e9n, this may be his first <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> but he has been to the Bernab\u00e9u three times and not lost, winning his last two visits with Betis.</p> <p>All of this is being remembered now, thrown into the mental mix. Barcelona are presented with an opportunity to deliver a potentially decisive blow. Madrid are presented with an obligation, <em>Marca</em> calling this is a <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> \u201cwith no safety net\u201d. Madrid cannot lose, just as they could not lose on Wednesday. \u201cAfter a hard night I see two options: we can think about yesterday\u2019s defeat or work towards tomorrow\u2019s victory,\u201d Ramos wrote on social media. \u201cI chose the latter. Head and heart immersed in the <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> as of now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhite panic,\u201d cheered the cover of <em>El Mundo Deportivo</em>. \u201cPanic at the white house,\u201d declared <em>Sport</em>, gleefully. Pride before a fall is a lesson they stubbornly refuse to learn and that euphoria had not been there the day before. City\u2019s win brought a wave of optimism not provided by Barcelona\u2019s own performance, a 1-1 draw at Napoli. The leaders, too, have their problems, more even than their rivals. It is not as if they are reliable, still adapting to new methods having sacked a coach mid\u2011season for the first time in 17 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/25/napoli-barcelona-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\">Griezmann rescues Barcelona after Mertens levels Napoli scoring record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are old teams \u2013 a dozen over-30s between them \u2013 and at Barcelona the division between board and squad runs deep, the institutional crisis, too. \u201cThe team has propped up the club,\u201d Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said. Doing so now is harder than ever. Piqu\u00e9 will play despite an ankle problem but Jordi Alba, Sergi Roberto, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 are out, leaving Barcelona with 16 first-team footballers; in the second leg against Napoli, it will be 13. \u201cThat\u2019s the planning, unfortunately,\u201d Sergio Busquets said, pointedly.</p> <p>Messi admitted that at the moment Barcelona are not good enough to win the Champions League, where they have won two of their last 10 knockout games away. Wednesday posed the question of whether Madrid are either. For now the issue is more immediate: are they good enough to win the <em>cl\u00e1sico</em>? If \u201cgood\u201d is the word. This is supposed to be the greatest game there is but neither team seems to fit that bill now. On Thursday night two radio shows ran the same debate. Not: \u201cWho comes into the <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> in the better shape?\u201d but \u201cWho comes into the <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> in the worse shape?\u201d Sunday\u2019s meeting, Valdano suggested, is like a race between two injured men limping towards the finish line.</p>",

The memory of this time last season already lingered; now it is on their minds even more. A year ago Madrid lost it all in eight Bernab\u00e9u days, their season over three months early: knocked out of the cup by Barcelona and the Champions League by Ajax, they lost the cl\u00e1sico 1-0, extinguishing any hope in the league. It was a significant exaggeration when Marca called memories of that a \u201cpsychosis\u201d on Monday; it was less of one by Thursday. The solidity and reliability that had defined Madrid, unbeaten in 15 league games until going to Levante, gave way to a vulnerability that is even more of a problem considering how few goals they are scoring: Karim Benzema has two in 13 games, Gareth Bale has three in 25, Luka Jovic two in 23, Vin\u00edcius three in 37. Eden Hazard, injured against Levante, will miss two months. On the same day Messi scored four and Barcelona fans discovered that Braithwaite might be useful after all. Barcelona have scored 16 goals more in the league alone. The Bernab\u00e9u, where Jorge Valdano said opponents routinely suffered \u201cstrange fright\u201d, is now a place where Ramos admits \u201cthe lack of tranquillity the fans have reaches players too\u201d. Madrid have won only nine of 17 home games this season. Nor is it only this season. Barcelona have won their last four league visits, eight of their last 11 trips in all competitions. That run includes a 6-2, a 2-0, a 3-0, a 3-1 and a 4-0. Add another defeat and Madrid would be five points behind, plus the head-to-head record, with 12 games to go. As for Seti\u00e9n, this may be his first cl\u00e1sico but he has been to the Bernab\u00e9u three times and not lost, winning his last two visits with Betis. All of this is being remembered now, thrown into the mental mix. Barcelona are presented with an opportunity to deliver a potentially decisive blow. Madrid are presented with an obligation, Marca calling this is a cl\u00e1sico \u201cwith no safety net\u201d. Madrid cannot lose, just as they could not lose on Wednesday. \u201cAfter a hard night I see two options: we can think about yesterday\u2019s defeat or work towards tomorrow\u2019s victory,\u201d Ramos wrote on social media. \u201cI chose the latter. Head and heart immersed in the cl\u00e1sico as of now.\u201d \u201cWhite panic,\u201d cheered the cover of El Mundo Deportivo. \u201cPanic at the white house,\u201d declared Sport, gleefully. Pride before a fall is a lesson they stubbornly refuse to learn and that euphoria had not been there the day before. City\u2019s win brought a wave of optimism not provided by Barcelona\u2019s own performance, a 1-1 draw at Napoli. The leaders, too, have their problems, more even than their rivals. It is not as if they are reliable, still adapting to new methods having sacked a coach mid\u2011season for the first time in 17 years. These are old teams \u2013 a dozen over-30s between them \u2013 and at Barcelona the division between board and squad runs deep, the institutional crisis, too. \u201cThe team has propped up the club,\u201d Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said. Doing so now is harder than ever. Piqu\u00e9 will play despite an ankle problem but Jordi Alba, Sergi Roberto, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 are out, leaving Barcelona with 16 first-team footballers; in the second leg against Napoli, it will be 13. \u201cThat\u2019s the planning, unfortunately,\u201d Sergio Busquets said, pointedly. Messi admitted that at the moment Barcelona are not good enough to win the Champions League, where they have won two of their last 10 knockout games away. Wednesday posed the question of whether Madrid are either. For now the issue is more immediate: are they good enough to win the cl\u00e1sico? If \u201cgood\u201d is the word. This is supposed to be the greatest game there is but neither team seems to fit that bill now. On Thursday night two radio shows ran the same debate. Not: \u201cWho comes into the cl\u00e1sico in the better shape?\u201d but \u201cWho comes into the cl\u00e1sico in the worse shape?\u201d Sunday\u2019s meeting, Valdano suggested, is like a race between two injured men limping towards the finish line.",

      "bodyText": "It was the call Lyndsay Chapple had dreaded. The call that left him racked with nerves. The call he\u2019d been crossing his fingers would never come. The federal agent on the other end of the line was investigating serious allegations of foreign bribery against multinational consulting giant Sinclair Knight Merz, one of the Australian government\u2019s biggest foreign aid contractors. His call wasn\u2019t \u201centirely\u201d unanticipated, Chapple told a preliminary hearing in the NSW local court this week. Chapple, an experienced engineer, had spent 23 years with the company, which consulted on major overseas development projects across south-east Asia and the world. Police were investigating allegations that SKM paid and covered up bribes in the Philippines and Vietnam for a decade, the court heard, using a complex system of secret payments and third parties to move money to foreign officials for work on aid projects funded by the World Bank. Chapple told the court he was in a tightly held \u201ccircle of knowledge\u201d within SKM. A select few who could read the company\u2019s invoices and internal spreadsheets and understand what terms such as \u201cmarketing\u201d fees might be hiding from prying eyes. When Sgt Ray Holder called in 2013, it was too much for Chapple to process. \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t believe you. I believe this is a practical joke. Give me your number and I\u2019ll call you back,\u2019 \u201d Chapple told the court. Many within the company thought SKM would escape prosecution, the court heard. \u201cMy second great point of embarrassment was that I had heard from many people that since SKM self-reported and instituted many processes and policies to prevent it from happening ever again, I was under impression it was not going to be investigated,\u201d Chapple told the court. Chapple said as much to the sergeant. Holder was laughing on the other end of the phone, Chapple said. There was \u201cgreat mirth\u201d from the officer, the court heard. \u201cHe said: \u2018If I knew you robbed a bank, just because you came in and told me you robbed a bank, that wouldn\u2019t stop [an investigation],\u2019 \u201d Chapple told the court. The SKM case was in the NSW local court this week for a preliminary hearing to test the way Chapple, a prosecution witness, and another SKM employee interacted with police and came to make their statements. It is the first time any of the witnesses to the alleged foreign bribery case against SKM have given evidence before court. Court documents allege the company offered bribes to Vietnamese officials between 2006 and November 2011 to secure work on four infrastructure projects, including in Thanh Hoa, Da Nang and the northern mountains. The company is alleged to have offered benefits of US$880,000. SKM is also alleged to have conspired to bribe officials on five projects in the Philippines between 2000 and mid-2005, including sewerage, river rehabilitation and air quality projects in Manila, and an urban services project on Mindanao. The firm is accused of offering benefits worth more than $6.5m Philippine pesos (about $200,000 at current rates) to \u201cunknown public officials\u201d from the Philippines working on the tender approval process for infrastructure projects. SKM and the Australian government Outside of court, the case has posed difficult questions for the Australian government. Before it was bought out by the Californian consulting giant Jacobs in 2013, SKM received a vast amount of taxpayers\u2019 money to work on Australian aid projects overseas. A Guardian analysis of public data suggests it won 83 contracts worth $489m through Australia\u2019s aid program between 2000 and 2014, largely for work on infrastructure-related aid projects, and advisory, consulting and service-oriented contracts, including for sanitation, energy and health care on Nauru. There is no suggestion taxpayer money was used in the alleged bribery. The criminal case against SKM Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre has struggled to accomodate the crowd of solicitors and barristers representing six co-accused. Those accused of involvement in a conspiracy to bribe officials include the company\u2019s former chief executive Paul Dougas and board member Paul Casamento, both of whom strongly deny the allegations. Much of the evidence has concerned the AFP\u2019s interactions with Chapple and another SKM employee, Adam Ward Carey. Neither Chapple nor Carey have been charged. The pair have been questioned about what police offered them to give evidence against their former employer and how their statements were prepared. Chapple remembers clearly he received no offer of indemnity in his first call with Holder, the police sergeant. \u201cThere was no offer or inference, sir. At the end of that call I was a nervous wreck,\u201d Chapple told the court. Not long afterwards, though, there was a second call. He was informed that police were after only the top brass at SKM. Chapple was too low on the food chain. \u201cI just remember the key line which meant I started breathing again after four hours,\u201d Chapple told the court. \u201cHe said: \u2018We\u2019re not interested in junior burgers, you junior people \u2026 We\u2019re only interested in people at the sort of board and CEO level, the more senior level.\u2019 \u201cI made a very complimentary response. I said: \u2018I can now get off the toilet.\u2019 I remember that very clearly.\u201d A hotly contested part of Chapple\u2019s evidence concerned the alleged involvement of Dougas in a conspiracy to bribe Philippine officials. Chapple told the court this week he remembered having conversations with Dougas in 2000, in which he understood the chief executive to be giving him the green light for bribery. Chapple alleges Dougas said words to the effect of: \u201cI understand that is the way we operate in Asia. You can do this as long as you do three things: first, keep it tight and keep the circle of knowledge to an absolute minimum.\u201d Dougas allegedly told Chapple the other two rules were to make the payments after the contract was finalised and to ensure it could not be audited later. Dougas through his barrister, Neil Brennan SC, strongly disputes those conversations took place. Chapple is unable to place the conversations in a country or give them specific dates, and they were all one-on-one discussions, the court heard. The hearing concluded on Friday but the case remains before the NSW local court.",

      "bodyText": "The two buildings sit side-by-side on Sydney\u2019s George Street, dwarfed by surrounding skyscrapers. They come properly into view from the opposite side of the street, in the shadow of the ornate Queen Victoria Building. Columns and archways adorn the two-storey facade on the left, while bay windows jut out elegantly beneath the fifth-floor balconies on the right. Pedestrians bustle along the retail strip below, most without ever looking up. One of these buildings is the Globe Theatre, a 106-year-old cinema hidden from the public eye for decades. The other is 97-year-old Dudley House. Both have been determined by the National Trust to be rare, \u201cirreplaceable\u201d elements of Sydney\u2019s architectural and cultural history. But they may soon be obliterated from the streetscape. Neither building has statutory heritage protection, and now a development application to extend the nearby QT Hotel proposes they be destroyed. \u2018The theatre to us was a mecca\u2019 The Globe Theatre is Sydney\u2019s only surviving Victorian Romanesque-style theatre. Constructed in 1914, its facade was designed by architect Clarence Backhouse to echo the QVB. It operated as a movie theatre until 1924 \u2013 notably running Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik for 26 weeks in 1922 \u2013 when it was taken over by music publishers J Albert and Son. In 1942 the cinema was renovated to become a live broadcast theatre for Australia\u2019s first 24-hour radio station, 2UW. A 110m aerial was erected on the roof, towering above much of the cityscape. Gold Coast radio announcer Russ Walkington\u2019s association with 2UW started in the late 1940s. \u201cDeluxe Radio Theatre was there every Sunday night and it was quite a thing to get tickets to be in the audience for those shows,\u201d he says. He was hired by 2UW in 1960 to work the popular \u201chappy, joke-telling, quickfire, toe-tapping\u201d Saturday morning children\u2019s variety show, the Coca-Cola Bottler\u2019s Club, broadcast weekly from the theatre in front of a live audience. \u201cWe\u2019d do shows in the theatre on the stage, children\u2019s talent quests,\u201d he says. \u201cEven the Sunday night hour-long dramas were all produced live in front of an audience.\u201d His former colleague Faye Inskip, 85, remembers those shows well. She was a voice actor in her teens, performing in radio dramas on the Globe stage. In the late 1950s, she started working in the 2UW record library, and coordinated the 50,000-strong fan club named for Walkington\u2019s alter ego, Gerald the Talking Grasshopper. \u201cThe children could write in and join the club,\u201d she says. \u201cOne time we had a picnic at Watson\u2019s Bay, Vaucluse. One year we decided to put on a Christmas pantomime [at the theatre] \u2026 and we auditioned the children from the Gerald the Grasshopper club.\u201d The pantomime ran over three weekends, with proceeds going to the Blind Society. The theatre was also used as a recording studio, notably for demos of 60s rock\u2019n\u2019roll juggernauts the Easybeats. John Diamond, 73, a one-time 2UW copyboy, remembers being sent there on errands and seeing Ted Albert and the band at work. \u201cTed would come down with the tapes and they\u2019d ask me to play them in the afternoon, and he\u2019d go round to Ray\u2019s office [Ray Bean, former 2UW program manager], big stereo speakers, and they\u2019d sit and listen,\u201d Diamond says. \u201cThen he\u2019d go back up to George Street and remix it.\u201d Walkington, now 84, says: \u201cThe theatre to us was a mecca; that\u2019s where great things happened. It was part of the entertainment scene of Sydney in those days. Radio people were not so mysterious because there were people in the audience watching them.\u201d \u2018These hidden gems are so hard to save\u2019 Dudley House was designed in 1923 by architects Burcham Clamp and MacKellar \u2013 the former a sometime business partner of Walter Burley Griffin.

It\u2019s tempting to forecast the future using simple cause and effect, assuming that the court of appeal ruling must now cause Heathrow and similar climate-busting projects to stop, thus accelerating Britain\u2019s transition to a carbon-free economy. But sadly, that\u2019s just one possible scenario. The effect of the ruling could be to expand smaller, regional airports.

A single cause can have any number of effects, some predictable but many unforeseen. Something can be generally certain \u2013 such as the law courts having to take the government\u2019s commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\" title=\"\">Paris accord</a> seriously \u2013 but specifically ambiguous: because no two projects are identical, all future judgments may not favour the environment.</p> <p>Minor differences in projects may result in widely varying outcomes. You can see the same difficulty with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/29/coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news-china-wuhan-stock-markets-update\" title=\"\">epidemics</a>. That they will keep happening is generally certain, but it is risky to extrapolate from one to the other because there is no profile of an epidemic. We don\u2019t know where or when the next epidemics will break out, or what diseases might cause them. They don\u2019t repeat themselves. Expecting to see the future through a simple unfolding of cause and effect is easy but risky.</p> <p>But simple cause-and-effect thinking has plagued forecasting since telling the future became big business at the end of the 19th century. One of the founding fathers of economic forecasting, Roger Babson, was adamant in his <a href=\"https://centennial.babson.edu/babson100/#newtonia\" title=\"\">Newtonian view</a> of the world. For him, every action had to be associated with an equal and opposite reaction. He not only assembled the largest collection of Newtoniana in North America, but based his entire economic theory on this premise, one of the first (but not the last) to believe he could develop laws of economics that had the same absolute certainty as the laws of physics.</p> <p>His view of cause and effect had a boost in 1929 when, as he had predicted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/04/useconomy\" title=\"\">Wall Street crashed</a>. This, Babson argued, was because periods of wasteful exuberance always produce the need for sensible self-discipline. But he had been forecasting a correction for the previous three years. And when, in May 1931, he announced the market had bottomed out and it was time to get back in, he was wrong: the US economy didn\u2019t recover for a decade.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Simple causes make memorable stories, but the sheer complexity of life militates against straightforward narratives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like most pundits, Babson was poor at reviewing his own forecasts; he continued to believe everything in life could be reduced to simple laws. As a young man, he was told he had <a href=\"https://www.babson.edu/about/news-events/babson-centennial/babsons-history/biography-of-roger-babson/\" title=\"\">contracted TB</a> \u2013 at the time, the single greatest cause of death in the western world. However shattering, the diagnosis was nonetheless ambiguous: it could mean a quick death or that the disease would lie latent for decades. Not a man to stand by and wait, Babson devised a health regimen that he was convinced would keep catastrophe at bay.</p> <p>He chose an office surrounded by windows, all of which he kept wide open, even throughout the brutal Massachusetts winters. He and his secretary wore mittens and hooded, floor-length wool cloaks as they worked, the secretary typing with wooden mallets and Babson wearing an electrically heated pad in his back. Was it these eccentricities that allowed Babson to live to 91? It\u2019s impossible to know. He might not even have had TB, since no accurate test was devised until years later.</p> <p>The same problem bedevils studies of leadership. It is fashionable to follow high-profile business leaders and draw from them lessons of success. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs\" title=\"\">Steve Jobs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/billgates\" title=\"\">Bill Gates</a> created huge, valuable companies \u2013 but how far was their success attributable to them as individuals, and how far the result of other factors: the thousands of people who worked for them, the short-sightedness of their competitors, the wealthy ecosystem they inherited, and a growing educated populace? It\u2019s impossible to do the experiment, Apple without Jobs, or Microsoft without Gates.</p> <p>Seeing individuals as single causes of complex success is an attribution error routinely made when analysing politicians too: did Churchill really win the Second World War, or were Hitler\u2019s unforced errors and the brute force of the Soviet Union more important?</p> <p>Simple causes make memorable stories, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re true. The sheer complexity of life militates against straightforward narratives and it can feel as though the sides have come off the billiard table, balls dropping off or arriving from anywhere. You don\u2019t know how many variables there are, where they may come from or which, if any, will matter. That\u2019s why, increasingly, efficiency gives way to robustness.</p> <p>When the stakes are high (as in epidemics) a bold response is safer than complacency. Which is why the campaigners celebrating last week\u2019s appeal court judgment will have to return to their fight if they want to increase their chances of environmental success.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Margaret Heffernan is the author of<em> </em>Uncharted: How To Map the Future Together</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Thursday, when climate activists spilled on to the road, singing \u201cWe\u2019ll take climate change seriously\u201d to the tune of My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean, they felt confident of a big victory. Heathrow\u2019s expansion had been declared illegal because it is incompatible with legislation committing the government to zero carbon emissions by 2050. The proposal, which would have brought 260,000 new flights a year to the airport, was dead and campaigners celebrated because similar schemes were now doomed. But are they? It\u2019s tempting to forecast the future using simple cause and effect, assuming that the court of appeal ruling must now cause Heathrow and similar climate-busting projects to stop, thus accelerating Britain\u2019s transition to a carbon-free economy. But sadly, that\u2019s just one possible scenario. The effect of the ruling could be to expand smaller, regional airports. Most Heathrow flights are for pleasure; determined travellers could pile into Luton, Stansted, Birmingham. More might decide to drive. Even though the government says it won\u2019t appeal, the transport minister, Grant Shapps, has also said, in principle, it does \u201cwant to see airport expansion\u201d. Heathrow will appeal against the decision. It could win. Nature could still lose. The future is uncertain because cause and effect are rarely simple. A single cause can have any number of effects, some predictable but many unforeseen. Something can be generally certain \u2013 such as the law courts having to take the government\u2019s commitment to the Paris accord seriously \u2013 but specifically ambiguous: because no two projects are identical, all future judgments may not favour the environment. Minor differences in projects may result in widely varying outcomes. You can see the same difficulty with epidemics. That they will keep happening is generally certain, but it is risky to extrapolate from one to the other because there is no profile of an epidemic. We don\u2019t know where or when the next epidemics will break out, or what diseases might cause them. They don\u2019t repeat themselves. Expecting to see the future through a simple unfolding of cause and effect is easy but risky. But simple cause-and-effect thinking has plagued forecasting since telling the future became big business at the end of the 19th century. One of the founding fathers of economic forecasting, Roger Babson, was adamant in his Newtonian view of the world. For him, every action had to be associated with an equal and opposite reaction. He not only assembled the largest collection of Newtoniana in North America, but based his entire economic theory on this premise, one of the first (but not the last) to believe he could develop laws of economics that had the same absolute certainty as the laws of physics. His view of cause and effect had a boost in 1929 when, as he had predicted, Wall Street crashed. This, Babson argued, was because periods of wasteful exuberance always produce the need for sensible self-discipline. But he had been forecasting a correction for the previous three years. And when, in May 1931, he announced the market had bottomed out and it was time to get back in, he was wrong: the US economy didn\u2019t recover for a decade. Like most pundits, Babson was poor at reviewing his own forecasts; he continued to believe everything in life could be reduced to simple laws. As a young man, he was told he had contracted TB \u2013 at the time, the single greatest cause of death in the western world. However shattering, the diagnosis was nonetheless ambiguous: it could mean a quick death or that the disease would lie latent for decades. Not a man to stand by and wait, Babson devised a health regimen that he was convinced would keep catastrophe at bay. He chose an office surrounded by windows, all of which he kept wide open, even throughout the brutal Massachusetts winters. He and his secretary wore mittens and hooded, floor-length wool cloaks as they worked, the secretary typing with wooden mallets and Babson wearing an electrically heated pad in his back. Was it these eccentricities that allowed Babson to live to 91? It\u2019s impossible to know. He might not even have had TB, since no accurate test was devised until years later. The same problem bedevils studies of leadership. It is fashionable to follow high-profile business leaders and draw from them lessons of success. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates created huge, valuable companies \u2013 but how far was their success attributable to them as individuals, and how far the result of other factors: the thousands of people who worked for them, the short-sightedness of their competitors, the wealthy ecosystem they inherited, and a growing educated populace? It\u2019s impossible to do the experiment, Apple without Jobs, or Microsoft without Gates. Seeing individuals as single causes of complex success is an attribution error routinely made when analysing politicians too: did Churchill really win the Second World War, or were Hitler\u2019s unforced errors and the brute force of the Soviet Union more important? Simple causes make memorable stories, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re true. The sheer complexity of life militates against straightforward narratives and it can feel as though the sides have come off the billiard table, balls dropping off or arriving from anywhere. You don\u2019t know how many variables there are, where they may come from or which, if any, will matter. That\u2019s why, increasingly, efficiency gives way to robustness. When the stakes are high (as in epidemics) a bold response is safer than complacency. Which is why the campaigners celebrating last week\u2019s appeal court judgment will have to return to their fight if they want to increase their chances of environmental success. \u2022 Margaret Heffernan is the author of Uncharted: How To Map the Future Together",

      "bodyText": "Anyone who thinks that protest will derail West Ham\u2019s efforts to stay in the Premier League should probably pipe down now. Far from affecting performances on the pitch, the atmosphere generated by the biggest demonstration yet against David Gold, David Sullivan and Karren Brady seemed to bring the best out of West Ham, who rose to the challenge by climbing out of the bottom three with this an emphatic victory. This was a rare good day for West Ham, who are up to 16th after their first league win since New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cSupport the team not the regime,\u201d was the message from Hammers United, the fan group organising the protests, and there was no sign of any toxicity inside the London Stadium. Although supporters voiced their disapproval with the board outside the ground, there was nothing but positivity once they were in their seats and the team responded in style. West Ham, who have played a game more than 19th-placed Aston Villa, can be confident of staying up if they maintain this level. There is quality in this team; weapons at David Moyes\u2019s disposal. He has options in attack and he put them to good use here, easing the pressure with a triumph built on the power of S\u00e9bastien Haller and Michail Antonio up front, Jarrod Bowen\u2019s first goal since his \u00a322m move from Hull in January and two neat assists from Pablo Fornals. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a great job,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cAll of them contributed. The crowd were great. The team also helps.\u201d The focus before kick-off was drawn to an estimated 3,000 supporters marching against Sullivan, Gold and Brady. It started in Plaistow, a short walk from where Upton Park once stood, and it was hard to find anyone with a good word to say about the people running this troubled club. There were GSB Out banners and T-shirts, there were GSB Out stickers pushed on to lamp posts and it was clear from the fiery speeches and the mutinous chants that supporters have completely lost faith with those at the top. There was humour, too. A Southampton fan emerged from Pudding Mill Lane station and asked if she was really supposed to be looking at a football ground. \u201cNo, it\u2019s an athletics stadium,\u201d a police officer replied. It all passed peacefully and there was a good atmosphere inside the ground. West Ham were up for it after coming close to nicking a point at Liverpool last Monday and, for all the complaints about Moyes being too negative, there was an adventurous look to the Scot\u2019s 4-4-2 system. Haller was back in the side and the \u00a345m striker\u2019s physical partnership with Antonio was highly effective. \u201cWe could never defend them in a way we should do in the Premier League,\u201d said Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, Southampton\u2019s manager. There were also plenty of bright touches from Bowen on his first start for his new side, including a cheeky nutmeg to embarrass Ryan Bertrand, and he opened the scoring in the 15th minute. The impressive Declan Rice won possession in midfield and when Fornals spotted Bowen making a run from right to left, the Spaniard\u2019s pass allowed the winger to dink a lovely finish over Alex McCarthy with his left foot. Perhaps Moyes was right to ease the 23-year-old in gently. \u201cI know a little bit about bringing in the boys from the lower leagues at the right moment,\u201d he said. Haller spurned a chance to double the lead, heading straight at McCarthy, and Southampton stirred after a lethargic start. When the visitors exposed Mark Noble\u2019s lack of pace in midfield with a slick counterattack in the 31st minute, Stuart Armstrong found James Ward-Prowse and his cutback gave Michael Obafemi the chance to curl a shot beyond Lukasz Fabianski. The confidence briefly seeped out of West Ham, who have lost 22 points from winning positions this season. Yet there was something different about them here; more defiance, a greater sense of purpose. They should have regained the lead when Issa Diop produced an absurd miss, ducking underneath Aaron Cresswell\u2019s corner, and they did regain the lead when an error from McCarthy gifted Haller his seventh goal of the season. Antonio sliced a cross into the area from the left and the Southampton goalkeeper was far too tentative as he came to collect, allowing Haller to bump him with a legal challenge, nod the ball away and turn it into the empty net. There would be no VAR reprieve for McCarthy and West Ham scored again in the 54th minute, Haller flicking on for Fornals to release Antonio, who finished with aplomb. Southampton introduced Danny Ings but Haller almost created another goal for Antonio with a rabona. West Ham saw the gloom lifting.",

It was an all-out assault, which came off with that climactic penalty try. The bonus-point win takes Quins into the top six, from ninth, but Exeter remain clear at the top. Curiously, it was at the scrum they were found out, even as they ran in three fine tries with an aplomb more associated with Harlequins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/28/rugby-union-needs-to-wake-up-to-the-slow-strangling-of-the-grassroots-game\">Rugby needs to wake up to the slow strangling of the grassroots game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It looked as if they would do no more than pick up where they left off the weekend before, when they had put 50 past fellow play-off contenders Northampton. With pretty much their first stretch of possession, Phil Dollman dummied and broke inside Marcus Smith for a fine individual try in the third minute.</p> <p>The home side rode that indignity and started to flex their muscles. To begin with, the Quins scrum could do no wrong. Having won an early penalty, they won another within range, which Smith landed. Joe Simmonds replied almost immediately with a penalty before Harlequins levelled, again the points stemming from another scrum. They were scrumming penalties as early as the 20th minute, but at the site of the latest scrum penalty Danny Care, in his 200th Premiership appearance, tapped and fed the formidable Paul Lasike.</p> <p>There is not much arguing with the American on the charge and his path to the line was unbroken. Very direct, very Exeter.</p> <p>A penalty apiece, albeit with Exeter\u2019s scrum starting to win favour for no obvious reason, maintained parity at the break. Neither Exeter\u2019s ascendancy at the scrum nor the parity was to last long. Quins repeated the scrum-Care-Lasike routine to set up Tevita Cavubati from close range.</p> <p>Cue the Simmonds brothers. Sam cut inside Lasike like the centre he might have been in another life for a dazzling break, which was improved when brother Joe ghosted past four more tacklers to the line to draw Exeter level. Three minutes later, and Sam broke again, Elvis Taione charged deep into Quins territory, before Joe ghosted through again, past three this time, for Exeter\u2019s third.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"978b040f77cde33590692ed030d0d912cb015256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/978b040f77cde33590692ed030d0d912cb015256/0_12_3444_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exeter\u2019s Phil Dollman goes over over in the first half.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exeter\u2019s Phil Dollman goes over over in the first half.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Khachfe/JMP/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quins levelled on the hour. Another scrum (instead of a simple shot at goal), and Alex Dombrandt fed Care who sent Smith on an arc round the Exeter midfield. Nick Auterac was shown the first of three late yellow cards, when he deliberately knocked-on after Joe Simmonds had split Quins\u2019 defence once more. The latter landed the penalty that put Exeter ahead with quarter of an hour to go.</p> <p>The drama was only just beginning. Ollie Devoto\u2019s high tackle on Smith meant he was next to go to the bin, with six minutes to go. Quins continued to take scrums for each penalty. With a minute to go, the referee apologised for awarding one too quickly when Care cross-kicked to an unmarked Gabriel Ibitoye with what should have been the advantage. From then on, any benefit of the doubt would go to the home side.</p> <p>Alec Hepburn\u2019s yellow card at the umpteenth scrum penalty reduced Exeter to 13 briefly, but there would be time for Devoto to return before the game was finally settled. The scrum splintered into chaos, and the referee marched to the sticks. An unsatisfactory way to win, perhaps, but appropriately dramatic.</p>",

It was an all-out assault, which came off with that climactic penalty try. The bonus-point win takes Quins into the top six, from ninth, but Exeter remain clear at the top. Curiously, it was at the scrum they were found out, even as they ran in three fine tries with an aplomb more associated with Harlequins. It looked as if they would do no more than pick up where they left off the weekend before, when they had put 50 past fellow play-off contenders Northampton. With pretty much their first stretch of possession, Phil Dollman dummied and broke inside Marcus Smith for a fine individual try in the third minute. The home side rode that indignity and started to flex their muscles. To begin with, the Quins scrum could do no wrong. Having won an early penalty, they won another within range, which Smith landed. Joe Simmonds replied almost immediately with a penalty before Harlequins levelled, again the points stemming from another scrum. They were scrumming penalties as early as the 20th minute, but at the site of the latest scrum penalty Danny Care, in his 200th Premiership appearance, tapped and fed the formidable Paul Lasike. There is not much arguing with the American on the charge and his path to the line was unbroken. Very direct, very Exeter. A penalty apiece, albeit with Exeter\u2019s scrum starting to win favour for no obvious reason, maintained parity at the break. Neither Exeter\u2019s ascendancy at the scrum nor the parity was to last long. Quins repeated the scrum-Care-Lasike routine to set up Tevita Cavubati from close range. Cue the Simmonds brothers. Sam cut inside Lasike like the centre he might have been in another life for a dazzling break, which was improved when brother Joe ghosted past four more tacklers to the line to draw Exeter level. Three minutes later, and Sam broke again, Elvis Taione charged deep into Quins territory, before Joe ghosted through again, past three this time, for Exeter\u2019s third. Quins levelled on the hour. Another scrum (instead of a simple shot at goal), and Alex Dombrandt fed Care who sent Smith on an arc round the Exeter midfield. Nick Auterac was shown the first of three late yellow cards, when he deliberately knocked-on after Joe Simmonds had split Quins\u2019 defence once more. The latter landed the penalty that put Exeter ahead with quarter of an hour to go. The drama was only just beginning. Ollie Devoto\u2019s high tackle on Smith meant he was next to go to the bin, with six minutes to go. Quins continued to take scrums for each penalty. With a minute to go, the referee apologised for awarding one too quickly when Care cross-kicked to an unmarked Gabriel Ibitoye with what should have been the advantage. From then on, any benefit of the doubt would go to the home side. Alec Hepburn\u2019s yellow card at the umpteenth scrum penalty reduced Exeter to 13 briefly, but there would be time for Devoto to return before the game was finally settled. The scrum splintered into chaos, and the referee marched to the sticks. An unsatisfactory way to win, perhaps, but appropriately dramatic.",

      "body": "<p>The finality of the grave brings clarity. On the tombstone of this administration the epitaph should read: \u201cHere lies the Conservative party, it brought death to the country it claimed to love. It killed the working class it claimed to represent. It said it was for the north but wouldn\u2019t keep northerners alive.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Michael Marmot\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/publications/reports/the-marmot-review-10-years-on\" title=\"\">review</a> of health and inequality confirms what you already suspected. But suspecting is one thing and knowing another. Marmot shows that England is now the sick man of Europe with such authority and cool precision, he replaces doubt with certainty and transforms the way you think about your country.</p> <p>From the end of the 19th century, life expectancy increased by one year every four years for men and every five-and-a-half years for women. Since David Cameron took power in 2010, the steady improvement in the condition of England has stalled and in the case of the poorest gone into reverse. And people say Cameron will only be remembered for Brexit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Life expectancy for women in the UK showed a 90% slowdown, the worst performance in the rich world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Women\u2019s life expectancy declined in the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods. As for their children, they can expect to have worse lives than their mothers did. Life expectancy is lower in the north than the south. If you are poor in the north-east \u2013 that is, if you are in the bottom 10% of the population \u2013 your life expectancy is less than if you are poor in London, possibly because in London you can hope to find a halfway decent job, if you are in good health, and move on. In the north-east less opportunity means less hope.</p> <p>International comparisons illuminate England\u2019s sickness. No global pandemic hit between 2010 and 2019. The winters weren\u2019t severe. An invading army did not massacre the population. Serial killers did not stalk the streets. In restrained prose, the Marmot inquiry describes instead the enemy within that cut essential services by staggering amounts. Government grants to local authorities fell by 77% between 2010 and 2019. Sure Start centres closed; public health was moved out of the NHS, dumped on local authorities, and then saw its budgets cut, despite <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/hot-topics/public-health-cuts/deprived-areas-receive-six-times-more-cuts-to-public-health-budgets/20039637.article\" title=\"\">promises to the contrary</a>. The slowdown in life expectancy is matched in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which had the bad luck to share a Conservative government with England.</p> <p>The true measure of our failure comes from looking at the other rich countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. English men had the second largest reduction in life expectancy improvement after the US. Meanwhile life expectancy for women in the UK showed a 90% slowdown, the worst performance anywhere in the rich world. No one knows why women are suffering so, but the evidence that austerity hit them hardest has to be a part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/women-bearing-86-of-austerity-burden-labour-research-reveals\" title=\"\">the answer</a>. It\u2019s not that public health had been racing ahead in the late 20th century and couldn\u2019t be expected to maintain its breakneck pace in the 2010s. \u201cMany countries have higher levels of life expectancy and continue to improve at a much faster rate than the UK,\u201d the Marmot review concluded.</p> <p>The Health Foundation, which supported the research, can show that the Tories\u2019 new seats in the north have <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/charts-and-infographics/new-conservative-seats-and-the-healthy-life-expectancy-gap\" title=\"\">lower average healthy life expectancies</a> \u2013 that is, life without chronic illnesses \u2013 than Labour seats. It implies it would be a blessing if Johnson decided that he had a political interest in changing that. I hope he does but I have my doubts, despite Johnson wanting to end austerity and the <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/closing-the-gap-on-health-inequality/\" title=\"\">NHS cooing</a> about its commitment to tackling health inequalities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnson and Gove do not see wilful stupidity as a source of shame but as a smart career move</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Conservatives have already taken decisions that will have monstrous consequences. The hard Brexit they favour will hit the poorest regions hardest, and they show no signs of caring. The next phase of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/11/universal-credit-could-steamroll-vulnerable-into-poverty-salvation-army\" title=\"\">universal credit</a> will capture 750,000 sick and disabled people, many of whom do not have the cognitive skills to negotiate the system. </p> <p>The culture of Tory England matters as much as its political decisions. Ever since the Brexit referendum I\u2019ve written about the folly of allowing journalists to run a country. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are not merely journalists but the worst type of hacks: crowd-pleasing, dilettante opinionators, performing bullshitters, who do not see wilful stupidity as a source of shame but as a smart career move. It\u2019s not just that they can picture the ignorant attacks from the right that a policy of improving the national health would bring: they\u2019ve written them themselves.</p> <p>Jon Ashworth, Labour\u2019s health spokesman, makes the point well. He noticed that the Marmot inquiry found that mortality rates have increased for 45- to 49-year-olds. In the US these <a href=\"https://time.com/5606411/millennials-deaths-of-despair/\" title=\"\">\u201cdeaths of despair\u201d</a> have attracted huge interest, particularly after the death rates for middle-aged white men began to reach the level of their African- and Native-American contemporaries. The same phenomenon can be seen here among middle-aged men (deaths of despair among women are also <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/14/deaths-of-despair-once-an-american-phenomenon-now-haunt-britain\" title=\"\">rising</a>, but less quickly). Now suppose that the government considered curbing alcoholism with minimum prices, health warnings and an advertising ban. Johnson and Gove would know their <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/02/boris-johnson-aims-put-end-nanny-state-sin-taxes-food/\" title=\"\">own words</a> on the nanny state would be thrown in their faces.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/23/national-disgrace-tackle-regional-health-inequality-pm-to-be-told\">'National disgrace': tackle regional health inequality, PM to be told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hardly anyone has noticed that there has been no great pressure from Labour to relieve the health crisis. It may have shouted loudly about food banks and passed its conscience round for the public to applaud. But over the protests of Ashworth and others, Corbynism remained a thoroughly bourgeois movement. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/manifestos\" title=\"\">noted</a>, at the last election Labour preferred to spend \u201cconsiderably more\u201d on making up the pensions of \u201crelatively well off\u201d Waspi women than on alleviating the all too genuine despair of the working poor.</p> <p>Write like this and one is in danger of falling into the journalism of despair. So I will end with an upbeat question. This cannot go on \u2013 can it? The British don\u2019t expect much from their politicians. But is it too much to ask that they stop trying to kill us?</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The finality of the grave brings clarity. On the tombstone of this administration the epitaph should read: \u201cHere lies the Conservative party, it brought death to the country it claimed to love. It killed the working class it claimed to represent. It said it was for the north but wouldn\u2019t keep northerners alive.\u201d Sir Michael Marmot\u2019s review of health and inequality confirms what you already suspected. But suspecting is one thing and knowing another. Marmot shows that England is now the sick man of Europe with such authority and cool precision, he replaces doubt with certainty and transforms the way you think about your country. From the end of the 19th century, life expectancy increased by one year every four years for men and every five-and-a-half years for women. Since David Cameron took power in 2010, the steady improvement in the condition of England has stalled and in the case of the poorest gone into reverse. And people say Cameron will only be remembered for Brexit. Women\u2019s life expectancy declined in the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods. As for their children, they can expect to have worse lives than their mothers did. Life expectancy is lower in the north than the south. If you are poor in the north-east \u2013 that is, if you are in the bottom 10% of the population \u2013 your life expectancy is less than if you are poor in London, possibly because in London you can hope to find a halfway decent job, if you are in good health, and move on. In the north-east less opportunity means less hope. International comparisons illuminate England\u2019s sickness. No global pandemic hit between 2010 and 2019. The winters weren\u2019t severe. An invading army did not massacre the population. Serial killers did not stalk the streets. In restrained prose, the Marmot inquiry describes instead the enemy within that cut essential services by staggering amounts. Government grants to local authorities fell by 77% between 2010 and 2019. Sure Start centres closed; public health was moved out of the NHS, dumped on local authorities, and then saw its budgets cut, despite promises to the contrary. The slowdown in life expectancy is matched in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which had the bad luck to share a Conservative government with England. The true measure of our failure comes from looking at the other rich countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. English men had the second largest reduction in life expectancy improvement after the US. Meanwhile life expectancy for women in the UK showed a 90% slowdown, the worst performance anywhere in the rich world. No one knows why women are suffering so, but the evidence that austerity hit them hardest has to be a part of the answer. It\u2019s not that public health had been racing ahead in the late 20th century and couldn\u2019t be expected to maintain its breakneck pace in the 2010s. \u201cMany countries have higher levels of life expectancy and continue to improve at a much faster rate than the UK,\u201d the Marmot review concluded. The Health Foundation, which supported the research, can show that the Tories\u2019 new seats in the north have lower average healthy life expectancies \u2013 that is, life without chronic illnesses \u2013 than Labour seats. It implies it would be a blessing if Johnson decided that he had a political interest in changing that. I hope he does but I have my doubts, despite Johnson wanting to end austerity and the NHS cooing about its commitment to tackling health inequalities. The Conservatives have already taken decisions that will have monstrous consequences. The hard Brexit they favour will hit the poorest regions hardest, and they show no signs of caring. The next phase of universal credit will capture 750,000 sick and disabled people, many of whom do not have the cognitive skills to negotiate the system. The culture of Tory England matters as much as its political decisions. Ever since the Brexit referendum I\u2019ve written about the folly of allowing journalists to run a country. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are not merely journalists but the worst type of hacks: crowd-pleasing, dilettante opinionators, performing bullshitters, who do not see wilful stupidity as a source of shame but as a smart career move. It\u2019s not just that they can picture the ignorant attacks from the right that a policy of improving the national health would bring: they\u2019ve written them themselves. Jon Ashworth, Labour\u2019s health spokesman, makes the point well. He noticed that the Marmot inquiry found that mortality rates have increased for 45- to 49-year-olds. In the US these \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d have attracted huge interest, particularly after the death rates for middle-aged white men began to reach the level of their African- and Native-American contemporaries. The same phenomenon can be seen here among middle-aged men (deaths of despair among women are also rising, but less quickly). Now suppose that the government considered curbing alcoholism with minimum prices, health warnings and an advertising ban. Johnson and Gove would know their own words on the nanny state would be thrown in their faces. Hardly anyone has noticed that there has been no great pressure from Labour to relieve the health crisis. It may have shouted loudly about food banks and passed its conscience round for the public to applaud. But over the protests of Ashworth and others, Corbynism remained a thoroughly bourgeois movement. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted, at the last election Labour preferred to spend \u201cconsiderably more\u201d on making up the pensions of \u201crelatively well off\u201d Waspi women than on alleviating the all too genuine despair of the working poor. Write like this and one is in danger of falling into the journalism of despair. So I will end with an upbeat question. This cannot go on \u2013 can it? The British don\u2019t expect much from their politicians. But is it too much to ask that they stop trying to kill us? \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q: I\u2019m tired of sad and depressing themes, but want something that\u2019s not a romcom in book form. Are there any happy novels that are also literary?</strong><br><em>Anonymous, 56, New York City</em></p> <p><strong>Jojo Moyes is a bestselling author whose novels include </strong><em><strong>Me Before You</strong></em><strong> and, most recently, </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-giver-of-stars-9780718183202.html\" title=\"\">The Giver of Stars</a></strong></em><strong>. She writes:</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve just judged two literary prizes and reading for both numbed my brain with bleakness. Like the misconception that comedic acting is somehow easier than Ibsen, so has \u201chappy\u201d literature somehow become equated with lightweight. Here are five novels that I hope might dispel that.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/paradise-lodge-9780241974926.html\" title=\"\">Paradise Lodge</a></em> by Nina Stibbe. Or in fact any novel by Nina Stibbe. She has a very British comedic way of writing, in which it\u2019s possible to detect everything from Wodehouse to the Mitfords, but in a grubbier, modern setting.</p> <p>The poet Patricia Lockwood\u2019s quirky and autobiographical <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/priestdaddy-9780141984599.html\" title=\"\">Priestdaddy</a></em> made me laugh so much in a car (a scene with her and her mother discussing motel sheets) that I had to pull over. (Yes I\u2019ve cheated; it\u2019s a memoir, but it reads like a novel.) Joyous, filthy in places and full of exquisite imagery and jokes.</p> <p>On the tiny off chance you have not read it, the classic <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austen is the deftest, wittiest and most beautifully constructed novel of social manners. It is both unputdownable and uplifting, but far from romcom.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-young-visiters-9781784743215.html\" title=\"\">The Young Visiters or Mister Salteena\u2019s Plan</a></em> is a 1919 novel by nine-year-old Daisy Ashford.

      "bodyText": "Q: I\u2019m tired of sad and depressing themes, but want something that\u2019s not a romcom in book form. Are there any happy novels that are also literary? Anonymous, 56, New York City Jojo Moyes is a bestselling author whose novels include Me Before You and, most recently, The Giver of Stars. She writes: I\u2019ve just judged two literary prizes and reading for both numbed my brain with bleakness. Like the misconception that comedic acting is somehow easier than Ibsen, so has \u201chappy\u201d literature somehow become equated with lightweight. Here are five novels that I hope might dispel that. Paradise Lodge by Nina Stibbe. Or in fact any novel by Nina Stibbe. She has a very British comedic way of writing, in which it\u2019s possible to detect everything from Wodehouse to the Mitfords, but in a grubbier, modern setting. The poet Patricia Lockwood\u2019s quirky and autobiographical Priestdaddy made me laugh so much in a car (a scene with her and her mother discussing motel sheets) that I had to pull over. (Yes I\u2019ve cheated; it\u2019s a memoir, but it reads like a novel.) Joyous, filthy in places and full of exquisite imagery and jokes. On the tiny off chance you have not read it, the classic Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is the deftest, wittiest and most beautifully constructed novel of social manners. It is both unputdownable and uplifting, but far from romcom. The Young Visiters or Mister Salteena\u2019s Plan is a 1919 novel by nine-year-old Daisy Ashford. Centred on Alfred Salteena, \u201can elderly man of 42\u201d, it was published with spelling mistakes and descriptions intact and I defy anyone not to read it as a comedy masterpiece. Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is funny, sad, sly and pragmatic. This is a love story that never goes quite where you think it will and ends with two elderly people being simultaneously in love and quite cross with each other. Blissful.

Did you have a particular reader in mind for your history?</strong><br>It was explained to me I should keep teenage readers in mind, and that suited me fine. It meant I could leave out any boring theory and technical terms, and put in plenty of anecdotes to bring the poets to life.</p> <p><strong>The way literature is taught in schools neglects this kind of historical sweep. We seem to like our literature to be \u201crelevant\u201d\u2026</strong><br>I think that\u2019s right.

I remember reading how when he was dying, the nervous young doctor attending him asked: should he get another cylinder of oxygen? Chekhov said: \u201cNo, I think you would be better getting a bottle of champagne.\u201d I love that. But it is rare. I just reviewed that new book on George Orwell about how dreadfully he treated his wife. He was not only unfaithful but when she was terminally ill and they had just adopted a child, he went off to be a foreign correspondent for the <em>Observer</em>. She died not long after he left. Unbelievably uncaring.</p> <p><strong>Do you think we should take that into account when we read Orwell?</strong><br>I don\u2019t personally think so. Orwell himself argued that you can be a great artist and a disgusting human being. And I think that is right. Though if it gets into the writing, you can\u2019t ignore it. If you read Dante, for example, his depiction of hell suggests an obsessive interest in cruelty and torture. I don\u2019t see how you can read that and simply admire the lovely poetry.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds have announced they are expecting a baby and that they have got engaged. The couple, who have been living together in Downing Street since Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, with Symonds becoming the first unmarried prime ministerial partner in history, are expecting the birth of the child in the early summer. Details of the prime minister\u2019s relationship with Symonds, 31, an environmental campaigner and former Conservative party official, emerged last year. The expected birth date of the child suggests the baby was conceived in autumn, around the time that the 31 October Brexit deadline was extended and it follows speculation over whether the couple would soon have a child together. A spokesperson for the couple said: \u201cThe prime minister and Miss Symonds are very pleased to announce their engagement and that they are expecting a baby in the early summer.\u201d The couple\u2019s relationship was the subject of scrutiny during the 2019 general election after police were called to Symonds\u2019 home by a neighbour who claimed to have heard a row between the two. However, officers attended and confirmed both were \u201csafe and well\u201d. Johnson, 55, will become the first prime minister to get married in office for 250 years, while the last child born to an incumbent prime minister was Florence Rose Endellion, the daughter of David and Samantha Cameron, who was born in August 2010. Johnson has repeatedly come under scrutiny over his personal life. In 2004, he was sacked from the Tory frontbench over a reported affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt. Appeal court judges ruled in 2013 that the public had a right to know that he had fathered a daughter during an adulterous liaison while mayor of London in 2009. The prime minister is believed already to be the father of at least five children with two women \u2013 his second wife Marina Wheeler, whom he married in 1993, and art consultant Helen Macintyre, with whom he had an extramarital affair. He has always refused to say how many children he has in total. Johnson refused to speak about his own children in November, nor the possibility that another might be on the way, after it emerged he had referred to single mothers as \u201cirresponsible\u201d. Challenged on live radio, he told LBC listeners: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is what the nation wants to hear. They want to hear how we\u2019re going to get Brexit done.\u201d Asked how many children he has, he replied: \u201cI love my children very much but they are not standing at this election. I\u2019m therefore not going to comment on them.\u201d Johnson announced that he was separating from his wife in September 2018 after months of being romantically linked with Symonds. Pictures of the pair on holiday emerged in March 2019 and the pair bought a house together in Camberwell in July 2019. However, their association together dates back to when she worked on his successful re-election bid at City Hall in 2012. Symonds moved into Downing Street with Johnson when he became prime minister but has kept a low profile since then. A family court judge on Tuesday approved an undisclosed financial settlement and gave Wheeler permission to apply for a divorce decree which will bring the marriage to an end. Neither Johnson nor Wheeler, a barrister, were at the 10-minute private hearing in the central family court in London but both were represented by lawyers. Johnson is believed to be the first prime minister to be divorced in office since the Duke of Grafton was granted a divorce, by act of parliament, while serving as prime minister in 1769. Former Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson was among the first to congratulate the couple, while former chancellor Sajid Javid \u2013 who recently resigned after he was ordered to sack all of his advisers by No 10 \u2013 tweeted it was \u201cwonderful news!\u201d. But Labour peer George Foulkes questioned the timing of the announcement from Downing Street on the same day as Home Office permanent secretary Philip Rutnam\u2019s dramatic resignation. The former MP of 26 years tweeted: \u201cWonder why they announced it today?\u201d",

On 23 February, however, Butt and Resika \u201cturned and knelt on the ground, remaining in that position for the duration of the [Israeli] anthem\u201d.</p> <p>A brief <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Antisemitism/Brooklyn-College-volleyball-players-kneel-during-Israeli-national-anthem-619177\">video clip</a> posted to Twitter showed two students kneeling.</p> <p>Yeshiva University\u2019s president, Ari Berman, told the Yeshiva paper it was \u201cunfortunate that some members of the opposing team disrespected Israel\u2019s national anthem\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe are proud to be the only university who sings both the American and Israeli national anthems before every athletic competition and major event. Nothing makes me prouder to be an American than living in a country where our religious freedom, our Zionism and our commitment to our people will never be impeded and always be prized.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com/about/about-the-simon-wiesenthal-center/\">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com/about/news/brooklyn-college-2.html\">said in a statement</a>: \u201cAt a time of increased antisemitism in our country, including on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, we demand to know what steps Brooklyn College intends to take with regard to this display of antisemitism by members of its volleyball team. The ball is in their court.\u201d</p> <p>Several outlets said on Twitter the two players refused to shake hands with Yeshiva\u2019s players. Both colleges denied such claims.</p> <p>On Twitter, Yeshiva\u2019s athletics department <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YUathletics/status/1231722185460416519\">replied</a>: \u201cPlease rest assured that if anything like that should ever occur we would handle it through the proper channels.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Brooklyn College told the Yeshiva paper it \u201cstrongly condemns all forms of antisemitism and hatred. The two students who knelt during the national anthem did not refuse to shake hands with players from the other team.

      "bodyText": "Two Brooklyn College volleyball players kneeled during playing of the Israeli national anthem at a game against Yeshiva University, a private Jewish educational institution in New York City, earlier this week. In doing so the players, identified as Hunnan Butt and Omar Rezika, seemed to echo similar examples of athletes making political protests during the US anthem, most notably the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Reports of the incident surfaced amid a rightwing push to suppress criticism of Israel and the occupation of Palestine at US public universities. Brooklyn College is a public institution. First reported by the Yeshiva University Observer, a student newspaper, the incident unfolded immediately before the game. Normally at Yeshiva, players stand for both the Star Spangled Banner and Israel\u2019s national anthem, the Hatikvah, the Yeshiva paper said. On 23 February, however, Butt and Resika \u201cturned and knelt on the ground, remaining in that position for the duration of the [Israeli] anthem\u201d. A brief video clip posted to Twitter showed two students kneeling. Yeshiva University\u2019s president, Ari Berman, told the Yeshiva paper it was \u201cunfortunate that some members of the opposing team disrespected Israel\u2019s national anthem\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are proud to be the only university who sings both the American and Israeli national anthems before every athletic competition and major event. Nothing makes me prouder to be an American than living in a country where our religious freedom, our Zionism and our commitment to our people will never be impeded and always be prized.\u201d The Simon Wiesenthal Center, meanwhile, said in a statement: \u201cAt a time of increased antisemitism in our country, including on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, we demand to know what steps Brooklyn College intends to take with regard to this display of antisemitism by members of its volleyball team. The ball is in their court.\u201d Several outlets said on Twitter the two players refused to shake hands with Yeshiva\u2019s players. Both colleges denied such claims. On Twitter, Yeshiva\u2019s athletics department replied: \u201cPlease rest assured that if anything like that should ever occur we would handle it through the proper channels.\u201d A spokesperson for Brooklyn College told the Yeshiva paper it \u201cstrongly condemns all forms of antisemitism and hatred. The two students who knelt during the national anthem did not refuse to shake hands with players from the other team. Their kneeling is protected by the first amendment.\u201d The two Brooklyn students could not immediately be reached for comment. The practice of kneeling in protest before sporting events became a flashpoint in US culture and politics when Kaepernick did so in 2016. His actions had a dramatic impact on debate surrounding police violence, politics and racism. Kaepernick has been without a team after leaving the 49ers at the conclusion of the 2016 season. He settled a claim that NFL team owners colluded to bar him from the league over his political position. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 March 2020 to change the word \u201cban\u201d in the standfirst and third paragraph to \u201csuppress\u201d.",

Thanks for staying with this goalfest, and by way of reward, here\u2019s some breaking news to end it all: the theme from Z-Cars has just blasted from the speakers at Vicarage Road, and that means Watford v Liverpool is minutes away from kick-off. Rob Smyth is all over it. Enjoy, enjoy! Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Crystal Palace. In case you missed it earlier, Palace won the M23 derby. Ed Aarons was at the Amex, and these are his conclusions. Newcastle United 0-0 Burnley. In retrospect, poor Louise Taylor drew the short straw today. She was there to witness Newcastle struggle up front yet again. Here\u2019s her take on the action at St James\u2019. West Ham United 3-1 Southampton. It was a huge win for the Hammers at their beloved London Stadium. Jacob Steinberg was on point to file this verdict. Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 6-0, incidentally. Here\u2019s how football\u2019s latest fiasco literally unfurled. Bournemouth 2-2 Chelsea. It was an entertaining back-and-forth on the south coast. Ben Fisher was there to witness it, and here\u2019s his report. All the updated tables, to peruse at your leisure, perchance for your pleasure. It\u2019s been a great day for West Ham, Leeds, Fulham, Wigan and Huddersfield; not so great for Aston Villa, West Brom, Charlton, Stoke and Middlesbrough. Scottish League Two full-times. Albion Rovers 1-2 Elgin City Brechin 0-2 Sterling Albion Cowdenbeath 1-1 Edinburgh City Queen\u2019s Park 2-0 Annan Athletic Stenhousemuir 0-3 Cove Rangers Scottish League One full-times.

The home side break up the other end, Aboubakar Kamara making sure of the three points in the fourth minute of injury time. It\u2019s 2-0, and Fulham remain on the shoulders of West Brom and Leeds, six and five points behind in third respectively. It\u2019s four for Huddersfield! Juninho Bacuna has whistled one into the top corner from 25 yards: 4-0. Blackburn have scrambled a draw at home against Swansea thanks to Bradley Johnson\u2019s 95th-minute deflected shot. It\u2019s 2-2 at Ewood. And it\u2019s all over at West Brom, where in-form Wigan have claimed all three points against the leaders: 0-1. All the Premier League full-time scores are in. Bournemouth 2-2 Chelsea Newcastle United 0-0 Burnley West Ham United 3-1 Southampton A third goal for Huddersfield against Charlton. Karlan Grant scores his second of the day: it\u2019s 3-0. Also down at the bottom: Luton equalise against fellow strugglers Stoke in the first minute of injury time, thanks to a James Collins penalty. And a sickener for Ipswich at Blackpool, Joe Nuttall scoring what is surely the winner in the 93rd minute. It\u2019s 2-1 to the Seasiders. West Brom are pushing hard for an equaliser against Wigan. The relegation haunted Latics refuse to bend. See also Newcastle, who are piling forward against Burnley. They\u2019ve got a two-on-one break in injury time, but Matt Ritchie hesitates and is stripped of possession. The Clarets are refusing to buckle as well. An equaliser for Birmingham at QPR. Scott Hogan makes it 2-2 with eight minutes remaining. Meanwhile here\u2019s budding playwright Bill Hargreaves: \u201cOf course the underlying funny thing about the Bayern banner is that poor old Dietmar Hopp will be wishing it all to go away, not for it to be highlighted by the stopping of play etc. All we need now is for the post match interviews to go something like this: Player: Well we had to stop playing because there was a banner saying the owner was the son of a whore. Interviewer: Son of a what? Player: A whore. Huge red letters on a white background. You couldn\u2019t miss it. Over there. Marcos Alonso, goal machine. It\u2019s three in two league games for the rampaging left back. That had been coming, with Chelsea piling on the pressure. Now the Cherries, so close to a precious win, will simply be looking to hang onto a point. Absolutely nothing has happened at St James\u2019 Park in the match between Newcastle and Burnley. Nothing, nowt, zilch, nada, nix, bugger all. There: if that doesn\u2019t guarantee some late drama, nothing will. Steve Mounie has scored a second for Huddersfield against Charlton. This win would catapult the Terriers up to the heady heights of 17th in the Championship table, leaving Charlton one place and two points above the relegation zone. The match at Hoffenheim has restarted. By all accounts, Bayern are just doing keepie-uppies, Jim Baxter style, and Hoffenheim players are merely standing around in the fag-while-waiting-for-bus style. Having a nice chat. Meanwhile the clock ticks on, and the referee doesn\u2019t give two hoots. What is it with touchy billionaires, though? Guess it\u2019s true what the moptops said: money can\u2019t buy you love. A huge goal in the Championship. Wigan take the lead against West Brom at the Hawthorns, Sam Morsy taking advantage of a post-corner scramble to slam home. If this stays the same, Leeds will be just a point behind the Baggies at the top of the table, while Wigan will escape the dropzone at the expense of Middlesbrough. The teamsheets are in at Vicarage Road. Watford: Foster, Femenia, Kabasele, Cathcart, Masina, Hughes, Capoue, Sarr, Doucoure, Deulofeu, Deeney. Subs: Gomes, Dawson, Welbeck, Chalobah, Gray, Pussetto, Pereyra. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Adrian, Minamino, Lallana, Origi, Matip, Jones, Hoever. Rob Smyth helms the MBM, and will furnish you with all the pre-match analysis you require. And possibly some more. Chelsea have brought on Michy Batshuayi, in the hope of getting back into the game at Dean Court. The erratic Belgian has just slotted home ... but from a clearly offside position. VAR does its job, and Bournemouth remain 2-1 in the lead. Fulham are determined to stay on the tails of West Brom and Leeds in the Championship promotion places. Preston North End appear equally determined to give them a hand. David Nugent has put through his own net, giving the Cottagers a 58th-minute lead. Thin-skinned rich men latest. Bayern Munich are currently 6-0 up at Hoffenheim. But the game has been suspended because their fans are waving an offensive banner against Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp. Dundee United have a Liverpoolesque lead at the top of the Scottish Championship. Second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle aren\u2019t going to catch them, 18 points behind, albeit with two games in their pocket after today. So a defeat today is unlikely to cause the Arabs too much despair. Nevertheless, the leaders are 2-0 down at Dunfermline, Jonathan Afolabi adding to Kevin Nisbet\u2019s first-half goal. Freddie Sears has equalised for momentum-free Ipswich Town at Blackpool. Meanwhile QPR, who were trailing 1-0 at half time at home to Birmingham City, have staged a fine comeback, Marc Pugh and Jordan Hugill scoring the goals in a four-minute burst to snatch the lead. And down near the bottom of the Championship, out-of-form Reading are 2-0 up on Barnsley, George Puscas adding to Yakou Meite\u2019s first-half strike. That cup of half-time tea must have been a tasty drop. Two goals in three minutes, the second from Josh King, has turned things around for the Cherries at Dean Court. Bournemouth, like West Ham, are fighting hard for three precious points. Saints have brought on Danny Ings. And he\u2019s got a job to do, because Michail Antonio has just stretched West Ham\u2019s lead in a must-win game for the hosts. A Tomas Kalas own goal has brought Millwall level against Bristol City. It\u2019s 1-1 at the New Den. Meanwhile from og to Ng: in the old Fourth Division, Perry Ng puts Crewe 1-0 up at Morecambe. As things stand, Crewe will be going to the top of the table. Ryan Fraser swings a corner into the Chelsea mixer. Jefferson Lerma rises highest to bullet a header into the net. It\u2019s his first home goal for the Cherries. The Championship leaders West Brom are being held at home by lowly Wigan. It\u2019s 0-0, and it\u2019s not exactly been a classic at the Hawthorns. Meanwhile at Ewood Park, Swansea have turned things around completely either side of the half-time break, Andre Ayew stroking home a penalty kick on 48 minutes. It\u2019s 1-2. Huddersfield are playing Charlton this afternoon, you\u2019ll have noticed. Any excuse to exhume an old Joy of Six. Why not while away the time before the second-half goals start flying in?

It\u2019s an equaliser, right on the stroke of half-time, Sam Gallagher having given Rovers a 25th-minute lead at Ewood Park. Meanwhile Cardiff have levelled up at home against Brentford, Joe Ralls completing a comeback from two goals down just before the half-time whistle. It\u2019s 2-2 at the Cardiff City Stadium. The Premier League half-times. Bournemouth 0-1 Chelsea Newcastle United 0-0 Burnley West Ham United 2-1 Southampton As things stand, West Ham catapult themselves up to 16th, leapfrogging Bournemouth and pushing Aston Villa into the bottom three. With games against Arsenal, Wolves, Spurs and Chelsea coming up, a win today couldn\u2019t be more precious. But not for long! Sebastien Haller bullies Alex McCarthy as the pair compete for a high ball, then slides home. VAR has a check, harshing West Ham\u2019s buzz, but eventually they\u2019re allowed to celebrate properly. The goal stands, and the Hammers deservedly lead on the balance of play. Could it be one of those days for West Ham? They\u2019ve messed up a three-on-one break, conceded minutes after missing a great chance, and now another goal goes betting. From a corner, Issa Diop fails to connect a couple of yards out, and the score remains 1-1. Cardiff are back in it against Brentford. Junior Hoilett has halved the deficit on 34 minutes; it\u2019s 1-2. Elsewhere in the Championship, Sheffield Wednesday are capitulating at home against Derby. Jason Knight scores a third for the Rams on the half-hour, and already plenty of Owls regulars have decided enough is enough. They\u2019re off to the pub. Bournemouth had started well, but it\u2019s Chelsea who have taken the lead at Dean Court (some habits, etc.). Olivier Giroud hits the bar, and Marcos Alonso rifles home the rebound from close range. The destroyers of Spurs last week combine again. The small margins between success and failure, right here. Pablo Fornals passes up a great chance to make it 2-0 at the London Stadium. Saints break up the other end, Michael Obafemi justifying Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s decision to start him ahead of Danny Ings. Ipswich Town have only won four of their last 18 matches. Once leading the old Third Division (some habits are hard to shake) they\u2019re now adrift of the play-off positions in ninth, and not looking likely to turn things around at Blackpool today. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has given the Seasiders a 26th-minute lead. Derby County are also out of the blocks quickly this afternoon. Tom Lawrence has scored twice in the first 24 minutes at Sheffield Wednesday. While there\u2019s a mid-table flavour to that one, it\u2019s a relegation scrap at Huddersfield Town, where the hosts have taken the lead against Charlton Athletic through Karlan Ahearne-Grant. It\u2019s been a fast start by promotion-chasing Brentford at Cardiff. Luca Racic had given the Bees a fifth-minute lead; Bryan Mbeumo has just slotted away a free kick to double their advantage. As things stand, they\u2019re in fourth spot in the Championship. West Ham are on the front foot now. Haller slams a header straight at Alex McCarthy in the Saints goal. Either side, and the hosts were 2-0 up and well on their way to their first win in nine matches. A minute after Michail Antonio mess up a three-on-one break, Jarrod Bowen scores on his full debut for West Ham! Saints had been growing into the match after West Ham\u2019s fast start, too. An early goal in the Championship relegation six-pointer at Kenilworth Road. Sam Vokes has given Stoke City the lead against hosts Luton Town, finishing a move started by Joe Allen. Meanwhile up the other end of the table, play-off hopefuls Bristol City have gone a goal up at Millwall, Pedro Pereira with the opener for the Robins. West Ham threw down an early marker as well. Within the first minute, Aaron Cresswell clattered into Stuart Armstrong, the Saints midfielder requiring the wet sponge, smelling salts, etc. Armstrong is up and about quickly enough, though, and the game goes on. David Moyes, desperate for the three points today, has clearly told his charges to, er, charge. The first goal of the traditional 3pm kick-offs in any division is scored by East Fife. Daniel Denholm puts the Fifers a goal up at Forfar. They\u2019ll be dancing on the streets of Farncombe, Surrey, and yes that is a tedious in-joke that about four people in the entire world will get. Meanwhile an early statement of intent by Bournemouth, for whom Philip Billing has wasted a couple of good early chances already. Chelsea aren\u2019t out of the dressing room yet. Peep! Tootle! Parp! After some coronavirus-defying handshakes at grounds all around the country, the 3pm kick-offs get underway. Still here? For those of you who haven\u2019t immediately raced straight to the butchers for a couple of pounds of mutton mince, stopping off en route only to pick up a slab of lard ... the Observer\u2019s report of Palace\u2019s win at arch-rivals Brighton has landed. Ed Aarons was our man down by the seaside, and here\u2019s his verdict. Pre-match pie. Further proof that the BBC licence fee is worth every single penny. West Ham fans, having been sold a pup by their preposterous board, will be protesting before their match against Southampton. Stephen Cross, of the Hammers United supporters\u2019 club, explains why it\u2019s come to this. Preach on, brother. Bournemouth v Chelsea team news. Bournemouth welcome back Nathan Ake, Jefferson Lerma, Lewis Cook and Ryan Fraser. Fikayo Tomori replaces Antonio Rudiger in central defence for Chelsea, while Pedro displaces Ross Barkley in midfield. Kepa Arrizabalaga remains on the bench, Willy Caballero continuing in between the sticks. West Ham United v Southampton team news. Jarrod Bowen makes his full West Ham debut against Southampton. He lines up alongside Sebastien Haller and Michail Antonio as David Moyes goes for all-out attack. Feel free to read those seven words back to yourself, ten times or more if necessary. Meanwhile Saints select Michael Obafemi up front. Danny Ings is once again on the bench, Southampton\u2019s leading scorer perhaps understandably running on fumes after carrying the entire team for the past seven months. Newcastle United v Burnley team news. Five changes for Newcastle. Steve Bruce replaces Fabian Schar, Valentino Lazaro, Nabil Bentaleb, Sean Longstaff and Allan Saint-Maximin with Javier Manquillo, Matt Ritchie, Isaac Hayden, Jonjo Shelvey and Dwight Gayle. However, Burnley boss Sean Dyche is in If It Ain\u2019t Broke mode: he names the same XI who started the 3-0 win over Bournemouth last week. Chris Wood is among the substitutes after recovering from a hamstring problem. FULL TIME: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Crystal Palace. It\u2019s also all over at the Amex. Palace win the M23 derby thanks to a second-half Wilfried Zaha goal on the break. Rob Smyth has all the details, plus post-match reaction. FULL TIME: Hull City 0-4 Leeds United. A stunning second-half display by Leeds. Towards the end of it, they were stroking passes around to cheers of ol\u00e9! from the away end. The obvious comparison would be to their famous ball-flicking, back-heeling, shoulder-dropping humiliation of Southampton back in 1972, though everyone forgets Don Revie\u2019s side did pretty much the same thing a fortnight earlier against Manchester United. GOAL! Hull City 0-4 Leeds United (Roberts 84). This is now a rout. A second goal for Tyler Roberts in three minutes, this one a beautiful diving header, meeting Mateusz Klich\u2019s right-wing cross with a header back across George Long and into the top right. Picture-book. Hull will remain four points off the relegation places after this inevitable defeat. They\u2019ve got some big six-pointers coming up against Stoke, Charlton and Middlesbrough, plus extremely tricky away fixtures at Birmingham, West Brom and Bristol City. Survival is far from guaranteed. GOAL! Hull City 0-3 Leeds United (Roberts 81). Leeds really have cleared out their promotion-chasing pipes after that wobble. A length-of-pitch team move that ends with Jack Harrison teeing up Tyler Roberts to viciously sweep into the bottom right from 12 yards. Public service announcement: Five Serie A games have been called off as a result of the current Public Health Emergency of International Concern. We remind you because one of them is still showing up on our live scores, you see. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Smith, Ake, Stacey, Steve Cook, Billing, King, Lerma, Lewis Cook, Fraser, Callum Wilson. Subs: Boruc, Francis, Gosling, Solanke, Stanislas, Rico, Harry Wilson. Chelsea: Caballero, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Tomori, James, Jorginho, Kovacic, Alonso, Mount, Pedro, Giroud. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Rudiger, Barkley, Willian, Loftus-Cheek, Batshuayi, Gilmour. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Manquillo, Fernandez, Lascelles, Rose, Almiron, Hayden, Shelvey, Ritchie, Gayle, Joelinton. Subs: Schar, Saint-Maximin, Lejeune, Yedlin, Darlow, Sean Longstaff, Bentaleb. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Cork, Westwood, McNeil, Vydra, Rodriguez. Subs: Brownhill, Wood, Brady, Hart, Pieters, Lennon, Long. West Ham United: Fabianski, Ngakia, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Noble, Rice, Bowen, Fornals, Antonio, Haller. Subs: Balbuena, Zabaleta, Felipe Anderson, Lanzini, Snodgrass, Masuaku, Randolph. Southampton: McCarthy, Ward-Prowse, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Boufal, Smallbone, Hojbjerg, Armstrong, Obafemi, Long. Subs: Vestergaard, Ings, Adams, Romeu, Walker-Peters, Gunn, Valery. GOAL! Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Crystal Palace (Ayew 70). An opener at the Amex, and it\u2019s come against the run of play. Rob Smyth has the details. Click and enjoy. So having said nothing much was happening, Leeds nearly make it three in spectacular fashion. Jack Harrison takes a touch out on the right before whipping a power-curler towards the top left. He\u2019s beaten Hull keeper George Long all ends up, but the ball twangs off the upright and away from danger. That would have been a peach. It\u2019s still just 0-2. Hull have half-an-hour to get back into this. Leeds last won promotion from the second tier in 1990, the same year Liverpool last became champions of England. A good omen for both clubs? Or a tenuous coincidence crowbarred into a rolling blog while nothing much else is going on? The choice, dear reader, is yours. So after that rocky period, Leeds seem to have pulled themselves together as they chase that elusive return to the top flight. If they close this one out, they\u2019ll be eight points clear of third-placed Fulham, who entertain sixth-placed Preston North End this afternoon. GOAL! Hull City 0-2 Leeds United (Hernandez 47). It hasn\u2019t taken long for Leeds to double their advantage. Jack Harrison crosses long from the left. Patrick Bamford causes confusion in the middle. The ball finds Helder Costa down the inside-right channel. He slips in Pablo Hernandez, who fires a low diagonal shot into the bottom left. Here we go, then. It\u2019ll be a little while before the 3pm teamsheets land, so in the meantime let\u2019s concentrate on the lunchtime kick-offs. The M23 derby is goalless at half-time, the square root of nix having occurred so far down on the south coast. Rob Smyth is doing his best with that. Hull City v Leeds United has been a bit more eventful, thankfully. The teams were separated at the break by Luke Ayling\u2019s deflected long-range strike on five minutes. Pablo Hernandez has hit the Hull crossbar, while Leeds keeper Illan Meslier, making his league debut for the club at the age of 19, has been distributing the ball in an esoteric fashion. All set up for a great second half, with Leeds looking to close the gap on leaders West Brom, for a couple of hours at least, and Hull desperately looking for something that\u2019ll put a little more distance between themselves and the relegation places. There aren\u2019t too many Premier League fixtures being played this afternoon. Just the five. And yet it could prove to be quite a significant day in the 2019-20 Premier League. Brighton and Crystal Palace kicked off an hour ago, and you can follow that live, right here, right now, with our old pal Rob Smyth. Today\u2019s other fixtures are as follows (all 3pm unless stated): Bournemouth v Chelsea Newcastle United v Burnley West Ham United v Southampton Watford v Liverpool (5.30pm) So with all the teams at the bottom, bar League Cup finalists Aston Villa, playing, some potentially lethal shots could be fired in the relegation battle. Liverpool could also stretch their lead at the top. It\u2019s a big day. There\u2019s plenty to be keeping up with elsewhere, too, with West Bromwich Albion, Leeds United and Fulham all in Championship action. Other fixtures are additionally available. Is the Clockwatch vidiprinter on? It\u2019s on!",

      "body": "<p>This was hardly the emphatic response Frank Lampard had hoped for and, as he highlighted with a whiff of exasperation, when Marcos Alonso again proved the saviour, this time to rescue a point with five minutes left on the clock at Bournemouth, there should inevitably be questions raised. Alonso ensured a Chelsea team depleted by injuries \u2013 particularly in forward areas with Tammy Abraham sent to Barcelona to see a specialist regarding his ankle injury \u2013 did not depart empty handed, heading in an equaliser to help hold on to fourth spot for at least another week after Chelsea fell behind to goals from Joshua King and Jefferson Lerma in three remarkable second-half minutes.</p> <p>Lampard did not attempt to sugarcoat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/25/chelsea-bayern-munich-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">a humbling defeat by Bayern Munich</a> in midweek and acknowledged that his side, who host Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round on Tuesday, were below-par in both boxes again here. \u201cMarcos Alonso has had a big week but I don\u2019t want my left-back top of the scoring charts,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI want our attackers scoring goals and they haven\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I think that my left-back is the one scoring the two goals and the one who scored our last goal in the league [against Tottenham], and we are creating that many chances in between, you have to question why we are not finishing them.

      "bodyText": "This was hardly the emphatic response Frank Lampard had hoped for and, as he highlighted with a whiff of exasperation, when Marcos Alonso again proved the saviour, this time to rescue a point with five minutes left on the clock at Bournemouth, there should inevitably be questions raised. Alonso ensured a Chelsea team depleted by injuries \u2013 particularly in forward areas with Tammy Abraham sent to Barcelona to see a specialist regarding his ankle injury \u2013 did not depart empty handed, heading in an equaliser to help hold on to fourth spot for at least another week after Chelsea fell behind to goals from Joshua King and Jefferson Lerma in three remarkable second-half minutes. Lampard did not attempt to sugarcoat a humbling defeat by Bayern Munich in midweek and acknowledged that his side, who host Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round on Tuesday, were below-par in both boxes again here. \u201cMarcos Alonso has had a big week but I don\u2019t want my left-back top of the scoring charts,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI want our attackers scoring goals and they haven\u2019t. \u201cWhen I think that my left-back is the one scoring the two goals and the one who scored our last goal in the league [against Tottenham], and we are creating that many chances in between, you have to question why we are not finishing them. We are fighting for fourth against teams that are pushing the same as us and we really are striving for a little run of form where it\u2019s win, win, win.

The documents call for residential areas, a hospital and town squares. Officials from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates visited in 2018 promising to help finance the work, including an international airport.</p> <p>For now, two water towers mark the entrance to the town, placed there to slake the thirst of the camels, which vastly outnumber either people or vehicles. The largest house belongs to Juma Dagalo, the area\u2019s chief and Hemedti\u2019s uncle. \u201cWe were nomads, but now we want to develop ourselves, so we have to settle and send our children to school,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In his telling, Zurrug belongs to his ethnic group, the Mahariya, having been gifted to them by their former colonial masters, the British. The chief, who brought Hemedti up, says the land was empty.</p> <p>This story of empty land is bitterly disputed by community leaders in the camps in north Darfur. They claim Zurrug is on land they inhabited for centuries before being forced to leave by the RSF, who used the same tactics \u2013 murder, rape and robbery \u2013 as the Janjaweed. One of these communities is the Zaghawa, a black African ethnic group who bore much of the brunt of the war crimes alleged in Bashir\u2019s ICC indictment.</p> <p>Mohamed Ibrahim, a Zaghawa chief or <em>umda</em>, said: \u201cWhat Juma Dagalo is saying is not true. Zurrug was not empty land. We have our farms there but we cannot harvest. The RSF denies us access.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The land issue is far from buried: \u2018If we can\u2019t solve this peacefully we will take up arms again\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Mohamed Ibrahim</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Injustice and asymmetric war on civilians dominated much of the three decades that Bashir spent in power. His hold on office relied on a complex of alliances that spanned the Islamists, the army and support among the Arab middle class. Last year the regime collapsed as demonstrators in the cities demanded a civilian government. But insiders claim that Bashir stepped down only when Hemedti refused to use the RSF to crush the demonstrations. The protector switched allegiances from Bashir to the protestors in a move that saw him expand his support base far beyond Darfur.</p> <p>\u201cI stood beside the Sudanese people,\u201d Hemedti told the <em>Observer</em> from his gilded residence in Khartoum. \u201cA massacre would have happened herein Khartoum, a genocide would have happened on 11 April without our existence.\u201d</p> <p>The RSF is sanctioned by the state but its allegiance is to Hemedti, not Sudan\u2019s army. His leadership of what is effectively a private army has reportedly helped him make a fortune from gold, construction and alleged smuggling. Hemedti denies that the men he commands perpetrated atrocities, either in their former guise as the Janjaweed or more recently as the RSF.</p> <p>Today, Hemedti, whose Mahariya clan is part of the populous Rizeigat tribe, is vice-chairman of the sovereign council, the transitional body that is meant to guide Sudan to a new civilian government. But his credentials as protector of the people were stained in June last year when soldiers \u2013 many in RSF uniforms \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/sudan-khartoum-protest-gunfire-explosions-heard\" title=\"\">attacked a civilian sit-in</a> in the capital. More than 150 people were killed and many woman were raped. Hemedti denies ordering the violence and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/13/sudanese-protesters-demand-justice-after-mass-killings\" title=\"\">blames elements of the former regime</a> seeking to discredit him. His denial is dismissed by most of the protest groups.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac27db2e1f9e503ef7affaea3e40fb25ce2ed0ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac27db2e1f9e503ef7affaea3e40fb25ce2ed0ea/0_155_4038_2423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, the RSF leader.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, the RSF leader.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, a struggle is being waged inside the Sovereign Council, and on the streets, to make good on the promise of a transition to civilian rule. The army retains a powerful, possibly decisive voice on the council. Straddling it all is Hemedti, not beholden to Sudan\u2019s army, confident in his wealth and political support. He has the backing of influential Gulf States, cemented by sending the RSF to fight in Yemen alongside Saudi proxies in yet another gruesome conflict.</p> <p>For now, Hemedti prefers to whitewash the RSF\u2019s recent and deeper past, saying his forces have brought safety and stability to Darfur. On the issue of land, he appears magnanimous: \u201cWhoever took land or built anything on land which is not his, he has to leave it. Everybody has to take his own old land.\u201d</p> <p>But those who have done the taking in north Darfur are overwhelmingly Hemedti\u2019s own Mahariya people. His uncle, Juma Dagalo, has toured the region enticing members of his own ethnic group to come and settle in Zurrug and six other proto-towns around it. Each one has the same school and clinic, recycled from the UN bases. The teachers and doctors are on Hemedti\u2019s payroll. Water towers, a practical and symbolic way of staking claim to land, have started to appear \u2013 all financed by the RSF.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/sudan-map/giv-3902Ej95CQ0nACYo/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/sudan-map/giv-3902Ej95CQ0nACYo/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Final%20report%20of%20the%20Panel%20of%20Experts%20on%20the%20Sudan%20established-10jan2019.pdf\" title=\"\">report last year from the UN</a> panel of experts for Darfur concluded that development around Zurrug was meant to lure people from the cities.

During the day they sing songs that mash up anti-racism slogans with praise for the RSF. These anthems would ring hollow with the disenfranchised Zaghawa, who have formed committees in their camps and written letters to Sudan\u2019s new leadership.

Mohamed Ibrahim, a Zaghawa chief or umda, said: \u201cWhat Juma Dagalo is saying is not true. Zurrug was not empty land. We have our farms there but we cannot harvest. The RSF denies us access.\u201d Injustice and asymmetric war on civilians dominated much of the three decades that Bashir spent in power. His hold on office relied on a complex of alliances that spanned the Islamists, the army and support among the Arab middle class. Last year the regime collapsed as demonstrators in the cities demanded a civilian government. But insiders claim that Bashir stepped down only when Hemedti refused to use the RSF to crush the demonstrations. The protector switched allegiances from Bashir to the protestors in a move that saw him expand his support base far beyond Darfur. \u201cI stood beside the Sudanese people,\u201d Hemedti told the Observer from his gilded residence in Khartoum. \u201cA massacre would have happened herein Khartoum, a genocide would have happened on 11 April without our existence.\u201d The RSF is sanctioned by the state but its allegiance is to Hemedti, not Sudan\u2019s army. His leadership of what is effectively a private army has reportedly helped him make a fortune from gold, construction and alleged smuggling. Hemedti denies that the men he commands perpetrated atrocities, either in their former guise as the Janjaweed or more recently as the RSF. Today, Hemedti, whose Mahariya clan is part of the populous Rizeigat tribe, is vice-chairman of the sovereign council, the transitional body that is meant to guide Sudan to a new civilian government. But his credentials as protector of the people were stained in June last year when soldiers \u2013 many in RSF uniforms \u2013 attacked a civilian sit-in in the capital. More than 150 people were killed and many woman were raped. Hemedti denies ordering the violence and blames elements of the former regime seeking to discredit him. His denial is dismissed by most of the protest groups. Meanwhile, a struggle is being waged inside the Sovereign Council, and on the streets, to make good on the promise of a transition to civilian rule. The army retains a powerful, possibly decisive voice on the council. Straddling it all is Hemedti, not beholden to Sudan\u2019s army, confident in his wealth and political support. He has the backing of influential Gulf States, cemented by sending the RSF to fight in Yemen alongside Saudi proxies in yet another gruesome conflict. For now, Hemedti prefers to whitewash the RSF\u2019s recent and deeper past, saying his forces have brought safety and stability to Darfur. On the issue of land, he appears magnanimous: \u201cWhoever took land or built anything on land which is not his, he has to leave it. Everybody has to take his own old land.\u201d But those who have done the taking in north Darfur are overwhelmingly Hemedti\u2019s own Mahariya people. His uncle, Juma Dagalo, has toured the region enticing members of his own ethnic group to come and settle in Zurrug and six other proto-towns around it. Each one has the same school and clinic, recycled from the UN bases. The teachers and doctors are on Hemedti\u2019s payroll. Water towers, a practical and symbolic way of staking claim to land, have started to appear \u2013 all financed by the RSF. A report last year from the UN panel of experts for Darfur concluded that development around Zurrug was meant to lure people from the cities. It also warned that it had the potential to \u201cbecome a new source of conflict\u201d. The land issue is far from buried, and Darfur is part of the same negotiations between Sudan\u2019s transitional government and various rebel groups that saw Bashir offered up to the ICC. Whatever those talks conclude, the facts on the ground are already being changed, with mono-ethnic settlements expanding every day. After dark in Zurrug the children of the Mahariya gather around a single lightbulb to recite passages from the Qur\u2019an. During the day they sing songs that mash up anti-racism slogans with praise for the RSF. These anthems would ring hollow with the disenfranchised Zaghawa, who have formed committees in their camps and written letters to Sudan\u2019s new leadership. They have had no response and their leader, Mohamed Ibrahim, warns: \u201cIf we can\u2019t solve this peacefully, we will take up arms again.\u201d Klaas van Dijken is a journalist at Lighthousereport.nl",

Shore later described his democratic approach thus: \u201cTo see something ordinary, something you\u2019d see every day, and recognise it as a photographic possibility \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d Though dismissed at the time by many critics, his style has been enduringly influential and he is now recognised as one of the greatest living photographers.</p> <p>His approach was singular, not least for the amount of thought he put into depicting the seemingly ordinary. \u201cI have always been interested in everyday experience,\u201d he says, \u201cIt relates to an idea I had back then of what it might be like to pay attention to the average moments in your life, rather than just the dramatic moments. Attentiveness is self-awareness \u2013 you are aware of yourself paying attention. It was a different experience and I was nourished by it. I still am.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3940128a8cb06e8a6e964f02b918ba18777354c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3940128a8cb06e8a6e964f02b918ba18777354c7/0_0_3216_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Stephen Shore, Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971-1979. Courtesy Stephen Shore and Mack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While making the work that became <em>Uncommon Places</em>, Shore\u2019s attentiveness was further honed by his decision to use a large-format 8x10-inch camera. \u201cIt\u2019s unlike any other camera,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unwieldy. You have to physically lift it up on its tripod and move it to get the shot you want. That alone makes any decision you make very clear and visceral. The camera is no longer an extension of your eye; it\u2019s this tool that is outside of you.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps for this reason, Shore also carried a small 35mm Leica on his travels, allowing him to shoot more freely and instinctively. Now, having finally revisited those long unseen images, he has produced a new photobook, <em>Transparencies: Small Camera Works, 1971-1979</em>. It is intriguing, not least because the America that emerges from it seems quintessentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/may/17/stephen-shores-los-angeles-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Stephen Shore</a> and yet somehow different: the style less formal, the tone more intimate and spontaneous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ccc17d74f758dae2edf430845bce41fb8a5dc2d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccc17d74f758dae2edf430845bce41fb8a5dc2d6/0_0_3225_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Stephen Shore, Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971-1979. Courtesy Stephen Shore and Mack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There is, too, a distinct aura that emanates from these pictures, a sense of another America, recognisable but distant, that seems at times luminous in its very everydayness. This is not just to do with time passing, but with the singular quality of the Kodachrome colour slide film he was using, which, according to Shore, \u201cis the sharpest film that Kodak ever made\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feedcfe23e41c8edaebe5f7e550544bd4af6e334\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feedcfe23e41c8edaebe5f7e550544bd4af6e334/0_0_3210_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Stephen Shore, Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971-1979.

He captured shadows falling on city streets and, in a single dramatic moment, a cloud of thick smoke billowing ominously over a country road. There are several snapshot-like pictures of bad art hanging in drab commercial interiors, as well as signage of every kind, from the makeshift to the stylish: an unfinished US that seems by turns charming and downbeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b26e4e22950e7e70e574f8672f860716f7a4b40d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b26e4e22950e7e70e574f8672f860716f7a4b40d/0_0_3210_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Stephen Shore, Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971-1979.

Did he set out, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/sep/11/robert-frank-photography-work-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Robert Frank</a> before him, to look for the tarnished soul of America? \u201cWell, I was more fascinated by it than critical of it,\u201d he says, \u201cI had no political axe to grind. I felt more like an explorer.\u201d</p> <p>For his first road trip, he tells me, laughing, he purchased a safari-style suit from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, which was then a traditional sporting and outdoors outfitter \u2013 \u201cIt was where you went if you were going on an African safari or fly fishing in Norway.\u201d For his later trips, he wore a jump suit. \u201dBack then,\u201d he says, laughing, \u201cthey just seemed to me like the right outfits to wear if you were going to drive around exploring America for three months with a camera.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e72bc7189e6b174183bdf2ee011e043c0f3b6cde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e72bc7189e6b174183bdf2ee011e043c0f3b6cde/0_0_3210_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Stephen Shore, Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971-1979.

He bought his first photography book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/jul/18/walker-evans-america-moma-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Walker Evans\u2019s classic </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/jul/18/walker-evans-america-moma-in-pictures\" title=\"\">American Photographs</a></em>, aged 10, and, at 14, cold-called the esteemed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/oct/29/fashion-edward-steichens-trailblazing-vogue-photographs-vanity-fair-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Edward Steichen</a>, curator of photography at Moma in New York, to ask whether he could show him some work. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were not supposed to do that sort of thing,\u201d Shore told me, laughing. His precociousness paid off, however, and Steichen purchased three photographs, though they have yet to be exhibited there.</p> <p>Shore\u2019s next port of call was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/11/inside-andy-warhol-factory-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory</a> in New York. Having turned up unannounced, Shore hung out at the studio for three years, photographing between long bouts of \u201csitting around on couches waiting for something to happen\u201d. In 1971, he became the first living photographer to have an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, showing a sequence of early black and white images. A year later, he arranged 200 unframed Kodak colour snapshots in grids on the walls of the city\u2019s Light gallery. The exhibition was met with bemusement and consternation from critics, visitors and other photographers, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/mar/16/parmesan-and-politics-paul-strands-photographic-genius-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Paul Strand</a>, then in his 80s, who later told him that \u201chigher emotions could not be communicated in colour\u201d.</p> <p>Strand and Shore had conflicting views on the function of photography indicative of a wider generational shift in attitude \u2013 a move away from traditional pictorialism towards new ways of seeing that embraced colour and the more knowing strategies of conceptual art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548a9a06daa43cad70e4be96b4362f0b79424b26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548a9a06daa43cad70e4be96b4362f0b79424b26/0_0_3225_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Stephen Shore, Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971-1979.

In a way, they are a small, pivotal moment that prefigures the bigger one. \u201cThey were all taken at funny angles like I was shooting out of a car window, which I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat I was trying to do was take pictures that looked like they weren\u2019t composed. I wanted to get away from the visual conventions of photography, the weight of tradition that informed how you were supposed to structure a photograph. Basically, I wanted to take screwy pictures, but intentionally screwy pictures.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f45140b83c857517eb81abb0e6fa7807f91fdf25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f45140b83c857517eb81abb0e6fa7807f91fdf25/0_0_2160_3210/673.jpg\" alt=\"From Stephen Shore, Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971-1979.

He posts a daily iPhone photo on Instagram, where he has 171,000 followers. Over the past few weeks, he has posted pictures of his dog, Wally, a cute Havanese, his compost, a frozen lake, ice-covered branches, a portrait of Debbie Harry and several snaps of the interior of his car.</p> <p>\u201cIt means I work every day,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be diaristic or it can just be pictures I find interesting.

Shore later described his democratic approach thus: \u201cTo see something ordinary, something you\u2019d see every day, and recognise it as a photographic possibility \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d Though dismissed at the time by many critics, his style has been enduringly influential and he is now recognised as one of the greatest living photographers. His approach was singular, not least for the amount of thought he put into depicting the seemingly ordinary. \u201cI have always been interested in everyday experience,\u201d he says, \u201cIt relates to an idea I had back then of what it might be like to pay attention to the average moments in your life, rather than just the dramatic moments. Attentiveness is self-awareness \u2013 you are aware of yourself paying attention. It was a different experience and I was nourished by it. I still am.\u201d While making the work that became Uncommon Places, Shore\u2019s attentiveness was further honed by his decision to use a large-format 8x10-inch camera. \u201cIt\u2019s unlike any other camera,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unwieldy. You have to physically lift it up on its tripod and move it to get the shot you want. That alone makes any decision you make very clear and visceral. The camera is no longer an extension of your eye; it\u2019s this tool that is outside of you.\u201d Perhaps for this reason, Shore also carried a small 35mm Leica on his travels, allowing him to shoot more freely and instinctively. Now, having finally revisited those long unseen images, he has produced a new photobook, Transparencies: Small Camera Works, 1971-1979. It is intriguing, not least because the America that emerges from it seems quintessentially Stephen Shore and yet somehow different: the style less formal, the tone more intimate and spontaneous. There is, too, a distinct aura that emanates from these pictures, a sense of another America, recognisable but distant, that seems at times luminous in its very everydayness. This is not just to do with time passing, but with the singular quality of the Kodachrome colour slide film he was using, which, according to Shore, \u201cis the sharpest film that Kodak ever made\u201d. It also allowed him to home in on illuminating details: an elaborately embossed cowboy boot, a garishly patterned tie, a pair of scuffed brown shoes discarded on a fading orange mat. He captured shadows falling on city streets and, in a single dramatic moment, a cloud of thick smoke billowing ominously over a country road. There are several snapshot-like pictures of bad art hanging in drab commercial interiors, as well as signage of every kind, from the makeshift to the stylish: an unfinished US that seems by turns charming and downbeat. Elsewhere, it seems as if the country is unfolding before him, a flow of fast-food joints, freeways, roadside stores and billboards. Did he set out, like Robert Frank before him, to look for the tarnished soul of America? \u201cWell, I was more fascinated by it than critical of it,\u201d he says, \u201cI had no political axe to grind. I felt more like an explorer.\u201d For his first road trip, he tells me, laughing, he purchased a safari-style suit from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, which was then a traditional sporting and outdoors outfitter \u2013 \u201cIt was where you went if you were going on an African safari or fly fishing in Norway.\u201d For his later trips, he wore a jump suit. \u201dBack then,\u201d he says, laughing, \u201cthey just seemed to me like the right outfits to wear if you were going to drive around exploring America for three months with a camera.\u201d Did he draw much attention in his safari suit, lugging an old-fashioned plate camera on a tripod? \u201cStrangely, no,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one seemed to care at all that I was standing there, maybe six feet away, waiting for the light to change so I could photograph them. Often, they were more concerned when I was wandering about with the Leica. People would often chase me off their lawns and sidewalks.\u201d Shore\u2019s interest in photography began in childhood, when he was given a Kodak Junior darkroom set by a thoughtful uncle on his sixth birthday. He bought his first photography book, Walker Evans\u2019s classic American Photographs, aged 10, and, at 14, cold-called the esteemed Edward Steichen, curator of photography at Moma in New York, to ask whether he could show him some work. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were not supposed to do that sort of thing,\u201d Shore told me, laughing. His precociousness paid off, however, and Steichen purchased three photographs, though they have yet to be exhibited there. Shore\u2019s next port of call was Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory in New York. Having turned up unannounced, Shore hung out at the studio for three years, photographing between long bouts of \u201csitting around on couches waiting for something to happen\u201d. In 1971, he became the first living photographer to have an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, showing a sequence of early black and white images. A year later, he arranged 200 unframed Kodak colour snapshots in grids on the walls of the city\u2019s Light gallery. The exhibition was met with bemusement and consternation from critics, visitors and other photographers, including Paul Strand, then in his 80s, who later told him that \u201chigher emotions could not be communicated in colour\u201d. Strand and Shore had conflicting views on the function of photography indicative of a wider generational shift in attitude \u2013 a move away from traditional pictorialism towards new ways of seeing that embraced colour and the more knowing strategies of conceptual art. Before Shore embarked on the first of his many road trips, he made a tentative series of colour pictures in Union, New Jersey in 1971, six of which appear in Transparencies. In a way, they are a small, pivotal moment that prefigures the bigger one. \u201cThey were all taken at funny angles like I was shooting out of a car window, which I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat I was trying to do was take pictures that looked like they weren\u2019t composed. I wanted to get away from the visual conventions of photography, the weight of tradition that informed how you were supposed to structure a photograph. Basically, I wanted to take screwy pictures, but intentionally screwy pictures.\u201d Now aged 72, Stephen Shore is still interested in the possibilities of what might be called democratic photography. He posts a daily iPhone photo on Instagram, where he has 171,000 followers. Over the past few weeks, he has posted pictures of his dog, Wally, a cute Havanese, his compost, a frozen lake, ice-covered branches, a portrait of Debbie Harry and several snaps of the interior of his car. \u201cIt means I work every day,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be diaristic or it can just be pictures I find interesting. I recently posted a picture of the steering wheel of my car and someone commented something along the lines of: \u201cJeez, you\u2019ve finally run out of subject matter.\u201d So, I replied: \u2018Yep, that\u2019s it exactly.\u2019 I think most people understand my Instagram feed is not my gallery.\u201d In his 2017 Moma retrospective, he included three years of his Instagram pictures. \u201cPeople flew in from different parts of the world for the opening, he enthuses, \u201cand they all knew each other from Instagram. It\u2019s amazing in a way. I\u2019m interested in visual thinking, and there is something very personal and revealing about this kind of visual thinking that I just find fascinating.\u201d Still curious, still engaged, Stephen Shore\u2019s way of seeing remains singular and defiantly democratic. \u2022 Transparencies: Small Camera Works 1971\u20131979 is out this month (Mack, \u00a350).

      "bodyText": "Flood-hit towns are bracing for further downpours as Storm Jorge pushes Britain into the wettest February on record. February\u2019s third named storm is bringing rain, gales and snow, prompting weather warnings stretching from Cornwall to the north of Scotland and across to Northern Ireland. Pontypridd, which was also flooded two weeks ago, and the Ely area of Cardiff are among the worst affected areas. Residents have been advised to stay indoors to avoid winds of up to 70mph and have been warned that water levels could rise further. In Ireland, a lorry was overturned as winds battered the N59 road in Galway. The driver sustained no injuries, garda\u00ed said. Police declared a critical incident in flood-hit south Wales overnight, as Storm Jorge brought heavy rain and strong winds in what is Britain\u2019s fourth weekend of downpours. Cardiff council said its road team has answered about 100 incidents. It has deployed emergency teams to work throughout the night on flood defences and removing debris. More than 600 homes and a similar number of businesses have been hit in Wales, making up around a quarter of affected properties in the UK. South Wales police said emergency services, local authorities and other organisations were working continuously to ensure the safety and welfare of those affected, minimise damage to infrastructure and property, and minimise disruption. Supt Andy Kingdom said: \u201cIndications are that the rain is set to stop and river levels will soon recede. There is still significant surface water and debris on the roads throughout the force area so we would advise people only to travel if absolutely necessary.\u201d In Shropshire, the Environment agency repaired flood defences along the River Severn at Ironbridge and Beales Corner. The Met Office has declared this month as the wettest February since records began in 1862 \u2013 with a UK average of 202.1mm, beating the February 1990 figure of 193.4mm. There were six yellow weather warnings for rain, wind and snow in force across the country on Saturday morning. The rain warning was lifted before midday as showers eased but alerts remained in place for gales and the potential for power cuts, transport delays and large waves for coastal communities. The wind warnings last until 9am on Sunday across much of England and Wales and until 3pm the same day across Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, and northern England. Persistent snowfall was forecast over higher parts of Scotland, with up to 30cm predicted in some places, with warnings in place until noon on Monday, the Met Office said. A total of 83 flood warnings were in place across England and Wales, mostly in the south-west, along the English-Welsh border, and in Yorkshire. A further 211 \u201cflooding is possible\u201d alerts are also in force. The wind-chill factor will make temperatures feel close to freezing, said the Met Office. Heavy rain, which started with Storm Ciara and continued with Storm Dennis, contributed to record river levels as safety teams put in \u201cHerculean efforts\u201d to erect flood defences. Towns including Ironbridge and Bewdley along the Severn, and East Cowick in east Yorkshire, along the River Aire, are among the worst-hit areas in England. The Environment Agency said 1,000 staff per day had worked on flood defences and pumps, clearing debris and repairing damaged defences, erecting 3.7 miles of barriers. It said the country needed to brace itself for \u201cmore frequent periods of extreme weather like this\u201d because of the climate emergency.",

Six British women were so concerned that Weinstein would leak their identities to the media before or during his rape trial in New York that they were granted a highly unusual court order granting them international anonymity. Last week Weinstein was found guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another, a watershed victory for abuse victims more than two years after the first claims against the 67-year-old surfaced.

In their wake, says Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, a $2.7bn industry has grown up as private companies swoop in to offer their safety training services. \u201cHire us and we\u2019ll organise safety for your school, they say \u2013 but they\u2019re preying on the anguish of parents and school staff and the desperate feeling that we must \u2018do something\u2019,\u201d she said. But Jean-Paul Guilbault, chief executive of the Alice Training Institute, a company that runs shooter drills, insisted they don\u2019t fuel fear. \u201cOur children are living in it, they see it all around them on the news, they go to school every day and they are worried about it,\u201d he said. His company claims to have a methodology that could save people\u2019s lives in \u201cthe two minutes 20 seconds from when a shot goes off to when the first responders arrive\u201d. Drills did need to be age-appropriate, he said. \u201cBut when that alarm goes off, when the panic button is pushed, people should know how to secure a room.\u201d Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America (part of Everytown) believes active shooter drills are deflecting from the real issue in America, of easy access to guns. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a mass shooting, the gun lobby argues that schools need to be arming teachers and increasing the number of shooter drills,\u201d she said. \u201cBut children are much safer in schools than they are in their homes.\u201d Almost five million American children live in homes with unlocked, loaded guns. The focus needs to be on addressing gun violence \u201cbefore it ever gets to our schools\u201d, she said. Clements understands that parents are afraid for their children whenever the unthinkable happens \u2013 whether it\u2019s at a school, a cinema or, a shopping mall. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult situation for the schools,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause parents are demanding to know \u2018what are you doing to keep my kids safe?\u2019.\u201d But she is adamant that no one could have done anything differently at Sandy Hook. \u201cIn a real situation, you have no idea where the shooting is coming from\u201d, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong thing to do \u2013 you go on instinct.\u201d",

And she knows he approves of the majority of what she subsequently did to the interior, because he revisited last year, during the inaugural <a href=\"https://www.crystalpalaceart.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace Artists\u2019 Open House</a>, an annual event running over two consecutive weekends, which Jacobs established for the area.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the green of the kitchen walls \u2013 Little Greene\u2019s Sage &amp; Onions \u2013 paired with fresh turquoise on the window frame (Dulux Trade\u2019s Marine Splash) looked so outr\u00e9 when he later spotted it on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/annalysejacobs/?hl=en\" title=\"\">her Instagram</a> feed, that it prompted a visit from the property agent. \u201cIt just meant I had to sign an addendum to my contract saying I will return anything to neutral that my landlord doesn\u2019t like when I leave,\u201d she explains. He may want to reconsider this when the time comes. The flat has proved so popular on social media that a queue of wannabe tenants is already forming. \u201cI\u2019ve had people messaging me to ask if they can move in after me because they love it so much!\u201d she says.</p> <p>Decorating a rental property this thoroughly is rare. Most of us can\u2019t be bothered to invest so much time and effort, preferring instead to inject our own personality by hanging pictures on ubiquitous magnolia walls. Jacobs is not, however, most people. A bit of a creative dynamo, she switched from a career in the city in her 40s and, despite being a single mum with two children, successfully launched her own design business in 2015 specialising in home textiles, lighting, art and wallpaper. Furniture store Heal\u2019s snapped up her colourful cushions and table lamps, featuring bird and leaf motifs, within her first year of business and then gave her a pop-up concession at their Tottenham Court Road store in London, which ran for nine months in 2018.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0885532f5bc5029e36ab9e058cf36454134e0223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0885532f5bc5029e36ab9e058cf36454134e0223/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s home: Anna Jacobs in her front room.

I refuse to live in a house with a pink hall!\u201d then stormed upstairs and slammed his door. She compromised by keeping just the woodwork pink \u2013 Floris by Mylands \u2013 which bounces off the now white walls.</p> <p>Zach reaped his revenge by requesting a green and purple palette in his bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of purple, it\u2019s really hard to use,\u201d says Jacobs. She offered him a pre-selected limited choice of 12 shades, from which he could choose three or four. \u201cIt turned out beautifully and is now almost my favourite room in the house,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"19c6ff658f8693caf1352f9232f0cd0943032184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19c6ff658f8693caf1352f9232f0cd0943032184/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Stairway to heaven: blue stairs and stencilled art on the walls bring life to every corner of the house.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stairway to heaven: blue stairs and stencilled art on the walls bring life to every corner of the house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Balston/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rest of the interior was completed very much on a shoestring budget.

      "bodyText": "I am very conscious of how much colour affects my mood,\u201d says artist and designer Anna Jacobs, sitting on her pink velvet sofa in a zebra-print T-shirt and shocking pink trousers. \u201cI need it around me, it really improves my wellbeing.\u201d Glancing around her three-bedroom rental flat in Crystal Palace, south London, which she shares with her son Zach, 13, daughter Coco, 10, and Zuchon dog, Duffy, it\u2019s abundantly clear Jacobs is no fan of neutrals, preferring to surround herself with a zinging spectrum of vivacious hues \u2013 with an emphasis on aquatic shades for their \u201chealing, calming properties\u201d. She discovered the flat in autumn 2018 and, meeting the landlord prior to signing the lease, decided to be upfront about her decorating plans. \u201cIt turned out he was already a fan of my work and loved all the colour,\u201d says Jacobs. And she knows he approves of the majority of what she subsequently did to the interior, because he revisited last year, during the inaugural Crystal Palace Artists\u2019 Open House, an annual event running over two consecutive weekends, which Jacobs established for the area. Nevertheless, the green of the kitchen walls \u2013 Little Greene\u2019s Sage &amp; Onions \u2013 paired with fresh turquoise on the window frame (Dulux Trade\u2019s Marine Splash) looked so outr\u00e9 when he later spotted it on her Instagram feed, that it prompted a visit from the property agent. \u201cIt just meant I had to sign an addendum to my contract saying I will return anything to neutral that my landlord doesn\u2019t like when I leave,\u201d she explains. He may want to reconsider this when the time comes. The flat has proved so popular on social media that a queue of wannabe tenants is already forming. \u201cI\u2019ve had people messaging me to ask if they can move in after me because they love it so much!\u201d she says. Decorating a rental property this thoroughly is rare. Most of us can\u2019t be bothered to invest so much time and effort, preferring instead to inject our own personality by hanging pictures on ubiquitous magnolia walls. Jacobs is not, however, most people. A bit of a creative dynamo, she switched from a career in the city in her 40s and, despite being a single mum with two children, successfully launched her own design business in 2015 specialising in home textiles, lighting, art and wallpaper. Furniture store Heal\u2019s snapped up her colourful cushions and table lamps, featuring bird and leaf motifs, within her first year of business and then gave her a pop-up concession at their Tottenham Court Road store in London, which ran for nine months in 2018. Not all of Jacobs\u2019s application of colour theory went according to plan. She decided to paint her hallway pink to create a warm and welcoming entrance space, but her son Zach walked in and shouted: \u201cYou\u2019re joking! I refuse to live in a house with a pink hall!\u201d then stormed upstairs and slammed his door. She compromised by keeping just the woodwork pink \u2013 Floris by Mylands \u2013 which bounces off the now white walls. Zach reaped his revenge by requesting a green and purple palette in his bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of purple, it\u2019s really hard to use,\u201d says Jacobs. She offered him a pre-selected limited choice of 12 shades, from which he could choose three or four. \u201cIt turned out beautifully and is now almost my favourite room in the house,\u201d she says. The rest of the interior was completed very much on a shoestring budget. Most furniture is borrowed, inherited from friends, or from eBay, skips and flea markets and then upcycled with a lick of paint or self-adhesive wallpaper. Even the sofabed in the lounge was discovered, abandoned, by her children, who dragged it up the hill and sat on it outside the front door, pleading to keep it. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrid old 1980s grey chenille sofa, but it was free and huge. So, I bought some pink velvet Ikea curtains and threw them over it. When they get dirty I just shove them in the washing machine.\u201d Pragmatic, resourceful and inspiring, Jacobs has an infectious positivity that is surely proof we all need to bring a bit of colour into our lives. Crystal Palace Artists\u2019 Open House is 11am-6pm, 29 February \u2013 1 March and 7-8 March (crystalpalaceart.co.uk). Anna Jacobs is at annajacobsart.com.",

      "body": "<p>Eighteen months ago, I was combing through the Apollo 11 mission logs, looking at the timelines and events for something unique that we might focus on to celebrate the 50th anniversary of humankind\u2019s first landing on the moon. Last year, that idea became the BBC World Service podcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/26/13-minutes-to-moon-kevin-pietersen-beast-man-where-this-service-will-review\" title=\"\"><em>13 Minutes to the Moon</em></a>.</p> <p>As the series drew to a close, it became clear that there was unfinished business. Some of the flight controllers who had been present for the Apollo 11 landing had also worked on another, arguably more dramatic, endeavour \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/16/apollo-13-mission-control-unsung-heroes-jim-lovell-interview\" title=\"\">ill-fated flight of Apollo 13</a>.</p> <p>That mission was crippled by an explosion while en route to the moon and nearly 200,000 miles from Earth. The story was popularised in 1995 in a Hollywood film starring Tom Hanks, but I knew that there was much more behind the narrative than the movie had managed to tell. So for the new series of the podcast I wanted to get under the skin of the thing and focus not just on the crew who flew the mission, but also on those who saved it \u2013 the incredible team of flight controllers who worked round the clock in shifts for 87 hours.</p> <p>We were after more than the story, gripping though it is. I wanted to understand what lessons we all might learn from what became arguably Nasa\u2019s finest achievement: the recovery from catastrophe in deep space and the rescue of a crew from what looked like certain death. How do you lead a team through that? How do you keep yourselves going in the face of something so hopeless? It felt to me like there should be something all of us might learn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f6582121c349ac49e893736dcd1c5a248f2fd7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f6582121c349ac49e893736dcd1c5a248f2fd7d/0_106_2094_1256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"marilyn lovell and her children watch as the apollo 13 mission lifts off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apollo 13 leader Jim Lovell\u2019s wife Marilyn (far right) and their children watch as the mission lifts off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yale Joel/The Life Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apollo 13 was the United States\u2019 third mission to land humans on the moon. Launched on 11 April 1970, it followed less than a year after Neil Armstrong\u2019s successful first lunar landing and famous small step. Commander Jim Lovell, a former US navy test pilot and spaceflight veteran, led a crew of two rookie astronauts, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise. Things had gone awry even before launch. Swigert was a late inclusion in the crew, having been swapped in at the last moment to replace his colleague Ken Mattingly who had been exposed to a case of German measles. But this drama in the buildup to the mission drew only moderate interest from the media.</p> <p>To the American public, sending people to the moon, a feat that had existed only at the limits of their imagination just 12 months earlier, had now taken on the air of something almost routine. There was much less press hoopla about the launch itself and television networks across America declined the opportunity to interrupt their schedules and include live inserts of Apollo 13\u2019s early inflight broadcasts. The view of the editorial teams back on Earth was clear: astronauts had landed on the moon not once but twice already and, with much of the novelty gone, the Apollo 13 mission deserved little attention, or so they thought.</p> <p>Fifty-six hours in, with the crew nearly 200,000 miles from Earth, an explosion in one of Apollo 13\u2019s two oxygen tanks left the command module Odyssey fatally damaged. Coasting in space, with alarms flashing all around them, bleeding oxygen and losing electrical power, Lovell, Swigert and Haise were suddenly in deep trouble.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bf2d6a489aab69d7c00b14d8577c06b2a785216\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bf2d6a489aab69d7c00b14d8577c06b2a785216/0_0_1389_2105/660.jpg\" alt=\"the apollo 13 rocket lifts off from launch pad a of the kennedy space center, cape canaveral, florida, 11 april 1970\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Apollo 13 rocket lifts off from launch pad A of the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida, 11 April 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lunar landing was called off and over the next four days, the crew and mission control would find themselves fending off deadly threats over and over again. They would solve problems one day, only to discover a host of new complications that might kill the crew the next. But they kept working together, across hundreds of thousands of miles of empty space, with everything against them, until they got the crew all the way back.</p> <p>On 17 April 1970, with the world watching, Apollo 13 reached Earth again. The capsule, surrounded by an inferno created by the heat of re-entry into the atmosphere, became impossible to contact by radio. At mission control, they watched and waited in silence.</p> <p>We tend to mythologise these stories of outrageous survival to the extent that it becomes difficult to tease fact apart from fiction. This is doubly true of Apollo 13. The popular retelling goes something like this: Apollo 13 was rescued by an elite team led by flight director, Gene Kranz, for whom failure was \u201cnot an option\u201d. The rescue was executed calmly and deftly without any doubts that it would succeed.</p> <p>But you only have to listen to the opening hours of the mission control recordings and the space-to-ground radio transmissions to know that was not the case. After the rupture of the oxygen tank, both the crew and their flight controllers struggled to make sense of what was happening.</p> <p>That the mission control team was caught flat-footed in the opening phase of the accident is strangely reassuring. Nobody, not even the exhaustively drilled Nasa flight controllers, is able to glide swan-like through chaos like that. Initially there was no structure. There were misdiagnoses and mistakes. The vehicle had failed so totally that it fleetingly crossed the mind of at least one flight controller that he should simply pack up and go home.</p> <p>Exemplary leadership is what got them through that first hour. Kranz kept his team and the vehicle together masterfully, buying time enough to start solving the problem. When reviewing the response to sudden crises, we often overlook that chaotic period, simply because it has little real structure and doesn\u2019t appear to move things forward. But preventing a team from disintegrating in the face of an apparently overwhelming challenge is a feat in itself. The average age of the flight control team was 27; some were freshly graduated from university. During routine mission operations you would never guess that; their statements are so clear and confident, their knowledge so deep. But immediately after the accident there are times when, listening to the mission audio loop, you hear a hint of fearful youth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nasa had learned to be wary \u2013 they knew that plans hatched in the\u00a0heat of the moment often harbour flaws</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After a torrid hour of failed troubleshooting, a new shift of flight controllers arrived, as well as a new flight director, waiting to take their turn. They were at this point still in the thick of the fight and the temptation for Kranz to keep going and refuse to relinquish control must have been enormous. Nevertheless he passed the baton to the incoming team, recognising that fresh eyes and minds were what was needed. This is the true spirit of teamwork \u2013 the ability to know when your part is done, when someone new can bring something better than you can.</p> <p>That ability to relinquish control and delegate authority didn\u2019t stop there. The Apollo missions were complex endeavours. Nobody could be across it all and Nasa knew that in mission control it had a team of people who, as a whole, were far greater than the sum of their individual parts.</p> <p>In approaching this crisis, their delegation of authority and deference to expertise is almost total. In the face of high-stakes scenarios, it is tempting to wrest control from more junior colleagues. But in 1970 the approach of mission control was quite different. They empowered their most junior team members, giving them total ownership of their specialist stations. They would interrogate their recommendations but not second-guess them. It is a lesson that industry and wider society has largely failed to heed.</p> <p>The other aspect of the Apollo 13 mission that I found fascinating during our interviews with the team was the depth of Nasa\u2019s preparation. I had always imagined Apollo 13 to be a feat of wall-to-wall improvisation. After all, the rupture of the oxygen tank had torn the heart out of the command module, leaving it dead, forcing the astronauts to use the lunar module as a lifeboat and means of propulsion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c3780ff12ff711f3de1b850d890e1f1a82af5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29c3780ff12ff711f3de1b850d890e1f1a82af5f/0_0_2299_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"jack swigert (right) and one of the other two crew members work an improvised co2 scrubber made from parts found aboard the apollo 13 lunar module\" width=\"1000\" height=\"881\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Swigert (right) and one of the other two crew members work an improvised CO2 scrubber made from parts found aboard the Apollo 13 lunar module.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what surprised me was how little of the response to the accident demanded improvised solutions. Nasa had learned to be wary of creativity and inventiveness in the heat of the moment. That doesn\u2019t mean it refused to improvise, nor that it wasn\u2019t capable of doing it well \u2013 only that it knew plans hatched in the heat of battle often harbour hidden flaws.</p> <p>Incredibly, Nasa had already rehearsed many of the contingency and fallback plans required to rescue Apollo 13. In earlier missions, it had experimented with using the lunar module\u2019s engines to drive both it and the command module. It had a checklist ready to manage the sudden powering down of the command module that was required to save dwindling battery power. Nasa even had a procedure for flying the spacecraft without their primary navigation and guidance computer. And then, when finally it had no choice but to improvise, it did it with same obsession and attention to detail it brought to everything else.</p> <p>Finally, we should turn to the things we think we know about the mission through retellings in popular culture. The best quotes are often misquotes. For example nobody ever said: \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d The precise words were: \u201cHouston, we\u2019ve had a problem.\u201d That is just a glitch in tense.</p> <p>More significant is the mission\u2019s other catchphrase \u2013 \u201cFailure is not an option\u201d \u2013 which we have taken to characterise Nasa as the sort of steel-willed organisation that steadfastly refuses to entertain the possibility of failure. But in truth nobody uttered those words during the mission. The quote itself derives from a line of script in the 1995 movie and Kranz then borrowed it as the title for his autobiography, published in 2000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13e167080290dfebf2233d8f18833f878d0f6926\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13e167080290dfebf2233d8f18833f878d0f6926/0_0_3626_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the scene at mission control minutes after the recovery of the apollo 13 crew. flight director gene kranz is on the far right with a cigar in his mouth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scene at mission control minutes after the recovery of the Apollo 13 crew.

      "bodyText": "Eighteen months ago, I was combing through the Apollo 11 mission logs, looking at the timelines and events for something unique that we might focus on to celebrate the 50th anniversary of humankind\u2019s first landing on the moon. Last year, that idea became the BBC World Service podcast 13 Minutes to the Moon. As the series drew to a close, it became clear that there was unfinished business. Some of the flight controllers who had been present for the Apollo 11 landing had also worked on another, arguably more dramatic, endeavour \u2013 the ill-fated flight of Apollo 13. That mission was crippled by an explosion while en route to the moon and nearly 200,000 miles from Earth. The story was popularised in 1995 in a Hollywood film starring Tom Hanks, but I knew that there was much more behind the narrative than the movie had managed to tell. So for the new series of the podcast I wanted to get under the skin of the thing and focus not just on the crew who flew the mission, but also on those who saved it \u2013 the incredible team of flight controllers who worked round the clock in shifts for 87 hours. We were after more than the story, gripping though it is. I wanted to understand what lessons we all might learn from what became arguably Nasa\u2019s finest achievement: the recovery from catastrophe in deep space and the rescue of a crew from what looked like certain death. How do you lead a team through that? How do you keep yourselves going in the face of something so hopeless? It felt to me like there should be something all of us might learn. Apollo 13 was the United States\u2019 third mission to land humans on the moon. Launched on 11 April 1970, it followed less than a year after Neil Armstrong\u2019s successful first lunar landing and famous small step. Commander Jim Lovell, a former US navy test pilot and spaceflight veteran, led a crew of two rookie astronauts, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise. Things had gone awry even before launch. Swigert was a late inclusion in the crew, having been swapped in at the last moment to replace his colleague Ken Mattingly who had been exposed to a case of German measles. But this drama in the buildup to the mission drew only moderate interest from the media. To the American public, sending people to the moon, a feat that had existed only at the limits of their imagination just 12 months earlier, had now taken on the air of something almost routine. There was much less press hoopla about the launch itself and television networks across America declined the opportunity to interrupt their schedules and include live inserts of Apollo 13\u2019s early inflight broadcasts. The view of the editorial teams back on Earth was clear: astronauts had landed on the moon not once but twice already and, with much of the novelty gone, the Apollo 13 mission deserved little attention, or so they thought. Fifty-six hours in, with the crew nearly 200,000 miles from Earth, an explosion in one of Apollo 13\u2019s two oxygen tanks left the command module Odyssey fatally damaged. Coasting in space, with alarms flashing all around them, bleeding oxygen and losing electrical power, Lovell, Swigert and Haise were suddenly in deep trouble. The lunar landing was called off and over the next four days, the crew and mission control would find themselves fending off deadly threats over and over again. They would solve problems one day, only to discover a host of new complications that might kill the crew the next. But they kept working together, across hundreds of thousands of miles of empty space, with everything against them, until they got the crew all the way back. On 17 April 1970, with the world watching, Apollo 13 reached Earth again. The capsule, surrounded by an inferno created by the heat of re-entry into the atmosphere, became impossible to contact by radio. At mission control, they watched and waited in silence. We tend to mythologise these stories of outrageous survival to the extent that it becomes difficult to tease fact apart from fiction. This is doubly true of Apollo 13. The popular retelling goes something like this: Apollo 13 was rescued by an elite team led by flight director, Gene Kranz, for whom failure was \u201cnot an option\u201d. The rescue was executed calmly and deftly without any doubts that it would succeed. But you only have to listen to the opening hours of the mission control recordings and the space-to-ground radio transmissions to know that was not the case. After the rupture of the oxygen tank, both the crew and their flight controllers struggled to make sense of what was happening. That the mission control team was caught flat-footed in the opening phase of the accident is strangely reassuring. Nobody, not even the exhaustively drilled Nasa flight controllers, is able to glide swan-like through chaos like that. Initially there was no structure. There were misdiagnoses and mistakes. The vehicle had failed so totally that it fleetingly crossed the mind of at least one flight controller that he should simply pack up and go home. Exemplary leadership is what got them through that first hour. Kranz kept his team and the vehicle together masterfully, buying time enough to start solving the problem. When reviewing the response to sudden crises, we often overlook that chaotic period, simply because it has little real structure and doesn\u2019t appear to move things forward. But preventing a team from disintegrating in the face of an apparently overwhelming challenge is a feat in itself. The average age of the flight control team was 27; some were freshly graduated from university. During routine mission operations you would never guess that; their statements are so clear and confident, their knowledge so deep. But immediately after the accident there are times when, listening to the mission audio loop, you hear a hint of fearful youth. After a torrid hour of failed troubleshooting, a new shift of flight controllers arrived, as well as a new flight director, waiting to take their turn. They were at this point still in the thick of the fight and the temptation for Kranz to keep going and refuse to relinquish control must have been enormous. Nevertheless he passed the baton to the incoming team, recognising that fresh eyes and minds were what was needed. This is the true spirit of teamwork \u2013 the ability to know when your part is done, when someone new can bring something better than you can. That ability to relinquish control and delegate authority didn\u2019t stop there. The Apollo missions were complex endeavours. Nobody could be across it all and Nasa knew that in mission control it had a team of people who, as a whole, were far greater than the sum of their individual parts. In approaching this crisis, their delegation of authority and deference to expertise is almost total. In the face of high-stakes scenarios, it is tempting to wrest control from more junior colleagues. But in 1970 the approach of mission control was quite different. They empowered their most junior team members, giving them total ownership of their specialist stations. They would interrogate their recommendations but not second-guess them. It is a lesson that industry and wider society has largely failed to heed. The other aspect of the Apollo 13 mission that I found fascinating during our interviews with the team was the depth of Nasa\u2019s preparation. I had always imagined Apollo 13 to be a feat of wall-to-wall improvisation. After all, the rupture of the oxygen tank had torn the heart out of the command module, leaving it dead, forcing the astronauts to use the lunar module as a lifeboat and means of propulsion. But what surprised me was how little of the response to the accident demanded improvised solutions. Nasa had learned to be wary of creativity and inventiveness in the heat of the moment. That doesn\u2019t mean it refused to improvise, nor that it wasn\u2019t capable of doing it well \u2013 only that it knew plans hatched in the heat of battle often harbour hidden flaws. Incredibly, Nasa had already rehearsed many of the contingency and fallback plans required to rescue Apollo 13. In earlier missions, it had experimented with using the lunar module\u2019s engines to drive both it and the command module. It had a checklist ready to manage the sudden powering down of the command module that was required to save dwindling battery power. Nasa even had a procedure for flying the spacecraft without their primary navigation and guidance computer. And then, when finally it had no choice but to improvise, it did it with same obsession and attention to detail it brought to everything else. Finally, we should turn to the things we think we know about the mission through retellings in popular culture. The best quotes are often misquotes. For example nobody ever said: \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d The precise words were: \u201cHouston, we\u2019ve had a problem.\u201d That is just a glitch in tense. More significant is the mission\u2019s other catchphrase \u2013 \u201cFailure is not an option\u201d \u2013 which we have taken to characterise Nasa as the sort of steel-willed organisation that steadfastly refuses to entertain the possibility of failure. But in truth nobody uttered those words during the mission. The quote itself derives from a line of script in the 1995 movie and Kranz then borrowed it as the title for his autobiography, published in 2000. And while the flight controllers enjoyed regurgitating that particular strand of mythology to us, it was clear that the possibility of failure remained very real throughout the mission. Fifty years later, several of the flight controllers were still moved to tears when describing the moment when Apollo 13 finally reappeared after the communications blackout. Despite their protestations, it became obvious that they all must have known how perilous the scenario was. But, importantly, what they didn\u2019t do was devote any time to contemplating disaster. As flight director Glynn Lunney, who relieved Kranz\u2019s first shift told me: \u201cIf you spend your time thinking about the crew dying, you\u2019re only going to make that eventuality more likely.\u201d \u2022 The second series of 13 Minutes to the Moon starts on the BBC World Service at 11.30am on Wednesday 11 March.

This week\u2019s announcement will be no different, except in one respect \u2013 staff will probably be handed a fraction of the usual 10% to 18% of salary. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/07/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonus-to-lowest-level-since-1953\" title=\"\">Last year it was 3%</a>, this year it could be as low as 2%.</p> <p>Under a more conventional business structure, the bonus might have disappeared altogether, but John Lewis Partnership is an employee-owned organisation and must listen to the concerns of its 81,500 staff working in 50 department stores and 338 Waitrose shops.</p> <p>A report by thinktank Ownership at Work has found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/feb/23/worker-owned-businesses-we-get-paid-the-same-regardless-of-role\" title=\"\">employee ownership</a>, whether achieved through direct shareholdings or an employee-owned trust, proves popular wherever the company operates and whatever the industry.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are an owner you recognise the need to boost your skills levels,\u201d says the report. \u201cYou know that the company\u2019s productivity feeds directly into your pay packet and the company\u2019s success. There is no need to fake enthusiasm or force yourself to go the extra mile when the business in hand is very much your business.\u201d</p> <p>Admittedly, all the companies in the report have grown since becoming employee-owned and have yet to suffer the kind of sales decline and cost increases that have put John Lewis on the rack. But many have disaster planning in place \u2013 or at least plans to cope with a contraction in sales \u2013 that staff have been involved in compiling, which has in turn made workers feel more secure.</p> <p>Employee ownership usually starts with a gift. John Lewis handed the Peter Jones department store to workers in the 1920s. Employee ownership at the engineering firm Arup and the chemicals firm Scott Bader, named after Ernest Bader and his wife, Dora Scott, date back more than 50 years, while more recent examples include Richer Sounds, donated by founder Julian Richer, and Riverford Organic Farmers, the vegetable-box provider started by farmer Guy Singh-Watson.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat influence in David Cameron\u2019s coalition government translated into improved tax breaks for owners and staff, but the wider adoption of employee ownership has been slow. The Employee Ownership Association set up an inquiry into the ways different ownership structures affect a curse of the modern workplace: low productivity. Since the 2008 financial crash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-productivity-britain-must-solve-the-puzzle\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s productivity rate</a> \u2013 the output of each worker per hour \u2013 has failed to rise more than a fraction.</p> <p>Could the traditional joint stock company with absentee owners be holding back productivity in an era when people want more from time at work than just a pay packet? Part of the inquiry examined how smaller employee-owned firms functioned to see if they, too, suffered from the low investment and sluggish output that characterised what Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane calls \u201czombie firms\u201d dragging down the UK productivity rate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd0cdb4de88d65b7bd4eaa451a6f6c5aed81ccaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0cdb4de88d65b7bd4eaa451a6f6c5aed81ccaa/0_333_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Richer of Richer Sounds gave away his business to employee control.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Richer of Richer Sounds gave away his business to employee control.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report\u2019s author, Stefan Stern, chose four businesses for his study: Community Dental Services, a worker buyout from the NHS based in Sharnbrook, near Bedford; Childbase Partnership, a nurseries business based in Newport Pagnell, near Milton Keynes; Union Industries, a maker of industrial doors, based in Hunslet on the edge of Leeds; and Gripple, a manufacturer of wires and cables, based in Sheffield.</p> <p>Stern, a business writer and former head of the High Pay Centre, which monitors executive remuneration, says he put together focus groups made up of 10-12 colleagues working at all levels in their businesses. The report is due out in a couple of weeks. \u201cWhat do the workers tell us? That employee ownership binds colleagues together, supports innovation, enterprise and risk-taking, wins engagement and commitment, and rewards people well for their efforts.\u201d </p> <p>Stern says he \u201ckicked the tyres\u201d of each organisation and couldn\u2019t find anyone who wasn\u2019t positive. . Workers can buy shares under some structures (and be loaned the money to do so) or be gifted them. Either way, they end up owning the business.</p> <p>\u201cEmployee ownership is not necessarily an easy option, especially when a business changes from a more conventional ownership structure. But it was quite hard to elicit serious criticisms or concerns from these witnesses, none of whom seemed to want to go back to working for any of their previous employers,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The nearest comparison in the mainstream corporate world in terms of holding staff close is probably Toyota, the world\u2019s largest car maker. Its management, developed by its founder, puts workers into teams and gives them responsibilities for monitoring standards, incorporating new ideas and developing new products.</p> <p>Even looser structures seem to occur in worker-owned businesses, as staff question traditional command-and-control management methods.</p> <p>\u201cEmployee ownership is clearly liberating for many workers,\u201d says Stern. \u201cBut with that freedom to operate comes responsibility, accountability and a genuine sense of ownership \u2013 the benefits which accrue from that, but also the seriousness that goes with it. Taking ownership means thinking harder about how you work and how you make money.\u201d</p> <p>A survey of managers at the same businesses, released this week, showed they need to make an even bigger leap, shedding any bombast and egotistical tendencies on their way to the boardroom.</p> <p>As Mike Thompson, founder and chairman of Childbase Partnership, says: \u201cYou have to understand, as a leader of an employee-owned business, that you have to be able to make it not about yourself. It has to be about the people.\u201d</p> <p>Under the heading \u201cletting go\u201d, Stern says it is counter-productive to be bossy.</p> <p>Alison Reid, chief executive of Community Dental Services, says: \u201cPeople know what they need to do on the ground, and we need to create this structure that enables them, that doesn\u2019t fetter them, and so trying to free that up was a really important part of our approach.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acab43fb4426d6cbb2446ae1fb8f63db8ad38066\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acab43fb4426d6cbb2446ae1fb8f63db8ad38066/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Singh-Watson, of Riverford Organic Farmers, based in South Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guy Singh-Watson, of Riverford Organic Farmers, based in South Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a recognition that some decisions take longer when the staff are more involved. For instance, setting aside the cash to open new outlets is a move that will need more than a quick board meeting. But hundreds of decisions are taken every day by middle managers in conventional businesses without much concern that anyone wants to waste money or embark on crazy escapades.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue with autocratic leadership is if everyone goes through you, then you are the bottleneck,\u201d according to Andrew Lane, managing director of Union Industries. \u201cWe like to think that we do the big checks but let people get on with it ... I\u2019ve only got so much time in the day to ask for something.\u201d</p> <p>This is important when growth is hurtling along. Gripple has 700 employees and a turnover of \u00a390m. Half its staff are in the UK and half are overseas.</p> <p>Ed Stubbs, its managing director, says Gripple has averaged growth of about 15% a year for more than 10 years after setting a 10%-a-year growth target, along with the aim that 25% of sales come from products less than five years old.</p> <p>\u201cWe set out in 2016 a 2021 plan of getting to \u00a3100m turnover. And in 2016 it meant to hit that target we had to generate \u00a325m of products that didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This kind of drive can appear intimidating to any worker who just wants a nine-to-five job and no responsibility beyond their immediate tasks. That can easily be dispelled when word gets around that profits can increase several-fold and bonuses can be taken tax-free up to \u00a33,500 a year.</p> <p>At Union Industries, Lane says: \u201c[Colleagues] have bought cars that are way beyond what they could hope to do and go on holidays ... Our company did that, our model provided them with those opportunities. It\u2019s so uplifting.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturers make up only a small proportion of employee-owned firms. Professional services firms account for 50% of the sector, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Architects\u2019 practices, engineering firms and accountants have a long history of partnership structures and it is not much of leap to becoming employee-owned.</p> <p>Stern says that a sector with a \u00a330bn turnover and hundreds of successful companies needs to be taken more seriously across the economy. If that happens, in the future there could be more employee-owned household names to stand alongside John Lewis and Waitrose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"50a323bc85cf639f2d26fa717b16427b72da6a23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50a323bc85cf639f2d26fa717b16427b72da6a23/1070_0_1229_1536/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shaun Revill of Gripple.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shaun Revill of Gripple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018If we lose someone, it\u2019s often because they can\u2019t cope with our flat structure\u2019<br>Shaun Revill, Gripple</h2> <p>Shaun Revill says that a 99% staff retention rate means the number of new recruits at wire maker Gripple is limited, but those that do arrive tend to leave in the first year if they struggle to cope with the active involvement that comes with being an owner and a worker.</p> <p>\u201cIf we lose someone it is usually in the first year and it often happens because they can\u2019t cope with the flat structure and open environment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means that when we recruit we focus as much on how the person will fit in as on their skill set.\u201d</p> <p>Revill manages an in-house marketing and video department that most firms would outsource.</p> <p>He studied media production at the University of Lincoln and went straight into a job making videos for the steel maker Corus.

      "bodyText": "The moment when staff at John Lewis and Waitrose are told the size of their bonus is always much-anticipated. This week\u2019s announcement will be no different, except in one respect \u2013 staff will probably be handed a fraction of the usual 10% to 18% of salary. Last year it was 3%, this year it could be as low as 2%. Under a more conventional business structure, the bonus might have disappeared altogether, but John Lewis Partnership is an employee-owned organisation and must listen to the concerns of its 81,500 staff working in 50 department stores and 338 Waitrose shops. A report by thinktank Ownership at Work has found that employee ownership, whether achieved through direct shareholdings or an employee-owned trust, proves popular wherever the company operates and whatever the industry. \u201cWhen you are an owner you recognise the need to boost your skills levels,\u201d says the report. \u201cYou know that the company\u2019s productivity feeds directly into your pay packet and the company\u2019s success. There is no need to fake enthusiasm or force yourself to go the extra mile when the business in hand is very much your business.\u201d Admittedly, all the companies in the report have grown since becoming employee-owned and have yet to suffer the kind of sales decline and cost increases that have put John Lewis on the rack. But many have disaster planning in place \u2013 or at least plans to cope with a contraction in sales \u2013 that staff have been involved in compiling, which has in turn made workers feel more secure. Employee ownership usually starts with a gift. John Lewis handed the Peter Jones department store to workers in the 1920s. Employee ownership at the engineering firm Arup and the chemicals firm Scott Bader, named after Ernest Bader and his wife, Dora Scott, date back more than 50 years, while more recent examples include Richer Sounds, donated by founder Julian Richer, and Riverford Organic Farmers, the vegetable-box provider started by farmer Guy Singh-Watson. Liberal Democrat influence in David Cameron\u2019s coalition government translated into improved tax breaks for owners and staff, but the wider adoption of employee ownership has been slow. The Employee Ownership Association set up an inquiry into the ways different ownership structures affect a curse of the modern workplace: low productivity. Since the 2008 financial crash, Britain\u2019s productivity rate \u2013 the output of each worker per hour \u2013 has failed to rise more than a fraction. Could the traditional joint stock company with absentee owners be holding back productivity in an era when people want more from time at work than just a pay packet? Part of the inquiry examined how smaller employee-owned firms functioned to see if they, too, suffered from the low investment and sluggish output that characterised what Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane calls \u201czombie firms\u201d dragging down the UK productivity rate. The report\u2019s author, Stefan Stern, chose four businesses for his study: Community Dental Services, a worker buyout from the NHS based in Sharnbrook, near Bedford; Childbase Partnership, a nurseries business based in Newport Pagnell, near Milton Keynes; Union Industries, a maker of industrial doors, based in Hunslet on the edge of Leeds; and Gripple, a manufacturer of wires and cables, based in Sheffield. Stern, a business writer and former head of the High Pay Centre, which monitors executive remuneration, says he put together focus groups made up of 10-12 colleagues working at all levels in their businesses. The report is due out in a couple of weeks. \u201cWhat do the workers tell us? That employee ownership binds colleagues together, supports innovation, enterprise and risk-taking, wins engagement and commitment, and rewards people well for their efforts.\u201d Stern says he \u201ckicked the tyres\u201d of each organisation and couldn\u2019t find anyone who wasn\u2019t positive. . Workers can buy shares under some structures (and be loaned the money to do so) or be gifted them. Either way, they end up owning the business. \u201cEmployee ownership is not necessarily an easy option, especially when a business changes from a more conventional ownership structure. But it was quite hard to elicit serious criticisms or concerns from these witnesses, none of whom seemed to want to go back to working for any of their previous employers,\u201d he says. The nearest comparison in the mainstream corporate world in terms of holding staff close is probably Toyota, the world\u2019s largest car maker. Its management, developed by its founder, puts workers into teams and gives them responsibilities for monitoring standards, incorporating new ideas and developing new products. Even looser structures seem to occur in worker-owned businesses, as staff question traditional command-and-control management methods. \u201cEmployee ownership is clearly liberating for many workers,\u201d says Stern. \u201cBut with that freedom to operate comes responsibility, accountability and a genuine sense of ownership \u2013 the benefits which accrue from that, but also the seriousness that goes with it. Taking ownership means thinking harder about how you work and how you make money.\u201d A survey of managers at the same businesses, released this week, showed they need to make an even bigger leap, shedding any bombast and egotistical tendencies on their way to the boardroom. As Mike Thompson, founder and chairman of Childbase Partnership, says: \u201cYou have to understand, as a leader of an employee-owned business, that you have to be able to make it not about yourself. It has to be about the people.\u201d Under the heading \u201cletting go\u201d, Stern says it is counter-productive to be bossy. Alison Reid, chief executive of Community Dental Services, says: \u201cPeople know what they need to do on the ground, and we need to create this structure that enables them, that doesn\u2019t fetter them, and so trying to free that up was a really important part of our approach.\u201d There is a recognition that some decisions take longer when the staff are more involved. For instance, setting aside the cash to open new outlets is a move that will need more than a quick board meeting. But hundreds of decisions are taken every day by middle managers in conventional businesses without much concern that anyone wants to waste money or embark on crazy escapades. \u201cThe issue with autocratic leadership is if everyone goes through you, then you are the bottleneck,\u201d according to Andrew Lane, managing director of Union Industries. \u201cWe like to think that we do the big checks but let people get on with it ... I\u2019ve only got so much time in the day to ask for something.\u201d This is important when growth is hurtling along. Gripple has 700 employees and a turnover of \u00a390m. Half its staff are in the UK and half are overseas. Ed Stubbs, its managing director, says Gripple has averaged growth of about 15% a year for more than 10 years after setting a 10%-a-year growth target, along with the aim that 25% of sales come from products less than five years old. \u201cWe set out in 2016 a 2021 plan of getting to \u00a3100m turnover. And in 2016 it meant to hit that target we had to generate \u00a325m of products that didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. This kind of drive can appear intimidating to any worker who just wants a nine-to-five job and no responsibility beyond their immediate tasks. That can easily be dispelled when word gets around that profits can increase several-fold and bonuses can be taken tax-free up to \u00a33,500 a year. At Union Industries, Lane says: \u201c[Colleagues] have bought cars that are way beyond what they could hope to do and go on holidays ... Our company did that, our model provided them with those opportunities. It\u2019s so uplifting.\u201d Manufacturers make up only a small proportion of employee-owned firms. Professional services firms account for 50% of the sector, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Architects\u2019 practices, engineering firms and accountants have a long history of partnership structures and it is not much of leap to becoming employee-owned. Stern says that a sector with a \u00a330bn turnover and hundreds of successful companies needs to be taken more seriously across the economy. If that happens, in the future there could be more employee-owned household names to stand alongside John Lewis and Waitrose. \u2018If we lose someone, it\u2019s often because they can\u2019t cope with our flat structure\u2019 Shaun Revill, Gripple Shaun Revill says that a 99% staff retention rate means the number of new recruits at wire maker Gripple is limited, but those that do arrive tend to leave in the first year if they struggle to cope with the active involvement that comes with being an owner and a worker. \u201cIf we lose someone it is usually in the first year and it often happens because they can\u2019t cope with the flat structure and open environment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means that when we recruit we focus as much on how the person will fit in as on their skill set.\u201d Revill manages an in-house marketing and video department that most firms would outsource. He studied media production at the University of Lincoln and went straight into a job making videos for the steel maker Corus. He joined \u00a390m-turnover Gripple Automation in Sheffield to do much the same, but persuaded his bosses to widen the department\u2019s remit as the firm expanded abroad. \u201cThere is a huge level of trust that what I asked for has been worked through as an idea. And when it doesn\u2019t work, that we will do something about it. It\u2019s in all our interests that we constantly review what we do.\u201d Two of the eight people in his department sit on a board of the Glide group, which oversees Gripple and five other businesses, all employee-owned since the founder handed over the business to his staff in 2011. \u201cThey see all the financial details of the groups and discuss strategic objectives. It is great for their development and careers to be so involved,\u201d he says. You care about what happens. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t switch off\u2019 Angela Brown, Childbase Trade unions are considered irrelevant in employee-owned businesses, but Angela Brown comes closest to the role of shop steward. As chair of the partnership council at the nursery business Childbase, she speaks regularly to the 44 workers that represent staff on each nursery site. Childbase\u2019s founder, Mike Thompson, began shifting the firm\u2019s ownership to its employees in 2000 with a succession of share issues. In 2017, the workers agreed to move to a fully owned trust structure with everyone owning the same stake. One reason, says Brown, followed concerns that lower-paid staff could ill afford to buy shares each year, even under tax-free schemes. The reps meet every three months, \u201cbut everyone knows they can ring me when they have a question,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have been asked about pay levels and gone back to reassess them, and after that things have changed. But that is a benefit to the organisation. \u201cIf your team isn\u2019t happy, that is going to be a problem for the manager, so talking it through is important.\u201d Brown, a former deputy nursery manager, joined eight years ago, thinking she would stay just a year or so. But the business, she says, encourages leadership through devolved decision-making and offering education and skills training. \u201cWhen you are engaged you care about what happens, but that doesn\u2019t mean someone can\u2019t switch off when they go home. I do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "World stock markets are expected to fall further next week after the first surveys of China\u2019s economic health since the coronavirus outbreak showed factory output has plunged and the country\u2019s service sectors have contracted. Illustrating how the virus could wreck the economic forecasts of other affected countries, the world\u2019s second largest economy reported that manufacturing production levels dropped to record lows in February. Stock markets tumbled last week as the virus spread to four continents and UN health officials upgraded the level of threat from the virus to \u201cvery high\u201d. It is likely the fresh data, which measures the economic impact of Beijing\u2019s efforts to clamp down on the virus, will further spook investors who sent global markets tumbling 11% last week in the worst seven-day period for stocks since the 2008 financial crash. With factories forced to remain closed after the traditional lunar new year holiday shutdown, China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), a widely watched measure of economic activity, fell further in February than at any time in the last 12 years, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said. The bureau found a significant collapse in domestic and export orders and a contraction of the country\u2019s burgeoning service sector. Similar surveys expected next month covering Japan and South Korea, both seriously affected by the coronavirus outbreak, could prolong the rout on global stock markets, analysts said. The outbreak has already disrupted supplies to factories in Europe, where companies have struggled to access vital components sourced from east Asia. Investors expect to find out in the next few days whether the outbreak is accelerating in the US, the world\u2019s biggest economy, and how far central banks and governments are prepared to go to deal with an epidemic. \u201cRight now the market is saying that this is unbounded. We don\u2019t know what the limits are and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to peak,\u201d said Graham Tanaka, the chief investment officer at New York-based Tanaka Capital. Stock markets globally lost about $5tn (\u00a33.9tn) of value last week, as measured by the MSCI all-country index. Last weekend China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, told local officials that low-risk areas should \u201cresume full production and normal life\u201d. The government reported that larger factories reached 85.6% of their capacity by the middle of last week. Analysts at ING said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t as positive as it sounds. Even if China\u2018s factory production can recover in March, it will still face the risk of a low level of export orders. This is because the supply chain will continue to be broken, this time in South Korea, Japan, Europe, and the US, where Covid-19 has begun to spread.\u201d Unofficial reports show that factories outside Hubei province, where the virus started, could be working at no more than 75% of their capacity and many nearer 25% to 50% while millions of workers remain trapped in their home province, unable to travel back to their place of work. Hundreds of corporate events have been cancelled or postponed in recent days in response to calls for a clampdown on large gatherings On Saturday the organisers of the Mipim property fair, which was due to take place in Cannes, France, from 10 to 13 March, was postponed until 2-5 June. Organiser Reed Midem said it was postponing the event, which is attended by thousands of architects and property professionals, due to \u201cgrowing concerns related to the coronavirus\u201d.

The latest data from UK Finance, the voice of the banking industry, put the amount stolen by criminals in the first six months of last year at \u00a3616m. Of this, \u00a3207.5m went in scams where people were duped into authorising a payment to an account controlled by a criminal.</p> <p>Officially known as authorised push payment (APP) fraud, it includes cases where criminals hack email accounts and convince consumers to send large sums to criminal accounts.

Offline, all involved have to remain modest in appearance, according to Carlos. \u201cIf you are only 15 and gaining \u00a36,000 a week, you need to learn how to not put that on display in real life in front of your family and teachers,\u201d he said. Most of the runners are still at school and have no idea what the accounts are being used for.</p> <p>In his experience, gangs can make between \u00a34,000 and \u00a380,000 a week. Overall, he made some \u00a325,000, but has little to show for it. \u201c<em>El dinero f\u00e1cil se va f\u00e1cil,</em>\u201d he says \u2013 easy come, easy go. The money he earns he spends \u2013 on clothes, watches, \u00a34,000-worth of gifts for a former girlfriend and small presents for his family.</p> <p>The plugs who run the fraud are mostly local and self-taught. Personal information about potential targets can be bought on the dark web, as can kits to initiate a fraud. Once a person has been convinced to transfer money, they\u2019re told to pay it into an account belonging to one of the runners, from where it is quickly transferred to the hacker\u2019s account.</p> <p>\u201cWe make sure that for each fraud attempt, we possess the victim\u2019s phone number,\u201d said Carlos. \u201cIf they receive a message about a transfer made from their account and they want to block it, they\u2019d be unable to alert their bank as we would be calling their number non-stop to keep the phone busy, giving us enough time to withdraw the money.\u201d</p> <p>Once an account is found to have been used in a fraud, it is blocked by the bank, so a new account is needed for each theft. Carlos\u2019s account and one opened by his cousin were shut down after being used, which alerted his family to what he was part of. But leaving a gang is not easy \u2013 it can bring threats of aggression, robbery and death. One runner who refused to pass on money to a plug had his home burgled and his furniture destroyed.</p> <p>A report for fraud prevention body Cifas last year found that one in five people thought being a money mule was a \u201creasonable activity\u201d. The organisation sees a spike in cases at the beginning of university terms as students get involved.</p> <p>What many fail to realise is how this is linked to organised crime, said Amber Burridge, Cifas\u2019s head of fraud intelligence. \u201cPeople do not understand, or maybe choose not to understand, that money muling is a form of money laundering and a criminal offence,\u201d she added. \u201cThe use of social media there is a great example of how easy it is to lure an audience into getting involved in these activities.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos left his gang after, he says, he saw the consequences of his actions \u2013 such as his cousin\u2019s account being blocked \u2013 and escaped without retribution thanks to having a wide group of friends who would defend him if he was threatened by the hacker. Now his earnings from the restaurant are paid either by cheque or into a parent\u2019s bank account.</p> <p>The runners, plugs and middles who run the hacking operations are still active around his south London home, he says, and a large number of his friends are involved.

Bloomberg News first reported that Elliott Management has taken a \u201csizable stake\u201d and \u201cand plans to push for changes at the social media company, including replacing Dorsey\u201d. Paul Singer, the billionaire founder of Elliott Management, is a Republican mega-donor who opposed Donald Trump during the real-estate magnate\u2019s run for the presidential nomination but has since come onside. After a White House visit in February 2017, Trump said Singer \u201cwas very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, \u2018Never Trump\u2019, and Paul just left, and he\u2019s given us his total support and it\u2019s all about unification\u201d. Trump famously communicates with the public largely through Twitter, at the expense of traditional media strategy. Twitter made headlines in October when it announced a ban on political advertising. Its use and potential manipulation by politicians of all stripes, from Trump to Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg, remains a source of fierce contention. Dorsey, a co-founder of Twitter, is also chief executive of Square, an online payment company. In November, he announced a plan to live and work in Africa for part of each year. It was reported that those moves were motivations for Singer\u2019s desire to push Dorsey out. Other stakeholders have voiced concern about Dorsey\u2019s leadership and Twitter has seen its share price struggle, although it recently reported quarterly revenue above $1bn for the first time. News of the Elliott stake saw Twitter\u2019s share price rise on Friday, during general market slides in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Elliott Management is an activist investor, which means it regularly pushes for change in companies in which it buys shares. Singer has even taken on whole countries: in 2016, after a relentless campaign, he secured a partial repayment of debts by Argentina, arising from its financial collapse in the early 2000s. Neither Elliott nor Twitter immediately offered comment.",

But the policy shift appears to be intended to force the EU and Nato to support Ankara\u2019s new military campaign in the north-western province of Idlib, Syria\u2019s last rebel stronghold, where thousands of Turkish soldiers are supporting opposition forces facing an onslaught from regime forces backed by Russian air power. Erdo\u011fan said Turkey could not handle a new wave of migration, in an apparent reference to the growing humanitarian crisis in Idlib. The Idlib offensive has pushed almost a million displaced civilians toward the Syrian-Turkish border, and hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians remain between advancing Syrian government forces backed by Russia and rebel fighters supported by Turkey. In the largest single loss of life to Turkish forces since their country became involved in the Syria conflict, at least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in an airstrike on Thursday night. After officials briefed on Friday that police, coastguard and border guards had been ordered to stand down, meaning passage to Europe would be no longer prevented, thousands of refugees and migrants made haste to Turkey\u2019s borders with Greece and Bulgaria.

      "bodyText": "Born in 1967 in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Mat Osman is a founding member and the bassist of English rock band Suede. He studied economics at the London School of Economics, graduating in 1989, the same year Suede were formed. The band\u2019s debut album won the Mercury music prize in 1993 and their latest album, The Blue Hour, was released in 2018 to critical acclaim. His debut novel, The Ruins, a story about two brothers, music and danger, is out now (Repeater Books). 1. Art Them (Redfern Gallery, London) This fascinating exhibition was by a group of artists, musicians and party throwers in the 70s, including Derek Jarman, Duggie Fields and Andrew Logan. There\u2019s an artist featured who died young called Luciana Martinez de la Rosa \u2013 her collages and paintings are amazing. They\u2019re hugely stealable as album covers \u2013 so vibrant and human. I\u2019d never heard of the group before, because they got wiped out by punk, so the show is almost like an alternative British history. I\u2019m a sucker for lost artists and one-hit wonders; people who make something beautiful and then just disappear. 2. TV What We Do in the Shadows (FX/BBC Two) You\u2019d think a show about vampires would be all about power, but What We Do in the Shadows is about a group of people just trying to get by. It\u2019s a TV remake of a film by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi about suburban vampires in New York City. They\u2019re living a boring life, until an ancient vampire from the old country arrives and announces a plan to take over Staten Island. But the vampires are hapless. They try to recruit people, but fail miserably. It\u2019s funny and charming. Matt Berry plays a 1,000-year-old sex maniac, and it\u2019s the best he\u2019s ever been. 3. Book Universal Harvester by John Darnielle When I was writing The Ruins, I couldn\u2019t find many good books written by musicians. Then I found this by John Darnielle from the indie band Mountain Goats. It\u2019s about a guy who lives in rural Iowa in the 90s and works at a VHS store. Customers keep returning the videos as strange scenes have been recorded over them. He then sets out to find out who is responsible. It has the most exquisite sense of place and time and is genuinely unsettling. It would make an amazing film or TV programme. It could be a slower, darker sequel to Stranger Things. 4. Podcast Intrigue: Tunnel 29 (BBC Sounds) This is about a group of students who build a tunnel under the Berlin wall to get East German families into the west. It\u2019s a documentary and it\u2019s insanely tense; there are mines, the roof collapses and the tunnel floods. I was driving and I pulled over three or four times, because I couldn\u2019t get the next episodes to stream. I was standing in every service station between Manchester and Birmingham with my phone in the air, trying to download the next episode, as I had to find out what happened next. It\u2019s thrilling and beautifully done. 5. Music Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore I discovered Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore a few years ago and they are the strangest band.

      "body": "<p>These are worrying times for Graham Potter. The Brighton manager watched his side suffer the ignominy of a first home defeat in the top flight at the hands of their bitter rivals that leaves them still waiting to record a first victory in 2020.</p> <p>Jordan Ayew\u2019s seventh Premier League goal of the season was enough to record a famous win for Crystal Palace as they gained sweet revenge for losing twice against these opponents last season. After the promise shown in the first half of the campaign under their new manager, it looks like being another spring filled with anxiety on the south coast.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/jack-grealish-aston-villa-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final\">Indispensable Jack Grealish offers hope for Villa against City machine | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe created enough to get something from the game and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a sore one for us,\u201d said Potter. \u201cSometimes luck is a commodity that you need and we didn\u2019t have too much of that. But I believe in what we\u2019re trying to do and now we have to pull it all together.\u201d</p> <p>Yet despite his positivity, Brighton remain the only side in England\u2019s top four divisions not to have won this year, even though they registered 24 shots on target against Palace. Shane Duffy\u2019s absence due to a family funeral had forced Potter to revert to a back four as Glenn Murray also made way against his former club. His counterpart, Roy Hodgson, named an unchanged side after Palace finally ended their own winless run last week against Newcastle to edge them closer to guaranteed survival for an unprecedented eighth successive season, with the 72-year-old close to agreeing a one-year extension to his contract. After this result, their supporters might be hoping chairman Steve Parish can persuade him to stay on for another decade.</p> <p>As usual on these occasions, there was a significant police presence outside the ground and there was no shortage of action in the opening exchanges on the pitch despite the early kick-off. A glorious pass from James McArthur which picked out Christian Benteke in the fifth minute could easily have given Palace the perfect start but the striker\u2019s volley was nowhere near the target. His confidence in front of goal may be almost non-existent these days but the Belgian is always a danger in the air and it was from his header that Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 had Palace\u2019s next opportunity, only to be denied by a good save from Mat Ryan.</p> <p>Brighton were slow to find their rhythm but, having dominated large parts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/16/crystal-palace-brighton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 1-1 draw between these sides at Selhurst Park in December</a>, started to do so again. Neal Maupay\u2019s shot was well saved by Vicente Guaita after a mistake from Wilfried Zaha gifted away possession, with the Ivory Coast forward \u2013 most definitely the pantomime villain in these parts \u2013 then getting himself into a heated exchange with Ezequiel Schelotto after the Brighton substitute kicked the ball at him after it went out of play. Replays appeared to show Zaha spitting on the ground rather than directly at the Argentinian. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t lose his head,\u201d admitted a relieved Hodgson afterwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Solly March and Gary Cahill both then spurned excellent chances for their respective sides so an entertaining first half came to an end with no breakthrough but plenty of incident. There was another straight after the restart when Lewis Dunk\u2019s goalbound header was inadvertently cleared by Maupay when the ball struck him full in the face. The Frenchman had ended his eight-match goal drought last week having previously not scored since the trip to Selhurst Park before Christmas and he could not take another excellent opportunity when the ball fell to him following Ja\u00efro Riedewald\u2019s slide tackle.</p> <p>Potter\u2019s decision to introduce Murray alongside Maupay up front with 25 minutes to play was an indication of Brighton\u2019s desire to claim all three points but it was Ayew who provided the game\u2019s decisive moment after a brilliant reverse pass from Benteke.</p>",

      "bodyText": "These are worrying times for Graham Potter. The Brighton manager watched his side suffer the ignominy of a first home defeat in the top flight at the hands of their bitter rivals that leaves them still waiting to record a first victory in 2020. Jordan Ayew\u2019s seventh Premier League goal of the season was enough to record a famous win for Crystal Palace as they gained sweet revenge for losing twice against these opponents last season. After the promise shown in the first half of the campaign under their new manager, it looks like being another spring filled with anxiety on the south coast. \u201cWe created enough to get something from the game and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a sore one for us,\u201d said Potter. \u201cSometimes luck is a commodity that you need and we didn\u2019t have too much of that. But I believe in what we\u2019re trying to do and now we have to pull it all together.\u201d Yet despite his positivity, Brighton remain the only side in England\u2019s top four divisions not to have won this year, even though they registered 24 shots on target against Palace. Shane Duffy\u2019s absence due to a family funeral had forced Potter to revert to a back four as Glenn Murray also made way against his former club. His counterpart, Roy Hodgson, named an unchanged side after Palace finally ended their own winless run last week against Newcastle to edge them closer to guaranteed survival for an unprecedented eighth successive season, with the 72-year-old close to agreeing a one-year extension to his contract. After this result, their supporters might be hoping chairman Steve Parish can persuade him to stay on for another decade. As usual on these occasions, there was a significant police presence outside the ground and there was no shortage of action in the opening exchanges on the pitch despite the early kick-off. A glorious pass from James McArthur which picked out Christian Benteke in the fifth minute could easily have given Palace the perfect start but the striker\u2019s volley was nowhere near the target. His confidence in front of goal may be almost non-existent these days but the Belgian is always a danger in the air and it was from his header that Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 had Palace\u2019s next opportunity, only to be denied by a good save from Mat Ryan. Brighton were slow to find their rhythm but, having dominated large parts of the 1-1 draw between these sides at Selhurst Park in December, started to do so again. Neal Maupay\u2019s shot was well saved by Vicente Guaita after a mistake from Wilfried Zaha gifted away possession, with the Ivory Coast forward \u2013 most definitely the pantomime villain in these parts \u2013 then getting himself into a heated exchange with Ezequiel Schelotto after the Brighton substitute kicked the ball at him after it went out of play. Replays appeared to show Zaha spitting on the ground rather than directly at the Argentinian. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t lose his head,\u201d admitted a relieved Hodgson afterwards. Solly March and Gary Cahill both then spurned excellent chances for their respective sides so an entertaining first half came to an end with no breakthrough but plenty of incident. There was another straight after the restart when Lewis Dunk\u2019s goalbound header was inadvertently cleared by Maupay when the ball struck him full in the face. The Frenchman had ended his eight-match goal drought last week having previously not scored since the trip to Selhurst Park before Christmas and he could not take another excellent opportunity when the ball fell to him following Ja\u00efro Riedewald\u2019s slide tackle. Potter\u2019s decision to introduce Murray alongside Maupay up front with 25 minutes to play was an indication of Brighton\u2019s desire to claim all three points but it was Ayew who provided the game\u2019s decisive moment after a brilliant reverse pass from Benteke.",

These two have developed an unlikely rivalry in the last 44 years, one fuelled fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry\">boiling coffee, loose change</a>, loose talk and even looser bowels (<a href=\"https://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11738245.albion-v-palace-poogate-culprit-uncovered-at-last/\">it was the coach driver</a>, by the way). </p> <p>A fixture that was dormant for a long time has been revived in the last decade by Brighton\u2019s improvement. There was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/18/gus-poyet-fuming-excrement-crystal-palace\">in/famous Championship play-off semi-final of 2013</a>, won by Palace. Brighton were eventually promoted to the Premier League four years later, which has meant regular top-flight meetings between the teams for the first time since Crystal Palace\u2019s Team of the Eighties were relegated in 1981. (By the way, if you haven\u2019t seen <a href=\"https://sport.bt.com/football/team-of-the-eighties-the-latest-bt-sport-film-charts-the-rise-and-fall-of-crystal-palace-in-the-1980s-S11364409914569\">the BT Sport documentary on that team</a>, it\u2019s massively enjoyable.)</p> <p>This year it\u2019s Brighton who are worried about relegation. Although they have done many good things under the impressive Graham Potter, they haven\u2019t won a game this year and are only four points off the bottom three. They need points now, because six of their next seven games are against the Premier League elite. (We\u2019re including Wolves and Arsenal in that, though you may disagree, and that\u2019s just fine.)</p> <p>Palace should be okay. No Premier League side has scored fewer goals this season, but their outstanding defence \u2013 easily the best in the bottom half of the table \u2013 has kept them out of trouble until now. Their win over Newcastle last weekend ended a long winless run and moved them nine points clear of the bottom three. Don\u2019t be surprised if it kicks off a bit later as well.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 12.30pm.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T11:37:43.130Z\">at 11.37am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with Ed Aarons\u2019 report from the Amex Stadium. Bye! Grahan Potter speaks \u201cIt\u2019s a sore one for us. We did a lot well in the game, made chances and were the better team before they scored. That\u2019s football; you have to put the ball in the net. I feel for the boys. We have to dust ourselves down and focus on what we\u2019ve done well.\u201d There\u2019s more relegation action to come at 3pm, with Bournemouth, Southampton and West Ham all in action. Join Scott Murray for all the latest news. Peep peep! Palace move up to 12th \u2013 and, more importantly, 12 points clear of the bottom three \u2013 with a hard-fought victory in the M23 derby. Jordan Ayew scored the only goal with 20 minutes remaining. Palace are surely safe now. Brighton, who have some very tough games coming up, are in a rare old relegation dogfight. 90+3 min: Zaha misses an open goal! That was a comedy of errors. Tosun ran clear from inside his own half, all the way to the edge of the Brighton penalty area. He tried to go round Guaita but overran the ball absurdly. Zaha, who was alongside him all the way, kept running and poked the ball against the outside of the post from a tight angle. 90+2 min Brighton appeal for a penalty when van Aanholt tackles Alzate in the area. At first it looked a good challenge, but on reflection I\u2019m not sure he got the ball. VAR isn\u2019t interested anyway. I\u2019d like to see that again. 90+1 min ... and Tosun will head it away at the near post. Poor delivery. 90+1 min Corner to Brighton on the left. Mooy will take it... 90 min Three added minutes. 89 min A weak 20-yard shot from Jahanbakhsh goes well wide. 87 min Palace break two against two. Benteke tries to play it through to Zaha, who is matched for speed by Burn. That\u2019s Benteke\u2019s last contribution: he is replaced by Cenk Tosun. 86 min Brighton are struggling to put Palace under any pressure. They\u2019ve been poor since going behind. 84 min van Aanholt\u2019s corner is cleared at the near post. 83 min van Aanholt combines well with Ayew to win a corner for Palace. That leads to another corner, this time on the right... 82 min Brighton make their final change, with the Colombian international Steven Alzate replacing Yves Bissouma. 80 min The underlapping Burn wins a corner for Brighton. Mooy\u2019s corner leads to a game of head tennis until Propper\u2019s excellent volley from the edge of the area is blocked. Then Mooy\u2019s long-range curler is headed behindby van Aanholt. I think it was going wide anyway. The second corner comes to nothing. 79 min \u201cNot strictly speaking a football question, Rob,\u201d writes Adrian Delatouche, \u201cbut has anyone tried oat yoghurt?\u201d Not now mate I\u2019m drinking a cow. 78 min Alireza Jahanbakhsh replaces Martin Montoya for Brighton. 76 min If Brighton lose this, they are in trouble. Their next seven league games are Wolves (A), Arsenal (H), Leicester (A), Man Utd (H), Norwich (A), Liverpool (H) and Man City (H). 72 min Benteke has played admirably today. He\u2019s in awful form, certainly in front of goal, and a lot of players hide from the ball in that situation. Yet he has wanted it all the time, even after that ugly early miss, and his courage has been rewarded. Well I never. A long goalkick was collected by Benteke, who moseyed infield from the left wing and played a superb reverse pass to put Ayew clear on the left side of the area. He opened his body and slid a low first-time shot that went through Ryan and into the net. Palace have stolen the lead on the break! 70 min Mooy\u2019s deflected shot from 25 yards is easily saved by Guaita. 69 min Maupay turns neatly inside Ward on the left of the area - but then he shoots straight at Guaita. There have been a lot of buts in today\u2019s MBM: good play but crap finish, that sort of thing. 66 min That\u2019s March\u2019s last touch: Glenn Murray, 97, has come on to replace him. He knows how to score a goal. 65 min March nutmegs van Aanholt and slides a low cross into the area. It\u2019s intercepted by the sliding Riedewald - but the ball comes back to March, who takes it down and spanks a half-volley over the bar. 64 min Anyone out there? 63 min A dodgy backpass from March goes straight to Benteke, whose toepoke is blocked at close range by Ryan. It wasn\u2019t the most confident attempt, though Ryan narrowed the angle well. 63 min \u201cFull disclosure, however, sounds like an excellent thriller,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cPerhaps one not with Liam Neeson.\u201d 62 min This is a decent spell for Brighton. Mooy finds a rare bit of space, 25 yards from goal, but drags a low shot wide of the near post. 59 min: Chance for Palace! van Aanholt\u2019s corner from the right is headed wide by Benteke at the near post. He did well to get above the defenders on the six-yard line but mistimed his connection completely. In many ways that was a better chance than the volley in the first half. 57 min Montoya is booked for running over Zaha. 55 min: Maupay misses another chance! Riedewald\u2019s sliding tackle on Mooy accidentally diverted the ball over Cahill and into the path of Maupay, 13 yards from goal. The ball sat up beautifully for him to lash first time towards goal, but he hit it straight at Guaita. 53 min Trossard\u2019s imaginative curler from the left edge of the area drifts just wide of the far post, with Guaita scrambling across his line. He looks a very classy footballer. Brighton, who started very nervously, have been the better side for the last half hour or so. 51 min The hail has stopped, by the way, and the sun is out again. Maupay runs at the Palace defence, reaching the edge of the area before being challenged. The ball ricochets to Trossard, whose first touch is poor. 48 min: Maupay clears off the line ... for Palace! Mooy\u2019s corner from the left was thumped towards goal by the head of Dunk on the six-yard line. Guaita was beaten but the ball hit Maupay on the line, flattening him in the process. 47 min Mooy turns on the halfway line and clips a good ball over the top to Maupay. He takes too long waiting for the ball to drop, however, and Dann gets back to put the ball behind for a corner. 46 min Peep peep! Brighton begin the second half. Palace have made a change, with Jairo Riedewald replacing the injured James McCarthy. \u201cA day that only rolls around once every four years?\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cSounds perfect for a Benteke goal...\u201d But it\u2019s not 23 April? \u201cYou may not have seen any goals yet but I have,\u201d says J.R. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m watching Hull v Leeds. Not only did I see a goal but I saw Luke Ayling do the Kevin Nolan chicken dance. Here in the U.S., ESPN shows several games a week from the non-VAR leagues. I was looking at the schedule for tomorrow and at 5:55 AM they have listed \u2018Coventry Town v Sunderland\u2019. Oh, ESPN! At least they\u2019re trying, I guess.\u201d Half-time reading Peep peep! Both sides missed good chances in a fairly scruffy half, the most notable event of which was Wilfried Zaha\u2019s run-in with the Brighton substitite Ezequiel Schelotto. The first half started in sunshine; it has ended amid a hailstorm. See you in 15 minutes for more weather news. 45 min Lovely play from Benteke, who dances past a couple of players on the left side of the box and cracks a shot that is very well blocked by Webster. McCarthy\u2019s deep corner is met by Cahill, whose heads hit the back of Burn. 43 min March shoots straight at Guaita from long range. 39 min While Webster is treated, the substitute Schelotto starts sledging Zaha, who asks the referee what\u2019s what. When the corner is taken, Gary Cahill\u2019s downward header at the far post bounces just over the bar. At first it looked like a bad miss - he was only six yards out - but he had to clamber over a defender to get to the ball, which is why his header went straight into the ground. 36 min Zaha goes on a weaving run and hits a shot that is blocked. Just before that, Webster jumped into Benteke\u2019s elbow, prompting a VAR review. Benteke is cleared by VAR. I don\u2019t think he did much wrong there, even though Webster is now being treated for a burst mooth. 35 min: March misses a great chance! It was a lovely move from Brighton. Maupay received a pass on the halfway line, turned and played a fine angled pass to Trossard on the left. He flicked a beautiful low cross with the outside of the right foot to find the unmarked March at the far post, but he pulled his first-time shot into the side netting. He should have scored. 33 min Benteke is booked for a late challenge on Dunk. 33 min March cuts infield from the right and hits a low shot that is comfortably saved at the near post by the sprawling Guaita. 32 min Brighton continue to dominate possession, but it\u2019s all a little slow and sterile. The pitch doesn\u2019t help. 30 min Schelotto kicked the ball at Zaha, that\u2019s why he was booked. Zaha spat in the general direction of the Brighton subs, though the replays don\u2019t show how close they were. Presumably not very close, or he\u2019d have been in trouble. His body language was fairly provocative, mind you. 29 min Zaha is booed as he goes on a long, winding run down the left. Propper dispossesses him to great cheers. 27 min Hello! Zaha is getting involved with one of the Brighton substitutes, Schelotto. I\u2019m not sure what happened there, although replays showed Zaha spitting and putting his hands to his ears in front of the Brighton fans. Schelotto is booked, Zaha is not. 26 min Full disclosure: this isn\u2019t a thriller. 23 min Another Mooy corner leads to a bit of a scramble in the Palace six-yard box. Eventually Dunk\u2019s looping header - which I\u2019m pretty sure was going just wide anyway - is headed clear by the leaping van Aanholt. 21 min This is a much better spell for Brighton, who have Palace pinned back in their half. 19 min Mooy\u2019s corner from the left leads to a scramble in the six-yard box, with Guaita eventually flapping the ball away from the stretching Dunk. Moments later, March\u2019s driven cross-shot is comfortably held by the diving Guaita. 18 min Brighton win their first corner. March\u2019s inswinger from the right is nutted away at the near post by Benteke. Brighton win the ball back through Montoya, whose tackle on the halfway line turns into a good pass to Maupay on the left of the area. He sidefoots a disguised shot to the near post, where Guaita gets down to palm the ball away. 14 min There are a few nerves around the ground, and Palace look the more relaxed, purposeful side. 12 min Brighton have have two thirds of the possession so far; Palace have had three thirds of the chances. 10 min: Another chance for Palace! Cahill\u2019s angled free-kick from the halfway line was won in the air emphatically by Benteke on the edge of the area. He headed it down to Kouyate, whose close-range poke was blocked by Ryan. 9 min Zaha has his first run at Burn, who does well to stay with him and make an important interception. 7 min There have been a few strong tackles in midfield, from Brighton in particular, though nothing excessive. Yet. 4 min: Benteke misses an excellent chance! McArthur moves confidently through midfield and clips a fine pass over the top. Benteke gets behind the defence, watches the ball all the way ... and then shins it miles wide. The home fans loved that. In his defence, it was an awkward ball to volley as it came over his shoulder, but that was still a bit of blooper gold. 4 min Maupay has the first shot on goal, a scuffed drive on the turn from just inside the area. It dribbles wide of the near pst. 3 min In fact, the pitch looks terrible by modern standards, really uneven and slow. 2 min You\u2019d expect Brighton to dominate possession, and the match has started that way. The pitch doesn\u2019t look in perfect condition, mind. 1 min Peep peep! We\u2019re underway. Brighton are in blue and white stripes; Palace are wearing their black away strip. \u201cThe police are out in force at the Amex today, mostly standing around and blocking routes as we all try to get to the stadium,\u201d writes my colleague Steph Fincham. \u201cYou might remember they claimed to find knives and knuckledusters on Palace fans a couple of years ago, though later admitted they were lying. Anyway, the sun is shining.\u201d I love unlikely rivalries. Gillingham v Swindon was all we ever used to talk about at school. \u2018A display of uncontrolled manic aggression\u2019 This, from Simon Burnton, is a cracking read on the origins of the Brighton/Palace rivalry. The return fixture at Selhurst Park, just before Christmas, ended 1-1. Wilfried Zaha was on one that night, as he often is against Brighton. Pre-match reading Brighton (4-2-3-1) Ryan; Montoya, Dunk, Webster, Burn; Propper, Bissouma; Trossard, Mooy, March; Maupay. Substitutes: Button, Schelotto, Stephens, Gross, Jahanbakhsh, Murray, Alzate. Crystal Palace (4-1-4-1) Guaita; Ward, Dann, Cahill, van Aanholt; McCarthy; Ayew, Kouyate, McArthur, Zaha; Benteke. Substitutes: Hennessey, Kelly, Milivojevic, Meyer, Townsend, Riedewald, Tosun. Referee Martin Atkinson. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Brighton v Crystal Palace from the Amex Stadium. These two have developed an unlikely rivalry in the last 44 years, one fuelled fuelled by boiling coffee, loose change, loose talk and even looser bowels (it was the coach driver, by the way). A fixture that was dormant for a long time has been revived in the last decade by Brighton\u2019s improvement. There was the in/famous Championship play-off semi-final of 2013, won by Palace. Brighton were eventually promoted to the Premier League four years later, which has meant regular top-flight meetings between the teams for the first time since Crystal Palace\u2019s Team of the Eighties were relegated in 1981. (By the way, if you haven\u2019t seen the BT Sport documentary on that team, it\u2019s massively enjoyable.) This year it\u2019s Brighton who are worried about relegation. Although they have done many good things under the impressive Graham Potter, they haven\u2019t won a game this year and are only four points off the bottom three. They need points now, because six of their next seven games are against the Premier League elite. (We\u2019re including Wolves and Arsenal in that, though you may disagree, and that\u2019s just fine.) Palace should be okay. No Premier League side has scored fewer goals this season, but their outstanding defence \u2013 easily the best in the bottom half of the table \u2013 has kept them out of trouble until now. Their win over Newcastle last weekend ended a long winless run and moved them nine points clear of the bottom three. Don\u2019t be surprised if it kicks off a bit later as well. Kick off is at 12.30pm.",

      "bodyText": "If you were in search of a scientifically minded, steadying presence to guide the country through the potential fallout of the coronavirus, you could not do much worse than Vice-President Mike Pence. This being the Donald Trump administration, however, where qualifications and expertise are often seen as prohibitive factors for top jobs, that\u2019s exactly who we\u2019ve been given. Cutting to the heart of the matter with her characteristic bluntness, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez this week pointed out the absurdity of placing Pence in charge of a potentially looming health crisis. \u201cMike Pence literally does not believe in science,\u201d the New York congresswoman tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cIt is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of US coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic. This decision could cost people their lives. Pence\u2019s past decisions already have.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez reminded people of Pence\u2019s credentials. While he was governor of Indiana, he oversaw an HIV crisis so severe that at its peak, 20 new cases were diagnosed each week. \u201cAs governor, Pence\u2019s science denial contributed to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in Indiana\u2019s history,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe is not a medical doctor. He is not a health expert. He is not qualified nor positioned in any way to protect our public health.\u201d Rushing to the defense of the administration the next day, Ted Cruz jumped into the fray. \u201cAs you are speaking as the oracle of science, tell us, what exactly is a Y chromosome?\u201d Cruz responded on Twitter. \u201cAnd at what age of gestation does science tell us that an unborn child feels physical pain?\u201d He may have picked the wrong opponent \u2013 Ocasio-Cortez, it transpires, holds an award for microbiology from MIT. Despite reports in the past of the two lawmakers, surprisingly, finding common ground on other issues, Ocasio-Cortez did not let the slight go unaddressed. Touting her scientific bona fides and jabbing at Cruz, who, like Pence, gives primacy to his religious beliefs, she delivered an acerbic put-down. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re asking about chromosomes given that you don\u2019t believe in evolution,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p><strong>The label \u2018satirist\u2019</strong> is too grand for what I do. I\u2019m a comedy writer who sometimes does politics. Satire to me is bigger and well above my station \u2013 it doesn\u2019t only critique the world, but also offers answers. I\u2019m afraid to say I have no solutions.</p> <p><strong>I left school at 16</strong> with mental health problems instead of qualifications. I was a happy child until 11, on our south London Peabody estate, but at my secondary school it was only football and fighting that were valued. I gave up and became socially phobic. I was put on medication for anxiety and depression.</p> <p><strong>I nearly died </strong>in an old Smithfield meat market van. As a teenager I played gigs at working men\u2019s clubs with a friend. His dad bought a van from work caked with animal blood and rust to lug our equipment. We were going at some speed down a hill towards the West Ham supporters\u2019 club for a show when the brakes cut out and we crossed a busy junction. We only survived because he mounted the kerb.</p> <p><strong>It cost</strong><strong> me \u00a32</strong> to turn my life around. At 18, desperation drove me to enrol on A-Level evening courses. They were only a quid for the unemployed, so I could afford it. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of a future just watching <em>The Sullivans</em> on my parents\u2019 sofa. Finding a way out is my proudest achievement.</p> <p><strong>David Copperfield </strong>helped get me into Cambridge University. I was poorly read when I arrived for my interview at Churchill College. Thankfully I knew some Dickens, and it just so happened the bloke interviewing me was also a fan. Writing [the screenplay for] <em>The Personal History of David Copperfield</em> with Armando [Iannucci] had a real resonance \u2013 for me it changed everything.</p> <p><strong>The pram </strong>in the hall is supposed to be the enemy of creativity, but having kids inspired me.

      "bodyText": "The label \u2018satirist\u2019 is too grand for what I do. I\u2019m a comedy writer who sometimes does politics. Satire to me is bigger and well above my station \u2013 it doesn\u2019t only critique the world, but also offers answers. I\u2019m afraid to say I have no solutions. I left school at 16 with mental health problems instead of qualifications. I was a happy child until 11, on our south London Peabody estate, but at my secondary school it was only football and fighting that were valued. I gave up and became socially phobic. I was put on medication for anxiety and depression. I nearly died in an old Smithfield meat market van. As a teenager I played gigs at working men\u2019s clubs with a friend. His dad bought a van from work caked with animal blood and rust to lug our equipment. We were going at some speed down a hill towards the West Ham supporters\u2019 club for a show when the brakes cut out and we crossed a busy junction. We only survived because he mounted the kerb. It cost me \u00a32 to turn my life around. At 18, desperation drove me to enrol on A-Level evening courses. They were only a quid for the unemployed, so I could afford it. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of a future just watching The Sullivans on my parents\u2019 sofa. Finding a way out is my proudest achievement. David Copperfield helped get me into Cambridge University. I was poorly read when I arrived for my interview at Churchill College. Thankfully I knew some Dickens, and it just so happened the bloke interviewing me was also a fan. Writing [the screenplay for] The Personal History of David Copperfield with Armando [Iannucci] had a real resonance \u2013 for me it changed everything. The pram in the hall is supposed to be the enemy of creativity, but having kids inspired me. Ours never slept, they were total shits, so I became determined to use what little free time I had wisely.

      "body": "<h2>Closing the gender Pac gap</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not cozying up to Super Pacs,\u201d Elizabeth Warren promised in an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1233232449133518849?s=20\">advert</a> that ran over 2,000 times in Iowa. It\u2019s a message the Democrat has repeated throughout her campaign: she\u2019s grassroots-funded and is fighting against the corrupting influence of big money in politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ted-cruz-coronavirus\">Ted Cruz tried to mock AOC's scientific knowledge \u2013 it didn't end well</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ah, how times have changed. After insisting she \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1094286090436075521?s=20\">won\u2019t take a dime of Pac money</a>\u201d (a pledge that is <a href=\"https://facts.elizabethwarren.com/the-best-president-money-cant-buy/\">still on her campaign website</a>), Warren now has what appears to be the biggest Super Pac advertising presence in crucial Super Tuesday states. Persist Pac, which was formed by female Warren supporters ahead of the Nevada caucuses, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485111-pro-warren-super-pac-unleashes-9-million-ad-buy-in-crucial-super-tuesday\">announced on Thursday night</a> that it is investing $9m in adverts across California, Texas and Massachusetts. This follows a separate $3m ad buy across 13 Super Tuesday states and a $2m buy in Nevada and South Carolina. Which means Persist Pac has now spent $14m on ads for Warren; money she seems very happy cozying up to.</p> <p>So what caused this flip-flop? Feminism, apparently. Speaking the <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/02/21/warren_reverses_on_super_pacs_all_the_men_have_one.html\">Thursday before last</a>, Warren complained that \u201call of the men who were still in this race and on the debate stage \u2026 had either Super Pacs, or they were multibillionaires \u2026 And the only people who didn\u2019t have them were the two women. And at that point, there were some women around the country who said, \u2018You know, that\u2019s just not right.\u2019\u201d The gender Pac gap swiftly closed; now Amy Klobuchar and Warren both have Super Pac support. Girl power at its finest!</p> <p>I don\u2019t completely begrudge Warren taking Super Pac money. Her campaign has been flagging; flooding Super Tuesday markets with expensive ad buys is probably her best chance at changing that. However, I do begrudge the highly disingenuous way she framed her Super Pac backtrack as some sort of feminist position. There is nothing remotely feminist about using gender as an excuse to abandon your principles and embrace big money. Feminism is supposed to be about dismantling oppressive systems, not aligning yourself with them.</p> <p>Let\u2019s remind ourselves exactly what Super Pacs are, shall we? Spawned by the supreme court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United v Federal Election Commission ruling, they are \u201cpolitical action committees\u201d, which are allowed to accept unlimited political donations from individuals and corporations. They are supposed to be independent and can\u2019t contribute directly to a campaign or coordinate with candidates; however, Super Pacs frequently <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/super-pac-coordination_n_56463f85e4b045bf3def0273\">circumvent these rules</a>. In short, they allow the extremely wealthy to avoid the caps on individual contributions; they give a small group of people an outsized impact on elections. They are disastrous for democracy.</p> <p>Is Warren\u2019s claim that \u201call\u201d the non-billionaires running, including Bernie Sanders, have Super Pac support correct? Sort of. It <a href=\"https://apnews.com/345bbd1af529cfb1e41305fa3ab1e604\">is true</a> that a coalition called People Power for Bernie includes a Super Pac affiliated with the national nurses union, and a non-profit Sanders founded called Our Revolution, which functions in a similar way to a Super Pac. However, in response to a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/02/26/our-revolution-bernie-sanders-donor-contributions/\">recent Intercept inquiry</a>, Our Revolution said it only received a total of six donations over $5,000 in 2019 and its biggest contribution was around $25,000. It hasn\u2019t taken money from any billionaires. It is fair to accuse Sanders of a degree of hypocrisy around Super Pacs, but it is hugely disingenuous to claim that the support he gets from nurses and contributors to Our Revolution is equivalent to the other candidates\u2019 Super Pacs. Sanders is very much running a grassroots campaign.</p> <p>Who are the donors behind the $14m of pro-Warren Super Pac spending? Nobody really knows. Because the Persist Pac was formed so late it is legally able to keep its donors secret until 20 March, by which time a majority of delegates will be allocated. Warren\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t responded to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-super-pac.html\">requests for comment</a> about whether the Super Pac should make its donors known earlier. Once again, I can understand why she would feel forced to accept Super Pac support. However, it is beyond the pale that she won\u2019t disavow a group that refuses to disclose its donors until after much of the primary voting has already taken place. The fact that the \u201cmen\u201d running may embrace big money and eschew transparency is no excuse. Warren has asked other candidates to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/19/warren-door-open-super-pac-spending-116015\">put their money where their mouth is</a>.

At the time of the research electricity was being put into the villages, allowing TV viewing. The researchers found that TV exposure does seem to drive both men and women to find slimmer female bodies more attractive. Duffy opens up about horrifying ordeal The Welsh pop singer made a brave statement on Instagram, explaining she\u2019d retreated from the public eye because she\u2019d been drugged, held captive and raped by an unidentified person. She has been praised by campaigners for drawing attention to the long-term impact of trauma. Saudi Arabia orders arrest of female rapper Her crime? She posted a music video called \u201cMecca Girl\u201d on YouTube. The persecution of the rapper, who identifies herself as Asayel, is a reminder that Saudi Arabia may make a big song and dance about its supposed \u201cmodernization\u201d, but there\u2019s a very long way for it to go. Teenage girl beats boys to win wrestling championship Heaven Fitch became the first girl to win one of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association\u2019s individual state wrestling championships. Fitch got into wrestling because of her brothers. \u201cI would just be like, \u2018Well, if they can do it, then I should be able to do it,\u2019\u201d she said. Indonesian official thinks women can get pregnant from swimming \u201cIn a swimming pool, there\u2019s a certain kind of sperm that is very strong,\u201d Sitti Hikmawatty, a senior child protection official, recently informed reporters. \u201cIf a person is aroused and ejaculates [in the pool] a pregnancy can happen even though there is no sexual penetration.\u201d These nonsensical claims are a perfect example of why sex education is so important. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 March 2020. An earlier version implied that a tweet by Elizabeth Warren in February 2019 was made a few weeks ago. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Listen to the opening number of the Peruvian-born producer Sofia Kourtesis\u2019s first, self-titled EP, and you imagine a train made of rackety sonic junk clattering down a track. Its destination? A good time, surely: while her brand of house may be arrestingly distinct, clicking and juddering with distorted vocals and fragments of field recordings, she always keeps her eyes firmly on the dancefloor rather than the navel. Kourtesis, who is based in Berlin, started out in a hip-hop band at 18 (\u201cWe were really bad\u201d) before migrating to the mixing deck after meeting her now ex-partner Derwin Schlecker, AKA Gold Panda, and later becoming a booker for clubs including Berlin\u2019s Funkhaus. Released last year by Studio Barnhus, the eclectic Stockholm-based dance label, the EP won glowing reviews (Pitchfork called it \u201cmagical\u201d). Now, Kourtesis has released a follow-up, Sarita Colonia. An initial thudding of warm bass seems to announce a heavier approach, but her inventive restlessness quickly makes itself felt again. Moninga is a synaesthete\u2019s delight, hissing and fizzing away inside the brain, while Akariku ripples and trills, closing things with irresistible, insistent arpeggios. Throughout, Kourtesis uses skittish fragments of found sound recorded on the road, plus vocal snippets lifted from films and records (spot the snatch of Marvin Gaye). A musical magpie then \u2013 or, as she put it in an interview with website Dance Deep, \u201cI like everything. You would call it stra\u00dfenk\u00f6ter in German: a stray dog.\u201d Sarita Colonia is out now on Studio Barnhus",

She received a reply confirming receipt, and the following day, as requested, she paid the balance of \u00a345,750. This was deposited into another Lloyds account after she was told the bank details had been revised because of an ongoing audit.</p> <p>Flood, who works in a Stockport secondary school, says her heart sank when her bank (not Lloyds) later rang to say that Lloyds had noticed a discrepancy in the payee name. \u201cI phoned my solicitor immediately, only to have them confirm their system had been hacked. The first email asking for the funds transfer looked very authentic. When I received a second email in response to mine, confirming receipt of the first transfer from my solicitor, I felt reassured and made a further payment.</p> <p>\u201cThe fraudsters banked with Lloyds and, while the bank was able to refund an unspent \u00a34,000 from their account, I have been advised they are unable to retrieve the remaining \u00a335,000,\u201d she says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/sep/26/number-of-bank-transfer-scams-in-uk-rise-by-40-in-a-year\" title=\"\">Fraud in the UK payments industry has soared</a>. This type of scam is known as \u201cauthorised push payment\u201d fraud and includes cases where email accounts \u2013 either those of individuals or the companies or tradespeople they have employed \u2013 are hacked in order to trick consumers into sending large sums to criminal accounts. Guardian Money has featured a number of these cases, and more than \u00a31m a day is being lost to such scams.</p> <p>Flood says a total of \u00a395,750 was paid into the two Lloyds accounts and, shortly after, \u00a391,280 was withdrawn. In February last year, \u00a34,470 was recovered and returned. In a letter to her MP, Lloyds said \u201cregrettably, as no further funds remain in the receiving accounts, we are unable to recover any more of the money transferred by Ms Flood\u201d.</p> <p>The bank added that \u201cdue to data protection, we are unable to disclose any information relating to the accounts\u201d, but before that it had no knowledge of fraudulent activity, or concerns about the way the accounts were opened or managed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64b46bb029ea39f817dd5eec680309391d9498ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64b46bb029ea39f817dd5eec680309391d9498ef/0_0_4096_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyds Bank branch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyds says both fraudulent accounts passed all the relevant identity and verification checks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flood decided to enlist the help of Hayes Connor Solicitors, which specialises in data protection breaches and other cyber offences. Kingsley Hayes, the firm\u2019s managing director, says: \u201cThe emails sent to my client were very authentic, containing details of the property being purchased and the desired date of completion, so Ms Flood had no reason to question it or anticipate that it may have been fake. They had hacked her solicitor\u2019s email system.\u201d</p> <p>He says the firm investigated the crime and retrieved \u00a357,000 from Flood\u2019s conveyancing solicitor, as it was responsible for the lack of robust security measures on its system. \u201cUnfortunately, as the incident took place before new consumer protection rights were introduced at the end of May 2019 via the new voluntary code of conduct, it will be difficult to retrieve the remaining stolen monies,\u201d Hayes says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/may/04/bank-victims-likely-to-be-offered-fairer-treatment\" title=\"\">This code</a> requires banks to reimburse affected customers who meet the criteria. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/25/bank-fraud-transfer-scams\" title=\"\">from the end of March this year</a>, name checks will be carried out when UK bank customers send money to other people as part of a regime known as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wearepay.uk/confirmation-of-payee/\" title=\"\">confirmation of payee</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Flood says: \u201cThere are some outstanding questions that we would like answered by Lloyds \u2026 If they can prove they have done everything right, I\u2019d walk away, but I don\u2019t think they have.\u201d</p> <p>She suggests accounts receiving large sums of money being transferred to a different payee name, which was then withdrawn within a very short period, \u201cshould perhaps have caused some checks to be made by Lloyds\u201d.</p> <p>Flood advises others to be vigilant when transferring large sums: \u201cThis has been a lengthy and very painful fight \u2026 Our lives have been on hold since this happened. I blame myself and feel anxious and upset. It\u2019s a lot of money to lose, and it\u2019s even more upsetting because it was money left to us by my dad that was supposed to be for my children\u2019s future.\u201d</p> <p>A Lloyds spokesperson told Money: \u201cWe have a great deal of sympathy for Ms Flood as the victim of a scam. We use sophisticated, multilayered procedures to prevent fraudulent account applications. In this case, both accounts passed all the relevant identity and verification checks. Once notified of the fraud we acted immediately to freeze the accounts, which allowed us to return the remaining funds to Ms Flood. We will continue to cooperate fully with the police with their investigation.\u201d</p>",

This type of scam is known as \u201cauthorised push payment\u201d fraud and includes cases where email accounts \u2013 either those of individuals or the companies or tradespeople they have employed \u2013 are hacked in order to trick consumers into sending large sums to criminal accounts. Guardian Money has featured a number of these cases, and more than \u00a31m a day is being lost to such scams. Flood says a total of \u00a395,750 was paid into the two Lloyds accounts and, shortly after, \u00a391,280 was withdrawn. In February last year, \u00a34,470 was recovered and returned. In a letter to her MP, Lloyds said \u201cregrettably, as no further funds remain in the receiving accounts, we are unable to recover any more of the money transferred by Ms Flood\u201d. The bank added that \u201cdue to data protection, we are unable to disclose any information relating to the accounts\u201d, but before that it had no knowledge of fraudulent activity, or concerns about the way the accounts were opened or managed. Flood decided to enlist the help of Hayes Connor Solicitors, which specialises in data protection breaches and other cyber offences. Kingsley Hayes, the firm\u2019s managing director, says: \u201cThe emails sent to my client were very authentic, containing details of the property being purchased and the desired date of completion, so Ms Flood had no reason to question it or anticipate that it may have been fake. They had hacked her solicitor\u2019s email system.\u201d He says the firm investigated the crime and retrieved \u00a357,000 from Flood\u2019s conveyancing solicitor, as it was responsible for the lack of robust security measures on its system. \u201cUnfortunately, as the incident took place before new consumer protection rights were introduced at the end of May 2019 via the new voluntary code of conduct, it will be difficult to retrieve the remaining stolen monies,\u201d Hayes says. This code requires banks to reimburse affected customers who meet the criteria. Meanwhile, from the end of March this year, name checks will be carried out when UK bank customers send money to other people as part of a regime known as \u201cconfirmation of payee\u201d. Flood says: \u201cThere are some outstanding questions that we would like answered by Lloyds \u2026 If they can prove they have done everything right, I\u2019d walk away, but I don\u2019t think they have.\u201d She suggests accounts receiving large sums of money being transferred to a different payee name, which was then withdrawn within a very short period, \u201cshould perhaps have caused some checks to be made by Lloyds\u201d. Flood advises others to be vigilant when transferring large sums: \u201cThis has been a lengthy and very painful fight \u2026 Our lives have been on hold since this happened. I blame myself and feel anxious and upset. It\u2019s a lot of money to lose, and it\u2019s even more upsetting because it was money left to us by my dad that was supposed to be for my children\u2019s future.\u201d A Lloyds spokesperson told Money: \u201cWe have a great deal of sympathy for Ms Flood as the victim of a scam. We use sophisticated, multilayered procedures to prevent fraudulent account applications. In this case, both accounts passed all the relevant identity and verification checks. Once notified of the fraud we acted immediately to freeze the accounts, which allowed us to return the remaining funds to Ms Flood. We will continue to cooperate fully with the police with their investigation.\u201d",

The cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, is dragged into the row after Patel demands Rutnam\u2019s removal. 21 February A former chief civil servant at the Home Office says the department is in the grip of a number of \u201ctropical storms\u201d, amid reports of clashes between Patel and her chief mandarin. Sir David Normington tells the BBC that it could sometimes come as \u201cvery unwelcome news\u201d when civil servants present ministers with facts, evidence and sometimes advice to slow down proposals. The Guardian reports allegations from an official in one of Patel\u2019s former departments claiming she was given to coming out of her office and inquiring: \u201cWhy is everyone so fucking useless?\u201d 22 February It emerges that one of the Home Office\u2019s most senior civil servants on immigration resigned following \u201cmajor run-ins\u201d with Patel. Union sources say \u201cuncomfortable\u201d demands by Patel had prompted Mark Thomson, the director general of UK Visas and Immigration and HM Passport Office, to announce his departure weeks after her appointment. 24 February No 10 tells Patel to cool down her row with Rutnam after a bitter briefing war between allies of the pair about their deteriorating relationship. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman says Johnson has full confidence in the home secretary and in the civil service, though the same guarantee was not given to Rutnam specifically. Meanwhile, Matthew Rycroft, a civil servant in the Department for International Development, Patel\u2019s former department, writes to all staff to reassure them of its \u201czero tolerance\u201d of bullying and harassment. 27 February It emerges that Patel tried to have the Home Office communications director removed from the job before Christmas. She asked for Andy Tighe, the head of news at the Home Office, to be moved out of the department last year, and he decided to take retirement. The Home Office does not deny the claim. HuffPost reports that Patel wanted Rutnam to sack Tighe on Christmas Eve and he refused, which led to some of the tensions between the pair. 29 February Rutnam resigns and announces plans to sue the government for constructive dismissal. Rutnam says he has been accused of briefing the media against Patel, an accusation he says is false. \u201cI have received allegations that [Patel\u2019s] conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands \u2013 behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out,\u201d he says.",

      "body": "<p>In the first season of <em>Killing Eve</em>, Jodie Comer\u2019s character, Villanelle, wore a baby-pink tulle dress by Molly Goddard. It was a look that launched copycat tiered dresses and hundreds of memes, not to mention fancy dress outfits. But as the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/killingeve/?utm_source=ig_embed\" title=\"\">\u201cfirst look\u201d pictures from season three</a> drop, it seems that she has seized on another trend: clown chic. The photos feature Comer dressed in full circus-ready regalia: tiny tartan top hat, suspenders, electric-blue ruff collar and big red nose. Visually surprising and witty, it was also the most \u201con trend\u201d look she could have gone for. The look is in, with every element of the clown look (big sleeves, neck ties and ruffs, print and colour mixing) being referenced in fashion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"192dc494b2d8ebe26b066967ce6c46ee9c76ac31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/192dc494b2d8ebe26b066967ce6c46ee9c76ac31/0_0_2541_3812/667.jpg\" alt=\"Bella Hadid in Max Mara at Milan fashion week .\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bella Hadid in Max Mara at Milan fashion week .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At London fashion week, Emilia Wickstead and Victoria Beckham featured huge pointy collars and billowy sleeves. In Milan, Gucci and Max Mara featured similarly wider silhouettes, while at the Brits the harlequin look was much in evidence. Charli XCX was seen in a gothy Fendi tulle dress with peaked shoulders; Paloma Faith wore an oversize, floppy, pink bow hat from Miu Miu, and Harry Styles performed in custom-made Gucci \u2013 an intricately designed lace shirt, gloves and trouser set that was peak Pierrot.</p> <p>In menswear, the clownish oversize silhouette has replaced the skinnier look (as defined by Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent in the 00s) with designers such as Bottega Veneta\u2019s Daniel Lee, Louis Vuitton\u2019s Kim Jones and Demna Gvasalia (founder of Vetements and now at Balenciaga) adopting the look in their collections.</p> <p>For newer labels such as Ganni (the Danish label beloved by Instagram influencers like Pernille Teisbaek and Pandora Sykes), Christopher John Rogers (worn by Lil Nas X and Lizzo) and New York label Batsheva, the exaggeration that the clown silhouette offers is inspiring.</p> <p>\u201cI like to play with anything that most people reject and to consider why they reject it,\u201d says Batsheva Hay. \u201cClownishness is the epitome of what people reject in terms of appearance, so it interests me.\u201d Indeed, the style, with associations of creepiness and danger (so apt for Villanelle), is a perfect sartorial reflection of our troubled, disjointed times.</p> <p>\u201cThe clown is an image of cultural exhaustion,\u201d says Andrew McConnell Stott, author of several essays on the subject, including <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/487112/pdf\" title=\"\">Clowns on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ba0d1fe3a6bfea40577976ec72d45acb4af2a8a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba0d1fe3a6bfea40577976ec72d45acb4af2a8a8/0_129_3537_4420/800.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Styles on stage at the Brits.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Styles on stage at the Brits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a holdover from the industrial age, whose lingering presence has come to represent the loss of innocence and fun curdling into terror.\u201d</p> <p>Designer Ashley Williams drew on similar ideas in her London fashion week collection. \u201cThe reference was childhood nostalgia and innocence \u2026 naive fun transforming, with time, into adult behaviours of insecurities; the idea of putting on a mask to hide yourself and your true emotions.\u201d</p> <p>Williams\u2019s show featured a model with clown makeup wearing a knitted tank top decorated with a pentagram pattern and a belt that read: \u201cshut up\u201d. It was a dissonant, unexpectedly jarring moment in an otherwise whimsical show. \u201cClowns are multifaceted characters who seem to only show one side of themselves,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThey behave in a comical way for the entertainment of others, while also having a pervasive and clandestine, flawed, dark side.\u201d</p> <p>Wild and outrageous fashions like the clown look have always existed as a way for consumers to live vicariously, revelling in the outrageousness of something that skirts the line between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d taste.</p> <p>\u201cIn ancient China, clowns were the only ones who could make fun of the emperor. In medieval Europe, it was the same,\u201d says writer and stylist Amber Nicole Alston. \u201cI think clowns have endured because there\u2019s a part of us \u2013 designers included \u2013 that wants to poke fun at the things we can\u2019t control.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the first season of Killing Eve, Jodie Comer\u2019s character, Villanelle, wore a baby-pink tulle dress by Molly Goddard. It was a look that launched copycat tiered dresses and hundreds of memes, not to mention fancy dress outfits. But as the \u201cfirst look\u201d pictures from season three drop, it seems that she has seized on another trend: clown chic. The photos feature Comer dressed in full circus-ready regalia: tiny tartan top hat, suspenders, electric-blue ruff collar and big red nose. Visually surprising and witty, it was also the most \u201con trend\u201d look she could have gone for. The look is in, with every element of the clown look (big sleeves, neck ties and ruffs, print and colour mixing) being referenced in fashion. At London fashion week, Emilia Wickstead and Victoria Beckham featured huge pointy collars and billowy sleeves. In Milan, Gucci and Max Mara featured similarly wider silhouettes, while at the Brits the harlequin look was much in evidence. Charli XCX was seen in a gothy Fendi tulle dress with peaked shoulders; Paloma Faith wore an oversize, floppy, pink bow hat from Miu Miu, and Harry Styles performed in custom-made Gucci \u2013 an intricately designed lace shirt, gloves and trouser set that was peak Pierrot. In menswear, the clownish oversize silhouette has replaced the skinnier look (as defined by Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent in the 00s) with designers such as Bottega Veneta\u2019s Daniel Lee, Louis Vuitton\u2019s Kim Jones and Demna Gvasalia (founder of Vetements and now at Balenciaga) adopting the look in their collections. For newer labels such as Ganni (the Danish label beloved by Instagram influencers like Pernille Teisbaek and Pandora Sykes), Christopher John Rogers (worn by Lil Nas X and Lizzo) and New York label Batsheva, the exaggeration that the clown silhouette offers is inspiring. \u201cI like to play with anything that most people reject and to consider why they reject it,\u201d says Batsheva Hay. \u201cClownishness is the epitome of what people reject in terms of appearance, so it interests me.\u201d Indeed, the style, with associations of creepiness and danger (so apt for Villanelle), is a perfect sartorial reflection of our troubled, disjointed times. \u201cThe clown is an image of cultural exhaustion,\u201d says Andrew McConnell Stott, author of several essays on the subject, including Clowns on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. \u201cIt\u2019s a holdover from the industrial age, whose lingering presence has come to represent the loss of innocence and fun curdling into terror.\u201d Designer Ashley Williams drew on similar ideas in her London fashion week collection. \u201cThe reference was childhood nostalgia and innocence \u2026 naive fun transforming, with time, into adult behaviours of insecurities; the idea of putting on a mask to hide yourself and your true emotions.\u201d Williams\u2019s show featured a model with clown makeup wearing a knitted tank top decorated with a pentagram pattern and a belt that read: \u201cshut up\u201d. It was a dissonant, unexpectedly jarring moment in an otherwise whimsical show. \u201cClowns are multifaceted characters who seem to only show one side of themselves,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThey behave in a comical way for the entertainment of others, while also having a pervasive and clandestine, flawed, dark side.\u201d Wild and outrageous fashions like the clown look have always existed as a way for consumers to live vicariously, revelling in the outrageousness of something that skirts the line between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d taste. \u201cIn ancient China, clowns were the only ones who could make fun of the emperor. In medieval Europe, it was the same,\u201d says writer and stylist Amber Nicole Alston. \u201cI think clowns have endured because there\u2019s a part of us \u2013 designers included \u2013 that wants to poke fun at the things we can\u2019t control.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On a recent afternoon in Florence, room 91 of the Uffizi Gallery, home to a magnificent Caravaggio, was packed with visitors.</p> <p>But the work they were straining to see wasn\u2019t by the baroque master but one of his contemporaries, an artist whose life story is strikingly reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a>. This painter risked all to challenge the man who raped her, and spent the rest of her career unpacking power struggles between the sexes on her canvases.</p> <p>She is Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-c.1656) and, next month, the National Gallery is mounting the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/artemisia?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3ubL2-f05wIVg7HtCh25zgfyEAAYASAAEgK7xPD_BwE\" title=\"\">first major exhibition of her work in the UK</a>. As has happened with many female artists, Gentileschi\u2019s paintings were ignored and wrongly attributed for centuries. Just last week, a <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/newly-attributed-artemisia-gentileschi-painting-revealed-in-london\" title=\"\">previously misattributed painting believed to be by her was unveiled in London</a>, a city where she once lived and worked.</p> <p>When the canvas, <em>David and Goliath</em>, was sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 1975, it was believed to be by Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri, a student of Gentileschi\u2019s father, Orazio. \u201cIt\u2019s common for women\u2019s work to be wrongly attributed to male artists,\u201d said Palmyre Manivet of Simon Gillespie Studio in London, where the work was restored.</p> <p>Last week, art scholar Gianni Papi, writing in the <em>Burlington </em>magazine, suggested the painting could be from the collection of King Charles I. Art historian Horace Walpole noted in 1762 that this collection included \u201cseveral of her [Artemisia Gentileschi\u2019s] works,\u201d and that \u201cher best was David with the head of Goliath\u201d.</p> <p>The painting, which was found on cleaning to have the signature \u201cArtemisia\u201d on David\u2019s sword, was recatalogued after being put up for sale again in 2018 in Munich. According to Papi, the giveaways included a wealth of rich colours typical of Gentileschi. Simon Gillespie, meanwhile, calls it \u201ca genius piece\u201d, adding that the sleeve and landscape details, and the way that light falls on David\u2019s face, are further indications of its new-found genesis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Judith Beheading Holofernes, she's imagining, as a woman, what it would take to decapitate a muscular man</p> <footer> <cite>Letizia Treves, curator</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The National Gallery exhibition will bring not only Gentileschi\u2019s paintings, but also her story, into sharp focus. Her mother died in childbirth when her only daughter was just 12.

      "bodyText": "On a recent afternoon in Florence, room 91 of the Uffizi Gallery, home to a magnificent Caravaggio, was packed with visitors. But the work they were straining to see wasn\u2019t by the baroque master but one of his contemporaries, an artist whose life story is strikingly reminiscent of the #MeToo movement. This painter risked all to challenge the man who raped her, and spent the rest of her career unpacking power struggles between the sexes on her canvases. She is Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-c.1656) and, next month, the National Gallery is mounting the first major exhibition of her work in the UK. As has happened with many female artists, Gentileschi\u2019s paintings were ignored and wrongly attributed for centuries. Just last week, a previously misattributed painting believed to be by her was unveiled in London, a city where she once lived and worked. When the canvas, David and Goliath, was sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 1975, it was believed to be by Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri, a student of Gentileschi\u2019s father, Orazio. \u201cIt\u2019s common for women\u2019s work to be wrongly attributed to male artists,\u201d said Palmyre Manivet of Simon Gillespie Studio in London, where the work was restored. Last week, art scholar Gianni Papi, writing in the Burlington magazine, suggested the painting could be from the collection of King Charles I. Art historian Horace Walpole noted in 1762 that this collection included \u201cseveral of her [Artemisia Gentileschi\u2019s] works,\u201d and that \u201cher best was David with the head of Goliath\u201d. The painting, which was found on cleaning to have the signature \u201cArtemisia\u201d on David\u2019s sword, was recatalogued after being put up for sale again in 2018 in Munich. According to Papi, the giveaways included a wealth of rich colours typical of Gentileschi. Simon Gillespie, meanwhile, calls it \u201ca genius piece\u201d, adding that the sleeve and landscape details, and the way that light falls on David\u2019s face, are further indications of its new-found genesis. The National Gallery exhibition will bring not only Gentileschi\u2019s paintings, but also her story, into sharp focus. Her mother died in childbirth when her only daughter was just 12. Her father, a successful artist and a friend of Caravaggio, was perhaps surprised when he realised that his talents had passed not to his three sons but to his daughter. At the time, women were not allowed to become members of the all-important artistic guilds or the academies, but Artemisia would go on to become the first female member of the Accademia in Florence in 1616. Nevertheless, Orazio encouraged Artemisia, and being the daughter of an artist meant she could access what most young women could never hope for \u2013 training. It meant, too, that she got to know Caravaggio\u2019s work, which would prove pivotal to her output. But she also met an artist called Agostino Tassi, who worked alongside her father and, when she was 17, raped her. When Tassi refused to marry her, Orazio took him to court. In the trial that followed, Artemisia, the victim \u2013 rather than Tassi, the perpetrator \u2013 was tortured to ascertain if she was telling the truth. \u201cIt is true. It is true. It is true. It is true,\u201d she cried as they crushed the fingers she needed to continue to wield a paintbrush. Tassi was found guilty, though not forced to serve his sentence. As the National Gallery\u2019s show will reveal, Gentileschi never forgot the injustice done to her, and to so many women. The star of the exhibition, according to its curator, Letizia Treves, will be Judith Beheading Holofernes (c1612-1613), the work the crowds were so eager to see in Florence last month. It is based on a biblical story \u2013 of a woman who takes revenge on a soldier who had tried to wrong her \u2013 that inspired many artists, including Caravaggio. Gentileschi gives it her own interpretation. \u201cShe\u2019s imagining, as a woman, what it would take to decapitate a muscular man,\u201d said Treves. \u201cYou see the determination and resolve in her face.\u201d Other works in the show, which will run until 26 July, include a painting of Judith and her maidservant a few minutes after they\u2019ve beheaded Holofernes, which Treves says shows \u201ca spirit of sisterhood, of women in it together\u201d, and a portrait of Mary Magdalene in which her usual penitence is replaced with a look of passionate eroticism. According to the Guardian\u2019s art critic Jonathan Jones, author of a new book on Gentileschi, she is \u201cCaravaggio\u2019s boldest and most-inspired follower \u2013 his artistic heir\u201d. She juggled being a wife, mother and lover with adventurous travels, money troubles and the deaths of most of her children. Now, in the 21st century, she is fulfilling the prediction she made in a letter written in 1649: \u201cI\u2019ll show you what a woman can do.\u201d Artemisia Gentileschi by Jonathan Jones is published in the Lives of the Artists series by Laurence King Publishing.

      "body": "<p>Arcosanti looks much as it did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/25/architecture.ethicalliving\" title=\"\">when I visited in 2008</a>: curving vaults, apses and amphitheatres with patterns inscribed in the concrete; circular windows, winding little paths, cypress trees, wind chimes tinkling in the breeze. This experimental city in the Arizona desert, founded in 1970, is like a set from a sci-fi movie for an alien civilisation more enlightened than ours.</p> <p>And in some ways, Arcosanti <em>is</em> more enlightened. Its utopian community was the brainchild of Paolo Soleri, an outsider architect who looked at America\u2019s unfolding future of consumerism, urban sprawl and environmental destruction, and decided there had to be something better. Arcosanti was a showcase for his concept of \u201carcology\u201d (architecture plus ecology), which argued that cities should be compact, car-free, low-impact, civic-minded. Planned as a city of 5,000, its population has, however, rarely risen above 150. By 2008, it had come to a standstill. \u201cThe main fault is me,\u201d Soleri told me then. He was 89, and seemed resigned. \u201cI don\u2019t have the gift of proselytising.\u201d But this was not the full extent of the problem, it emerged.</p> <p>In November 2017, four years after her father\u2019s death, Soleri\u2019s youngest daughter, Daniela, published an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@soleri/sexual-abuse-its-you-him-and-his-work-88ecb8e99648\" title=\"\">essay on </a><a href=\"https://medium.com/@soleri/sexual-abuse-its-you-him-and-his-work-88ecb8e99648\" title=\"\">medium.com</a>, claiming that her father had sexually abused her and attempted to rape her as a teenager. She had told some of Soleri\u2019s inner circle decades earlier, she wrote, and they had done nothing. Daniela likened her experience to that of other women of the #MeToo era who have accused powerful men with cultural capital. \u201cWhen the abuser is a publicly known, creative person, there is an added layer of complication,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe work itself argues against you, is a source of power for him. You are challenging his successes and everything his work means to anyone who has gained from affiliation, and decided that he and his work are essential to their own identity.\u201d</p> <p>This was especially true of Paolo Soleri. Scores of people have devoted their lives to his work; some of them continue to live and work at Arcosanti. These were people Daniela had known since she was a child, people she considered her extended family. Some of them knew about her father\u2019s abuses and problematic attitude towards women but, Daniela says, they took little action, even after she went public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e8306c24ae5ad8aa4b375a44207f9f4f9ecde64a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8306c24ae5ad8aa4b375a44207f9f4f9ecde64a/57_169_1962_1177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Architect Paolo Soleri with his daughter Daniela, backs to camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was a fantastic place to be a kid\u2019: Daniela and her father at the site of Arcosanti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Daniela Soleri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daniela connects her father\u2019s failings as a human being to the failures of his work \u2013 an argument that goes against recent, concerted efforts to separate the two: yes, artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/28/the-art-world-tolerates-abuse-the-fight-to-change-museum-wall-labels\" title=\"\">Pablo Picasso</a> or Miles Davis behaved monstrously, but their art is a gift to humanity. Daniela argues the opposite of her father: \u201cI believe that the same hubris and isolation that contributed to my abuse also made him, and some of his coterie, incapable of sustained engagement with the intellectual and artistic worlds they felt neglected by.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, the largely middle-aged community of Arcosanti had struck me as gentle, open-minded people committed to living frugally and responsibly. They were apprehensive about what would happen to the settlement, and Soleri\u2019s legacy, after his death. More than 10 years on, I wanted to know if Daniela\u2019s public denunciation had had an effect on them? Had they been complicit in Soleri\u2019s behaviour, or were they also victims? Was Arcosanti a relic of the past, or a blueprint for the future? (It has recently hosted festivals and events that draw a young crowd from around the world.) Late last year, I went back to find out.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Paolo Soleri was born in Turin, Italy, in 1919. He arrived in the US in 1946 to work with the renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright, but left Wright\u2019s Arizona office abruptly in 1948, for reasons unexplained. A collision of egos is entirely likely, though Soleri did fundamentally disagree with Wright\u2019s vision for the US city as a sprawling, low-rise, car-dependent suburbia \u2013 a model that Soleri described as \u201can engine for consumption\u201d.</p> <p>By the mid-1950s, Soleri had established a permanent base in nearby Scottsdale, and married the daughter of a client, Corolyn, known as Colly. Daniela, his second daughter, was born in 1958. (Her sister, Kristine, seven years her senior, refuses to speak publicly about her father.) In a statement of anti-materialist intent, Soleri called his Scottsdale base Cosanti \u2013 using <em>cosa</em>, the Italian word for thing.</p> <p>Throughout the 1960s, Soleri\u2019s output expanded in both quantity and scale. Alongside small architecture commissions, he drew, painted, sculpted and experimented with low-energy design. He produced blueprints for cities and huge allegorical paintings, including a 58ft scroll on the evolution of mankind. He developed an interest in ceramics and bronze casting (his <a href=\"https://cosanti.com/\" title=\"\">distinctive, handcrafted windbells</a> \u2013 which look like souvenirs from Middle Earth \u2013 continue to be a source of revenue for his foundation). His reputation also expanded: Soleri\u2019s work was embraced by the design community and US counterculture alike. He received large research grants, put on exhibitions and lectured around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b064c825d553ae0763828b4565558c08da603c2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b064c825d553ae0763828b4565558c08da603c2c/0_1667_5304_4375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniela Soleri, daughter of architect Paolo Soleri, in Santa Barbara, California, Feb 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"825\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Those kinds of experiences undermine your sense of self\u2019: Daniela Soleri today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1969, Soleri published <a href=\"https://arcosanti.org/50th-anniversary-edition-of-arcology-city-in-the-image-of-man/\" title=\"\">Arcology: The City </a><a href=\"https://arcosanti.org/50th-anniversary-edition-of-arcology-city-in-the-image-of-man/\" title=\"\">In The Image </a><a href=\"https://arcosanti.org/50th-anniversary-edition-of-arcology-city-in-the-image-of-man/\" title=\"\">Of Man</a>, a black tome more than 2ft wide, that laid out his philosophy in dense prose and intricate drawings of prototype \u201carcologies\u201d: mega-cities adapted for different habitats, from canyons to marshlands to volcanoes. They were arguably closer to psychedelic fantasy than serious architectural proposals, but Soleri wasn\u2019t joking. Boosted by his newfound celebrity and wealth, he acquired a plot of desert and, in 1970, the construction of Arcosanti began.</p> <p>Soleri was also running six-week workshops for paying students and volunteers \u2013 mostly from the US, Europe and Japan. About 1,700 of them passed through Arcosanti in its first seven years. As well as learning from the master, they were expected to work, and did so willingly. \u201cYou simply picked up a shovel and did what you were instructed to do,\u201d one veteran tells me. \u201cIt was a fantastic place to be a kid,\u201d says Daniela, who spent summers at Arcosanti, speaking on the phone from her home in Santa Barbara, California. \u201cWonderful, exciting, diverse. Very energetic, very enthusiastic, very free. There were so many interesting things happening.\u201d</p> <p>By the mid-1970s, Soleri had attracted a community that ranged from serious collaborators to acolytes and strays. He was in his 50s and becoming more confident in his own ideas, and less tolerant of dissent, says Daniela. \u201cIf there was ever a significant challenge, that person would have to leave.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were all bowled over. Why didn\u2019t we delve into it? She might have dropped the information hoping we'd come to her aid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Daniela was moving into adolescence, which is when the abuse started. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to go into precise details,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut definitely violations of my body, and of my person as an independent young woman, both hands on and hands off.\u201d It happened about once a month, in her home. \u201cIt followed the pattern that you now read about so often where you just freeze\u2026 You really do freeze.\u201d</p> <p>The breaking point came in 1976, at an exhibition in Rochester, New York. Daniela was sharing a hotel room with her father. \u201cThat\u2019s when he tried to rape me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was 17.\u201d It took her years to recover and process what had happened, she says. \u201cThose kinds of experiences undermine your sense of self, your sense of agency, and your sense of worth.\u201d</p> <p>Daniela did not completely cut ties with her father. After two years studying, she returned to Arizona to work for the Cosanti Foundation for six months, during which time she saved enough to go travelling in Africa for three years. She returned when her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer, and nursed her for nine months until her death in 1982. When I ask if her parents were happily married, Daniela laughs. \u201cIt was a work partnership devoted to him \u2013 Paolo spent all his time on his work; my mother also spent all her time on his work. She was a very social, gregarious, very warm person. There\u2019s a good case to say that she worked herself to death for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"62e2cd7a1bca4fac9c244b113971d257a9652d0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62e2cd7a1bca4fac9c244b113971d257a9652d0c/1854_0_1807_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panoramic of Arcosanti view from the south\" width=\"1000\" height=\"498\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arcosanti, surrounded by cypress trees planted by Paolo Soleri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Winslow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daniela established herself as an academic, specialising in agriculture and food systems, but continued to be involved with her father\u2019s work \u201cin a peripheral way\u201d. In 1993, during a discussion about Soleri\u2019s attitudes towards women, she told a small group of people at Arcosanti about the abuse. The news was \u201cunwanted information\u201d, she says. \u201cIn retrospect, I\u2019m surprised no one thought, \u2018Gosh! As grownups maybe we should have said something.\u2019 But when I did tell them, I made it very clear that I wasn\u2019t OK with it, and that I found his treatment of women reprehensible.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody has disputed the truth of Daniela\u2019s claims, but her continued contact with her father led some to question her allegations. Such behaviours are often used to undermine survivors of abuse: if it was so bad, how come you went back? Why did you not speak out sooner? It was partly a matter of her commitment to her father\u2019s work, she says. \u201cI was still such a believer that my workaround at the time was to think my greatest contribution would be to just bury it. That\u2019s my little burden to bear for the greater good.\u201d</p> <p>When I interviewed Soleri in 2008, he was stewarded by Mary Hoadley, who dutifully prompted and finished his thoughts for him. Her husband, Roger Tomalty, gave me a tour of Soleri\u2019s 1960s works at Cosanti. Now in her 70s, white-haired and suntanned from a lifetime spent working outdoors, she still works for the Cosanti Foundation, as does Tomalty.</p> <p>Hoadley first met Soleri in 1965 and, like many others, was captivated by him. \u201cHe was really dynamic, a little elf-like man,\u201d she says, when we meet last year. \u201cQuick to be angry, quick to forget, really focusing on the work.\u201d We are sitting in her former apartment at Arcosanti \u2013 an irregular warren of concrete rooms overlooking the apse. When she first arrived, it was all desert. \u201cMy mother helped me trowel this concrete floor,\u201d she says, looking down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79d54e6eaf3501be19295ce75b70b3c11bd71b56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79d54e6eaf3501be19295ce75b70b3c11bd71b56/31_61_2317_2370/978.jpg\" alt=\"Paolo and Colly Soleri during the 1981 Teilhard and Metamorphosis festival, pouring a plate of cement into the marker for a planned Teilhard de Chardin building\" width=\"978\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soleri and his wife, Colly, at Arcosanti in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cosanti Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hoadley recalls Daniela almost like a younger sister (she affectionately calls her \u201cDada\u201d) and sympathises with her plight. \u201cThe atmosphere was so idolatrous of Paolo \u2013 so who to talk to?\u201d Hoadley remembers when Daniela revealed she had been abused: \u201cWe were all just sort of bowled over. I sometimes think, why, at the time, didn\u2019t I just go, \u2018Oh my God, this is awful\u2019? Why didn\u2019t I delve into it? She might have dropped the information hoping we would come to her aid, and perhaps we didn\u2019t hear that request, or maybe it was too scary to act on at the time. In hindsight, given everything that\u2019s happened, I wish we\u2019d really delved into it.\u201d Hoadley says she took Daniela\u2019s continuing contact with Soleri as a sign that she had forgiven him.</p> <p>Another early Arcosanti recruit was Tomiaki Tamura, a trained architect from Japan, who visited out of curiosity in 1975. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly sure he had the right answers, but he asked lots of good questions,\u201d Tomiaki tells me. He became Soleri\u2019s assistant. For many years, it was just the two of them designing the city. \u201cIt was not really a collaborative process,\u201d Tomiaki says. \u201cI could make suggestions but he always had the bottom line.\u201d Despite having worked alongside Soleri for over 35 years, Tomiaki spent little time socialising with him. \u201cWe had dinner every once in a while, but not often. He was pretty much a loner. So am I.\u201d</p> <p>Tomiaki says he had no inkling of Daniela\u2019s experiences at the time: \u201cI really didn\u2019t have any control, I feel, over this whole unfortunate situation, but, at the same time, one has to take responsibility.\u201d He still lectures on Soleri\u2019s work, but always ends by making clear there was \u201ca side of Soleri that was not very good\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought, when he died, then things would be sorted out. They didn\u2019t do anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many Arcosanti veterans agree that Soleri was not particularly concerned with the social aspects of his urban experiment. \u201cHe dictated the design but he didn\u2019t dictate the lives of the people who participated in it at all and that, to me, was a very, very good setup,\u201d says Sue Kirsch, who manages Arcosanti\u2019s archive. Kirsch first visited Arcosanti from Germany in 1978, with her three-year-old daughter. She has lived here, on and off, for 30 years, during which time, like most residents, she has performed various roles: cooking in the communal kitchens, gardening, purchasing, coordinating workshops, conducting guided tours. There are no schools or shops, only a petrol station and a bar on the highway a couple of miles away.</p> <p>Kirsch was not close to Soleri. \u201cHe was a very private person. He would set a fairly high bar for the tone of discussion. It would not be about the president or politics or something stupid, it would be: OK, we are mankind. Where did we come from? Where are we going?\u201d</p> <p>One social aspect that did interest Soleri was women. \u201cIf there was a meeting and there was a beautiful young woman, he would be a little bit flirtatious,\u201d says Kirsch, \u201cbut to me it was that \u2018typical old Italian guy\u2019, kind of rooster behaviour, so I never took it that seriously.\u201d Soleri\u2019s status, combined with Arcosanti\u2019s workshop programme, ensured a steady flow of admiring women, decades younger than him. \u201cThere were many instances of women being courted and, uh, whatever the word is\u2026 <em>affaired</em>,\u201d says Hoadley. There is nothing to suggest these liaisons were not consensual, though from today\u2019s perspective, they could be characterised as exploitative.</p> <p>There was also the issue of the life drawings. Soleri would regularly draw nude female models, who responded to his flyers calling for \u201cwomen, aged 21 to 41\u201d. Some enjoyed the experience and maintained that Soleri behaved appropriately. Others tell a different story. <a href=\"https://www.oprah.com/spirit/posing-naked-for-art-and-yourself/all\" title=\"\">Writer Margie Goldsmith</a> modelled for Soleri in 2006. Having finished his second sketch, she recalls, Soleri, then 87, said to her: \u201cMay I have the privilege of kissing your nipples?\u201d Goldsmith refused, put on her clothes and left. Daniela said she had heard \u201cmany other stories\u201d similar to Goldsmith\u2019s. \u201cThis has been going on for a long time, and the people in what I call the inner circle, they knew about it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b9ca63ad3a03c92e6e7b68ba9e4b81f2c0351f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b9ca63ad3a03c92e6e7b68ba9e4b81f2c0351f8/1001_1117_6856_4113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 2019 Arcosanti festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steampunk meets Burning Man: the 2019 Arcosanti festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Villa Baroncelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In October 2010, Daniela resigned from the Cosanti Foundation board, again citing her father\u2019s abuse. \u201cI found out that someone who had been there almost my whole life was one of the people that Soleri was having relations with, and that same person was also quite cruel to my mother in a very juvenile way.\u201d She wrote to the board that she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by how they had handled her information and father\u2019s behaviour. \u201cI am no longer willing to cover up and accept things that are to me unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>After Daniela\u2019s resignation, the board decided it would be best if Soleri stepped down as chairman and ceased his life drawing; but it made no public statement on the matter, not even after his death two years later. \u201cI thought, when he died, then things would be sorted out. They didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d says Daniela. \u201cThere were eulogies, hagiographic readings, and on and on. [In October 2017, the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art opened a <a href=\"https://smoca.org/exhibition/repositioning-paolo-soleri-the-city-is-nature/\" title=\"\">major retrospective</a> titled Repositioning Paolo Soleri: The City Is Nature.] Nothing happened until I published that essay.\u201d</p> <p>It was only when the local press began asking questions that the Cosanti Foundation issued a <a href=\"https://arcosanti.org/me-too/\" title=\"\">statement</a>. \u201cWe are saddened by Daniela\u2019s trauma,\u201d it read. \u201cHer decision to speak out about her father\u2019s behaviour towards her helps us confront Paolo Soleri\u2019s flaws, and compels us to reconsider his legacy\u2026 We support and stand firmly with Daniela.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was an interesting way of putting it,\u201d says Daniela sarcastically. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange timeline for making assertions about \u2018standing firmly\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>My return to Arcosanti last year coincided with <a href=\"https://convergencefestival.com/\" title=\"\">Convergence</a> \u2013 a three-day festival of \u201ccounterculture, co-creation, art and music\u201d, now in its third year. In contrast to Soleri\u2019s \u201cold man\u201d values, the vibe is a mix of steampunk, eco-hippy and <a href=\"https://burningman.org/\" title=\"\">Burning Man</a>. There are talks and workshops on inclusivity, racial justice, self-realisation, sustainability, plus live music and hip-hop poetry. The crowd is noticeably youthful and diverse. One visitor tells me he found Arcosanti via Instagram. There is an evening ceremony with a Native American flautist playing as a red full moon rises. Few people seem to be familiar with Paolo Soleri and almost none are aware of the abuse allegations. The only mention of Soleri is during a panel discussion on the future of Arcosanti, where one veteran describes him as \u201ca benevolent dictator\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35dc5c52529134af6ab7269bf7bbff63254a0056\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35dc5c52529134af6ab7269bf7bbff63254a0056/0_0_3507_5366/654.jpg\" alt=\"A casting workshop at Arcosanti in 1977\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A casting workshop at Arcosanti in 1977.

It is appealing to a new demographic, says Tim Bell, the foundation\u2019s communications director, who moved here two years ago. A former actor from New York City and a self-described \u201cBurner\u201d (veteran of Burning Man), 32-year-old Bell was seeking alternatives, he says. \u201cI watched my parents lose their home in the 2008 crash and move into a trailer park and that was really difficult. It left me with this want for something better, for myself and my kids and their kids. That\u2019s why Arcosanti spoke to me.\u201d His generation is going through a similar process of re-evaluating society as their 1960s forebears, he suggests. He sees Arcosanti as a potential \u201ccaravanserai on the search for meaning\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://arcosanti.org/patrick-mcwhortor-named-new-ceo-of-cosanti-foundation/\" title=\"\">Patrick McWhortor</a>, the Cosanti Foundation\u2019s chief executive, agrees: \u201cPaolo was ahead of his time in his thinking. We all should have listened to him 60 years ago. The planet is paying the price. Now it\u2019s urgent that we address these issues, and I think young people feel that urgency.\u201d McWhortor was appointed in 2018 to bring fresh thinking to Arcosanti.

We had forgotten to reach out to the wider world. I want to get us back on the upward curve on that.\u201d McWhortor acknowledges that the Cosanti Foundation has some reputational damage to restore, while defending the mission of Arcosanti. \u201cThe ideas and the vision that Paolo inspired \u2013 that work is important regardless of anything Paolo ever did personally.

      "bodyText": "Arcosanti looks much as it did when I visited in 2008: curving vaults, apses and amphitheatres with patterns inscribed in the concrete; circular windows, winding little paths, cypress trees, wind chimes tinkling in the breeze. This experimental city in the Arizona desert, founded in 1970, is like a set from a sci-fi movie for an alien civilisation more enlightened than ours. And in some ways, Arcosanti is more enlightened. Its utopian community was the brainchild of Paolo Soleri, an outsider architect who looked at America\u2019s unfolding future of consumerism, urban sprawl and environmental destruction, and decided there had to be something better. Arcosanti was a showcase for his concept of \u201carcology\u201d (architecture plus ecology), which argued that cities should be compact, car-free, low-impact, civic-minded. Planned as a city of 5,000, its population has, however, rarely risen above 150. By 2008, it had come to a standstill. \u201cThe main fault is me,\u201d Soleri told me then. He was 89, and seemed resigned. \u201cI don\u2019t have the gift of proselytising.\u201d But this was not the full extent of the problem, it emerged. In November 2017, four years after her father\u2019s death, Soleri\u2019s youngest daughter, Daniela, published an essay on medium.com, claiming that her father had sexually abused her and attempted to rape her as a teenager. She had told some of Soleri\u2019s inner circle decades earlier, she wrote, and they had done nothing. Daniela likened her experience to that of other women of the #MeToo era who have accused powerful men with cultural capital. \u201cWhen the abuser is a publicly known, creative person, there is an added layer of complication,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe work itself argues against you, is a source of power for him. You are challenging his successes and everything his work means to anyone who has gained from affiliation, and decided that he and his work are essential to their own identity.\u201d This was especially true of Paolo Soleri. Scores of people have devoted their lives to his work; some of them continue to live and work at Arcosanti. These were people Daniela had known since she was a child, people she considered her extended family. Some of them knew about her father\u2019s abuses and problematic attitude towards women but, Daniela says, they took little action, even after she went public. Daniela connects her father\u2019s failings as a human being to the failures of his work \u2013 an argument that goes against recent, concerted efforts to separate the two: yes, artists such as Pablo Picasso or Miles Davis behaved monstrously, but their art is a gift to humanity. Daniela argues the opposite of her father: \u201cI believe that the same hubris and isolation that contributed to my abuse also made him, and some of his coterie, incapable of sustained engagement with the intellectual and artistic worlds they felt neglected by.\u201d In 2008, the largely middle-aged community of Arcosanti had struck me as gentle, open-minded people committed to living frugally and responsibly. They were apprehensive about what would happen to the settlement, and Soleri\u2019s legacy, after his death. More than 10 years on, I wanted to know if Daniela\u2019s public denunciation had had an effect on them? Had they been complicit in Soleri\u2019s behaviour, or were they also victims? Was Arcosanti a relic of the past, or a blueprint for the future? (It has recently hosted festivals and events that draw a young crowd from around the world.) Late last year, I went back to find out. *** Paolo Soleri was born in Turin, Italy, in 1919. He arrived in the US in 1946 to work with the renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright, but left Wright\u2019s Arizona office abruptly in 1948, for reasons unexplained. A collision of egos is entirely likely, though Soleri did fundamentally disagree with Wright\u2019s vision for the US city as a sprawling, low-rise, car-dependent suburbia \u2013 a model that Soleri described as \u201can engine for consumption\u201d. By the mid-1950s, Soleri had established a permanent base in nearby Scottsdale, and married the daughter of a client, Corolyn, known as Colly. Daniela, his second daughter, was born in 1958. (Her sister, Kristine, seven years her senior, refuses to speak publicly about her father.) In a statement of anti-materialist intent, Soleri called his Scottsdale base Cosanti \u2013 using cosa, the Italian word for thing. Throughout the 1960s, Soleri\u2019s output expanded in both quantity and scale. Alongside small architecture commissions, he drew, painted, sculpted and experimented with low-energy design. He produced blueprints for cities and huge allegorical paintings, including a 58ft scroll on the evolution of mankind. He developed an interest in ceramics and bronze casting (his distinctive, handcrafted windbells \u2013 which look like souvenirs from Middle Earth \u2013 continue to be a source of revenue for his foundation). His reputation also expanded: Soleri\u2019s work was embraced by the design community and US counterculture alike. He received large research grants, put on exhibitions and lectured around the world. In 1969, Soleri published Arcology: The City In The Image Of Man, a black tome more than 2ft wide, that laid out his philosophy in dense prose and intricate drawings of prototype \u201carcologies\u201d: mega-cities adapted for different habitats, from canyons to marshlands to volcanoes. They were arguably closer to psychedelic fantasy than serious architectural proposals, but Soleri wasn\u2019t joking. Boosted by his newfound celebrity and wealth, he acquired a plot of desert and, in 1970, the construction of Arcosanti began. Soleri was also running six-week workshops for paying students and volunteers \u2013 mostly from the US, Europe and Japan. About 1,700 of them passed through Arcosanti in its first seven years. As well as learning from the master, they were expected to work, and did so willingly. \u201cYou simply picked up a shovel and did what you were instructed to do,\u201d one veteran tells me. \u201cIt was a fantastic place to be a kid,\u201d says Daniela, who spent summers at Arcosanti, speaking on the phone from her home in Santa Barbara, California. \u201cWonderful, exciting, diverse. Very energetic, very enthusiastic, very free. There were so many interesting things happening.\u201d By the mid-1970s, Soleri had attracted a community that ranged from serious collaborators to acolytes and strays. He was in his 50s and becoming more confident in his own ideas, and less tolerant of dissent, says Daniela. \u201cIf there was ever a significant challenge, that person would have to leave.\u201d Daniela was moving into adolescence, which is when the abuse started. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to go into precise details,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut definitely violations of my body, and of my person as an independent young woman, both hands on and hands off.\u201d It happened about once a month, in her home. \u201cIt followed the pattern that you now read about so often where you just freeze\u2026 You really do freeze.\u201d The breaking point came in 1976, at an exhibition in Rochester, New York. Daniela was sharing a hotel room with her father. \u201cThat\u2019s when he tried to rape me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was 17.\u201d It took her years to recover and process what had happened, she says. \u201cThose kinds of experiences undermine your sense of self, your sense of agency, and your sense of worth.\u201d Daniela did not completely cut ties with her father. After two years studying, she returned to Arizona to work for the Cosanti Foundation for six months, during which time she saved enough to go travelling in Africa for three years. She returned when her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer, and nursed her for nine months until her death in 1982. When I ask if her parents were happily married, Daniela laughs. \u201cIt was a work partnership devoted to him \u2013 Paolo spent all his time on his work; my mother also spent all her time on his work. She was a very social, gregarious, very warm person. There\u2019s a good case to say that she worked herself to death for him.\u201d Daniela established herself as an academic, specialising in agriculture and food systems, but continued to be involved with her father\u2019s work \u201cin a peripheral way\u201d. In 1993, during a discussion about Soleri\u2019s attitudes towards women, she told a small group of people at Arcosanti about the abuse. The news was \u201cunwanted information\u201d, she says. \u201cIn retrospect, I\u2019m surprised no one thought, \u2018Gosh! As grownups maybe we should have said something.\u2019 But when I did tell them, I made it very clear that I wasn\u2019t OK with it, and that I found his treatment of women reprehensible.\u201d Nobody has disputed the truth of Daniela\u2019s claims, but her continued contact with her father led some to question her allegations. Such behaviours are often used to undermine survivors of abuse: if it was so bad, how come you went back? Why did you not speak out sooner? It was partly a matter of her commitment to her father\u2019s work, she says. \u201cI was still such a believer that my workaround at the time was to think my greatest contribution would be to just bury it. That\u2019s my little burden to bear for the greater good.\u201d When I interviewed Soleri in 2008, he was stewarded by Mary Hoadley, who dutifully prompted and finished his thoughts for him. Her husband, Roger Tomalty, gave me a tour of Soleri\u2019s 1960s works at Cosanti. Now in her 70s, white-haired and suntanned from a lifetime spent working outdoors, she still works for the Cosanti Foundation, as does Tomalty. Hoadley first met Soleri in 1965 and, like many others, was captivated by him. \u201cHe was really dynamic, a little elf-like man,\u201d she says, when we meet last year. \u201cQuick to be angry, quick to forget, really focusing on the work.\u201d We are sitting in her former apartment at Arcosanti \u2013 an irregular warren of concrete rooms overlooking the apse. When she first arrived, it was all desert. \u201cMy mother helped me trowel this concrete floor,\u201d she says, looking down. Hoadley recalls Daniela almost like a younger sister (she affectionately calls her \u201cDada\u201d) and sympathises with her plight. \u201cThe atmosphere was so idolatrous of Paolo \u2013 so who to talk to?\u201d Hoadley remembers when Daniela revealed she had been abused: \u201cWe were all just sort of bowled over. I sometimes think, why, at the time, didn\u2019t I just go, \u2018Oh my God, this is awful\u2019? Why didn\u2019t I delve into it? She might have dropped the information hoping we would come to her aid, and perhaps we didn\u2019t hear that request, or maybe it was too scary to act on at the time. In hindsight, given everything that\u2019s happened, I wish we\u2019d really delved into it.\u201d Hoadley says she took Daniela\u2019s continuing contact with Soleri as a sign that she had forgiven him. Another early Arcosanti recruit was Tomiaki Tamura, a trained architect from Japan, who visited out of curiosity in 1975. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly sure he had the right answers, but he asked lots of good questions,\u201d Tomiaki tells me. He became Soleri\u2019s assistant. For many years, it was just the two of them designing the city. \u201cIt was not really a collaborative process,\u201d Tomiaki says. \u201cI could make suggestions but he always had the bottom line.\u201d Despite having worked alongside Soleri for over 35 years, Tomiaki spent little time socialising with him. \u201cWe had dinner every once in a while, but not often. He was pretty much a loner. So am I.\u201d Tomiaki says he had no inkling of Daniela\u2019s experiences at the time: \u201cI really didn\u2019t have any control, I feel, over this whole unfortunate situation, but, at the same time, one has to take responsibility.\u201d He still lectures on Soleri\u2019s work, but always ends by making clear there was \u201ca side of Soleri that was not very good\u201d. Many Arcosanti veterans agree that Soleri was not particularly concerned with the social aspects of his urban experiment. \u201cHe dictated the design but he didn\u2019t dictate the lives of the people who participated in it at all and that, to me, was a very, very good setup,\u201d says Sue Kirsch, who manages Arcosanti\u2019s archive. Kirsch first visited Arcosanti from Germany in 1978, with her three-year-old daughter. She has lived here, on and off, for 30 years, during which time, like most residents, she has performed various roles: cooking in the communal kitchens, gardening, purchasing, coordinating workshops, conducting guided tours. There are no schools or shops, only a petrol station and a bar on the highway a couple of miles away. Kirsch was not close to Soleri. \u201cHe was a very private person. He would set a fairly high bar for the tone of discussion. It would not be about the president or politics or something stupid, it would be: OK, we are mankind. Where did we come from? Where are we going?\u201d One social aspect that did interest Soleri was women. \u201cIf there was a meeting and there was a beautiful young woman, he would be a little bit flirtatious,\u201d says Kirsch, \u201cbut to me it was that \u2018typical old Italian guy\u2019, kind of rooster behaviour, so I never took it that seriously.\u201d Soleri\u2019s status, combined with Arcosanti\u2019s workshop programme, ensured a steady flow of admiring women, decades younger than him. \u201cThere were many instances of women being courted and, uh, whatever the word is\u2026 affaired,\u201d says Hoadley. There is nothing to suggest these liaisons were not consensual, though from today\u2019s perspective, they could be characterised as exploitative. There was also the issue of the life drawings. Soleri would regularly draw nude female models, who responded to his flyers calling for \u201cwomen, aged 21 to 41\u201d. Some enjoyed the experience and maintained that Soleri behaved appropriately. Others tell a different story. Writer Margie Goldsmith modelled for Soleri in 2006. Having finished his second sketch, she recalls, Soleri, then 87, said to her: \u201cMay I have the privilege of kissing your nipples?\u201d Goldsmith refused, put on her clothes and left. Daniela said she had heard \u201cmany other stories\u201d similar to Goldsmith\u2019s. \u201cThis has been going on for a long time, and the people in what I call the inner circle, they knew about it.\u201d In October 2010, Daniela resigned from the Cosanti Foundation board, again citing her father\u2019s abuse. \u201cI found out that someone who had been there almost my whole life was one of the people that Soleri was having relations with, and that same person was also quite cruel to my mother in a very juvenile way.\u201d She wrote to the board that she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by how they had handled her information and father\u2019s behaviour. \u201cI am no longer willing to cover up and accept things that are to me unacceptable.\u201d After Daniela\u2019s resignation, the board decided it would be best if Soleri stepped down as chairman and ceased his life drawing; but it made no public statement on the matter, not even after his death two years later. \u201cI thought, when he died, then things would be sorted out. They didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d says Daniela. \u201cThere were eulogies, hagiographic readings, and on and on. [In October 2017, the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art opened a major retrospective titled Repositioning Paolo Soleri: The City Is Nature.] Nothing happened until I published that essay.\u201d It was only when the local press began asking questions that the Cosanti Foundation issued a statement. \u201cWe are saddened by Daniela\u2019s trauma,\u201d it read. \u201cHer decision to speak out about her father\u2019s behaviour towards her helps us confront Paolo Soleri\u2019s flaws, and compels us to reconsider his legacy\u2026 We support and stand firmly with Daniela.\u201d \u201cThat was an interesting way of putting it,\u201d says Daniela sarcastically. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange timeline for making assertions about \u2018standing firmly\u2019.\u201d *** My return to Arcosanti last year coincided with Convergence \u2013 a three-day festival of \u201ccounterculture, co-creation, art and music\u201d, now in its third year. In contrast to Soleri\u2019s \u201cold man\u201d values, the vibe is a mix of steampunk, eco-hippy and Burning Man. There are talks and workshops on inclusivity, racial justice, self-realisation, sustainability, plus live music and hip-hop poetry. The crowd is noticeably youthful and diverse. One visitor tells me he found Arcosanti via Instagram. There is an evening ceremony with a Native American flautist playing as a red full moon rises. Few people seem to be familiar with Paolo Soleri and almost none are aware of the abuse allegations. The only mention of Soleri is during a panel discussion on the future of Arcosanti, where one veteran describes him as \u201ca benevolent dictator\u201d. Arcosanti\u2019s permanent population is now about 80 \u2013 a third of whom are recent, young arrivals. It is appealing to a new demographic, says Tim Bell, the foundation\u2019s communications director, who moved here two years ago. A former actor from New York City and a self-described \u201cBurner\u201d (veteran of Burning Man), 32-year-old Bell was seeking alternatives, he says. \u201cI watched my parents lose their home in the 2008 crash and move into a trailer park and that was really difficult. It left me with this want for something better, for myself and my kids and their kids. That\u2019s why Arcosanti spoke to me.\u201d His generation is going through a similar process of re-evaluating society as their 1960s forebears, he suggests. He sees Arcosanti as a potential \u201ccaravanserai on the search for meaning\u201d. Patrick McWhortor, the Cosanti Foundation\u2019s chief executive, agrees: \u201cPaolo was ahead of his time in his thinking. We all should have listened to him 60 years ago. The planet is paying the price. Now it\u2019s urgent that we address these issues, and I think young people feel that urgency.\u201d McWhortor was appointed in 2018 to bring fresh thinking to Arcosanti. The 54-year-old has a background in non-profit organisations and describes himself as a \u201cchange agent\u201d. \u201cThe work to build Arcosanti was amazing in terms of the vision and energy and passion across the last 50 years,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat wasn\u2019t really built was the organisation to support it all on a permanent basis. We had forgotten to reach out to the wider world. I want to get us back on the upward curve on that.\u201d McWhortor acknowledges that the Cosanti Foundation has some reputational damage to restore, while defending the mission of Arcosanti. \u201cThe ideas and the vision that Paolo inspired \u2013 that work is important regardless of anything Paolo ever did personally. So to punish us and the people who are trying to advance that work because of his behaviour, really, to us, doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he says. Soleri\u2019s diagnosis of civilisation\u2019s ailments was largely correct. For proof, one need only look at Phoenix, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the US (Scottsdale has been absorbed into it), and one of the least sustainable cities in the US: exactly the type of sprawling, car-centric \u201cengine for consumption\u201d that Soleri warned against. His alternative might not have all the answers \u2013 who knows how Arcosanti might function as a city of 5,000 people? \u2013 but from today\u2019s perspective it looks like a path not taken. Perhaps the flaw in Soleri\u2019s vision was not so much his inability to proselytise as his assumption that he could change the world through his genius alone. \u201cEgo drives a lot, and is necessary,\u201d says Daniela. \u201cBut when you can\u2019t see outside of it, that\u2019s when you have trouble.\u201d In the absence of any social or communal organisation, she adds, Soleri\u2019s utopia defaulted to plain old mid-20th century patriarchy: \u201cPaolo always said, \u2018I\u2019m building the instrument; you have to play the music.\u2019 But he would dictate every single note of music that was ever played. It was the nature of his personality, and the people that gathered around him, that prevented him from having peers who would challenge him. That could have helped him and improved it.\u201d If anyone is qualified to assess the success of Soleri\u2019s \u201curban experiment\u201d, it is surely Daniela. She has spent most of her life weighing it up. In her view, \u201c70% of it is really valuable and helpful and realistic, and 30% of it is poisonous\u201d. Rather than attempt a surgical separation of artist and work, or dismiss Soleri\u2019s legacy wholesale, it is perhaps more worthwhile to identify what could still be of value. Daniela no longer has any involvement with the Cosanti Foundation. \u201cI just stay away because it\u2019s too sad to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was the personal loss, in terms of all the friendships and family. But also there was this institution that I really believed in strongly.\u201d She still believes in a positive way forward: \u201cBut it has to be honest. It has to be clear about what happened and how it was handled, and what that meant \u2013 not in terms of me and people who were there, but in terms of how the institution functioned. His work deserves recognition. But I believe its value should never negate his faults.\u201d \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>Iridescent blue, bilious green, orange, violet, black, blood-red. In English National Opera\u2019s spectacular staging of Puccini\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/madam-butterfly/\" title=\"\">Madam Butterfly</a></strong> (1904), the language of colour is as eloquent as the action it symbolises. Anthony Minghella\u2019s much-loved production, new in 2005, is back for its seventh revival (directed by Glen Sheppard) and still holds its magnetic power. The British film-maker died <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/18/filmnews.theatrenews\" title=\"\">in 2008</a>. It\u2019s a continuing regret that this was his only work in opera. Some may find its lush cinematic gestures and puppeteers too much, a needless glaze on a work that churns with its own potent imagery. When the cast holds the stage as powerfully as here, the union of music and staging is near ideal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No one needs say #MeToo. Puccini writes it into every note of the score</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Welsh soprano <a href=\"https://www.intermusica.co.uk/artist/Natalya-Romaniw\" title=\"\">Natalya Romaniw</a>, already an ENO favourite, sang the title role of Cio-Cio San. She has the combination of vocal steel, physical stillness and an ability to sing softly yet with control. Against the odds, you can believe she is indeed a fragile, impoverished 15-year-old Japanese virgin in Nagasaki, as resolute as she is innocent. That credibility is the secret of a great Butterfly. Her love for the American naval officer Pinkerton is as real as her knowledge, however suppressed, of his perfidy. Romaniw\u2019s performance has no fluttering fans (though elegantly choreographed fan-work features elsewhere), shuffling feet or any other gesture that could be interpreted as wrongly \u201coriental\u201d.</p> <p>This opera by an Italian composer was based on a play by an American (David Belasco), in turn taken from a short story by another American, inspired by the experience of his sister who had been to Japan with her husband, a Methodist missionary. Disentangling issues of historical cultural appropriation, always alive with productions of this work, now seems less urgent than seeing the work for its basic, and base, humanity. No one needs to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a>. Puccini writes it into every note of the score, expertly judged and paced by Martyn Brabbins, with sensuous, turbulent playing from ENO\u2019s orchestra. Pinkerton\u2019s voice is high-lying, verging on the bullying and petulant \u2013 perhaps not quite to the degree the American tenor <a href=\"http://www.dimitripittas.com/\" title=\"\">Dimitri Pittas </a>delivered on first night; some quieter singing would add depth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c056b88df0224dd0ae728cf1a2e6ba4414ef01ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c056b88df0224dd0ae728cf1a2e6ba4414ef01ac/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalya Romaniw (Cio-Cio San) and Dimitri Pittas (Pinkerton) in Madam Butterfly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalya Romaniw (Cio-Cio San) and Dimitri Pittas (Pinkerton) in Madam Butterfly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast, the troubled consul Sharpless is softer-grained and reflective, especially as sung, beautifully, by the baritone <a href=\"http://www.grovesartists.com/artist/roderick-williams/\" title=\"\">Roderick Williams</a>. Butterfly is Pinkerton\u2019s plaything, his toy, his child bride, until he finds a real, grown-up American bride. The consul perceives all. So too does the maid Suzuki, played with generous wisdom by mezzo-soprano <a href=\"https://www.stephaniewindsorlewis.com/\" title=\"\">Stephanie Windsor-Lewis</a>. Alasdair Elliott\u2019s Goro, Keel Watson\u2019s Bonze, Njabulo Madlala\u2019s Prince Yamadori, and Katie Stevenson, compressing so much pain and conflict into the tiny role of Kate Pinkerton, completed the ensemble. Michael Levine\u2019s designs, Han Feng\u2019s stunning costumes, Peter Mumford\u2019s lighting, Carolyn Choa\u2019s choreography and the puppetry of <a href=\"https://www.blindsummit.com/\" title=\"\">Blind Summit Theatre</a> still stand up to scrutiny. There are many seats available, between now and April. Go and fill them.</p> <p>The young Scottish composer <a href=\"http://www.lliampaterson.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lliam Paterson</a>\u2019s new opera, <strong><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/the-angel-esmeralda\" title=\"\">The Angel Esmeralda</a></strong>, twangs into life with an electric guitar solo: no standard orchestra, this, but one with two keyboards, two tuned percussion, saxophones and electric harp. Hearing this work so soon after John Adam\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/22/nixon-in-china-scottish-opera-review-theatre-royal-glasgow-john-adams\" title=\"\">Nixon in China</a></em>, with that work\u2019s sophisticated slip-knot rhythms, you hear echoes. Paterson\u2019s own compositional voice is assured and lyrical, but not yet so distinctive. In a union between Scottish Opera, which commissioned the work, and Guildhall School of Music and Drama,<em> The Angel Esmeralda</em> was given its world premiere on Monday, conducted by Dominic Wheeler.</p> <p>We\u2019re now so reliant on surtitles in opera, we can feel adrift without them, however expert the diction of all concerned. I didn\u2019t know Don DeLillo\u2019s short story before encountering Paterson\u2019s opera on which it is based, to a libretto by Pamela Carter. The blurb \u2013 set in the violent Bronx in the 1970s; a \u201cmysterious girl\u201d disappears \u2013 promised action enough. Instead, the internal worlds of an old nun wedded to tradition and a young nun committed to social change are key to the drama. It\u2019s more cantata than opera. The in-the-round staging, skilfully directed by Martin Lloyd-Evans though it was, further splintered the work\u2019s theatrical integrity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"725cc3d6e24cd7f77524b5da5ec9d06d7d37b7e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/725cc3d6e24cd7f77524b5da5ec9d06d7d37b7e6/0_266_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harriet Burns and Elsa Roux Chamoux in The Angel Esmeralda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harriet Burns and Elsa Roux Chamoux in The Angel Esmeralda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mihaela Bodlovic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paterson (b1991), responsible for the ingenious babies\u2019 opera <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/14/bambino-scottish-opera-review-albert-herring-carmen-grange-turandot-royal-opera\" title=\"\">BambinO</a></em>, writes idiomatically for voice. Stirring choral set pieces, and a smaller group of five \u201cObservers\u201d \u2013 each an excellent soloist \u2013 frame the nuns\u2019 discourse. In the first cast, Elsa Roux Chamoux, fervent as the older sister, Edgar, and Harriet Burns, equipped with great coloratura skills as Grace, showed huge promise. What was the impulse for this collaboration? On further inquiry, it turns out that the work started life on a smaller scale. Guildhall opera school worked with the composer to expand the piece, giving more opportunities for principals and orchestra. A rewarding training project may yet have diluted rather than concentrated the original creative instinct.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Madam Butterfly </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>The Angel Esmeralda </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/madam-butterfly/\" title=\"\">Madam Butterfly</a> is in rep at the Coliseum, London, until 17 April</p>",

In English National Opera\u2019s spectacular staging of Puccini\u2019s Madam Butterfly (1904), the language of colour is as eloquent as the action it symbolises. Anthony Minghella\u2019s much-loved production, new in 2005, is back for its seventh revival (directed by Glen Sheppard) and still holds its magnetic power. The British film-maker died in 2008. It\u2019s a continuing regret that this was his only work in opera. Some may find its lush cinematic gestures and puppeteers too much, a needless glaze on a work that churns with its own potent imagery. When the cast holds the stage as powerfully as here, the union of music and staging is near ideal. The Welsh soprano Natalya Romaniw, already an ENO favourite, sang the title role of Cio-Cio San. She has the combination of vocal steel, physical stillness and an ability to sing softly yet with control. Against the odds, you can believe she is indeed a fragile, impoverished 15-year-old Japanese virgin in Nagasaki, as resolute as she is innocent. That credibility is the secret of a great Butterfly. Her love for the American naval officer Pinkerton is as real as her knowledge, however suppressed, of his perfidy. Romaniw\u2019s performance has no fluttering fans (though elegantly choreographed fan-work features elsewhere), shuffling feet or any other gesture that could be interpreted as wrongly \u201coriental\u201d. This opera by an Italian composer was based on a play by an American (David Belasco), in turn taken from a short story by another American, inspired by the experience of his sister who had been to Japan with her husband, a Methodist missionary. Disentangling issues of historical cultural appropriation, always alive with productions of this work, now seems less urgent than seeing the work for its basic, and base, humanity. No one needs to say #MeToo. Puccini writes it into every note of the score, expertly judged and paced by Martyn Brabbins, with sensuous, turbulent playing from ENO\u2019s orchestra. Pinkerton\u2019s voice is high-lying, verging on the bullying and petulant \u2013 perhaps not quite to the degree the American tenor Dimitri Pittas delivered on first night; some quieter singing would add depth. In contrast, the troubled consul Sharpless is softer-grained and reflective, especially as sung, beautifully, by the baritone Roderick Williams. Butterfly is Pinkerton\u2019s plaything, his toy, his child bride, until he finds a real, grown-up American bride. The consul perceives all. So too does the maid Suzuki, played with generous wisdom by mezzo-soprano Stephanie Windsor-Lewis. Alasdair Elliott\u2019s Goro, Keel Watson\u2019s Bonze, Njabulo Madlala\u2019s Prince Yamadori, and Katie Stevenson, compressing so much pain and conflict into the tiny role of Kate Pinkerton, completed the ensemble. Michael Levine\u2019s designs, Han Feng\u2019s stunning costumes, Peter Mumford\u2019s lighting, Carolyn Choa\u2019s choreography and the puppetry of Blind Summit Theatre still stand up to scrutiny. There are many seats available, between now and April. Go and fill them. The young Scottish composer Lliam Paterson\u2019s new opera, The Angel Esmeralda, twangs into life with an electric guitar solo: no standard orchestra, this, but one with two keyboards, two tuned percussion, saxophones and electric harp. Hearing this work so soon after John Adam\u2019s Nixon in China, with that work\u2019s sophisticated slip-knot rhythms, you hear echoes. Paterson\u2019s own compositional voice is assured and lyrical, but not yet so distinctive. In a union between Scottish Opera, which commissioned the work, and Guildhall School of Music and Drama, The Angel Esmeralda was given its world premiere on Monday, conducted by Dominic Wheeler. We\u2019re now so reliant on surtitles in opera, we can feel adrift without them, however expert the diction of all concerned. I didn\u2019t know Don DeLillo\u2019s short story before encountering Paterson\u2019s opera on which it is based, to a libretto by Pamela Carter. The blurb \u2013 set in the violent Bronx in the 1970s; a \u201cmysterious girl\u201d disappears \u2013 promised action enough. Instead, the internal worlds of an old nun wedded to tradition and a young nun committed to social change are key to the drama. It\u2019s more cantata than opera. The in-the-round staging, skilfully directed by Martin Lloyd-Evans though it was, further splintered the work\u2019s theatrical integrity. Paterson (b1991), responsible for the ingenious babies\u2019 opera BambinO, writes idiomatically for voice. Stirring choral set pieces, and a smaller group of five \u201cObservers\u201d \u2013 each an excellent soloist \u2013 frame the nuns\u2019 discourse. In the first cast, Elsa Roux Chamoux, fervent as the older sister, Edgar, and Harriet Burns, equipped with great coloratura skills as Grace, showed huge promise. What was the impulse for this collaboration? On further inquiry, it turns out that the work started life on a smaller scale. Guildhall opera school worked with the composer to expand the piece, giving more opportunities for principals and orchestra. A rewarding training project may yet have diluted rather than concentrated the original creative instinct.

      "bodyText": "Five Serie A matches scheduled for this weekend have been postponed due to the spread of the coronavirus in Italy, with the crunch top-of-the-table clash between Inter and Juventus among them. All of the games had been scheduled to take place behind closed doors after the government banned public gatherings in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. However, in a statement released on Saturday morning, Serie A officials said the five affected matches have all now been rescheduled for Wednesday 13 May. The other fixtures are Udinese v Fiorentina, Milan v Genoa, Parma v Spal and Sassuolo v Brescia. Reuters reported that a football official, speaking off the record, said broadcasters and fans did not want the matches to be played in empty stadiums. Nearly 900 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Italy, with cafes and schools closed as daily life has ground to a halt. This weekend\u2019s matches in the top two divisions in Switzerland had already been postponed after the government banned events involving more than 1,000 people. Fifa president Gianni Infantino promised on Friday to do whatever is necessary to help combat the continued spread of the virus. Speaking in Belfast ahead of the annual general meeting of the International Football Association Board, Infantino said: \u201cThe health of persons is much more important than any football game. That\u2019s why we have to look at the situation and hope that it will decrease rather than increase. At the moment it looks like it is still increasing. If games have to be postponed or played without spectators until it is over, then we have to go through that.\u201d Elsewhere, Danish cyclist Michael Morkov has been cleared to race at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships after two individuals suspected of having the coronavirus at the UAE Tour tested negative. Morkov, 34, spent 34 hours in isolation in Berlin after travelling to the German capital from the UAE Tour, where he raced the opening four stages. The final two stages of that race were cancelled on Thursday night when two members of staff on the race developed symptoms suggesting they could have the virus, and riders and staff on the race remain under lockdown in Abu Dhabi. But, after the Abu Dhabi Department of Health issued a statement on Saturday saying the first 167 tests had come back negative, the UCI said Morkov was free to race as normal in Berlin. The opening round of the 2020 World Triathlon Series scheduled for Abu Dhabi became the latest event to be hit by the outbreak as the International Triathlon Union (ITU) decided to postpone it as a precautionary measure. The event was due to take place on Yas Island from 5-7 March, with organisers now looking for a new date in March or April. The rapid spread of the coronavirus has seen the World Health Organization (WHO) raise its global spread and impact risk alert to \u201cvery high\u201d. \u201cTravel restrictions and quarantines imposed by some countries and airlines for individuals and groups travelling from or to areas affected by the outbreak make it impossible to go ahead with the event in the planned dates,\u201d the ITU said in a statement. \u201cBut all stakeholders are working tirelessly against the clock to find a new date to host the event.\u201d",

Like an overzealous aunt at a wedding, it has an uncanny habit of crashing its way into your life. One minute it\u2019s background noise burbling from your flatmate\u2019s laptop, the next minute you\u2019re backstage at a Brighton gay bar with a glue gun in one hand and a box of rapidly expiring butterflies in the other, Michelle Visage screaming at you that she needs the next queen in TEN SECONDS.</p> <p>If you\u2019re here, we don\u2019t need to explain the format of the show. You know the score. There will be completely unpredictable but somehow also completely predictable twists. There will be bad puns. There will be at least one drink thrown in someone\u2019s face. So, without further ado, ladies and gentlemen and those clever enough to transcend gender \u2013 let\u2019s go! SPOILERS AHOY.</p> <h2>Meet the Queens</h2> <p>\u201cHere we go, sis! Y\u2019ALL THIRSTY?\u201d Brita is here \u2013 15 seconds in and we\u2019re already exhausted. She\u2019s got so much energy. Why is she walking energetically and drinking a martini at the same time? Why did she down it and then turn the glass upside down? What\u2019s happening? She says she\u2019s <em>the </em>queen of New York City. Somewhere on the Upper East Side, Sarah Jessica Parker just threw a Manolo at the TV. Side note \u2013 the first queen into the workroom is likely to do well in the competition, because chances are she\u2019s the one producers trust to do well in a room (or on a stage) by herself.</p> <p>After Brita, with a not-at-all-stereotypical accordion soundtrack, we have Drag Race\u2019s first ever FRENCH queen, Nicky Doll!

      "bodyText": "Drag Race is back, and there\u2019s no point pretending to yourself or anyone else that you\u2019re not going to watch it. Like an overzealous aunt at a wedding, it has an uncanny habit of crashing its way into your life. One minute it\u2019s background noise burbling from your flatmate\u2019s laptop, the next minute you\u2019re backstage at a Brighton gay bar with a glue gun in one hand and a box of rapidly expiring butterflies in the other, Michelle Visage screaming at you that she needs the next queen in TEN SECONDS. If you\u2019re here, we don\u2019t need to explain the format of the show. You know the score. There will be completely unpredictable but somehow also completely predictable twists. There will be bad puns. There will be at least one drink thrown in someone\u2019s face. So, without further ado, ladies and gentlemen and those clever enough to transcend gender \u2013 let\u2019s go! SPOILERS AHOY. Meet the Queens \u201cHere we go, sis! Y\u2019ALL THIRSTY?\u201d Brita is here \u2013 15 seconds in and we\u2019re already exhausted. She\u2019s got so much energy. Why is she walking energetically and drinking a martini at the same time? Why did she down it and then turn the glass upside down? What\u2019s happening? She says she\u2019s the queen of New York City. Somewhere on the Upper East Side, Sarah Jessica Parker just threw a Manolo at the TV. Side note \u2013 the first queen into the workroom is likely to do well in the competition, because chances are she\u2019s the one producers trust to do well in a room (or on a stage) by herself. After Brita, with a not-at-all-stereotypical accordion soundtrack, we have Drag Race\u2019s first ever FRENCH queen, Nicky Doll! Betty Boop styled by Jean Paul Gaultier. Still looking for that three-eyed raven, Bran Stark? Well Widow Von\u2019Du is wearing it! She\u2019s next in and wants everyone to know that she spells the word \u201call\u201d with four A\u2019s, eight 0\u2019s and three L\u2019s. \u201cAAAOOOOOOOOLLL.\u201d It should really be seven 0\u2019s actually Widow, not eight. That\u2019s the official Oxford English spelling. Next up it\u2019s Jackie Cox, a \u201cmiddle eastern nerd\u201d and \u201cqueen of the cabaret scene\u201d \u2013 what a combo! She seems sweet but very high energy, like you\u2019d need a cup of tea and a nice sit down if you spent more than 10 minutes in her company. Then, head-to-toe in pink zebra \u201cleprosy print\u201d (!) and doing a shrill tongue-flap ululation thing (!) it\u2019s Heidi N Closet (!). God, we love this show. And we think we might be obsessed with Heidi. That could be because it\u2019s the first week though. Come back to us in week four. \u201cAhoy.\u201d Gigi Goode stalks in and she looks fantastic. A punchy Pirates of The Caribbean look, seemingly hewn from the carpet of a small historic cinema in Canterbury. She\u2019s polished, she\u2019s confident and some of the other queens know her from Instagram. In reality TV show editing terms, \u201cthe threat\u201d has arrived. Crystal Methyd skips in next \u2013 yes, actually skips \u2013 and she\u2019s like \u2026 she\u2019s \u2026she\u2019s actually a mix of about three thousand things and there are only so many hours in the day so we\u2019ll leave it there. Seven queens and, so far \u2026 that\u2019s it! As Ru reveals, we\u2019ll be meeting the next seven in the second season 12 premiere next week. Crikey. Minichallenge The queens have to present spring AND fall runway looks. Whatever happened to the simpler days of a green screen, a pile of trash and the chance to look at Mike Ruiz\u2019s arms?! Nicky Doll is \u201cserving you nymph going to Olympus, and I\u2019m on Zeus\u2019 list, bitch.\u201d RuPaul pretends she doesn\u2019t know how to pronounce \u201cneoprene\u201d. No winner is announced. There\u2019s a lot going on to be fair, they probably just forgot. Kiki or kai kai? In a Drag Race twist that no-one saw coming, Nicky has decided she fancies Crystal, but somehow still manages to be shady by saying \u201cwho would have thought that behind all that clown makeup was this cute twink?\u201d Nicky also fancies Jackie. There\u2019s a theme emerging. Speaking of Jackie, she gives viewers some great no-nonsense insight into the intersectionality and difficulties of being both Iranian and a drag queen. Bravo, Jackie! Maxichallenge As the girls prepare to rap in front of Nicki Minaj (gay gasp!) there is, unsurprisingly, mild to moderate tension as they work out who should choreograph. Somehow \u2013 inexplicably, preposterously, wonderfully \u2013 this all ends with Heidi N Closet being in charge of the entire dance routine. Straight to the main stage, and barely halfway through episode 1 we\u2019re ALREADY being blasted through a catchy, customised, stream-it-on-Spotify, buy-it-on-iTunes brand new RuPaul number. She\u2019s a millionaire for a reason. Sissy that walk Nicki Minaj looks like she might actually know where she is for once, as Carson Cresley bubbles over with excitement (as always). RuPaul and Michelle are discerning as ever. THE TWIST: This week, everyone\u2019s safe (presumably until week three, where the two weakest from the two premieres will compete \u2013 again, exhausting). Instead, the two strongest \u2013 Widow and Gigi \u2013 lipsync for a cash prize of $5,000. Lipsync for your LIFE A drink-spillingly epic song choice in Starships. At one point, Gigi decides to simply lie motionless on the floor \u2013 the most deathly of death drops. In a way, it\u2019s genius \u2013 apathy in its most assured and glamorous incarnation, like Lana Del Rey. Widow gives three thousand per cent and, obviously, wins. Notes and observations Shadiest moment Feel the love in this opening episode. Michelle Visage\u2019s barely-suppressed scowl at Nicki Minaj deserves a mention though. Catchphrase watch Heidi going \u201cLILILILILI\u201d with her tongue \u2013 does that count as a catchphrase? Animal print hunt Positively predatory at a total of TEN garments \u2013 Brita\u2019s dress, Brita\u2019s fascinator, Heidi\u2019s jacket, Heidi\u2019s skirt, Heidi\u2019s fascinator, Heidi\u2019s bag, Crystal\u2019s shirt, Crystal\u2019s neckerchief, Crystal\u2019s rap look, Gigi\u2019s rap look. Just between us squorlfriends The absence of trans contestants on Drag Race has now become uncomfortably palpable, but unlike some recent years, the season 12 cast is sweet, switched on and instantly appealing. And we\u2019re meeting more next week! We can\u2019t WAIT to see how this turns out. What did you think? Who made you gag and who\u2019s set to sashay away?",

      "body": "<p>Ludicrous to think that it has been 10 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/15/the-trip-series-four-greece-rob-brydon-steve-coogan\" title=\"\">The Trip</a> first aired, a movie-in-the-shape-of-a-TV-show where Rob Brydon annoyed Steve Coogan around the Pennines, for no reason, while they slowly ate food. There is no way of describing The Trip without it sounding featherlight and pointless \u2013 \u201cTwo men approach their 50s by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFIQIpC5_wY&amp;list=PLAE8683DAEAA24C20\" title=\"\">aggressively impersonating Michael Caine</a> \u201d \u2013 but to love The Trip, as I unashamedly do, is to watch it first-hand, to consume it, to let it wash over you like a wave. Yes: a vast percentage of the show\u2019s four episodic series is just Rob Brydon licking his lips and shouting: \u201cWHATTYA GOT?\u201d at a succession of politely smiling waitresses. But somehow within that there is art.</p> <p>The Trip to Greece (Tuesday, 10pm, Sky One) is just every other series of The Trip, then, though this time in Greece. Brydon again plays an amped-up version of himself, clanging on the verge of annoying, seemingly missing two or three of humanity\u2019s core social nodes, always singing that same song, a Ronnie Corbett impression that goes on too long; while Coogan does the same, playing himself-but-not-himself, the chip-shouldered, fractious actor who takes driving very seriously and always seems on the verge of a full-blown temper tantrum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"145eb97ba49eda8c366db581c43981c09cbdd380\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/145eb97ba49eda8c366db581c43981c09cbdd380/0_323_6474_3884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Trip to Greece.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ancient ruins\u2026 The Trip to Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over exquisite Michelin-starred meals in blue-skied idylls, they jab, tuck and bob their way at each other, a love language of impersonations and \u201ccompetitively remembering things\u201d. Coogan will always sleep with the same photographer and not quite know how to love his son. Brydon will always reveal himself, tender and human, on the phone to his wife. Someone will always, without fail, wear an unflattering hat. Although this trip is supposedly that of Odysseus, tracing his epic journey home, it more often feels Sisyphean: the same rock, pushed up the same mountain, the same slow trundle back down again, the same roving drone shot of a Range Rover, the same moody stare off the side of a ferry.</p> <p>That is not to say The Trip to Greece is not still very good. It absolutely is. But, as a viewer, there is a strange note to watching the fourth series: you almost want something new to happen, even though that\u2019s the exact inverse of the point of this. To watch The Trip is to watch the two most entertaining people you know absolutely dominate a dinner party conversation while you just sit silently and watch: it is not about giving you some robust story to chew on. The Trip doesn\u2019t need a pregnancy-scare storyline, or a character having a sudden identity crisis.</p> <p>Good, then, I suppose, that this series gives us none of them. There are always those big, lightly painted themes to The Trip \u2013 life, death, legacy, the fading of man \u2013 and always some quiet threat of dread, a phone call or email taken on a cliff that threatens to upend the world. And that\u2019s it. Then, as surely as the sun sizzles into the sea, Rob Brydon points a flat palm at a plate of risotto, looks around an empty restaurant soundtracked by cicadas, licks his little Welsh lips, and whispers: \u201cWhattya got?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ludicrous to think that it has been 10 years since The Trip first aired, a movie-in-the-shape-of-a-TV-show where Rob Brydon annoyed Steve Coogan around the Pennines, for no reason, while they slowly ate food. There is no way of describing The Trip without it sounding featherlight and pointless \u2013 \u201cTwo men approach their 50s by aggressively impersonating Michael Caine \u201d \u2013 but to love The Trip, as I unashamedly do, is to watch it first-hand, to consume it, to let it wash over you like a wave. Yes: a vast percentage of the show\u2019s four episodic series is just Rob Brydon licking his lips and shouting: \u201cWHATTYA GOT?\u201d at a succession of politely smiling waitresses. But somehow within that there is art. The Trip to Greece (Tuesday, 10pm, Sky One) is just every other series of The Trip, then, though this time in Greece. Brydon again plays an amped-up version of himself, clanging on the verge of annoying, seemingly missing two or three of humanity\u2019s core social nodes, always singing that same song, a Ronnie Corbett impression that goes on too long; while Coogan does the same, playing himself-but-not-himself, the chip-shouldered, fractious actor who takes driving very seriously and always seems on the verge of a full-blown temper tantrum. Over exquisite Michelin-starred meals in blue-skied idylls, they jab, tuck and bob their way at each other, a love language of impersonations and \u201ccompetitively remembering things\u201d. Coogan will always sleep with the same photographer and not quite know how to love his son. Brydon will always reveal himself, tender and human, on the phone to his wife. Someone will always, without fail, wear an unflattering hat. Although this trip is supposedly that of Odysseus, tracing his epic journey home, it more often feels Sisyphean: the same rock, pushed up the same mountain, the same slow trundle back down again, the same roving drone shot of a Range Rover, the same moody stare off the side of a ferry. That is not to say The Trip to Greece is not still very good. It absolutely is. But, as a viewer, there is a strange note to watching the fourth series: you almost want something new to happen, even though that\u2019s the exact inverse of the point of this. To watch The Trip is to watch the two most entertaining people you know absolutely dominate a dinner party conversation while you just sit silently and watch: it is not about giving you some robust story to chew on. The Trip doesn\u2019t need a pregnancy-scare storyline, or a character having a sudden identity crisis. Good, then, I suppose, that this series gives us none of them. There are always those big, lightly painted themes to The Trip \u2013 life, death, legacy, the fading of man \u2013 and always some quiet threat of dread, a phone call or email taken on a cliff that threatens to upend the world. And that\u2019s it. Then, as surely as the sun sizzles into the sea, Rob Brydon points a flat palm at a plate of risotto, looks around an empty restaurant soundtracked by cicadas, licks his little Welsh lips, and whispers: \u201cWhattya got?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A pulsating finish to a real packed day of sport across Australasia. That was some finish to a game of basketball - let alone a finals match - in the NBL, where Sydney Kings have pulled off one of the all-time great comebacks. In the A-League, a dramatic finish as well as Victory snatched a late winner courtesy Andrew Nabbout to win a classic \u201coriginal derby\u201d against Adelaide, with Marco Rojas also re-opening his Victory account. Earlier, a big surprise as bottom-placed Jets stunned second-placed Perth by the same 2-1 margin. In the AFLW a first ever win for the West Coast Eagles who hung tough against the Western Bulldogs, while North Melbourne came from behind to sink the Suns. In the NRL Charity Shield the Bunnies showed their fans plenty to be excited about for the season ahead, as they saw off early resistance from the Dragons to win, five tries to two. Something for everyone - another classic Saturday Sportwatch! Would you believe it. Just as the clocked ticked 90, a player who was guilty of so many missed chances earlier on has handed Victory a critical three points! Andrew Nabbout - sporting one of the most ridiculous shiners after a head clash - only needed one eye to thump home a terrific finish. The Reds hit the crossbar twice in that second half, but they\u2019ve lost the cherries. What a pulsating second half - and maybe, just maybe, Victory\u2019s lumbering season is still alive! Those are the games of B\u2019ball that haunt retired players. Sydney have put something like a 24-2 final quarter scoring run - it\u2019s a meltdown of the most epic proportions for the visitors from Victoria. Home fans are ecstatic - that was a ridiculous end to this, the opening game of the finals series. Andrew Bogut calms some of the younger heads from getting too excited - it\u2019s still only 1-0; but wow. What a remarkable close to this one. NBL: Sydney Kings 82-80 Melbourne United - 40s\u2019 Caspar Ware sinks two, to make 79-80. It was a one-point margin as Perth beat Cairns in the first semi-final 108-107 last night - are we set for another thriller? Melbourne get sent to the stripe but to a chorus of boos, the United shooter misses two from two! And then the Brazilian Louzada goes up the other end and sinks two for the Kings! They were down by 16 points at one stage, the Kings - but they\u2019re doing it late. 82-80 with 40 seconds to go on the clock! We\u2019ve about ten to run in the A-League, where as it currently stands, Adelaide could - remarkably - be on track for their first draw of the season, nineteen games in! But, lets\u2019 get to the NBL - we\u2019ve about 90 seconds on the clock and it\u2019s the Kings trailing by 3 against rivals Melbourne in the second semi-final! Ugh. It\u2019s turned into a bloodbath - and what a tour of Australasia it\u2019s been for the visitors who snaffle another W. The skipper Am with a terrific intercept try, before the Sharks got it done out wide, through Tambwe, following a terrific counter raid that went through plenty of hands. They played about eight minutes extra time as the Sharks chased a bonus point try, but it was the Reds who were eventually rewarded for their own perseverance, with a first Super Rugby try to Craig. A fourth loss of the season for the Reds - plenty for coach Brad Thorn to mull over. Twenty-two unanswered points for the Bunnies in the second half whose depth was just too much for the Dragons. No Damien Cook, Reynolds off and a bunch of senior players rested, but it was the Rabbitohs rookies who got it done. Alex Johnson with South Sydney\u2019s fifth and final try. Good signs for the season ahead for Bunnies believers. A-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 1-1 Adelaide (Rojas) 57 min: Three times a charm - it\u2019s the diminutive Kiwi, back in his third spell with Melbourne Victory who produces something from nothing! It was a quickly-taken throw in, and Rojas responded first, charging into the box and firing past Izzo. And suddenly, the Reds\u2019 grasp on this game is looking very, very shaky. What a finish to this one! It\u2019s the Bulldogs with the chance to win it from the set shot, and Kirsten McLeod hooks it right! The fine margins on which games turn. Huge celebrations from the home side on the final whistle. \u201cScenes! Absolute scenes!\u201d is the appraisal from the commentary box - and why not: it\u2019s the Eagles\u2019 first ever four points! A cracking finale. And for boxing fans, this is a cracker of a piece from the one and only Barney Ronay, on the complex, controversial, but irrepressibly popular Tyson Fury. One for devotees and bemused onlookers alike. Super Rugby - 60 min: Reds 16-21 Sharks An offensive chance for the Queenslanders after a poor clearance, but they\u2019ve struggling against this imposing South African pack, and they eventually concede the scrum penalty - Du Toit has just monstered his opposite number Hooper. But there\u2019s an illegal forearm the Sharks\u2019 No 16. That seems a stiff call against the visitors. Didn\u2019t seem much there. As you can sense - this one remains: tiight. NRL Charity Shield - 60 min: South Sydney 20-12 St George And from the Blue V to the Red V, let\u2019s get back to Mudgee, where it\u2019s been a real turnaround since the interval for the Dragons. It\u2019s been all Souths, with Bailey Sironen in the mix for plenty. Tries to Mago, Sironen and Koloamatangi - this perhaps the pick of them: Gee, they\u2019ve got some depth in this squad, don\u2019t they - the Bunnies? A-League - half-time: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Adelaide I mentioned that wave of Victory attacks - they lead 16-5 on the shot count, with 5-1 on target. But guess what. Adelaide\u2019s one effort proved a good one from Opseth, and that\u2019s the difference at this stage. The ice-cool Swede Ola Toivonen is running unusually hot. Somebody needs to get inside his head and settle him down. He was in the book early for backchat, and walked a tightrope for much of that half. His late miss spoke very much of a hugely frustrated player. Victory need him focused after the break. AFLW - 3/4 time: West Coast 3.6 (24) leads Western Bulldogs 2.5 (17) It\u2019s a good quarter for the home side, with the Kelly sisters from Ireland combining brilliantly and causing their fair share of havoc. Hayley Bullas with a \u201csoccer\u201d from close range with the game looking very tight at just a two-point margin. Repeat entries and repeat pressure gets its rewards. Kirsty Lamb with a bad miss for the Dogs late on. They\u2019re still showing plenty of bite though. A-League - 43 min: Mias days. Ola Toivonen - one of the best strikers in the league has just squandered one of the most gilt-edged chances you can imagine: a free header, about four metres out - and he nods it wide! It\u2019s backs to the walls for the Reds, who have weathered an absolute storm for large parts of the half - but the Victory can\u2019t find the leveller. A-League - 33 min: Yikes. That was a close call for the home side! The \u2018keeper Lawrence Thomas has come a long way to challenge for the ball, but he\u2019s got nothing but man! Is that a red card? Referee Chris Beath produces a card - but it\u2019s yellow. Perhaps a covering defender has just saved the Victory custodian there. My, they would have been in all sorts - they still trail 0-1, the Big V. And from the world of tennis - a cracker in Qatar, where it\u2019s arguably the two most consistent women on the circuit at the moment locking horns once again. Sadly for Australian fans, it wasn\u2019t to be Ash Barty\u2019s night on this occasion: Super Rugby - half-time: Reds 11-8 Sharks It\u2019s tight and tense up in Queensland at the break. It is of course the two sides placed second in their respective conferences - the difference is for the South Africans that\u2019s a 3-1 record, for the Australians, a 1-3. Still, it\u2019s the Reds just shading this one - a late penalty the only addition to the score since last update. Could turn into a war of attrition second half. NRL Charity Shield - half-time: South Sydney 4-12 St George It\u2019s the Dragons who are out by over a converted try at the break, with Tyrell Fuimaono crashing over from close range. Zac Lomax with 2/2 from the boot, in a game that\u2019s been largely even - the Dragons perhaps just finishing their sets a little better. Still, plenty of X-Factors in this Rabbitohs side to get back in front. AFLW - half-time: West Coast 1.4 (10) trail Western Bulldogs 2.3 (15) And they do start to make their statistical superiority pay, the visitors. Goals to Kimberley Rennie and Danielle Marshall see the Dogs nose in front. Ellie Blackburn and Hannah Scott with double-digit disposals as they look to inspire their teammates. Still, fine margins in this one - first score after the break could be important for momentum. And it\u2019s not technically a sport, but it\u2019s definitely a sporting occasion. A big shoutout to all those around Sydney\u2019s Oxford st tonight for the Mardi Gras. Have a safe, fun, glittery evening! A-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 0-1 Adelaide (Opseth) 7 min: Cat - meet pigeons. It\u2019s a refashioned Victory, no Jakob Poulsen at all, Hoogland at right back, Broxham back in midfield - but the same result! It\u2019s a clever ball from McGree who feeds the big Norwegian. But he\u2019s had an acre of room to find a finish, Kristian Opseth, and he curls it home past an outstretched Lawrence Thomas! Not the start the home faithful were expecting. Super Rugby - Try! Reds 8-8 Sharks (Speight) 17 min: It\u2019s the Sharks who go in first, just three minutes earlier through van Vuuren, but the Reds hit back in impressive fashion - some fine running rugby as they go wide and Speight is the man to close. His fifth try in five against the Sharks. Okay - we\u2019re just about at kickoff for Victory\u2019s clash with Adelaide in the A-League. Let\u2019s play a guessing game - who am I? D-L-D-L-L-L. If you guessed \u201cMelbourne Victory\u2019s recent form\u201d you\u2019d be correct! Explaining why arguably the competition\u2019s biggest club is on track for missing the A-League finals for the first time since 2011/12. Here\u2019s the XIs: And Adelaide: Would you believe, courtesy the Newcastle Jets\u2019 shock win, Victory start this game 10th on the table, just Mariners below them. NRL Charity Shield - 25 min: The Rabbitohs with a two-on-two about 5m out from the Dragon\u2019s line, but Braidon Burns can\u2019t find his teammate with the trick-flick and the opportunity goes begging. It\u2019s defences on top at this stage - certainly not the tryfest of last year. AFLW: West Coast 1.2 (9) lead Western Bulldogs 0.2 (2) First blood to the Eagles, as Ashley Atkins kicks the first significant one of the contest. Emma Swanson lively early on for the home side, but there\u2019s not much between the two in the stats department. The Bulldogs doing much better in inside 50s and marks inside the arc, but perhaps some wayward shooting has let them down. Super Rugby - 5 min: A real nasty headknock for the Sharks\u2019s skipper Lukhanyo Am, as the ball-runner slips badly into a shoulder of the tackler. Not much the defender could do about that, but Curwin Bosch steps up and slots the resulting penalty. 3-3. NRL Charity Shield - Try! Souths 4-6 St George (Vaughan) 11 min: A nice kick from Ben Hunt tests the Rabbitoh\u2019s backline, and it\u2019s a rare error from the experienced Dane Gagai who spills the pills, and Paul Vaughan is on hand to crash over. They hit their kick, ruling out Campbell Graham\u2019s try inside a minute that had the home fans pretty happy. Another early look at Latrell Mitchell at fullback, which will be a fascinating subplot to this forthcoming league season. So, a flurry of games finishing, which means a flurry of games set to start! The pick of bunch is the NRL Charity Shield, where it\u2019s Rabbits v Dragons. In the animal kingdom you\u2019d imagine that\u2019s no match (except in Monty Python), but in the world of rugby league, it\u2019s a real tester. More on that, shortly. We also have West Coast v Bulldogs in the AFLW, Reds v Sharks in the Super Rugby, and a big \u201coriginal derby\u201d clash between Adelaide and a struggling Melbourne Victory in the A-League. Engrossing narratives, all. My, oh my. Rip up the form guide - I don\u2019t think too many fans saw this result coming. But, goes to show what sprinkle dust players of the calibre of Ibini and Hoolahan can add to a side. We\u2019ve been saying it all season - Newcastle Jets were playing football that was too good for a team at the bottom of the table; now they\u2019ve got the front third threats to match it, with Roy O\u2019Donovan\u2019s return to the club another key addition. It\u2019s Tony Popovic\u2019s first ever loss at Newcastle stadium - expect Perth to lick their wounds and come back bigger and nastier after this. It\u2019s suddenly very tight at the top with three sides all locked on 30 points. So, it\u2019s Victory who finish second on the table, but a good 8-11 points behind cross-town rivals City (who have one game left to come tomorrow). It\u2019s a significant mental blow though, as depending on permutations elsewhere, these two sides could face off again next weekend in the first week of the finals. Have Sydney salvaged enough late on to salvage some belief? Or was that just too emphatic from the Victory? An intriguing \u201cwatch this space\u201d next weekend - who doesn\u2019t love W-League finals action! We get within the final five and the margin is seven - and inside the goalsquare the Suns look to fire goalwards, but there\u2019s a superb smoother! What desperation, after nearly two hours of lung-busting effort. They huff and they puff, the Suns - but the more experienced Roos stand up in the championship minutes - Daisy Bateman with the knockout punch late on, her second major of the game - and that\u2019s the tea. An engrossing clash - plenty to delight the fans. W-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 3-1 Sydney FC (Tobin) 90 min: She\u2019s been around the club for a seeming age, but has Nat Tobin ever scored a better goal than that?! That was a terrific strike - she picked it up from outside the box before curling a fierce effort top bins - former teammate Casey Dumont with absolutely no chance! It\u2019s an important goal, as with Wanderers still to play later, a heavy loss could see Sydney slide from second to fourth - which has huge ramifications for finals playoffs: a possible date with Melbourne City. A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 2-1 Perth Glory (O\u2019Donovan) 73 min: It\u2019s a fine cross in from Bobby Burns, looking for Ibini and O\u2019Donovan in the centre - Ibini gets a tiny touch, but it\u2019s the Irishman, back at the club, who bundles home past Liam Reddy! They celebrate with jubilation - but would you believe it - VAR is taking a look. There\u2019s an interminable wait - did Ibini\u2019s tiny touch make the play offside? The coaching bench is furious, the players are nervous.. No! All clear - and it\u2019s a goal! Jets take the lead. W-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 3-0 Sydney FC (Jenkins) 71 min: Oh my. That\u2019s a superb solo effort. Jenkins picks it up just outside the box and slaloms around THREE defenders with a mazy dribble, before lashing a fierce left-footed volley past the FC \u2018keeper at the near post! What a strike. And isn\u2019t she Up. For. It. Brilliant goal. A-League - 60 min: So, we\u2019re just past the hour mark, and the Jets have responded with some pretty significant names off their bench. The marquee playmaker, former Premier League star, Wes Hoolahan, and the newly-signed Socceroo, Bernie Ibini enter the fray. Fair to say some firepower there. We\u2019re still locked at 1-1. AFLW - 3/4 time: North Melbourne 5.5 (35) lead Gold Coast 4.3 (27) This one\u2019s been swinging like a pendulum do - it was the Suns with the first majors of the quarter to bring us back to a one-goal game, before Emma Carney turned on the afterburners and strode inside 50. The kick looked to lack elevation, but teammate Emma King was on hand to make it count anyway. A late miss for North Melbourne, but the Roos with the late momentum - still \u201cnicely balanced\u201d with a quarter to play. W-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 2-0 Sydney FC (Jenkins) 49 min: My - they\u2019re fast into the ascendancy here, the home side. A lot of teams have seen their seasons tail off with a few high profile Matildas being whisked away to leagues in Europe (or US imports returning for Olympics duty in the case of the Wanderers), but the big V are one team improving. Annalise Longo having a big impact, while Darien Jenkins has been scoring for fun in recent weeks. That thumping from their rivals City the pre-finals wake up they needed? So, a few NRL trial matches going on around the country. I can confirm Dale Finucane has just crashed over for the Storm, as they take an 18-4 lead into half-time. For the Bulldogs and Raiders it\u2019s still an arm-wrestle with under ten to go: 10-12 the margin in that one. W-League: Melbourne Victory 1-0 Sydney FC - half-time Amy Jackson\u2019s right footed drive around 25 minutes in has been enough to divide this one, so far - it may not have the rivalry of the men\u2019s Big Blue given the comparative challenge crosstown rivals City have posed in recent years, but you can tell there\u2019s still some feeling to this one. Winner does, of course, take second spot on the ladder behind the runaway City outfit, so plenty on the line. A-League: Newcastle Jets 1-1 Perth Glory - half-time So, despite a Nikolai Topor-Stanley thunderbastard for the Jets, we\u2019re all square at the break. Fellow Newcastle centre back Nigel Boogaard pinged for a suspected handball while sliding to stop a cross, and Perth duly converting courtesy Neil Kilkenny from the spot. A lively first 45 up in Newcastle though - new coach Carl Robinson has certainly freshened up what had become a stale looking Jets earlier in the season. Hi all! Your ol\u2019 pal RP in the chair. Thanks Megan for a sterling turn, as always. There\u2019s a veritable smorgasbord of sport going on as we speak, so we\u2019ll try and get round the grounds for that - but first from the A-League. Well, that\u2019s it from me today! But don\u2019t log off yet, Richard Parkin is on hand to guide you gently through the rest of the night\u2019s sporting action. As your resident football (the round ball variety) expert, he will have some excellent insights into those A-League and W-League matches and hopefully will have plenty to say about how much better the Dragons are than those pesky Rabbits. Until next time, I bid you all adieu! AFLW: North Melbourne lead Gold Coast 4.5 (29) to 2.2 (14) at half-time A blinder of a second quarter from North Melbourne sees them outscore their opponents 21-1 in the quarter. Jasmine Garner and Ellie Kavalas have been relentless, moving the ball around constantly and tiring out the Suns\u2019 defence. A dominant performance from India, who got the job done with a clean sweep of their four pool matches. Now they just have to sit back and wait to find out who their semi final opponents will be. They have quite a long gap until their next game - will they see that as a positive to rest their bowlers, or a negative - breaking their momentum just as they\u2019re on a strong run? AFLW: Gold Coast 2.1 (13) lead North Melbourne 1.2 (8) at quarter time The Suns take the early lead, thanks to goals from Tiana Ernst and Kalinda Howarth in the first quarter. The Suns are spreading the attacking load well, not relying on one player, but playing smartly and moving the ball around a lot. They\u2019re certainly looking the better of the two teams at the moment, lets see if they can hold on to this momentum. A-League: Newcastle 1-0 Perth after 21 mins A goal in Newcastle and the Jets take the lead through Nikolai Topor-Stanley and don\u2019t they love it? T20 World Cup: India 86-2 after 10 overs India have absolutely no interest in slow accumulation or letting Sri Lanka think they have any sort of momentum. Shafali (46* off 33) and Harmanpreet (15 off 13) punished the bowlers, trying to reduce this total as quickly as they could. Harmanpreet gets caught out in the 10th over trying to smash some more runs, but at the moment it\u2019s not a concern and Jemimah Rodrigues comes to the crease to continue where her captain left off. With a perfect record from the round matches, they\u2019re not relying on their net run rate to get them through, but they\u2019re having a stab at increasing it just for the hell of it. All the talk was naturally about the home team coming into the tournament, but this Indian team are looking exceptionally hard to beat right now. It\u2019s just hit 5pm and things have got fast and furious, with a number of new matches underway in all codes and corners of the country. Let\u2019s catch up on a quick around the grounds! The A-League has just started in Newcastle with the Jets taking on Perth Glory and the score is 0-0. In the W-League, Melbourne Victory are hosting Sydney FC and the score there is - you guessed it - 0-0. The Super W match between the Reds and Rebels is well underway and the Reds are dominating - up 19-3. Averyl Mitchell scored two early tries to put them ahead. T20 World Cup: India 34-1 after five overs India looked like they were thinking about playing it safe, but the idea didn\u2019t last for long, Smriti Mandhana smashing 17 from 12 before being dismissed in the fifth over. They\u2019ve pushed the run rate up to 7.29 - much higher than required. They want this game over quickly it seems. Shafali Verma is ticking along nicely with 16 from 16 with Harmanpreet Kaur joining her at the crease. A clinical win from Geelong in the end, who pushed ahead in the second quarter and looked after their lead for the rest of the match. Some possible trouble for both sides as the result of a clash late in the third quarter - Jordan Ivey took Katie Brennan high and may have a case to answer. A good team performance from the Cats overall, with eight goal scorers sharing the load between them. AFLM: A nice piece during the week from Jonathan Horn about the nostalgia brought about by the Victoria v All Stars charity match and its shades of State of Origin times of old. Too often, the talent-laden Victorian sides came a cropper. In 1990, when they were beaten by New South Wales, it was like losing to Greenland in a Test cricket match. \u201cState of Embarrassment\u201d was the headline in The Age. AFLW: Geelong 9.7 (61) lead Richmond 7.1 (43) at three-quarter time Geelong just getting on with the job in Bendigo, quietly accumulating and Richmond play catch up. The Cats are doing a great job of stifling Sabrina Frederick, who has been limited in her impact with defenders all over her wherever she goes. Richelle Cranston has been the key to the Cats\u2019 attack, with 13 disposals, seven kicks and two goals. T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka 113-9 after 20 overs After another wicket from Radha Yadav to round out an incredible four overs at 4-23, Nilakshika Silva and Kaveesha Dilhari gave it their all for a few overs before Silva was out, skying possibly the highest ball I\u2019ve ever seen hit. Sathya Sandeepani comes and goes straight out next ball, bowled by a beautiful ball from Shika Pandey. Pandey nearly has another next ball, but it falls just wide of the keeper to be safe. Dilhari finishes with a lovely four to give Sri Lanka a little bit of hope -they have scrapped every run they can manage, but it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve made par on this wicket and will have to bowl very well indeed to get a win from here. Netball: An injury in the AFLW that has wider implications with Collingwood dual-code star Ash Brazill going down with a suspected ACL rupture. It would be devastating news for the club on two fronts, with Brazill one of their best players in both football and netball. Magpies Netball are already scrambling to replace the irreplaceable Nat Medhurst after the goal attack announced her pregnancy at the start of the year. Losing Brazill as well will put the club under incredible pressure. With Brazill unable to play for the Australian Diamonds in the bushfire charity match in Sydney tomorrow, Gabi Simpson has been shifted over from the All Stars team, while Amy Parmenter gets the call up to replace Simpson. Cycling: A fascinating read from Kieran Pender this week, taking us behind the scenes on Australia\u2019s preparations for the Track Cycling World Championships. The Australians are always among the first to arrive at international competitions; only New Zealand landed in Berlin before them. \u201cAfter long flights we get a lot of stiffness, so any pre-existing conditions can be irritated,\u201d says the team physiotherapist Patrick Custance. \u201cThe first day or two we want to get them active and moving, plus doing lots of stretching and soft-tissue work.\u201d Following a quiet Friday, nervous energy is building in the squad as they await their first track session.\u201d T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka 80-6 after 15 overs As suspected, Sri Lanka have struggled since losing Atapattu. With the run rate currently at 5.38 and wickets falling regularly, they will have to hope for an extremely waggy tail and put on a strong bowling performance to have a hope of taking down this dominant Indian team. Radha Yadav has been the pick of India\u2019s bowlers so far, with 3-19 and one over left to bowl. AFLW: HT Geelong 7.4 (46) lead Richmond 3.1 (19) Richmond scored early in the quarter and looked like they were hitting their straps, but Geelong hit back repeatedly to assert their dominance. Georgia Clarke has been strong with the boot, kicking two goals for the Cats in the quarter. Monique Conti has looked like the Tigers\u2019 best, but they\u2019ll need a full team performance to stop the Cats taking the premiership points. Cricket: It\u2019s been almost an under the radar tour of South Africa for the Australian men - with matches taking place in the middle of the night and being overshadowed by the drama of the women\u2019s T20 World Cup back at home. But it\u2019s an interesting return to the scene of the sandpaper crime, as Sam Perry ruminated during the week. Boxing: A fascinating read from Stephanie Convery during the week, previewing her soon to be released book After the Count. Mention concussion in a boxing gym and you are met with a squirming, uncomfortable silence. Sometimes there are nods, a murmured hrm, before your fellow conversationalist slides quietly away. If someone feels trapped, they may bust out a bit of bro-science: It\u2019s just one of those things. It\u2019s just a bit of conditioning. Don\u2019t worry too much about it. Shake it off. Keep your chin down and your guard up, you\u2019ll be fine. T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka 50-3 after nine overs A sensational ball from Rajeshwari Gayakwad means that Madhavi has to go for 12 and Hansima Karunarathna comes to the crease, with the desired effect for India of slowing down the scoring rate. She is not turning the strike over as well as Madhavi did and is taking some time to find her feet. As soon as Atapattu is back on strike she smashes a beautiful six, then tries to follow it up with another, falls short and is caught on the boundary, out for 33. That\u2019s a huge blow for Sri Lanka. AFLW: Geelong 1.3(9) leads Richmond 1.1(7) This match is at tight as the ladder suggests it should be so far. Highly defensive and a little bit scrappy, you get the feeling that whoever ultimate takes this one out will need to grind out a win, rather than glide to victory. Courtney Wakefield got Geelong on the board early, while Kate Darby scored Richmond\u2019s goal mid-quarter. Richmond will need to tighten up their discipline to take this one out, giving away six free kicks in the first quarter. T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka 32-1 after five overs A nice early wicket for India has put Sri Lanka under some pressure, but while Chamari Atapattu remains out there, Sri Lanka are in with a chance. Harshitha Madhavi is playing a good support role at present, with eight runs from eight balls, turning the strike over nicely. AFLW: A bottom of Conference A clash is just underway, with both Richmond and Geelong hunting for their first win. The Tigers haven\u2019t performed as well as their fanbase were hoping and haven\u2019t found a way to fire just yet. T20 World Cup: Here\u2019s the AAP match report for that incredible game, it really was a great escape from New Zealand. The Australian team will have had a close eye on that and will be looking to exploit all those batting weaknesses on Monday. New Zealand avoid T20 World Cup upset New Zealand have escaped with a 17-run win from their women\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup clash with Bangladesh after being given an almighty scare. The White Ferns managed to defend a paltry 91 after batting first at Melbourne\u2019s Junction Oval, restricting Bangladesh to 74. But the Kiwis will have to seriously improve on Monday for their sudden-death showdown against Australia, with the winner moving onto the semi-finals. Bangladesh\u2019s chase wasn\u2019t helped by key batter Nigar Sultana retiring hurt after she top-edged a shot into her helmet. Sultana appeared to be in severe pain around her neck and was taken from the field on a motorised cart, but later returned to the crease. Bangladesh were in the game at 2-31, but lost 7-27 after Sultana went down and were bowled out in the final over. All of the White Ferns bowlers performed strongly, but Hayley Jensen was the pick of them with an accurate spell of 3-11. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really bat too well there, but we know we\u2019re Kiwis and we scrap to the last ball so it was a really good bowling performance,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cI just kept it really simple, just hit the seam and bowl stump-to-stump. We know that we\u2019ve done all the work so we\u2019ll just go into training and come out confident for the next match.\u201d During New Zealand\u2019s innings, star batters Sophie Devine and Rachel Priest put on a 36-run opening stand, but the Kiwis then suffered an extraordinary collapse of 8-36 to be all-out in the 19th over. Playing in her first World Cup match, Bangladesh\u2019s Ritu Moni destroyed the Kiwis with figures of 4-18. T20 World Cup: The match between India and Sri Lanka is about to get underway, but earlier today New Zealand escaped a huge scare against Bangladesh to come away with the win. Led by a sensational 4-18 from Mst Ritu Moni, the Bangladesh bowlers restricted the White Ferns to 91 from their overs. Unfortunately (for them and Australia) they weren\u2019t able to back up with the performance with the bat, all out for 74 in 19.5 overs. Hayley Jensen was the player of the match for the Ferns, with a desperate 3-11 that saved that game and kept their tournament alive. Hello, happy Mardi Gras and welcome to another edition of Sportwatch! I\u2019m your host, Megan Maurice and I\u2019ll be with you all afternoon until my esteemed colleague Richard Parkin jumps in to see you through the evening. What a day we have ahead of us! There\u2019s more sport than you can poke a stick at, from the T20 World Cup to AFLW, a bit of Super W and Super Rugby, some W-League and A-League and the only NRL trial match that matters - the Charity Shield between the Dragons and Bunnies in Mudgee. We\u2019ve got plenty to get through, so let\u2019s get into it and see where Leap Day takes us.",

      "body": "<p>As you grow older you become an immigrant from a vanished country, a country some of your peers may remember but the young may find unimaginable or incomprehensible. You could call it the land of before; before some great change, before we did things this way, before we decided that was unacceptable, before we shed new light on an old problem. I was shaped by a world that no longer quite exists, so I can\u2019t imagine myself at, say, 18 in the present moment, because to do so is to imagine someone utterly different. She does not exist, and I \u2013 as we all do \u2013 exist as the cumulative effect of my experiences, opportunities or lack thereof, and ideals.</p> <p>So much of what shaped and scarred my younger self, and made me a solitary feminist, and then much later one among many, was the unspeakability of violence against women and all the denigration, harassment and silencing that went with it. It was epidemic, and yet every incident was supposed to be an isolated incident, and nobody was supposed to connect the crimes to the culture that relished violence against women as entertainment, and denied it existed in any significant way as fact, and made sure that prevention and prosecution were as feeble as they were rare. All those forces still exist, but something else does alongside them: a vigorous conversation, speaking and naming and describing and defining; rejecting the excuses and cover-ups and justifications.</p> <p>That conversation is exhilarating for me. It\u2019s also a conundrum in that I have spent much of the past dozen years reading horrific stories of rape, torture, murder, stalking and domestic violence in the news, and hearing them directly from survivors. I have been both exhilarated to see change come \u2013 although not enough \u2013 and exhausted by this immersion in (mostly) male violence and (mostly) female annihilation. But we have at least diagnosed the problem.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Conversations about generational divides try to set up feminism as a catfight \u2013 because people like it when ladies fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is no 18-year-old me, but there are plenty of 18 year olds to show me how much has changed, and to promise through their beautiful insubordination and high expectations that more is going to change. Last year, when a young woman I know shared an essay she wrote about accompanying her friend through the all-night ordeal of getting a rape kit from a hospital, I was amazed to see how truths and stances that were so hard-won for many of us were built into her worldview. She had this new equipment, and seemed never to have had the self-doubt that undermines people\u2019s ability to recognise what just happened; that old voice saying \u201cyou\u2019re overreacting\u201d, which is another way to say \u201cyou\u2019re having the wrong feelings\u201d, which really means \u201cyour feelings are inconvenient for others, so strangle them at birth\u201d.</p> <p>Decades ago, I came across an aphorism that said, more or less: \u201cRemember the respect due to youth.\u201d One of the pernicious myths of our time is that wisdom accumulates with age in some steady, standard way, like tree rings. In this scheme, the old have it and the young lack it, and should open their little beaks and wait for a worm of wisdom to be dropped in. Told this way, wisdom is also the result of individual development, rather than of how we as a society become better at seeing something, smarter about knowing how something works. I think that conversations about generational divides miss the point, and are all too common in the attempt to set up feminism as a generational catfight \u2013 because people like it when ladies fight. This culture doesn\u2019t know how to tell stories that don\u2019t pit groups against each other in some warlike drama of scarcity and selfishness.</p> <p>Me, I admire and am grateful to the younger feminists at work, and learn a lot from them \u2013 not any one big truth but a host of insights that have gradually shifted my understanding, and given me new tools to use. What I find in so many young women and girls \u2013 right down to toddlers in my family, as well as that young woman taking her friend to get the rape kit \u2013 is a clarity and confidence about their rights, needs, and truths that feels new and different. We can credit an older generation with sowing some of the seeds, but they are the beautiful harvest. They are the victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4615a0316123c6c372f185129efc2862eefcfd45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4615a0316123c6c372f185129efc2862eefcfd45/0_670_3280_2437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s march on Washington, January 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"743\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The women\u2019s march on Washington DC, 21 January 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Edwards/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For this collective awakening, the young often lead by being more demanding, less willing to settle, less willing to believe that something is impossible \u2013 though almost six decades on this earth have taught me that those things the status quo says are impossible <em>do</em> come to pass, from time to time. I remember that, 20 years ago, leaving the age of fossil fuel behind seemed impossible because solar and wind were as expensive as they were inadequate. And I remember 1992, when a total of six women in the US Senate (including the first woman senator of colour) saw it hailed as The Year of the Women, since that was more than there had ever been before. There are currently 25 women senators.</p> <p>Feminism is part of an immense endeavour on all seven continents (and sometimes a space station or two) to change how we imagine gender, rights, equality, consent, voice; to create a conversation that invites participation for those who have felt excluded, silenced. It\u2019s a conversation about race, gender, sexual orientation, trans rights, disability rights, religious freedom, neurodiversity, and so much more, and about how these things can intersect in a single person or interaction. Anyone in this conversation learns from others to look harder, see farther, ask new questions, use new terms that admit new possibilities. It is as though we\u2019re wandering through the night, each with our small light, sometimes all shining our beams on the same problem until we see it clearly, passing descriptions from one to another, building trail maps together, sharpening the focus, until we reach somewhere new. Or become something new.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Speaking up about the men who harassed me seemed likely to make things worse. What I wanted was someone to shout with me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There have been some very literal choral moments, as when huge numbers of feminists use the same hashtag: for example, in 2014, a young Muslim woman launched #yesallwomen in response to the dismal male response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/23/one-year-isla-vista-massacre-victim-father-gun-control\" title=\"Rebecca Solnit on the 2014 Isla Vista massacre\">Isla Vista massacre</a>, when a 22-year-old incel killed six people near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus. She was responding to the widely used hashtag #notallmen, which shifted the focus to exonerating men rather than recognising how immense the threat of violence is for, yes, all women.</p> <p>But it\u2019s more often been a conversation than a chorus. Just the very simple line \u201crapists cause rape\u201d \u2013 maybe coined by the website <a href=\"http://feministing.com/\" title=\"Feministing\">Feministing</a> in 2010, or maybe they got it from someone else \u2013 gave us a tool and perspective to push back on all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/21/brett-kavanaugh-blame-women-anita-hill-cosby-weinstein\" title=\"Rebecca Solnit on victim-blaming\">victim-blaming</a>; all the emphasis on what she was wearing and drinking, and what else she did wrong by not being locked inside a bank vault clad in a nun\u2019s habit, while holding a revolver.</p> <p>So I admire the young, and that seems worth saying when boomers complaining about millennials is a thing, and when some older women are so inured to the task of surviving patriarchy that they can\u2019t break out of the \u201cnot that bad/toughen up\u201d framework to acknowledge that, yes, this shit sucks, and it does have an effect on us, and it\u2019s wrong. And it\u2019s not just me, who was born when John F Kennedy was president. Mary Beard, who was born when Winston Churchill was doing his last round as prime minister, recently <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/no-competitive-martyrdom/\" title=\"\">wrote about that lost continent of silence</a>, saying: \u201cOne of the reasons that my students in the 2010s get anxious about reading Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses or the early books of Livy is that they have a much sharper idea of what those works are about. Fifty years ago, we usually did not recognise (nor were we taught to) that the Metamorphoses was a poem founded on rape. Back then, we saw it as a series of \u2018ravishings\u2019 (with an awkward hint of pleasure implied); and the transformation of the victims into trees, or whatever, was treated as just one more curious aspect of ancient mythology.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/2329_31_3417_4271/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jia Tolentino\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revisiting Ovid: New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Mudd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She\u2019s defending millennials against charges of fragility \u2013 and I\u2019m with her in her enthusiasm for the more acute perceptions of this generation. In <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/how-a-woman-becomes-a-lake\" title=\"Jia Tolentino on Ovid in the New Yorker\">a superb 2018 New Yorker piece</a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/how-a-woman-becomes-a-lake\" title=\"Jia Tolentino on Ovid in the New Yorker\">, millennial feminist Jia Tolentino</a> revisits Ovid in the wake of the 2018 hearing for supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, because she feels \u201ca shameful, increasing desire to stop running, to find some way to be impassive and serene\u201d, like those women turned into lakes and trees. If younger readers like Tolentino and Beard\u2019s students recognise that Metamorphoses is full of rape, then it is because of groundwork laid by older readers, writers and dissidents. Whether or not we stand on the shoulders of giants, we stroll on the topsoil into which the past has decomposed, and some seeds planted then are sprouting, and even blooming, now.</p> <p>There was so much we couldn\u2019t talk about then, and still some aspects and consequences we haven\u2019t yet talked about enough. Recently I wrote a book about those things, Recollections Of My Non-Existence, about the muteness of my formative years. Because nothing I could say seemed to mean \u201cno\u201d in any effectual way to the men who harassed and menaced me, nothing I could do made them desist, and speaking up seemed likely to make things worse. What I wanted, for starters, was someone to shout, with me, that this was absolutely wrong. I wanted someone to ask questions with me about how we change it all, and why we must.</p> <p>I had experiences that are still common. Last summer, my friend\u2019s teenage daughter had a man threaten to kill her when she responded defiantly to his harassment \u2013 the kind of thing that happened to me, over and over, in my youth. It\u2019s so ordinary, and there\u2019s so much of it. The past several years have been an extraordinary collaborative exhumation and reinvention of women\u2019s experience, and one in which the old have learned from the young at least as much as the opposite.</p> <p>I still think the conversation is far from complete. But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s begun. When people suggest feminism has somehow been a failure, I like to hark back to the world I was born into, the world that made my mother so full of suppressed fury, the world in which women were, by law and custom, so much more deeply unequal. Marriage laws in the US, the UK, and many other countries defined wives as property of a sort, or chattel, or pets, whose bodies husbands had the right to rape and beat, and whose choices husbands controlled, from financial to medical decisions. Women were excluded from nearly all positions of economic, legal, social, educational and governmental power, and the language to even describe phenomena such as workplace sexual harassment as something serious and illicit did not exist. I could go on, but I\u2019ll stop, after referencing how routine was the denigration of women as subjective, unreliable, incompetent creatures, undermining the foundation to participate and even to object. Not that that bit is over, but at least we\u2019ve been pointing it out for half a century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07014a140ec6ec71d76133a98142c82c85091b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07014a140ec6ec71d76133a98142c82c85091b3f/0_0_6144_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Academic and activist Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, who coined the term intersectionality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even to see some of these forms of oppression was a great collective project. In one of the books I can\u2019t call seminal \u2013 is there a feminine equivalent? ovarian? \u2013 but that was formative, Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique (1963), she talks about \u201cthe problem that has no name\u201d.

So much of what shaped and scarred my younger self, and made me a solitary feminist, and then much later one among many, was the unspeakability of violence against women and all the denigration, harassment and silencing that went with it. It was epidemic, and yet every incident was supposed to be an isolated incident, and nobody was supposed to connect the crimes to the culture that relished violence against women as entertainment, and denied it existed in any significant way as fact, and made sure that prevention and prosecution were as feeble as they were rare. All those forces still exist, but something else does alongside them: a vigorous conversation, speaking and naming and describing and defining; rejecting the excuses and cover-ups and justifications. That conversation is exhilarating for me. It\u2019s also a conundrum in that I have spent much of the past dozen years reading horrific stories of rape, torture, murder, stalking and domestic violence in the news, and hearing them directly from survivors. I have been both exhilarated to see change come \u2013 although not enough \u2013 and exhausted by this immersion in (mostly) male violence and (mostly) female annihilation. But we have at least diagnosed the problem. There is no 18-year-old me, but there are plenty of 18 year olds to show me how much has changed, and to promise through their beautiful insubordination and high expectations that more is going to change. Last year, when a young woman I know shared an essay she wrote about accompanying her friend through the all-night ordeal of getting a rape kit from a hospital, I was amazed to see how truths and stances that were so hard-won for many of us were built into her worldview. She had this new equipment, and seemed never to have had the self-doubt that undermines people\u2019s ability to recognise what just happened; that old voice saying \u201cyou\u2019re overreacting\u201d, which is another way to say \u201cyou\u2019re having the wrong feelings\u201d, which really means \u201cyour feelings are inconvenient for others, so strangle them at birth\u201d. Decades ago, I came across an aphorism that said, more or less: \u201cRemember the respect due to youth.\u201d One of the pernicious myths of our time is that wisdom accumulates with age in some steady, standard way, like tree rings. In this scheme, the old have it and the young lack it, and should open their little beaks and wait for a worm of wisdom to be dropped in. Told this way, wisdom is also the result of individual development, rather than of how we as a society become better at seeing something, smarter about knowing how something works. I think that conversations about generational divides miss the point, and are all too common in the attempt to set up feminism as a generational catfight \u2013 because people like it when ladies fight. This culture doesn\u2019t know how to tell stories that don\u2019t pit groups against each other in some warlike drama of scarcity and selfishness. Me, I admire and am grateful to the younger feminists at work, and learn a lot from them \u2013 not any one big truth but a host of insights that have gradually shifted my understanding, and given me new tools to use. What I find in so many young women and girls \u2013 right down to toddlers in my family, as well as that young woman taking her friend to get the rape kit \u2013 is a clarity and confidence about their rights, needs, and truths that feels new and different. We can credit an older generation with sowing some of the seeds, but they are the beautiful harvest. They are the victory. For this collective awakening, the young often lead by being more demanding, less willing to settle, less willing to believe that something is impossible \u2013 though almost six decades on this earth have taught me that those things the status quo says are impossible do come to pass, from time to time. I remember that, 20 years ago, leaving the age of fossil fuel behind seemed impossible because solar and wind were as expensive as they were inadequate. And I remember 1992, when a total of six women in the US Senate (including the first woman senator of colour) saw it hailed as The Year of the Women, since that was more than there had ever been before. There are currently 25 women senators. Feminism is part of an immense endeavour on all seven continents (and sometimes a space station or two) to change how we imagine gender, rights, equality, consent, voice; to create a conversation that invites participation for those who have felt excluded, silenced. It\u2019s a conversation about race, gender, sexual orientation, trans rights, disability rights, religious freedom, neurodiversity, and so much more, and about how these things can intersect in a single person or interaction. Anyone in this conversation learns from others to look harder, see farther, ask new questions, use new terms that admit new possibilities. It is as though we\u2019re wandering through the night, each with our small light, sometimes all shining our beams on the same problem until we see it clearly, passing descriptions from one to another, building trail maps together, sharpening the focus, until we reach somewhere new. Or become something new. There have been some very literal choral moments, as when huge numbers of feminists use the same hashtag: for example, in 2014, a young Muslim woman launched #yesallwomen in response to the dismal male response to the Isla Vista massacre, when a 22-year-old incel killed six people near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus. She was responding to the widely used hashtag #notallmen, which shifted the focus to exonerating men rather than recognising how immense the threat of violence is for, yes, all women. But it\u2019s more often been a conversation than a chorus. Just the very simple line \u201crapists cause rape\u201d \u2013 maybe coined by the website Feministing in 2010, or maybe they got it from someone else \u2013 gave us a tool and perspective to push back on all the victim-blaming; all the emphasis on what she was wearing and drinking, and what else she did wrong by not being locked inside a bank vault clad in a nun\u2019s habit, while holding a revolver. So I admire the young, and that seems worth saying when boomers complaining about millennials is a thing, and when some older women are so inured to the task of surviving patriarchy that they can\u2019t break out of the \u201cnot that bad/toughen up\u201d framework to acknowledge that, yes, this shit sucks, and it does have an effect on us, and it\u2019s wrong. And it\u2019s not just me, who was born when John F Kennedy was president. Mary Beard, who was born when Winston Churchill was doing his last round as prime minister, recently wrote about that lost continent of silence, saying: \u201cOne of the reasons that my students in the 2010s get anxious about reading Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses or the early books of Livy is that they have a much sharper idea of what those works are about. Fifty years ago, we usually did not recognise (nor were we taught to) that the Metamorphoses was a poem founded on rape. Back then, we saw it as a series of \u2018ravishings\u2019 (with an awkward hint of pleasure implied); and the transformation of the victims into trees, or whatever, was treated as just one more curious aspect of ancient mythology.\u201d She\u2019s defending millennials against charges of fragility \u2013 and I\u2019m with her in her enthusiasm for the more acute perceptions of this generation. In a superb 2018 New Yorker piece, millennial feminist Jia Tolentino revisits Ovid in the wake of the 2018 hearing for supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, because she feels \u201ca shameful, increasing desire to stop running, to find some way to be impassive and serene\u201d, like those women turned into lakes and trees. If younger readers like Tolentino and Beard\u2019s students recognise that Metamorphoses is full of rape, then it is because of groundwork laid by older readers, writers and dissidents. Whether or not we stand on the shoulders of giants, we stroll on the topsoil into which the past has decomposed, and some seeds planted then are sprouting, and even blooming, now. There was so much we couldn\u2019t talk about then, and still some aspects and consequences we haven\u2019t yet talked about enough. Recently I wrote a book about those things, Recollections Of My Non-Existence, about the muteness of my formative years. Because nothing I could say seemed to mean \u201cno\u201d in any effectual way to the men who harassed and menaced me, nothing I could do made them desist, and speaking up seemed likely to make things worse. What I wanted, for starters, was someone to shout, with me, that this was absolutely wrong. I wanted someone to ask questions with me about how we change it all, and why we must. I had experiences that are still common. Last summer, my friend\u2019s teenage daughter had a man threaten to kill her when she responded defiantly to his harassment \u2013 the kind of thing that happened to me, over and over, in my youth. It\u2019s so ordinary, and there\u2019s so much of it. The past several years have been an extraordinary collaborative exhumation and reinvention of women\u2019s experience, and one in which the old have learned from the young at least as much as the opposite. I still think the conversation is far from complete. But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s begun. When people suggest feminism has somehow been a failure, I like to hark back to the world I was born into, the world that made my mother so full of suppressed fury, the world in which women were, by law and custom, so much more deeply unequal. Marriage laws in the US, the UK, and many other countries defined wives as property of a sort, or chattel, or pets, whose bodies husbands had the right to rape and beat, and whose choices husbands controlled, from financial to medical decisions. Women were excluded from nearly all positions of economic, legal, social, educational and governmental power, and the language to even describe phenomena such as workplace sexual harassment as something serious and illicit did not exist. I could go on, but I\u2019ll stop, after referencing how routine was the denigration of women as subjective, unreliable, incompetent creatures, undermining the foundation to participate and even to object. Not that that bit is over, but at least we\u2019ve been pointing it out for half a century. Even to see some of these forms of oppression was a great collective project. In one of the books I can\u2019t call seminal \u2013 is there a feminine equivalent? ovarian? \u2013 but that was formative, Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique (1963), she talks about \u201cthe problem that has no name\u201d. We have named it bit by bit: with old words like patriarchy and gaslighting put back to work; with new words like marginalisation, mansplaining (not coined by me, by the way), Kate Manne\u2019s himpathy, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\u2019s intersectionality, rape culture, misogynoir, victim-blaming and slut-shaming. What has been beautiful and amazing about the past several years has been the great collective research expedition to examine our lives, to turn up the volume on historically silenced voices, and turn down the volume a little on the people who always got heard. We have made a new map of who we have been, and are, and could be. To be one voice in this global conversation has been a joy and an honour; to hear others has been an education and an inspiration. And the one thing I am surest of is that we are only beginning. \u2022 Recollections Of My Non-Existence by Rebecca Solnit is published by Granta Books at \u00a316.99.

      "body": "<p>A few weeks ago in Auckland, while getting into a cab, a colleague and I were having an animated discussion about the merits of a capital gains tax. Before greeting us, the driver chimed in with his dislike for any tax on profits from the sale of property. An interesting start to the ride. A few questions later and the cabbie revealed that he owned four properties in addition to his family home. Welcome to New Zealand.</p> <p>Or should I say, welcome to the world?</p> <p>Globally, residential property remains one of the hottest commodities, with <a href=\"https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/198669-0\" title=\"\">assets valued at $162 trillion</a>, a dizzying amount that is almost three times the value of every single country\u2019s GDP combined. While individual investors want a piece of the pie, it\u2019s largely being driven by multinational institutional investors with unprecedented amounts of capital: private equity, pension funds and asset management firms.

Dig a little deeper, and you\u2019ll find that those rent prices are the product of a global financial trend towards residential property investment, supported by governments.</p> <p>In essence, treating housing as a commodity is creating a global crisis witnessed in Hong Kong, London and New York, but also in Auckland, Lagos and Buenos Aires.</p> <p>On the business side, it goes like this: big financial investors (private equity firms, pension funds and multinational asset management firms) survey city landscapes looking for \u201cundervalued\u201d properties they can swoop in and purchase to add to their investment portfolio. Once the transaction \u2013 the purchase of hundreds or even thousands of units in one fell swoop \u2013 is complete, they set about reaping profits to satisfy their investors and to generate more capital to do it all again.</p> <p>In many cases, units are soon renovated, whether necessary or not. If the renovations alone don\u2019t drive the tenants out \u2013 and in some cases, that appears to be the intention \u2013 then they are used to justify rent increases, making the place unaffordable to those living there.

      "body": "<p>Readers of <em>Wolf Hall</em> and <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em> can be in no doubt about where <em>The Mirror &amp; the Light</em>, the concluding volume of Hilary Mantel\u2019s historical trilogy (reviewed on page 12), will take them. On 28 July 1540, Thomas Cromwell will be beheaded at Tower Hill. But while we know where Cromwell is going, he does not. Mantel has brilliantly exploited the predestination of historical fiction. It comes alive in the gap between the reader\u2019s knowledge and her protagonist\u2019s uncertainty. Her special achievement is to restore provisionality \u2013 luck, accident, surprise \u2013 to history. In Mantel\u2019s extraordinary present-tense narration, history is unfolding before us. Cromwell, the novelist\u2019s surrogate, is a piercing analyst of human beings, but can never be sure of what they will do next.</p> <p>This is where historical fiction began. When Walter Scott in effect invented the genre with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/07/sir-walter-scott-fiction\" title=\"\">Waverley</a></em> in 1814, his eponymous hero was a young idealist drawn into the 1745 Jacobite rebellion against George II. (The reader knew that the rebellion was to fail.) In the 19th century, in Scott\u2019s wake, the historical novel had high status. Works that are now little read \u2013 Thackeray\u2019s <em>The History of</em> <em>Henry Esmond Esq</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2012/may/13/ten-best-historical-novels\" title=\"\">George Eliot\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2012/may/13/ten-best-historical-novels\" title=\"\">Romola</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/thomas.hardy\" title=\"\">Hardy\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/thomas.hardy\" title=\"\">The Trumpet Major</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/thomas.hardy\" title=\"\"> </a>\u2013 were once thought their authors\u2019 highest achievements.</p> <p>By the next century, historical fiction had sunk. Modernism made history look like escapism and novelists avoided it. As the mid-20th century approached, historical fiction was commercially successful but distinctly populist. The big names were authors such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/05/georgette-heyer-novelist-regency-romance-blue-plaque\" title=\"\">Georgette Heyer </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/08/top-10-books-about-royal-families\" title=\"\">Jean Plaidy</a> (the nom de plume of the prolific Eleanor Hibbert). They loved their History. Heyer, in particular, was exacting in her research, her Regency novels sometimes clotted with period detail. The most successful and prolific historical novelist of today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/28/philippa-gregory-unearthing-history-s-forgotten-women\" title=\"\">Philippa Gregory</a>, equally prides herself on accuracy. You can say the same for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/bernard-cornwell-historical-fiction\" title=\"\">Bernard Cornwe</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/bernard-cornwell-historical-fiction\" title=\"\">ll</a>, with his Sharpe series, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/patrick-o-brian\" title=\"\">Patrick O\u2019Brian</a>, with his Napoleonic nautical novels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2c24d725502cbe0bfeabecdd6ae5cfdfcb45d04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2c24d725502cbe0bfeabecdd6ae5cfdfcb45d04/0_0_3068_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Crowe in Peter Weir\u2019s 2003, film of Master and Commander by Patrick O\u201dBrian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Crowe in Peter Weir\u2019s 2003, film of Master and Commander by Patrick O\u201dBrian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20 CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet sometimes a historical setting means not an accumulation of period detail, but the very opposite. Some novelists go to the past to lose the distractions of the modern world. The model here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/05/william-golding-john-carey-review\" title=\"\">William Golding</a>, in both his 1964 novel <em>The Spire</em> and <em>To the Ends of the Earth</em>, his trilogy of novels from the 1980s set on a ship taking British migrants to Australia in the early 19th century. Golding used the imagined past to distil essential human appetites and conflicts. In <em>The Spire</em>, the building of an English cathedral spire in the middle ages is the Christian mission of Jocelin, the dean, but he and those who work for him are possessed by dark spirits of lust or fear.</p> <p>A more recent book such as Jim Crace\u2019s dark antipastoral <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/16/harvest-jim-crace-review\" title=\"\">Harvest</a></em>, set in a remote English village at a time of forced enclosures of land (the date is uncertain), belongs to the same category of historical fiction. The past is where social order hardly protects people from some Hobbesian state of nature. A comparable example is Samantha Harvey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/01/the-western-wind-by-samantha-harvey-review\" title=\"\">2018 novel </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/01/the-western-wind-by-samantha-harvey-review\" title=\"\">The Western Wind</a></em>, which takes us to an isolated Somerset village in the 15th century. Narrated by an intelligent, weary parish priest, it asks us to imagine what religious belief might be like in an age of faith. (This is an interest of much recent historical fiction.) The action takes place over four days, in reverse chronological order, as if time is pulling us backwards. There is a mystery plot \u2013 the wealthiest and cleverest man in the village has disappeared, perhaps drowned \u2013 but to find the solution we return to what the narrator has always known. The history that it reveals is one of communal violence. Oddly, the setting and the protagonist have something in common with Robert Harris\u2019s 2019 neo-historical novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/the-second-sleep-robert-harris-review\" title=\"\">The Second Sleep</a></em>. Although this begins by declaring that its events take place in 1468, we soon find that we are in a Dark Age of the distant future, where history has been remade after some catastrophe. It is also a novel that turns on the murderous violence with which one small group can turn on another.</p> <p>A novel set centuries ago has a freedom denied to fiction that goes back only decades, to times for which we still have records or even memories. Some contemporary novelists clearly find historical distance a liberation. Andrew Miller\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/14/now-we-shall-be-entirely-free-andrew-miller\" title=\"\">Now We Shall Be Entirely Free</a></em> (2018) is set in 1809 and narrates the return from the Peninsular war of a traumatised army officer, who flees the horrors of war but is pursued by a vengeful villain. Essential to the novel\u2019s pleasure is the estranging period detail \u2013 we explore a Regency gunshop, visit a textile mill, or flinch from the work of a surgeon of the time. (Miller has always been fascinated by the incomplete medical and scientific knowledge of earlier ages ). Yet the sentences are only lightly touched by archaism.</p> <p>For Miller, as for some other contemporary novelists, history has become an escape into the wonderful. The challenge is language: how do you make your characters\u2019 sentences belong to another age? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/02/the-wake-paul-kingsnorth-review-literary-triumph\" title=\"\">Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/02/the-wake-paul-kingsnorth-review-literary-triumph\" title=\"\">The Wake</a></em> took the archaising principle to an unmatchable extreme.

      "bodyText": "Readers of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies can be in no doubt about where The Mirror &amp; the Light, the concluding volume of Hilary Mantel\u2019s historical trilogy (reviewed on page 12), will take them. On 28 July 1540, Thomas Cromwell will be beheaded at Tower Hill. But while we know where Cromwell is going, he does not. Mantel has brilliantly exploited the predestination of historical fiction. It comes alive in the gap between the reader\u2019s knowledge and her protagonist\u2019s uncertainty. Her special achievement is to restore provisionality \u2013 luck, accident, surprise \u2013 to history. In Mantel\u2019s extraordinary present-tense narration, history is unfolding before us. Cromwell, the novelist\u2019s surrogate, is a piercing analyst of human beings, but can never be sure of what they will do next. This is where historical fiction began. When Walter Scott in effect invented the genre with Waverley in 1814, his eponymous hero was a young idealist drawn into the 1745 Jacobite rebellion against George II. (The reader knew that the rebellion was to fail.) In the 19th century, in Scott\u2019s wake, the historical novel had high status. Works that are now little read \u2013 Thackeray\u2019s The History of Henry Esmond Esq, George Eliot\u2019s Romola, Hardy\u2019s The Trumpet Major \u2013 were once thought their authors\u2019 highest achievements. By the next century, historical fiction had sunk. Modernism made history look like escapism and novelists avoided it. As the mid-20th century approached, historical fiction was commercially successful but distinctly populist. The big names were authors such as Georgette Heyer and Jean Plaidy (the nom de plume of the prolific Eleanor Hibbert). They loved their History. Heyer, in particular, was exacting in her research, her Regency novels sometimes clotted with period detail. The most successful and prolific historical novelist of today, Philippa Gregory, equally prides herself on accuracy. You can say the same for Bernard Cornwell, with his Sharpe series, or Patrick O\u2019Brian, with his Napoleonic nautical novels. Yet sometimes a historical setting means not an accumulation of period detail, but the very opposite. Some novelists go to the past to lose the distractions of the modern world. The model here is William Golding, in both his 1964 novel The Spire and To the Ends of the Earth, his trilogy of novels from the 1980s set on a ship taking British migrants to Australia in the early 19th century. Golding used the imagined past to distil essential human appetites and conflicts. In The Spire, the building of an English cathedral spire in the middle ages is the Christian mission of Jocelin, the dean, but he and those who work for him are possessed by dark spirits of lust or fear. A more recent book such as Jim Crace\u2019s dark antipastoral Harvest, set in a remote English village at a time of forced enclosures of land (the date is uncertain), belongs to the same category of historical fiction. The past is where social order hardly protects people from some Hobbesian state of nature. A comparable example is Samantha Harvey\u2019s 2018 novel The Western Wind, which takes us to an isolated Somerset village in the 15th century. Narrated by an intelligent, weary parish priest, it asks us to imagine what religious belief might be like in an age of faith. (This is an interest of much recent historical fiction.)

A novel set centuries ago has a freedom denied to fiction that goes back only decades, to times for which we still have records or even memories. Some contemporary novelists clearly find historical distance a liberation. Andrew Miller\u2019s Now We Shall Be Entirely Free (2018) is set in 1809 and narrates the return from the Peninsular war of a traumatised army officer, who flees the horrors of war but is pursued by a vengeful villain. Essential to the novel\u2019s pleasure is the estranging period detail \u2013 we explore a Regency gunshop, visit a textile mill, or flinch from the work of a surgeon of the time. (Miller has always been fascinated by the incomplete medical and scientific knowledge of earlier ages ). Yet the sentences are only lightly touched by archaism. For Miller, as for some other contemporary novelists, history has become an escape into the wonderful. The challenge is language: how do you make your characters\u2019 sentences belong to another age? Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s The Wake took the archaising principle to an unmatchable extreme. His novel, set in 11th\u2011century Lincolnshire, is narrated in an invented neo-Old English, full of words and syntactic patterns taken from Anglo-Saxon, comprehensible to the modern reader. Among recent historical novels, James Meek\u2019s To Calais, in Ordinary Time is rare in making its vocabulary and occasionally syntax sound old. The novel is set in 1348.

Now? Not long after it seemed the parade had moved on from Fury entirely, it\u2019s hard to imagine who in the current landscape could beat him, at least the version who boxed and mauled Wilder into submission on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</p> \n<p>Since the 31-year-old from Manchester signed a reported nine-figure co-promotional deal with Top Rank in the weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/22/wilder-fury-first-fight-defining-moments\">his gripping first encounter with Wilder</a> in December 2018, he has been openly driven by the challenge of conquering the American market. He spoke at length during the run-up to last weekend\u2019s rematch about his plan to finish his career with three more fights in the United States, noting on multiple occasions that he is no longer even in possession of a British Boxing Board of Control license.</p> \n<p>On one hand it makes sense that Fury, a natural showman, has been taken by the peculiar allure of Vegas. For decades the desert city has represented boxing\u2019s most aspirational platform and sophisticated money-churning machine: where the world\u2019s best prizefighters have traditionally contested for the richest purses before the broadest audiences. As a romantic, he is transparently geeked by the idea of surmounting the same frontiers as the heavyweight titans of his childhood, not least his namesake.</p> \n<p>On the other, it\u2019s not immediately clear that Fury is a standalone attraction in the United States. According to Nevada\u2019s state athletic commission, Fury\u2019s bout with Tom Schwarz in June sold 5,489 tickets at the scaled-down MGM Grand followed by a September date with Otto Wallin that sold only 3,577 at the nearby T-Mobile Arena. Granted those fights were de facto infomercials for a return meeting with Wilder that had already been agreed to in principle (even if someone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/15/tyson-fury-otto-wallin-fight-report\">forgot to tell Wallin</a>) and came before Saturday\u2019s brand-boosting win, but the anemic sales lay bare an inconvenient truth: for whatever reason, European fighters will always struggle to connect in the US when there\u2019s not an American in the frame.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1246cc5fe98d1e74bf4a35d6bcbdbd4cfd0cc7da\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1246cc5fe98d1e74bf4a35d6bcbdbd4cfd0cc7da/0_0_3515_2343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyson Fury v Deontay Wilder II\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyson Fury lands a right hand on Deontay Wilder during last Saturday\u2019s rematch at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Say what you want about Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s style, but he was the heavyweight champion for an entire decade and couldn\u2019t build enough of a following to anchor a single pay-per-view fight stateside. Even Gennady Golovkin, a come-forward knockout merchant who at his peak was the closest thing we\u2019ve seen to Mike Tyson since Tyson himself, was never able to draw a huge US audience until he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/17/canelo-alvarez-ggg-golovkin-fight-draw\">shared the bill with an established superstar</a>.</p> \n<p>There are exceptions, but a foreign-born boxer needs a special truly something to cross over into the US cultural mainstream, whether it\u2019s a hyperkinetic, made-for-YouTube style like Manny Pacquiao or a built-in fan base like Canelo \u00c1lvarez. Even Vasiliy Lomachenko, likely the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/apr/15/lomachenko-lightweight-crolla-demolition-world-best-boxer-claim\">best fighter on the planet regardless of weight</a> today and no shrinking violet stylistically, is all but anonymous to the average man on the street.</p> \n<p>None of this is the fault of Fury, a fistic savant who once made headlines for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/15/tyson-fury-gay-feminist-picket-spoty-bbc-belfast\">archaic views on women and homosexuals</a> but has since become an improbable champion for mental illness, the sort of redemptive underpinnings that have broadened his appeal at home. He is clearly an effective fighter, technical but not mechanical, though doesn\u2019t fit into the traditional framework of how Americans understand heavyweights, with a style that does not wow you in any single facet like power or speed. Which leaves him in an interesting place moving forward.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c269f691-24bc-469f-b51f-258c20531077\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YX5h9Tg1ZI4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Late Friday night, Wilder <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqpxKzjKuOY\">gave the most explicit indication yet</a> that he intends to exercise his contracted option for an immediate rematch.

      "bodyText": "The early returns from last weekend\u2019s heavyweight championship tilt between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder have suggested a money-spinning success commensurate to the breathless promotional heft behind it. Fury\u2019s shocking beatdown of the unbeaten American, which saw him both capture the World Boxing Council\u2019s heavyweight title and reduce the sport\u2019s most feared bogeyman to a lamentable puddle of excuses, reportedly generated between 800,000 and 850,000 pay-per-view buys at $75 a pop (even accounting for the extraordinarily high piracy rate) and surpassed the 1999 rematch between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield as the richest ever live gate for a heavyweight fight in Nevada. It was boxing\u2019s biggest night in years and Fury was the star, assuming his place as sport\u2019s alpha dog and the last unbeaten standing of the division\u2019s Big Three \u2013 a scenario that would have been unthinkable three years ago during a 31-month layoff that saw him swell to nearly 28st amid public battles with addiction and bipolar disorder. Now? Not long after it seemed the parade had moved on from Fury entirely, it\u2019s hard to imagine who in the current landscape could beat him, at least the version who boxed and mauled Wilder into submission on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Since the 31-year-old from Manchester signed a reported nine-figure co-promotional deal with Top Rank in the weeks after his gripping first encounter with Wilder in December 2018, he has been openly driven by the challenge of conquering the American market. He spoke at length during the run-up to last weekend\u2019s rematch about his plan to finish his career with three more fights in the United States, noting on multiple occasions that he is no longer even in possession of a British Boxing Board of Control license. On one hand it makes sense that Fury, a natural showman, has been taken by the peculiar allure of Vegas. For decades the desert city has represented boxing\u2019s most aspirational platform and sophisticated money-churning machine: where the world\u2019s best prizefighters have traditionally contested for the richest purses before the broadest audiences. As a romantic, he is transparently geeked by the idea of surmounting the same frontiers as the heavyweight titans of his childhood, not least his namesake. On the other, it\u2019s not immediately clear that Fury is a standalone attraction in the United States. According to Nevada\u2019s state athletic commission, Fury\u2019s bout with Tom Schwarz in June sold 5,489 tickets at the scaled-down MGM Grand followed by a September date with Otto Wallin that sold only 3,577 at the nearby T-Mobile Arena. Granted those fights were de facto infomercials for a return meeting with Wilder that had already been agreed to in principle (even if someone forgot to tell Wallin) and came before Saturday\u2019s brand-boosting win, but the anemic sales lay bare an inconvenient truth: for whatever reason, European fighters will always struggle to connect in the US when there\u2019s not an American in the frame. Say what you want about Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s style, but he was the heavyweight champion for an entire decade and couldn\u2019t build enough of a following to anchor a single pay-per-view fight stateside. Even Gennady Golovkin, a come-forward knockout merchant who at his peak was the closest thing we\u2019ve seen to Mike Tyson since Tyson himself, was never able to draw a huge US audience until he shared the bill with an established superstar. There are exceptions, but a foreign-born boxer needs a special truly something to cross over into the US cultural mainstream, whether it\u2019s a hyperkinetic, made-for-YouTube style like Manny Pacquiao or a built-in fan base like Canelo \u00c1lvarez. Even Vasiliy Lomachenko, likely the best fighter on the planet regardless of weight today and no shrinking violet stylistically, is all but anonymous to the average man on the street. None of this is the fault of Fury, a fistic savant who once made headlines for his archaic views on women and homosexuals but has since become an improbable champion for mental illness, the sort of redemptive underpinnings that have broadened his appeal at home. He is clearly an effective fighter, technical but not mechanical, though doesn\u2019t fit into the traditional framework of how Americans understand heavyweights, with a style that does not wow you in any single facet like power or speed. Which leaves him in an interesting place moving forward. Late Friday night, Wilder gave the most explicit indication yet that he intends to exercise his contracted option for an immediate rematch. After the robust business of last weekend\u2019s second instalment, it makes perfect sense to run it back in Vegas \u2013 most likely at the new 72,000-seat NFL stadium presently under construction along the strip. But should Fury win again (as he will be expected to), his American journey may well have run its course. Anthony Joshua\u2019s run of stadium sellouts in the UK, say nothing of last winter\u2019s Saudi sojourn, have put forth a compelling alternative to Vegas glitz, teasing an eastward shift in the sport\u2019s focus. An all-British four-belt unification fight between Fury and Joshua, who holds the WBA, WBO and IBF straps, to crown the first undisputed world heavyweight champion in two decades would sell out Wembley in minutes. The sport\u2019s flagship division has long served as a bellwether for the popularity of fighting at large. As the heavyweights go, they say, so does boxing. Six months ago, the long-fractured heavyweight championship was owned by an Alabaman and a Californian. Now those four belts are owned by two Britons and boxing\u2019s center of gravity has crossed the pond. America may no longer be the backdrop Fury envisioned at the outset of his sensational second act. Fortunately, he doesn\u2019t need it to be.",

The former England captain never thought it would be like this, yet the Miami political landscape is far trickier to beat than a well positioned defensive wall with a curling free-kick, something the 44-year-old did so wonderfully during his stellar playing days. Running battles with commissioners plainly unimpressed by the Londoner\u2019s glittering resume and status as a global sporting icon will, finally, take a backseat as Inter Miami begin their inaugural MLS campaign at Los Angeles FC, last season\u2019s trailblazers who looked nailed on to win the championship before falling just short. Beckham confirmed his intentions to become an owner in 2014. So, potential new stadium sites can wait as can a bizarre patent dispute with Internazionale over the marketing use of \u2018Inter\u2019. Powered by LAFC\u2019s star turn Carlos Vela \u2013 the ex-Arsenal striker scored 34 goals last season and was named MVP \u2013 former US national coach Bob Bradley has formed an attacking powerhouse of a side who will aim to devour opponents hastily blended together by someone only installed at the end of 2019. And so, therein lies a fresh set of problems for Beckham who will be praying for a strong start to keep the momentum of excitement building. Everything about Inter Miami is new: the supposedly temporary stadium (the plan is to eventually move to a $1bn business park site near Miami airport although doubts remain) and training complex which is almost built in Fort Lauderdale; the squad and the manager, Diego Alonso, who arrives with a strong reputation after impressive spells in Mexico with Pachuca and Monterrey, yet is untried in the United States where many new factors \u2013 including dealing with long trips like the 2,000-mile journey from South Florida to the west coast \u2013 come into play. He is the only coach to have won the Concacaf Champions League twice with two different teams and enjoyed healthily impressive victories over MLS mainstays in the process. Alonso, who also lifted the Liga MX Clausura title with Pachuca in 2016, has pedigree, although it remains entirely conceivable that come the opening of the totally revamped Lockhart Stadium on 14 March where LA Galaxy, Beckham\u2019s former team, are the visitors, the team could be facing up to a chastening two-match start on the road.

How Alonso, who was a back-up choice after moves for the likes of Patrick Vieira, Carlo Ancelotti and River Plate\u2019s Marcelo Gallardo failed, would love such a timeframe.

And as the current Villa captain, there was one thing he wanted to ask Townsend above all: what it felt like to lift the trophy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/28/pep-guardiola-bob-paisley-manchester-city-league-cup-final\">Guardiola has Paisley record in his sights as City seek League Cup treble</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was one of those rare moments of clarity: an insight, perhaps, into what really motivates a gifted 24-year-old footballer with the world at his feet and expectation on his shoulders.

But the video analyst cannot tell you what it is like climbing the steps to Wembley\u2019s royal box.

Grealish is Villa\u2019s most booked player and their most fouled player, the player who has made the most passes and been dispossessed the most. All this while playing on the left wing in a team who \u2013 as befitting a side 17th in the table \u2013 spend most of their time defending.

      "body": "<p>My adoration for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/caroline-flack\">Caroline Flack</a> bordered on teenage. As an American abroad in the UK last summer, managing the vague, inchoate loneliness of time spent in a country not my own, the hours I watched her, six nights a week from roughly 9pm to 10.30pm, became a benchmark of cosy normalcy, a point of connection in an often cruel and unfamiliar world. She was, in the way that is specific to pop figures we engage with daily, a friend, albeit one I had never met. That raspy voice, her surprised guffaw, her dresses (pretty, bordering on wacky, like early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/cher\">Cher</a>) and the empathy she brought to a bloodless and occasionally unkind television format lent her an air of approachable glamour, a local-girl-done-good sheen, aspirational but earthy.</p> <p>Not since I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sarah-jessica-parker\">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> on Broadway in 1996, belting her heart out with a childlike vibrato, had I hungered so deeply for information about a star. I pored over Flack\u2019s Instagram, over dailymail.co.uk images of her pink-doored flat (I\u2019m not proud of this), and histories of her love interests (most of whom were only figures of note to me because they had been pictured holding her hand outside a nightclub). I read her deceptively sunny memoir, <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Storm-in-a-C-Cup/Caroline-Flack/9781471154386\">Storm I</a><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Storm-in-a-C-Cup/Caroline-Flack/9781471154386\">n A</a><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Storm-in-a-C-Cup/Caroline-Flack/9781471154386\"> C Cup</a>, and took comfort in her durable, bounce-back brand of vulnerability. Her quotes about heartbreak (\u201cI feel at my most calm, in control and happiest when I\u2019m single, so at the minute that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing\u201d) reassured me, yet still I cheered \u201cGood for her!\u201d when she was pictured on the beach in Ibiza with her latest athlete beau. Despite being on fairly intimate terms with the mechanics of celebrity, I felt sure we were connected. Caroline would like me. She would get <em>it</em>. I <em>got</em> her. I am clearly far from the only person who felt this way, which is why her every move, hairstyle and misstep were clocked and noted by the country at large.</p> <p>This adoration, this childish sense of connection, is only a small part of why her death hit me with a sickening power. While I am not often at a loss for words, I felt that weighing in \u2013 especially with a Twitter micro-tribute \u2013 would be useless and borderline disrespectful. I am fairly allergic to the culture around celebrity death announcements. When the latest loss hits the timeline, we pile in with broken-heart emojis and prayers for the families, a kind of wan language of loss.

      "bodyText": "My adoration for Caroline Flack bordered on teenage. As an American abroad in the UK last summer, managing the vague, inchoate loneliness of time spent in a country not my own, the hours I watched her, six nights a week from roughly 9pm to 10.30pm, became a benchmark of cosy normalcy, a point of connection in an often cruel and unfamiliar world. She was, in the way that is specific to pop figures we engage with daily, a friend, albeit one I had never met. That raspy voice, her surprised guffaw, her dresses (pretty, bordering on wacky, like early Cher) and the empathy she brought to a bloodless and occasionally unkind television format lent her an air of approachable glamour, a local-girl-done-good sheen, aspirational but earthy. Not since I saw Sarah Jessica Parker on Broadway in 1996, belting her heart out with a childlike vibrato, had I hungered so deeply for information about a star. I pored over Flack\u2019s Instagram, over dailymail.co.uk images of her pink-doored flat (I\u2019m not proud of this), and histories of her love interests (most of whom were only figures of note to me because they had been pictured holding her hand outside a nightclub). I read her deceptively sunny memoir, Storm In A C Cup, and took comfort in her durable, bounce-back brand of vulnerability. Her quotes about heartbreak (\u201cI feel at my most calm, in control and happiest when I\u2019m single, so at the minute that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing\u201d) reassured me, yet still I cheered \u201cGood for her!\u201d when she was pictured on the beach in Ibiza with her latest athlete beau. Despite being on fairly intimate terms with the mechanics of celebrity, I felt sure we were connected. Caroline would like me. She would get it. I got her. I am clearly far from the only person who felt this way, which is why her every move, hairstyle and misstep were clocked and noted by the country at large. This adoration, this childish sense of connection, is only a small part of why her death hit me with a sickening power. While I am not often at a loss for words, I felt that weighing in \u2013 especially with a Twitter micro-tribute \u2013 would be useless and borderline disrespectful. I am fairly allergic to the culture around celebrity death announcements. When the latest loss hits the timeline, we pile in with broken-heart emojis and prayers for the families, a kind of wan language of loss. And when a death is as tragic as Flack\u2019s, we stand even further on careful tippy-toes, offering soft-pedalled wishes that she had felt less alone, or footnoting our praise with terms like \u201cshe had her demons\u201d. We remind our followers that there\u2019s always someone to reach out to, even if we privately have often believed there is not. In our efforts to avoid saying the wrong thing, we resort to vagaries. I\u2019m not suggesting I know of a better way. But I do know of a better way to treat the living. And I am \u2013 with both gratitude and some bitter aftertaste \u2013 able to describe the inner state of a person who has placed their self-image in the hands of the public; a public that has made a sport of building up, then tearing down, the people we elect to entertain us. The deepest rage is reserved for women. There are a few caveats to apply here: I do not claim to know what Caroline Flack felt when she took her own life. I know that obsessively following her holiday outfits and \u201clove rivals\u201d does not make me an authority on her inner life, which was as rich, varied and insular as anyone\u2019s. I also do not claim to know why some people take their lives when their circumstances nosedive, and others do not. What I can say, with the authority of someone who has been on a decade-long journey through the funhouse of public life, is that none of us benefit from a culture in which young women are told that being revered by people who do not really know them, in any forum from secondary school to the X Factor stage, is the answer to ancient feelings of low self-worth, or a salve for the pain and powerlessness that accompany so many forms of female identity.

      "body": "<p>The persistence of mental health hardships among gay and bisexual men, which endure even as LGBTQ people gain greater acceptance and civil rights, can be explained at least in part by the corrosive effects of status consciousness, competitiveness and racism within the gay community itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/11/florida-hiv-rick-scott-republican-governor\">'Rick Scott had us on lockdown': how Florida said no to $70m for HIV crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those are the striking and potentially controversial findings of a study <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-02346-001\">published in January</a> in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that may broaden appreciation of the unique stressors faced by gay and bisexual men.</p> <p>Gay and lesbian people have a more than fourfold higher rate of suicide than the general population. Among transgender people, the gulf is even wider. LGBTQ people are more than twice as likely as heterosexuals to experience depression and anxiety and to misuse substances, which can all fuel HIV risk.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, an expanding body of scholarship has attributed these disparities to anti-LGBTQ stigma.</p> <p>\u201cBut that argument feels not totally complete for many LGBTQ people,\u201d says <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/john_pachankis/\">John Pachankis</a>, an associate professor of public health and psychiatry at Yale and the lead author of the new study.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sfu.ca/fhs/about/people/profiles/travis-salway.html\">Travis Salway</a>, an assistant professor of social epidemiology at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, says the excessive suicide rate among sexual and gender minorities is \u201ctoo large of a disparity for it to be explained, certainly by chance and probably by even one factor\u201d.</p> <p>Past research into such mental health disparities, both academics said, has typically overlooked drags on mental health that may come from within sexual and gender minority subcultures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9bade3ca3eadde1a398e1cd3f4e38b7b9c22998d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bade3ca3eadde1a398e1cd3f4e38b7b9c22998d/0_251_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Pachankis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Pachankis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Cassidy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2017, the journalist Michael Hobbes bucked this trend in a <a href=\"https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/\">deep dive for HuffPost</a> into what he called an epidemic of gay loneliness. The article\u2019s popularity among gay and bisexual men was a testament to a hunger for narratives that validate persistent feelings of unease about gay culture.</p> <p>Pachankis\u2019s paper represents the field of psychology catching up with something that to many has long been painfully self-evident: gay men can be awfully hard on each other. Moreover, as the paper suggests, the pressure to keep up with the Joneses can be profoundly taxing in ways unique to this segment of the population.</p> <h2>Sources of stress</h2> <p>A small handful of papers have laid the groundwork for exploring the deleterious effects of stressors within the gay community.

      "bodyText": "The persistence of mental health hardships among gay and bisexual men, which endure even as LGBTQ people gain greater acceptance and civil rights, can be explained at least in part by the corrosive effects of status consciousness, competitiveness and racism within the gay community itself. Those are the striking and potentially controversial findings of a study published in January in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that may broaden appreciation of the unique stressors faced by gay and bisexual men. Gay and lesbian people have a more than fourfold higher rate of suicide than the general population. Among transgender people, the gulf is even wider. LGBTQ people are more than twice as likely as heterosexuals to experience depression and anxiety and to misuse substances, which can all fuel HIV risk. Over the last two decades, an expanding body of scholarship has attributed these disparities to anti-LGBTQ stigma. \u201cBut that argument feels not totally complete for many LGBTQ people,\u201d says John Pachankis, an associate professor of public health and psychiatry at Yale and the lead author of the new study. Travis Salway, an assistant professor of social epidemiology at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, says the excessive suicide rate among sexual and gender minorities is \u201ctoo large of a disparity for it to be explained, certainly by chance and probably by even one factor\u201d. Past research into such mental health disparities, both academics said, has typically overlooked drags on mental health that may come from within sexual and gender minority subcultures. In 2017, the journalist Michael Hobbes bucked this trend in a deep dive for HuffPost into what he called an epidemic of gay loneliness. The article\u2019s popularity among gay and bisexual men was a testament to a hunger for narratives that validate persistent feelings of unease about gay culture. Pachankis\u2019s paper represents the field of psychology catching up with something that to many has long been painfully self-evident: gay men can be awfully hard on each other. Moreover, as the paper suggests, the pressure to keep up with the Joneses can be profoundly taxing in ways unique to this segment of the population. Sources of stress A small handful of papers have laid the groundwork for exploring the deleterious effects of stressors within the gay community. Pachankis\u2019s study is the most rigorous yet. The five-year study is based on five psychological studies, including four meticulously designed experiments with nine cohorts of gay and bisexual men. Pachankis and his colleagues found that the stress gay and bisexual men reported experiencing related to their community\u2019s preoccupation with sex, status and competition, as well as racism within their ranks, was associated with compromised mental health, especially for those lower on the gay-status totem pole. These connections held even when the investigators controlled for traditional factors tied to the stress of being a stigmatized sexual minority as well as general life stress. The study culminated with a series of experiments in which gay and bisexual men participated in a chat room with other men. When the participants experienced rejection from gay or bisexual men they perceived to be of superior status, because of a higher level of masculinity, attractiveness and income, this proved particularly stressful. Such a status imbalance did not intensify feelings of rejection if the higher-status man was straight. Rejection from gay and bisexual peers, Pachankis found in a follow-up study soon to be published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, was also associated with an increased likelihood that men would engage in sex that put them at risk for HIV. This finding reveals an apparent blind spot in HIV prevention. The preponderance of stress-related psychological research about HIV risk among men who have sex with men has focused on stress related to anti-LGBTQ stigma and not on the effects, for example, of receiving persistent rejections and cutting or racist remarks on hook-up apps. \u201cIn the HIV-risk article,\u201d Pachankis says, \u201cwe repeatedly mention, \u2018Why not look at the people gays are actually having sex with as sources of stress?\u2019\u201d As the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology paper describes, men in all global cultures are inclined toward competitiveness and driven by a need to prove their manhood. Thus, any subculture composed entirely of the male sex \u2013 think the NFL or a frat house \u2013 is likely to be intrinsically status conscious. Within gay male culture, such competition is compounded by the fact that members compete for social and sexual gain and for sex with each other. Pachankis\u2019s research suggests factors such as physique, income and race can be major sources of compare-and-despair anxieties that have become ever-more insidious as Instagram and apps such as Grindr and Scruff quantify with often excruciating and demoralizing precision where men stand in the pecking order. Additionally, unlike their straight counterparts, sexual minority men can assess their own personal sexual status using standards they would apply to potential partners. This can create a mental feedback loop and give rise to a kind of sexual arms race. Body-conscious gay men often go to extensive lengths to outmatch competitors and attract higher-status men. Such efforts can give rise to body dysmorphia, eating disorders and harmful use of anabolic steroids, says Aaron Blashill of San Diego State University, who researches body image among men who have sex with men. Local men in his studies rarely report, he says, \u201c\u2018I had a really difficult week because someone called me a fag.\u2019 It\u2019s much, much more common that folks are talking about intraminority stressors of a lot of dating apps, judgment, and sexual racism within the community.\u201d \u2018No silver bullet\u2019 Historically, most psychological research into health and mental health disparities among sexual minorities has focused on the trauma of growing up and living in a homophobic society. In 1957, psychologist Evelyn Hooker published a groundbreaking study that found homosexuals were psychologically healthy, comparable to heterosexuals in that regard. Such research would contribute to the watershed de-listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973. Starting in the mid-1990s, researchers began to recognize that sexual minorities experience disproportionate rates of anxiety and substance use disorders, suicidal behaviors and ideations and depression, compared with heterosexuals. In 2003 Ilan H Meyer, a University of California, Los Angeles psychiatric epidemiologist, established what is known as minority stress theory, which explains health and mental health disparities between sexual and gender minorities and the general population as a function of anti-LGBTQ stigma and prejudice. Minority stress theory has proved influential in shaping LGBTQ civil rights campaigns and court cases as well as a prevailing media narrative that focuses on the harms a heterosexist, transphobic society inflicts on queer people. Pachankis\u2019s Personality and Social Psychology paper introduces a new paradigm he calls the \u201cgay community stress theory\u201d and which is meant to complement minority stress theory. The new theory provides a framework to explore many seldom-studied aspects of gay life that shape mental health. \u201cThis paper and this work on intra-gay community stress,\u201d Meyer says, \u201cis definitely pointing to a problem that LGBTQ advocates and community centers and people who deal with therapy or reducing distress in these communities need to pay attention to.\u201d Pachankis, Meyer and others have nevertheless expressed concern that the new findings may be misconstrued or even deliberately misread and manipulated to serve an age-old narrative characterizing homosexuality as inherently damaging. Pachankis pursued this line of research reluctantly, he says, after hearing repeated mention of the themes that would color his study from patients and participants in research. As a stigma researcher, the last thing he wanted was to provide society with a new basis for casting gay and bisexual men in a negative light. \u201cI would hope this set of findings would never compromise the drive for LGBTQ equality,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery minority group must face stressors from within.\u201d \u201cThere may be people who try to misinterpret what this study means but the study\u2019s findings also can support our work,\u201d says Lambda Legal senior attorney Omar Gonz\u00e1lez-Pag\u00e1n, who was on the legal team behind the supreme court case that legalized same-sex marriage in 2015.

They have ferocious Brazilian provocation <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/bacurau\" title=\"\">Bacurau</a> </strong>coming in cinemas and on streaming later in March. Better yet, however, they\u2019ve just added Diao Yinan\u2019s dazzling <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/wild-goose-lake\" title=\"\">The Wild Goose Lake</a></strong> to their <a href=\"https://mubi.com/showing\" title=\"\">30-day streaming menu</a>. The best film at Cannes last year not to win any kind of prize at all, it\u2019s also been sold a bit short by not getting a cinema release. Don\u2019t let it pass you by, however: this Chinese film noir is an eye-popping, screen-filling vision that deserves wider attention.</p> <p>If the English-language title of Diao\u2019s film sounds like a play of \u201cwild goose chase\u201d, that\u2019s probably accidental, but also not inappropriate. In this pileup of double- and triple-crossings in the ganglands of a fictional, seedy Chinese town, the looping, labyrinthine plot often feels like an exceptionally ornate bluff. Gradually you realise that all the neon-lit beauty you take in while running Diao\u2019s elegant, breathless obstacle course is the real point.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2pcumduhDM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L2pcumduhDM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2pcumduhDM\">Watch a trailer for The Wild Goose Lake.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It begins, like many a great noir, with a shadowed meeting between a hardened criminal and an aloof femme fatale. Zhou (the superbly stoic Hu Ge) is on the run from the law after killing a cop; prostitute Liu Aiai (Gwei Lun Mei) has come to deliver a message from his wife, but perhaps also has interest in the substantial price on his head. Further complexities unfold in flashback, as we learn how things unravelled for Zhou in a heist labelled \u201cthe Olympic Games of theft\u201d: a madcap plan to steal a town\u2019s worth of motorbikes in two hours. Diao\u2019s film thrives on such demented details.</p> <p>Mistakes are made, spectacularly, and things get more and more tangled: if you lose the thread at some point and simply wallow in the film\u2019s seamy, rain-soaked visual splendour and athletically choreographed action, that\u2019s probably the idea, and you certainly won\u2019t feel shortchanged. Though there\u2019s a rich tradition of Asian thrillers that find lavish atmosphere in late-night noodle shops, bleak urban beaches and, perhaps more unusually, an after-hours zoo, they\u2019re rarely presented with quite gravity-defying cinematic imagination. Revelling in hot pinks and sulphurous yellows, Diao and his ingenious cinematographer Dong Jinsong make a brilliant new world of this much-crossed terrain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXm1XcjP13E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WXm1XcjP13E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXm1XcjP13E\">Watch a trailer for Black Coal, Thin Ice.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This won\u2019t be a revelation to anyone who\u2019s seen Diao\u2019s previous film, the 2014 Berlin Golden Bear winner <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXm1XcjP13E\" title=\"\">Black Coal, Thin Ice</a></strong>, though any newly converted fans should make haste to it. It brings the same knotty storytelling and rich, blanketing atmosphere to the film-noir genre, but in a more sombre, charred visual register, with its wintry tale of a disgraced ex-cop pursuing the unsolved murder case that ended his career. The film is widely available to stream on such outlets <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Coal-Thin-Ice-Liao/dp/B00ZSUF41M/r\" title=\"\">as Amazon</a>.</p> <p>More surprising is that Diao\u2019s little-seen 2003 debut, <strong>Uniform</strong>, can be found <a href=\"https://uk.chili.com/movie/uniform-2003/419786a1-a619-48f1-b41d-e0ee91522540\" title=\"\">streaming on Chili</a> for a mere 90p. It\u2019s a dark fable about a young factory worker who swipes a cop\u2019s uniform from a laundrette and discovers the unearned power it wields when he slips it on. A simpler, scruffier study of inverted law and order than its successors, it\u2019s a taut, witty treat in its own right \u2013 ripe for rediscovery as Diao\u2019s luminous new film spreads its wings.</p> <h2>Also new to DVD and streaming this week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66ec2baa39d2e54e1134e3053e9c5ecf89632488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ec2baa39d2e54e1134e3053e9c5ecf89632488/0_0_1800_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomie Harris in Black and Blue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomie Harris in Black and Blue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Markfield/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Black and Blue</strong><em> <br>(Sony, 15) </em><br>A rookie cop goes on the run after witnessing a murder committed by corrupt boys in blue.

It brings the same knotty storytelling and rich, blanketing atmosphere to the film-noir genre, but in a more sombre, charred visual register, with its wintry tale of a disgraced ex-cop pursuing the unsolved murder case that ended his career. The film is widely available to stream on such outlets as Amazon. More surprising is that Diao\u2019s little-seen 2003 debut, Uniform, can be found streaming on Chili for a mere 90p. It\u2019s a dark fable about a young factory worker who swipes a cop\u2019s uniform from a laundrette and discovers the unearned power it wields when he slips it on. A simpler, scruffier study of inverted law and order than its successors, it\u2019s a taut, witty treat in its own right \u2013 ripe for rediscovery as Diao\u2019s luminous new film spreads its wings. Also new to DVD and streaming this week Black and Blue (Sony, 15) A rookie cop goes on the run after witnessing a murder committed by corrupt boys in blue. Carried by a soulfully committed Naomie Harris, Deon Taylor\u2019s old-school police thriller is spikier than generic outward appearances might suggest. Chained for Life (Anti-Worlds, 15) Ableism in Hollywood goes under the microscope in Aaron Schimberg\u2019s pointed, cleverly metatextual satire, in which a conventionally beautiful movie star \u2013 playing the role of a blind person in a dubious disability drama \u2013 falls for her facially disfigured co-star. Terminator: Dark Fate (Fox, 15) After a run of desperate extensions to a mutated franchise, this back-to-basics return is a marked improvement, thanks largely to a front-and-centre role for 63-year-old Linda Hamilton\u2019s resurgent Sarah Connor. But let\u2019s leave things there, shall we? First Love (Signature, 15) Japanese genre workhorse Takashi Miike is so prolific that you can afford to skip several of his films in a row, but this cheerfully grisly Tokyo underworld caper is one of his keepers, stringing one beautifully staged knockabout action set piece after another. Studio Ghibli (Netflix) I discussed Netflix\u2019s bonanza of films from the Japanese anime masters last month: a reminder that the second batch, including the essential Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, hits the service on Sunday.",

One is a seeming capacity for political misjudgment, notably her extracurricular visit to Israel, which baffled and outraged May and her team. Patel\u2019s decision to hold a dozen unauthorised work meetings during what was billed as a family holiday, including with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, seemed motivated by her vigorous opinions on foreign policy, apparently influenced by her ties to strongly pro-Israel and pro-US groups such as the Henry Jackson Society. Most of all, weeks of allegations about bullying and fallings-out with senior civil servants, coupled with reports that she sought to have the director of communications at the Home Office removed just before Christmas, have clearly damaged Patel\u2019s reputation, for all the counter-briefing by allies. But at the same time, Patel\u2019s allies are vehement her reputation is unfair. One official who worked closely with her at her Home Office said she has \u201cthe hardest job in British politics\u201d. They said: \u201cPersonally, I loved working for Priti. She is an extremely motivated and demanding boss, sure, but also incredibly kind. Frankly, I find the allegations of bullying ridiculous. I\u2019ve never seen anything that even vaguely resembles it.\u201d Potted profile Born: 29 March 1972 in north London. Career: Educated at state schools, then Keele and Essex Universities. After stints as a press officer for both the Referendum party and the Conservatives, she worked in corporate PR for Weber Shandwick, and for the drinks giant Diageo. Having become an MP in 2010 she had junior ministerial roles in the Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions under David Cameron, before Theresa May made her international development secretary. High point: Returning to the cabinet as home secretary under Boris Johnson. Low point: Being forced to resign by May after failing to tell the PM about unofficial meetings in Israel. She says: \u201cAs the daughter of a migrant, I know the sanctuary, welcome and opportunities that Britain provides. Regaining control of our borders does not mean slamming the door shut.\u201d They say: \u201cPriti Patel is a politician with a consistent record of voting against basic human rights protections. For her to be put in charge of the Home Office is extremely concerning,\u201d \u2013 rights group Liberty.",

He is small, softly spoken with twinkly eyes and sticky-out hair: I\u2019m not the first to observe that he looks a lot like one of his drawings. He is not sure how many books he has illustrated \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t counted them recently\u201d \u2013 but reckons it\u2019s more than 400. Despite being semi-retired, he is still incredibly prolific. He\u2019s mostly given up doing public appearances and has scaled back the commissions. \u201cWhich means I can draw anything, you see,\u201d he says, delightedly. \u201cI draw every day. I draw in bed and when I\u2019m sitting like this on the sofa.\u201d</p> <p>His studio is in his flat around the corner, and he has another one in his other house in Hastings. \u201cI spent 40 years working standing up at a plan chest with a light box on it, and eventually my doctor said: \u2018No wonder your feet hurt. You\u2019d better sit down.\u2019 Sitting down still feels rather odd, though lying down is perfectly all right. Do you know Michael Morpurgo? He writes everything in bed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c7abfc53b8c17749aa1ddcd207de99d81f0cdcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c7abfc53b8c17749aa1ddcd207de99d81f0cdcc/579_299_1388_1735/800.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from The BFG.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from The BFG.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quentin Blake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blake is, he says, a fast worker. He once described his style as \u201cdeceptively slapdash\u201d, though \u201cif you know anything about it, [you know] it isn\u2019t slapdash,\u201d he adds. \u201cI had a very nice student who once said \u2018You\u2019re like Fred Astaire, you make it look easy.\u2019\u201d I ask whether he looks for people\u2019s visual quirks and stores them for future reference. \u201cI think I must do, but I\u2019m not really conscious of it,\u201d he replies. He will act out certain positions himself while drawing people, and has been told that he pulls faces, too. \u201cI do a lot of rough [drawings] for commissions. Sometimes I go back to the roughs, and there might be someone standing looking at someone else, and they\u2019ve got an expression on their face that I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d put there. You can\u2019t always get it again. You don\u2019t think: \u2018He should be looking suspicious.\u2019 You just go into his situation, and, well, you don\u2019t know quite how you do it.\u201d</p> <p>He struggles to draw cars and buildings but birds have been a recurring motif, from the magpies in <em>The Twits</em> and the mynah bird in <em>The Weed</em>, to his illustrated version of Aristophanes\u2019 <em>The Birds</em>. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d says Blake. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s partly because they\u2019ve got two legs like us.\u201d He asks his assistant, Nikki, to hand me a copy of his 2005 book, <em>The Life of Birds</em>, in which there are birds in spectacles walking in the park, birds as adolescents standing moodily with their hands deep in their pockets, and a bird sitting at a desk writing letters. A recent commission, he tells me, involved a series of drawings about whisky, and he was asked to bring in characters from Shakespeare\u2019s <em>Macbeth</em> \u2013 \u201cand they all ended up as birds. It\u2019s what came naturally.\u201d</p> <p>Although he turns down a lot of work, he still enjoys the challenge of drawing to order. Collaborations with authors have sustained much of his career. \u201cReading is the only thing I\u2019ve got a qualification for,\u201d he chuckles (he studied English at Cambridge). \u201cI like drawing for myself but all those books, they\u2019re so different in character \u2026 People often ask me where I get my ideas from and I say: \u2018I get them from writers.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4cbe7abf444316d43274f2f8895bcc99def64630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cbe7abf444316d43274f2f8895bcc99def64630/0_278_1946_2431/800.jpg\" alt=\"Matilda at 30\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtesy of Quentin Blake/Roald Dahl Story Company 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quentin Blake/Roald Dahl Story Company 2018</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in 1932 and raised in Sidcup, Kent, Blake doesn\u2019t recall seeing many illustrated children\u2019s books as a child. In his early teens he became aware of the 19th-century French caricaturist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/nov/14/honore-daumier-scandalous-cartoons-french-society-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Honor\u00e9 Daumier</a>. \u201cHe was fascinating to me because he was an artist of major stature, but in newspapers.\u201d He recalls going to a shop in Bromley with his mother and paying two guineas for a book on Daumier. \u201cMy mother said: \u2018Are you sure you want to spend all that money on a book?\u2019 I was and I did. I still have it.\u201d</p> <p>Blake sent drawings to Punch magazine in his teens and, to his surprise, it paid him for them. He later found a mentor in the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/brian-robb-1853\" title=\"\">painter and illustrator Brian Robb</a>, whom he tracked down at Chelsea School of Art with a view to studying with him. \u201cHe told me: \u2018Don\u2019t join my illustration class.\u2019 I think he thought I\u2019d done enough on my own. So instead I took in my drawings and he gave me a tutorial. He looked after me very well, and when he died he left me the contents of his studio. Extraordinary.\u201d</p> <p>After university, Blake did a teaching diploma. The plan was to teach English, which he did part-time for a while, but he went on to teach illustration at the Royal College of Art. After university, he knew he wanted to draw full-time but, he says, \u201creceived wisdom was that you couldn\u2019t make a living from it\u201d. He had the last laugh; when he finally gave up teaching to concentrate on drawing \u201cmy income increased dramatically\u201d.</p> <p>Blake is currently working on drawings to accompany a series of poems by Michael Rosen called <em>On the Move</em>, about migration. \u201cIt\u2019s a children\u2019s book but anyone could read it. It\u2019s about members of his family, many of whom were refugees.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to try to draw Rosen\u2019s family, as that would have felt intrusive. \u201cSo what I\u2019ve done is landscape pictures of people migrating. In one I\u2019ve got a line of them going up a hill with their bags, and there\u2019s another one with a bombed building in it. They\u2019re not exactly illustrations, they\u2019re things that might have happened to those people. But they\u2019re generalised.\u201d</p> <p>The hardest commission he ever had was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/12/darkness-literature\" title=\"\">Rosen\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/12/darkness-literature\" title=\"\">Sad Book</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/12/darkness-literature\" title=\"\"> in 2004</a>. It was about the author\u2019s grief after the death of his 18-year-old son Eddie from meningitis. \u201cI\u2019d come across Eddie in earlier poems that Michael had written about him, so I\u2019d drawn him as a small boy,\u201d explains Blake. \u201cI was very relieved that I\u2019d never met him. It made it easier for me.\u201d The first page had an illustration of Rosen with a smile on his face and big, wide eyes. \u201cThis is me being sad,\u201d it says. \u201cMaybe you think I\u2019m being happy in this picture. Really I\u2019m sad but pretending I\u2019m being happy.\u201d Usually, Blake will do two or three versions of an illustration and pick the best, but this was different. \u201cI did it about 14 times,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/apr/05/bulging-portfolio-of-quentin-blake-artworks-1830-gallery-halifax-in-pictures\">The colour in anything: illustrations by Quentin Blake \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blake rarely deals directly with authors when illustrating their books, although he would talk to Dahl from time to time \u2013 \u201cWe would have a discussion about what the BFG was going to wear, and that kind of thing.\u201d Is it true that Dahl sent Blake a pair of sandals in the post and said he\u2019d like the BFG to be wearing them? \u201cYes, that\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d he confirms, though he adds that most authors don\u2019t do that. Once, when Rosen was asked about his working relationship with Blake, he replied, \u201cI give it to him and he does it.\u201d Blake tells me this approvingly. He doesn\u2019t like to think too hard about where his ideas come from or what they mean. He just gets on with it.</p> <p>Nikki tells me it\u2019s time for the last question so I ask Blake, who has never had a family of his own, if he ever seeks out the company of children to get a sense of what they like and don\u2019t like. He looks slightly appalled at this. \u201cGood God, no,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cOh no. I get on with them perfectly well but spend time with them? No, no, no. There\u2019s no need, you see.

And there\u2019s another one called Chance Encounters, which has two tightropes over a mountain pass \u2013 someone\u2019s walking one way with his mother on his back, and the other is walking the other way with some other strange family situation. I couldn\u2019t tell you where these ideas come from.\u201d Scrawly, often joyful and entirely unmistakable, Blake\u2019s drawings have given some of children\u2019s literature\u2019s most cherished characters their visual identities, in books from Roald Dahl\u2019s The BFG, Matilda, Fantastic Mr Fox and The Twits to David Walliams\u2019s Mr Stink and The Boy in the Dress. Britain\u2019s first children\u2019s laureate from 1999 to 2001, Blake has also illustrated poetry collections by Michael Rosen and the stories of his lifelong friend John Yeoman, with whom he shares a flat (Blake has previously said he is not gay), as well as creating his own characters including Mister Magnolia and Mrs Armitage. In the past 15 or so years, his work has moved into public spaces: he has drawn murals for hospitals all over London as well as in Sheffield and at a maternity unit in Angers, France (the French government made him a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres in 2004). We are sitting on a sofa in Blake\u2019s office, the fabric of which is printed with his illustrations (you can also get Blake wallpaper, mugs, fridge magnets and tea towels). He is small, softly spoken with twinkly eyes and sticky-out hair: I\u2019m not the first to observe that he looks a lot like one of his drawings. He is not sure how many books he has illustrated \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t counted them recently\u201d \u2013 but reckons it\u2019s more than 400. Despite being semi-retired, he is still incredibly prolific. He\u2019s mostly given up doing public appearances and has scaled back the commissions. \u201cWhich means I can draw anything, you see,\u201d he says, delightedly. \u201cI draw every day. I draw in bed and when I\u2019m sitting like this on the sofa.\u201d His studio is in his flat around the corner, and he has another one in his other house in Hastings. \u201cI spent 40 years working standing up at a plan chest with a light box on it, and eventually my doctor said: \u2018No wonder your feet hurt. You\u2019d better sit down.\u2019 Sitting down still feels rather odd, though lying down is perfectly all right. Do you know Michael Morpurgo? He writes everything in bed.\u201d Blake is, he says, a fast worker. He once described his style as \u201cdeceptively slapdash\u201d, though \u201cif you know anything about it, [you know] it isn\u2019t slapdash,\u201d he adds. \u201cI had a very nice student who once said \u2018You\u2019re like Fred Astaire, you make it look easy.\u2019\u201d I ask whether he looks for people\u2019s visual quirks and stores them for future reference. \u201cI think I must do, but I\u2019m not really conscious of it,\u201d he replies. He will act out certain positions himself while drawing people, and has been told that he pulls faces, too. \u201cI do a lot of rough [drawings] for commissions. Sometimes I go back to the roughs, and there might be someone standing looking at someone else, and they\u2019ve got an expression on their face that I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d put there. You can\u2019t always get it again. You don\u2019t think: \u2018He should be looking suspicious.\u2019 You just go into his situation, and, well, you don\u2019t know quite how you do it.\u201d He struggles to draw cars and buildings but birds have been a recurring motif, from the magpies in The Twits and the mynah bird in The Weed, to his illustrated version of Aristophanes\u2019 The Birds. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d says Blake. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s partly because they\u2019ve got two legs like us.\u201d He asks his assistant, Nikki, to hand me a copy of his 2005 book, The Life of Birds, in which there are birds in spectacles walking in the park, birds as adolescents standing moodily with their hands deep in their pockets, and a bird sitting at a desk writing letters. A recent commission, he tells me, involved a series of drawings about whisky, and he was asked to bring in characters from Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth \u2013 \u201cand they all ended up as birds. It\u2019s what came naturally.\u201d Although he turns down a lot of work, he still enjoys the challenge of drawing to order. Collaborations with authors have sustained much of his career. \u201cReading is the only thing I\u2019ve got a qualification for,\u201d he chuckles (he studied English at Cambridge). \u201cI like drawing for myself but all those books, they\u2019re so different in character \u2026 People often ask me where I get my ideas from and I say: \u2018I get them from writers.\u2019\u201d Born in 1932 and raised in Sidcup, Kent, Blake doesn\u2019t recall seeing many illustrated children\u2019s books as a child. In his early teens he became aware of the 19th-century French caricaturist Honor\u00e9 Daumier. \u201cHe was fascinating to me because he was an artist of major stature, but in newspapers.\u201d He recalls going to a shop in Bromley with his mother and paying two guineas for a book on Daumier. \u201cMy mother said: \u2018Are you sure you want to spend all that money on a book?\u2019 I was and I did. I still have it.\u201d Blake sent drawings to Punch magazine in his teens and, to his surprise, it paid him for them. He later found a mentor in the painter and illustrator Brian Robb, whom he tracked down at Chelsea School of Art with a view to studying with him. \u201cHe told me: \u2018Don\u2019t join my illustration class.\u2019 I think he thought I\u2019d done enough on my own. So instead I took in my drawings and he gave me a tutorial. He looked after me very well, and when he died he left me the contents of his studio. Extraordinary.\u201d After university, Blake did a teaching diploma. The plan was to teach English, which he did part-time for a while, but he went on to teach illustration at the Royal College of Art. After university, he knew he wanted to draw full-time but, he says, \u201creceived wisdom was that you couldn\u2019t make a living from it\u201d. He had the last laugh; when he finally gave up teaching to concentrate on drawing \u201cmy income increased dramatically\u201d. Blake is currently working on drawings to accompany a series of poems by Michael Rosen called On the Move, about migration. \u201cIt\u2019s a children\u2019s book but anyone could read it. It\u2019s about members of his family, many of whom were refugees.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to try to draw Rosen\u2019s family, as that would have felt intrusive. \u201cSo what I\u2019ve done is landscape pictures of people migrating. In one I\u2019ve got a line of them going up a hill with their bags, and there\u2019s another one with a bombed building in it. They\u2019re not exactly illustrations, they\u2019re things that might have happened to those people. But they\u2019re generalised.\u201d The hardest commission he ever had was Rosen\u2019s Sad Book in 2004. It was about the author\u2019s grief after the death of his 18-year-old son Eddie from meningitis. \u201cI\u2019d come across Eddie in earlier poems that Michael had written about him, so I\u2019d drawn him as a small boy,\u201d explains Blake. \u201cI was very relieved that I\u2019d never met him. It made it easier for me.\u201d The first page had an illustration of Rosen with a smile on his face and big, wide eyes. \u201cThis is me being sad,\u201d it says. \u201cMaybe you think I\u2019m being happy in this picture. Really I\u2019m sad but pretending I\u2019m being happy.\u201d Usually, Blake will do two or three versions of an illustration and pick the best, but this was different. \u201cI did it about 14 times,\u201d he says. Blake rarely deals directly with authors when illustrating their books, although he would talk to Dahl from time to time \u2013 \u201cWe would have a discussion about what the BFG was going to wear, and that kind of thing.\u201d Is it true that Dahl sent Blake a pair of sandals in the post and said he\u2019d like the BFG to be wearing them? \u201cYes, that\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d he confirms, though he adds that most authors don\u2019t do that. Once, when Rosen was asked about his working relationship with Blake, he replied, \u201cI give it to him and he does it.\u201d Blake tells me this approvingly. He doesn\u2019t like to think too hard about where his ideas come from or what they mean. He just gets on with it. Nikki tells me it\u2019s time for the last question so I ask Blake, who has never had a family of his own, if he ever seeks out the company of children to get a sense of what they like and don\u2019t like. He looks slightly appalled at this. \u201cGood God, no,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cOh no. I get on with them perfectly well but spend time with them? No, no, no. There\u2019s no need, you see. I just make it all up.\u201d \u2022 The Weed by Quentin Blake is published by Tate (RRP \u00a312.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p on all online orders over \u00a315.",

His mouth froths. He gets so excited that he spills some of his lemon and ginger tea on the floor of the photo studio we\u2019re sitting in. \u201cOh dear,\u201d he says, Iggy Pop transforming rapidly into an extremely apologetic, polite young man. \u201cI\u2019m just going to wipe that up with my bum.\u201d And so he does \u2013 sliding across the floor while his black trousers soak up the drink.</p> <p>A polite young man George MacKay might be, but at just 27 he\u2019s had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/03/george-mackay-yours-sincerely-sunshine-on-leith\" title=\"p\">plenty of practice</a> trying on other personas: a closeted gay activist in Pride, a singing Scottish squaddie in Sunshine On Leith and \u2013 most recently \u2013 Lance Corporal Will Schofield in Sam Mendes\u2019 first world war smash, 1917. He is soon to play the notorious Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in True History Of The Kelly Gang, which is where today\u2019s unlikely punk outburst comes in: director Justin Kurzel wanted his young actors to put a punky spin on the tale of the Aussie folk hero, so he booked a gig venue and told them to perform their own songs live as a punk band. MacKay is treating me to one of his self-penned numbers.</p> <p>\u201cWe put on dresses and rubbed ash in our eyes,\u201d he recalls of the performance by the resulting band, Fleshlight. MacKay came up with the name: \u201cIt\u2019s a\u2026 it\u2019s a sort of\u2026 sex toy that you can, um, unscrew and, er, make love to,\u201d he says, his bashfulness further proof that Iggy has left the building.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21b8caf01a80bf74ae7c5d458668b1504969365f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21b8caf01a80bf74ae7c5d458668b1504969365f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor George MacKay against union flag in True History Of The Kelly Gang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Just grow a mullet\u2019: a beardless MacKay in True History Of The Kelly Gang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MacKay adores this immersive way of working \u2013 not just researching but <em>living</em> his roles. To prepare for True History Of The Kelly Gang, he lived in the bush, bulking up by chopping wood and riding horses. Sadly, not every aspect of physical transformation was as easy to achieve: the outlaw Kelly was renowned for his manly whiskers, yet baby-faced MacKay struggled to grow any facial hair. \u201cI honestly thought I was going to lose the part,\u201d he says.</p> <p>What did his attempt at a beard look like?</p> <p>\u201cIt looked like a big ginger eyebrow. I spoke to [Kurzel] on Skype, and of course at the time he had this <em>amazing</em> beard. just like Ned\u2019s out here \u2013\u201d he gestures with his arms. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, no need for the whole one, but\u2026 like, nothing?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They tried a stick-on beard but Kurzel wasn\u2019t convinced. Then the director had a brainwave \u2013 what could be more punk rock than playing Australia\u2019s hairiest antihero with baby-smooth cheeks? \u201cJust grow a mullet instead,\u201d came the instructions, which MacKay managed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"716d342f454e0855a89ead0a17a0dbd396759e40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/716d342f454e0855a89ead0a17a0dbd396759e40/0_1340_4888_3916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George MacKay, actor, looking back while walking across a field, January 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacKay wears <a href=\"https://www.margarethowell.co.uk/campaigns/mhl/\">MHL</a> mac, <a href=\"https://www.loewe.com/eur/en/home\">Loewe</a> trousers, <a href=\"https://oliverspencer.co.uk/\">Oliver Spencer</a> shoes and (top) <a href=\"https://www.margarethowell.co.uk/\">Margaret Howell</a> blazer and trousers, <a href=\"https://www.margarethowell.co.uk/campaigns/mhl/\">MHL</a> jersey and mac.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Brownlee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fortunately, no facial fuzz was needed for 1917, in which MacKay\u2019s role \u2013 alongside another relatively little-known actor (Dean-Charles Chapman) \u2013 was to be a young man in an old man\u2019s war. The story follows the two soldiers on their mission to carry a vital message deep behind enemy lines. Again, MacKay threw himself into the part: army boot camps, six months of rehearsals, understanding the function of every bit of archaic military kit. The Oscar-winning film was famously shot in \u201cone take\u201d (in reality, very long takes \u2013 some of them almost 10 minutes \u2013 stitched together) and the last thing anyone needed was to get seven minutes into a take, only for the safety catch on a rifle to jam.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, mistakes were encouraged. In one epic scene, MacKay hurtles down the frontline while allied troops emerge over the trenches; he gets floored by one soldier, something that wasn\u2019t scripted. \u201cWhen everyone\u2019s blood\u2019s up and the bombs are going off, that happens,\u201d MacKay says. \u201cSam wanted it to be natural and alive, so he kept it.\u201d</p> <p>As an actor, MacKay is already something of a war veteran: he\u2019s fought the first world war three times, and the second world war twice. For him, this has meant delving into an awful lot of history books, including harrowing first-person accounts. \u201cWe talk about seeing the inside of a person in a spiritual or figurative sense,\u201d he says. \u201cBut these people would really see it. To see someone\u2019s organs, or their bone split and poke out. Picking up a friend\u2019s leg and it coming away\u2026\u201d He shudders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89bb31983154981a9f26c091da891bbe37bc8a26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bb31983154981a9f26c091da891bbe37bc8a26/27_199_2720_1632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor George MacKay (centre) in 1917\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When everyone\u2019s blood\u2019s up and the bombs are going off, unscripted things happen\u2019: in 1917.

MacKay\u2019s 1917 character, Schofield, is a quiet soul who bottles up his emotions as a way of forgetting his life back home, and MacKay thinks he did something similar while working on True History Of The Kelly Gang.</p> <p>\u201c[That film] was the most exhausting physical and emotional time,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember at the end of it thinking, I\u2019ve no energy left. And if anyone asks me about it, I\u2019ll break. It was one of the most profound and joyous experiences. But by the end, I felt very wobbly and vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>MacKay grew up in Barnes, a villagey suburb of south-west London on the bank of the Thames. His parents (his mother is a costume designer, his father a lighting and stage director) sent him to the independent Harrodian school, which encouraged his love of drama. By the time he was 10, MacKay had his first acting job, and was whisked away to Australia for eight months to play Curly, one of the lost boys in PJ Hogan\u2019s 2003 version of Peter Pan. Back in London, he got on with the business of becoming a normal teenager: \u201cI didn\u2019t really talk about it much,\u201d he shrugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfd1c19b130ea412843e626413f3dab03897ef8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfd1c19b130ea412843e626413f3dab03897ef8f/174_543_4775_2865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actors Saoirse Ronan and George MacKay in the 2013 film How I Live Now\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Even back then, she was a trailblazer\u2019: with Saoirse Ronan in How I Live Now in 2013. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His career hasn\u2019t been all plain sailing. He failed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but refused to be disheartened: \u201cI decided the next job I got, I was going to actively learn and listen, and look for jobs that could facilitate the learning I would have done there.\u201d And so he picked roles that pushed him to new places. The part he wanted more than anything was that of Edmond in the 2013 postapocalyptic teen drama How I Live Now \u2013 because he wanted to learn from its director Kevin Macdonald and then rising star Saoirse Ronan. \u201cI was 20, had spent a year not working, and I knew she was this amazing actress,\u201d he says. \u201cEven back then, she was a trailblazer.\u201d</p> <p>The two ended up dating while on set (\u201cI suspected what was going on but they kept it very quiet,\u201d Macdonald would later say), which must have made finding the onscreen chemistry a bit easier.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI just admire that woman <em>so</em> much. She\u2019s an amazing human being, but that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d</p> <p>Does he make a habit of falling for his co-stars? \u201cIt seems obvious that, if that\u2019s who you\u2019re spending time with, and who you\u2019re getting to know, that\u2019s how we meet everyone,\u201d he deflects. \u201cIt\u2019s not a constant through-line but we all meet people some way, either at work or in a pub.\u201d</p> <p>Is he single at the moment? \u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d</p> <p>He is less cautious when it comes to picking his parts. MacKay\u2019s cross-dressing Ned Kelly, for instance, is charged with sexual energy: there\u2019s a homoerotic frisson between him and Nicholas Hoult, who plays a young constable interested in Kelly\u2019s sister; and his relationship with his onscreen mother (played by the director\u2019s wife, Essie Davis) would make Freud blush. As MacKay puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, weird oedipal relationship where he\u2019s the little boy to his mum but he\u2019s also her man, and she\u2019s his greatest woman and greatest love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85a14d188c0c83f1673630b97e1122cc1ea1047d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a14d188c0c83f1673630b97e1122cc1ea1047d/0_556_4888_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Headshot of George MacKay, against grey sky and field backdrop, January 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Making True History was one of the most profound and joyous experiences. At the end of it, I had no energy left.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Brownlee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years ago, MacKay encountered a degree of controversy when he played Lutz, a Hitler Youth member who falls in love with a black girl (Amandla Stenberg) imprisoned in a concentration camp, in Amma Asante\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/10/where-hands-touch-review-amma-asante-amandla-stenberg-george-mackay-abbie-cornish\" title=\"w\">Where Hands Touch</a>. The love story was one element many online commentators were uncomfortable with, although MacKay says he was oblivious because he has no social media presence.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere\u2019ll be no more of this shit,\u201d snarls George MacKay, eyes bulging like a young Iggy Pop. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the full 11 inches of my dick, just so you can know how it feels to get shaaafted!\u201d His temple throbs. His mouth froths. He gets so excited that he spills some of his lemon and ginger tea on the floor of the photo studio we\u2019re sitting in. \u201cOh dear,\u201d he says, Iggy Pop transforming rapidly into an extremely apologetic, polite young man. \u201cI\u2019m just going to wipe that up with my bum.\u201d And so he does \u2013 sliding across the floor while his black trousers soak up the drink. A polite young man George MacKay might be, but at just 27 he\u2019s had plenty of practice trying on other personas: a closeted gay activist in Pride, a singing Scottish squaddie in Sunshine On Leith and \u2013 most recently \u2013 Lance Corporal Will Schofield in Sam Mendes\u2019 first world war smash, 1917. He is soon to play the notorious Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in True History Of The Kelly Gang, which is where today\u2019s unlikely punk outburst comes in: director Justin Kurzel wanted his young actors to put a punky spin on the tale of the Aussie folk hero, so he booked a gig venue and told them to perform their own songs live as a punk band. MacKay is treating me to one of his self-penned numbers. \u201cWe put on dresses and rubbed ash in our eyes,\u201d he recalls of the performance by the resulting band, Fleshlight. MacKay came up with the name: \u201cIt\u2019s a\u2026 it\u2019s a sort of\u2026 sex toy that you can, um, unscrew and, er, make love to,\u201d he says, his bashfulness further proof that Iggy has left the building. MacKay adores this immersive way of working \u2013 not just researching but living his roles. To prepare for True History Of The Kelly Gang, he lived in the bush, bulking up by chopping wood and riding horses. Sadly, not every aspect of physical transformation was as easy to achieve: the outlaw Kelly was renowned for his manly whiskers, yet baby-faced MacKay struggled to grow any facial hair. \u201cI honestly thought I was going to lose the part,\u201d he says. What did his attempt at a beard look like? \u201cIt looked like a big ginger eyebrow. I spoke to [Kurzel] on Skype, and of course at the time he had this amazing beard. just like Ned\u2019s out here \u2013\u201d he gestures with his arms. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, no need for the whole one, but\u2026 like, nothing?\u2019\u201d They tried a stick-on beard but Kurzel wasn\u2019t convinced. Then the director had a brainwave \u2013 what could be more punk rock than playing Australia\u2019s hairiest antihero with baby-smooth cheeks? \u201cJust grow a mullet instead,\u201d came the instructions, which MacKay managed. Fortunately, no facial fuzz was needed for 1917, in which MacKay\u2019s role \u2013 alongside another relatively little-known actor (Dean-Charles Chapman) \u2013 was to be a young man in an old man\u2019s war. The story follows the two soldiers on their mission to carry a vital message deep behind enemy lines. Again, MacKay threw himself into the part: army boot camps, six months of rehearsals, understanding the function of every bit of archaic military kit. The Oscar-winning film was famously shot in \u201cone take\u201d (in reality, very long takes \u2013 some of them almost 10 minutes \u2013 stitched together) and the last thing anyone needed was to get seven minutes into a take, only for the safety catch on a rifle to jam. Sometimes, though, mistakes were encouraged. In one epic scene, MacKay hurtles down the frontline while allied troops emerge over the trenches; he gets floored by one soldier, something that wasn\u2019t scripted. \u201cWhen everyone\u2019s blood\u2019s up and the bombs are going off, that happens,\u201d MacKay says. \u201cSam wanted it to be natural and alive, so he kept it.\u201d As an actor, MacKay is already something of a war veteran: he\u2019s fought the first world war three times, and the second world war twice. For him, this has meant delving into an awful lot of history books, including harrowing first-person accounts. \u201cWe talk about seeing the inside of a person in a spiritual or figurative sense,\u201d he says. \u201cBut these people would really see it. To see someone\u2019s organs, or their bone split and poke out. Picking up a friend\u2019s leg and it coming away\u2026\u201d He shudders. At the same time, he is keen to stress that being an actor is nothing like being a soldier. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t a terribly misjudged thing to say,\u201d he caveats at one point, and, \u201cThis is only my extremely cushy version of it.\u201d But he does note some parallels: there is the sense of brotherhood on a film set; the returning home after an experience that nobody else has been through; the sense of pushing yourself beyond normal limits. MacKay\u2019s 1917 character, Schofield, is a quiet soul who bottles up his emotions as a way of forgetting his life back home, and MacKay thinks he did something similar while working on True History Of The Kelly Gang. \u201c[That film] was the most exhausting physical and emotional time,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember at the end of it thinking, I\u2019ve no energy left. And if anyone asks me about it, I\u2019ll break. It was one of the most profound and joyous experiences. But by the end, I felt very wobbly and vulnerable.\u201d *** MacKay grew up in Barnes, a villagey suburb of south-west London on the bank of the Thames. His parents (his mother is a costume designer, his father a lighting and stage director) sent him to the independent Harrodian school, which encouraged his love of drama. By the time he was 10, MacKay had his first acting job, and was whisked away to Australia for eight months to play Curly, one of the lost boys in PJ Hogan\u2019s 2003 version of Peter Pan. Back in London, he got on with the business of becoming a normal teenager: \u201cI didn\u2019t really talk about it much,\u201d he shrugs. His career hasn\u2019t been all plain sailing. He failed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but refused to be disheartened: \u201cI decided the next job I got, I was going to actively learn and listen, and look for jobs that could facilitate the learning I would have done there.\u201d And so he picked roles that pushed him to new places. The part he wanted more than anything was that of Edmond in the 2013 postapocalyptic teen drama How I Live Now \u2013 because he wanted to learn from its director Kevin Macdonald and then rising star Saoirse Ronan. \u201cI was 20, had spent a year not working, and I knew she was this amazing actress,\u201d he says. \u201cEven back then, she was a trailblazer.\u201d The two ended up dating while on set (\u201cI suspected what was going on but they kept it very quiet,\u201d Macdonald would later say), which must have made finding the onscreen chemistry a bit easier. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI just admire that woman so much. She\u2019s an amazing human being, but that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d Does he make a habit of falling for his co-stars? \u201cIt seems obvious that, if that\u2019s who you\u2019re spending time with, and who you\u2019re getting to know, that\u2019s how we meet everyone,\u201d he deflects. \u201cIt\u2019s not a constant through-line but we all meet people some way, either at work or in a pub.\u201d Is he single at the moment? \u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d He is less cautious when it comes to picking his parts. MacKay\u2019s cross-dressing Ned Kelly, for instance, is charged with sexual energy: there\u2019s a homoerotic frisson between him and Nicholas Hoult, who plays a young constable interested in Kelly\u2019s sister; and his relationship with his onscreen mother (played by the director\u2019s wife, Essie Davis) would make Freud blush. As MacKay puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, weird oedipal relationship where he\u2019s the little boy to his mum but he\u2019s also her man, and she\u2019s his greatest woman and greatest love.\u201d Two years ago, MacKay encountered a degree of controversy when he played Lutz, a Hitler Youth member who falls in love with a black girl (Amandla Stenberg) imprisoned in a concentration camp, in Amma Asante\u2019s Where Hands Touch. The love story was one element many online commentators were uncomfortable with, although MacKay says he was oblivious because he has no social media presence. Today, he is fiercely loyal to Asante and believes the criticism was misguided. \u201cIt suits us to assume that the Nazis weren\u2019t human, that they are a [different] breed, era\u2026 But the film is saying: these were humans who did this.\u201d Playing characters such as Lutz and Kelly has made him \u201cthink a little bit harder\u201d about social constructs, he says, specifically ones that have benefited him. \u201cI am recognising that I have never, as a white male, felt like I couldn\u2019t walk into a room,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing to feel confident. So it\u2019s been a brilliant realisation to be, like, wow, that\u2019s not a feeling that everyone feels? Not everyone feels they could get cast for this? Why, subconsciously, do I feel that confidence \u2013 and other people subconsciously feel inferior?\u201d In an interview last year, MacKay said that he wanted to be more political in his life and work, but his innate caution and fear of offending means he probably won\u2019t usurp Joaquin Phoenix in the wild outburst charts any time soon. When I ask which way he votes, he flushes, looks panicked and, after a pause that seems to hang in the air, puts his hand to his chest and says he would prefer to keep that private.

From the Americas (I think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">Living to Tell the Tale</a></em>) to Africa (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/18/the-wifes-tale-aida-edemariam-review\" title=\"\">Aida Edemariam\u2019s beautiful </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/18/the-wifes-tale-aida-edemariam-review\" title=\"\">The Wife\u2019s Tale</a></em>), in an era of renewed identity politics, many wish to engage with the inter-generational connections that skip the parents.</p> <p>Freeman\u2019s focus \u2013 initiated by finding a burnished red shoebox stuffed with papers and secrets \u2013 was originally on her father\u2019s mother, born as Sala Glahs in 1910 in Chrzanow, a small town of the Austro-Hungarian empire, not so far from Krak\u00f3w. She was one of four siblings, and the intertwining of the life of Sala \u2013 who later became Sara \u2013 with that of her three older brothers encouraged Freeman to broaden her attention. The challenge for the structure and direction of a book such as this is obvious: family lives, as well as the discovery of the details, tend not to be linear.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I became an adult, I suddenly couldn\u2019t stop thinking of them,\u201d Freeman, a, Guardian journalist, explains. Many will know that feeling, the persistence of regret, of not having had a certain conversation, or asked a particular question.</p> <p>There is a singular form of communication that exists between grandchild and grandparent, not necessarily in a spoken form. It was finely explored by Maria Torok and Nicolas Abraham, two Hungarian psychoanalysts who sought to understand how secrets skip a generation and are transmitted from the first to the third generation. \u201cWhat haunts are not the dead,\u201d they concluded, \u201cbut the gaps left within us by the secrets of others.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e883076a7619bc04e9c9c9cfe6ec47a455f5308f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e883076a7619bc04e9c9c9cfe6ec47a455f5308f/230_101_1697_1018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henri, Sonia (his finacee), Sara, Chaya and Jacques.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henri, Sonia (his finacee), Sara, Chaya and Jacques.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hadley Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writer sets out to know who they are, and who she is. The reader is intrigued by the tales because they offer a way better to understand the gaps in their own life. There is also the question: what would I have done in times of brutal upheaval? Give me a grandparent, it might be said, and I will tell you about the grandchild.</p> <p>Sala was part of the generation of <em>Ostjuden</em> \u2013 eastern Jews \u2013 who headed west following the upheavals of the first world war, including pogroms against the Jews. In the 1920s the four Glahs siblings headed to Paris, where they lived happily under the name Glass. The life of each followed a different path.

      "bodyText": "Hadley Freeman\u2019s captivating family memoir inscribes itself in the pantheon of family stories that connect the grandchild to the generation of the grandparents. From the Americas (I think of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s Living to Tell the Tale) to Africa (Aida Edemariam\u2019s beautiful The Wife\u2019s Tale), in an era of renewed identity politics, many wish to engage with the inter-generational connections that skip the parents. Freeman\u2019s focus \u2013 initiated by finding a burnished red shoebox stuffed with papers and secrets \u2013 was originally on her father\u2019s mother, born as Sala Glahs in 1910 in Chrzanow, a small town of the Austro-Hungarian empire, not so far from Krak\u00f3w. She was one of four siblings, and the intertwining of the life of Sala \u2013 who later became Sara \u2013 with that of her three older brothers encouraged Freeman to broaden her attention. The challenge for the structure and direction of a book such as this is obvious: family lives, as well as the discovery of the details, tend not to be linear. \u201cWhen I became an adult, I suddenly couldn\u2019t stop thinking of them,\u201d Freeman, a, Guardian journalist, explains. Many will know that feeling, the persistence of regret, of not having had a certain conversation, or asked a particular question. There is a singular form of communication that exists between grandchild and grandparent, not necessarily in a spoken form. It was finely explored by Maria Torok and Nicolas Abraham, two Hungarian psychoanalysts who sought to understand how secrets skip a generation and are transmitted from the first to the third generation. \u201cWhat haunts are not the dead,\u201d they concluded, \u201cbut the gaps left within us by the secrets of others.\u201d The writer sets out to know who they are, and who she is. The reader is intrigued by the tales because they offer a way better to understand the gaps in their own life. There is also the question: what would I have done in times of brutal upheaval? Give me a grandparent, it might be said, and I will tell you about the grandchild. Sala was part of the generation of Ostjuden \u2013 eastern Jews \u2013 who headed west following the upheavals of the first world war, including pogroms against the Jews. In the 1920s the four Glahs siblings headed to Paris, where they lived happily under the name Glass. The life of each followed a different path. Jehuda Henoch became Jules Henri Glass, married a woman with roots in Lw\u00f3w, invented the Omniphot microfilming machine, set up his own company and became a successful businessman. The ill-fated Jakob became Jacques; in May 1940, as the Germans approached Paris, he joined a regiment connected to the Foreign Legion, which happened to be the same one my Lwowian grandfather joined, based in Barcares on a beach in southwest France. He was taken prisoner, but returned to Paris where he dutifully registered as Jewish. The third brother, named Sender, became Alex Maguy, a successful couturier who worked with a young Christian Dior and would, in later life, become a gallery owner who hoped to hang out with Picasso, and then did. Sala became Sara. She met Bill Freiman, an American man of business and left for the US and marriage, which allowed her to escape the horrors that engulfed Europe. But her husband promised more than he delivered and she led, it seems, an emotionally unfulfilled life in a place that never quite felt like home. She lost her \u201ceasy-going\u201d brother Jacques as well as her favourite cousin, Rose, in the Holocaust. Freeman traces the lives of the four siblings with elegance and humanity. She confronts the mysteries of life that cause four individuals with a similar beginning to reach very different endpoints. Is it will, or fate, or chance, or something else? Such questions flow below the surface of the narrative. Occasionally they reach out with brutal force: could it be that death in an extermination camp is the price you pay for being decent and playing by the rules? The sibling who stands out is the one defined by the greatest ambiguities, at once attractive and repellent. Great uncle Alex \u2013 \u201csmall bald and tough like a bullet\u201d \u2013 is recalled for the cabana he kept on the beach at Deauville, who, as his great niece records (with admirable clarity), was \u201csuspected of collaboration\u201d during the war, and of having associated with known collaborators after the war. Serge Lifar, for example, a former director of the Paris Opera Ballet, commissioned Alex to make costumes in the postwar years and so offered him a financial lifeline. In that period, Alex records in a personal reminiscence, \u201cmy real concern was to get my couture business relaunched\u201d. This is delicate material, the dark side of a beloved family member.

Luckily, we\u2019ve drawn up a detailed timetable in order for you to maximise your celebration ...</p> <h2>06:00 \u2013 Time to wake up</h2> <p>Your alarm today is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbLC7F2ELww\">I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance) by Tina Charles</a>, which Radio 1 named as the No 1 single on 29 February 1976. The only other song ever to reach No 1 on a Leap Day is a rerelease of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqIq4B1rgl4\">Mysterious Girl by Peter Andre</a>, and frankly you\u2019re better than that.</p> <h2>07:00 \u2013 Ja Rule celebration hour</h2> <p>One of very few contemporary recording artists to have a birthday on 29 February, Ja Rule is literally the man of the hour. Listen to his hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tcDXJfAFVw\">Always on Time</a>! Watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyNYoAd02Uo\">the trailer to his 2002 action film Half Past Dead</a>! Get involved in a fraudulent, influencer-baiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/19/ja-rule-fyre-festival-lawsuit\">music festival</a>! He deserves this!</p> <h2>10:00 \u2013 Propose!</h2> <p>Remember: if you are a woman, it is tradition to propose to your boyfriend today, and only today. If you don\u2019t have a boyfriend, propose to anyone. If you\u2019re not a woman, then make a woman propose to you. Tradition dictates it!</p> <h2>11:00 \u2013 Listen to a song called Leap Day</h2> <p>I\u2019ve checked Spotify, and some exist. One, by <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/65MIAyAf0sLrGD5oBrv3yV\">Terry v Tori</a>, is all indie and jangly. One, by the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2QO6bawCbYUzeNh4QgpyzR?highlight=spotify:track:2kvUZzQqUU6uUdWmCXPKKH\">Mystic Cowboys</a>, is acoustic and depressing. One, by <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6X7sFrop9JgQHcqer3u9Lp\">Cam Buma Project</a>, is smooth jazz. One, by <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/00Uh07J0j8jtZFmsaao10N\">Jack Thought</a>, sounds as if it came from a garden centre\u2019s ambient CD collection. They\u2019re all terrible, so go nuts.</p> <h2>12:00 \u2013 Hattie McDaniel celebration hour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"739e6fdae302bd03e140d61576c3bd17469f4eea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/739e6fdae302bd03e140d61576c3bd17469f4eea/0_0_4894_2937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hattie McDaniel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hat\u2019s off...

Why not watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/21/gone-with-the-wind-review\">Gone With the Wind</a> and then stand around doing nothing for 51 years until Whoopi Goldberg becomes the second African American woman to win an acting Oscar?</p> <h2>14:00 \u2013 Movie time</h2> <p>Only a handful of movies are set on 29 February, so you have a choice. Romantic comedy fans can watch the Amy Adams romcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/25/leap-year-film-review\">Leap Year</a>. Horror fans, you can watch the South Korean haunted-tollbooth film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0927575/\">February 29</a>. All other people, you\u2019re out of luck.</p> <h2>16:00 \u2013 La Bougie du Sapeur</h2> <p>If today is 29 February, that means it must be time to rush out and buy the new issue of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Bougie_du_Sapeur\">La Bougie du Sapeur</a> (The Soldier\u2019s Candle), the French satirical newspaper that only publishes once every four years. This is only its 11th issue, so well done for being such an early adopter.</p> <h2>18:00 \u2013 Lie about an event of supreme historical importance</h2> <p>Just three Leap Days ago, Misha Defonseca finally admitted that her 1997 memoir Misha: A M\u00e9moire of the Holocaust Years \u2013 in which she claimed to have spent the duration of the Holocaust living with wolves in the forest \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/12/author-fake-holocaust-memoir-to-return-22m\">was all made up</a>. Commemorate this betrayal of trust by making up some rubbish about where you were during a time of international crisis. Maybe you were a passenger on the Titanic. Maybe Pearl Harbor interrupted your lunch. It\u2019s your choice entirely!</p> <h2>20:00 \u2013 30 Rock</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc2f2ff45baae867aa2e4d9336ecdca04d70c0bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc2f2ff45baae867aa2e4d9336ecdca04d70c0bc/69_351_2701_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack McBrayer as Kenneth Parcell as Leap Day William.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One giant leap...

It tells the story of Leap Day William, who emerges every four years from the Mariana Trench to trade children\u2019s tears for candy. It is perfect.</p> <h2>22:00 \u2013 Move out</h2> <p>Don\u2019t forget, today is the birthday of U-Haul founder <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Shoen\">Leonard Shoen</a>. As such, you are required to pack all your worldly goods into a trailer and leave your house for ever. Tradition dictates it!</p> <h2>23:00 \u2013 Propose!</h2> <p>Don\u2019t forget, time is running out. If you\u2019re a woman and you haven\u2019t proposed within the hour, you\u2019ll remain sad and unmarried until at least 2024, by which time nuclear war might have killed most of the male population. Quickly! It\u2019s your last chance!</p> <h2>00:00 \u2013 Relax</h2> <p>Congratulations: you have successfully made it through yet another Leap Day.

      "body": "<p>Giving up your job to look after a family member or friend may not be something you\u2019ve given much thought to, but two in three UK adults can expect to become an unpaid carer during their lifetime, according to <a href=\"https://www.carersuk.org/\" title=\"\">Carers UK</a>.</p> <p>About 600 people a day quit work to look after for someone who is older, disabled or seriously ill, and the emotional and financial impact on these individuals can be huge.</p> <p>While research suggests unpaid carers <a href=\"https://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/news/unpaid-carers-save-the-uk-132-billion-a-year-the-cost-of-a-second-nhs\" title=\"\">save the UK economy </a><a href=\"https://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/news/unpaid-carers-save-the-uk-132-billion-a-year-the-cost-of-a-second-nhs\" title=\"\">about \u00a3132bn a year</a>, the main carer\u2019s benefit, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance\" title=\"\">carer\u2019s allowance</a>, is just \u00a366.15 a week if you care for someone for at least 35 hours a week.</p> <p>Four carers tell us how they make ends meet.</p> <p><strong>Mary Adeson, 33, is an auditor and lives in London. She has helped care for her mother, Caroline, 57, who has schizophrenia, with her two sisters</strong><strong> since she was a teenager</strong></p> <p>\u201cFrom a young age, my twin sister, Hannah, and my sister Heide, 27, and I have looked after my mum. She\u2019d often feel really depressed. We didn\u2019t realise she had a mental health disorder until she was repeatedly sectioned after a number of incidents over the years. We didn\u2019t want to put additional pressure on her, so we learned to manage ourselves. We became very self-sufficient.</p> <p>By the time I was in year 11, I had part-time jobs. Hannah and I had to go to work as mum wasn\u2019t able to. We couldn\u2019t depend on her to pay the bills, and letters would pile up. Hannah and I just split the costs. When I was at college I worked evenings and weekends and then over the holidays. I always worked while studying.</p> <p>Now I work full-time as an auditor and still live at home with my mum and Heide. We both handle all the finances. While my mum receives disability allowance, we don\u2019t claim for carer\u2019s allowance. With my salary, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s necessary.</p> <p>Do I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on any luxuries? For a long time now I\u2019ve always just worked out what my budget is. I know how much I\u2019ve got and what my expenses are, so nothing comes as a surprise. I felt more of an impact when I was working during school, college and university. It was difficult paying for accommodation as well as dealing with my financial responsibilities at home. But I just had to find a way to make it work.</p> <p>I do have to watch my spending, and I\u2019m quite mindful about the future. I worry about what will happen if mum gets worse and we need to pay for her to go into a home. I\u2019m always thinking about how to make my money work harder: I invest in stocks and shares and art, and I have a pension. I don\u2019t have the luxury not to think about it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>John Stefanyszyn, 64, lives in Sheffield and looks after his wife, Joanna, 46, and his niece, Lauren, 20, who both have ME</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e7192302ce9eca08ce09e6243fdff787417e2ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e7192302ce9eca08ce09e6243fdff787417e2ee/80_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Stefanyszyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Stefanyszyn: \u2018Without my pension I\u2019d be absolutely screwed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stefanyszyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy wife has had ME since she was 14, but in the past year she\u2019s also suffered from pudendal neuralgia. She\u2019s in constant pain and has to spend a lot of time in bed. While a nerve-block injection last June improved her condition slightly, the past year has been very dark.</p> <p>I\u2019m between a rock and a hard place trying to survive. I stopped working as an NVQ enroller about three years ago to care for my wife. I receive a carer\u2019s allowance of just \u00a366.15 a week. Fortunately, I receive a private pension of \u00a3400 a month from my 16 years working in the civil service and as an Investors in People manager. Without that, I\u2019d be destitute.</p> <p>My wife receives employment support and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pip\" title=\"\">personal independence payment</a> (Pip) of about \u00a3700-\u00a3800 a month. But with outgoings such as mortgage, insurance, car and groceries, we struggle every month. We have to sit down and look at what goes in and out.</p> <p>A year ago, I thought about redecorating downstairs, but now we\u2019re struggling to get that done because of the cost. Fortunately the Sheffield Carers Trust managed to sort out a holiday for us to a B&amp;B in Scarborough in October. But otherwise there\u2019s no way you can pay for holidays and sustain your life. Without my pension we\u2019d be absolutely screwed \u2013 I don\u2019t know how we could afford anything. I try to stay on top of things but it\u2019s difficult. For the past three years I\u2019ve also looked after my niece. She\u2019s in her own flat, and carers go to visit, but I look after her advocacy and fight for her rights.</p> <p>I spend half my time worrying about money and the other half battling for basics and being an advocate. It\u2019s a constant fight for resources across the board, and it takes time, energy and capability. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to just give up and let injustice walk over you.</p> <p>I do worry for the future. If anything happens to me, who will look after my wife and niece? You do go through some bad moods, thinking you are better off dead. You don\u2019t choose this life. It\u2019s not fun, it\u2019s just basic survival.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Helen, 48, lives in Salisbury and cares for her daughter, Maja, 21, who has Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, and has specialist learning and physical support needs</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0de3a8203431c6b7af11b37e89d2f6978efad5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0de3a8203431c6b7af11b37e89d2f6978efad5/0_513_1987_1192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen, a carer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen: \u2018Waiting five weeks for universal credit to come through has left me in debt.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMaja was born with Kleefstra syndrome, which means she has floppy joints and isn\u2019t so stable. She didn\u2019t start walking or talking until she was eight. She functions like a four- to seven-year-old, depending on the activity. She can write and has a good vocabulary. She\u2019s really sociable but she\u2019s prone to low moods and mental health problems.</p> <p>Maja attends a specialist college on Monday to Friday, 9am to 3pm. We live on benefits as it\u2019s difficult to find a job because of the holidays. Last summer Maja had eight weeks off, then there\u2019s Christmas holidays and so on. An employer that flexible just doesn\u2019t exist. I always try to keep an eye out for a job. I receive income support of \u00a387.60 every two weeks and a carer\u2019s allowance of \u00a366.15 every week. Maja receives personal independence payment of \u00a3350.60 and \u00a3588 in universal credit every month.</p> <p>Waiting five weeks for her universal credit to come through left me in debt. I\u2019ve a \u00a3500 overdraft now. I don\u2019t seem to be able to get out of it. I\u2019m recently married but my husband doesn\u2019t live with me, so I\u2019m financially in control. I pay the bills, but he does help out because he feels like he should but, at the same time, he has property elsewhere and has bills to pay. It\u2019s difficult to get a break. I receive income for a carer to come in for three hours a week.</p> <p>When Maja was 18, I received 43 nights of care per year, and she would go to a respite centre in Salisbury, which she loved. This was taken away in July. Maja misses it terribly. I miss it too. An overnight break is very important for us both.</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful that I live in the UK and that we have a benefits system at all. However, the problem is that if you\u2019re a carer like me, my daughter\u2019s condition isn\u2019t going to change. If it does, it will only get worse. What I mean is, there is no cure for my daughter \u2013 this is a permanent situation. So we live on benefits.</p> <p>I put money aside for Maja\u2019s pocket money and her needs, clubs, activities and special holidays, but we can\u2019t afford to replace old clothes, shoes or broken furniture, electrical appliances and to generally maintain and upkeep our place. My choice has always been: do I give my daughter a myriad of opportunities and experiences, or use the money to maintain my home and garden better?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Syreeta Challinger, 38, founder of a lifestyle store</strong><strong>, lives in Frome, Somerset, and cares for her husband Rob, 42, who is paralysed on his right side and has aphasia and epilepsy </strong><strong>after </strong><strong>having a brain haemorrhage and stroke </strong><strong>in 2014</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05e7343da56bae6a16bbd5899ac65b3d737130c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e7343da56bae6a16bbd5899ac65b3d737130c6/0_14_3859_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syreeta Challinger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syreeta Challinger: \u2018I\u2019m trying to figure out a solution that works around Rob\u2019s needs.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Gisborne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRob and I had been living and working in Hong Kong for several years when he suffered a brain haemorrhage and stroke while on holiday in Sydney. It resulted in Rob losing his speech and requiring 24-hour care. As we hadn\u2019t been recently residing in the UK, we were unable to claim any benefits for the first two years, and we moved in with Rob\u2019s parents in Lincoln.</p> <p>I managed to keep my job and work remotely, but it meant commuting to Hong Kong every three to four weeks. Commuting to another continent is not good for anyone, never mind with what we were going through. I ended up quitting to become a full-time carer.</p> <p>Over the years I\u2019ve applied for so many jobs, but once you tell employers your circumstances and that you potentially require flexible working, you\u2019re not such a suitable candidate any more. I did work part-time in a local shop for \u00a38 an hour, but having worked in high-end roles before meant I was probably too can-do for the job.</p> <p>At the moment, Rob receives Pip of \u00a3350 a month, and I receive carer\u2019s allowance of \u00a366 a week. What are you supposed to buy with \u00a366 a week? It hardly covers a food shop. In the summer we moved from Lincoln to Frome to be closer to friends. We\u2019re renting a bungalow, which is doable through financial support from family members and savings from the good jobs we had in Hong Kong. However, we\u2019re literally on zero now.</p> <p>The focus this year has been figuring out how to get back to supporting the three of us \u2013 our son, Grayson, was born in the summer. Rob doesn\u2019t receive <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance\" title=\"\">employment and support allowance</a> any more, as I\u2019m attempting to work. A job coach at the Department for Work and Pensions advised that I would be financially better off if I didn\u2019t work, but I\u2019m just 38 \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be staring at four walls every day.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to figure out a solution that works around Rob\u2019s needs. I\u2019m excited but also extremely scared about how we\u2019re going to make this work, but I have hope \u2013 now Rob doesn\u2019t need 24/7 care, his speech is coming back and he communicates through drawings.</p> <p>In 2016 I launched Moments of Sense and Style, a lifestyle store selling products that align with our story and offering a message of courage, strength and hope. I spend 10 hours a week on it but I\u2019d love to market it more. For the future, I want to get on top of the bills and then have a little fun again and maybe take a holiday. Things have been really stripped back for us since the incident.\u201d</p> <h2>Economic timebomb</h2> <p>The proposed closure of UK borders to low-skilled workers after Brexit has caused carers to be dragged into the discussion.</p> <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, has been heavily criticised in some quarters for suggesting employers could plug the gap with some of the 8 million Britons between the ages of 16 and 64 classed as economically inactive \u2013 a cohort that includes those with caring responsibilities, long-term sick and retired people, and students.</p> <p>Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK, says caring for a loved one round the clock can mean a real struggle to make ends meet. \u201cMany carers have to manage on a reduced income, and the majority spend that limited income or savings on the cost of care, specialist equipment or products \u2013 reducing their financial resilience.</p> <p>\u201cOur research shows that financial hardship worsens for carers the longer they are caring, with double the proportion of carers in debt after 15 years of caring, compared with those in their first year.

      "bodyText": "Giving up your job to look after a family member or friend may not be something you\u2019ve given much thought to, but two in three UK adults can expect to become an unpaid carer during their lifetime, according to Carers UK. About 600 people a day quit work to look after for someone who is older, disabled or seriously ill, and the emotional and financial impact on these individuals can be huge. While research suggests unpaid carers save the UK economy about \u00a3132bn a year, the main carer\u2019s benefit, carer\u2019s allowance, is just \u00a366.15 a week if you care for someone for at least 35 hours a week. Four carers tell us how they make ends meet. Mary Adeson, 33, is an auditor and lives in London. She has helped care for her mother, Caroline, 57, who has schizophrenia, with her two sisters since she was a teenager \u201cFrom a young age, my twin sister, Hannah, and my sister Heide, 27, and I have looked after my mum. She\u2019d often feel really depressed. We didn\u2019t realise she had a mental health disorder until she was repeatedly sectioned after a number of incidents over the years. We didn\u2019t want to put additional pressure on her, so we learned to manage ourselves. We became very self-sufficient. By the time I was in year 11, I had part-time jobs. Hannah and I had to go to work as mum wasn\u2019t able to. We couldn\u2019t depend on her to pay the bills, and letters would pile up. Hannah and I just split the costs. When I was at college I worked evenings and weekends and then over the holidays. I always worked while studying. Now I work full-time as an auditor and still live at home with my mum and Heide. We both handle all the finances. While my mum receives disability allowance, we don\u2019t claim for carer\u2019s allowance. With my salary, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s necessary. Do I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on any luxuries? For a long time now I\u2019ve always just worked out what my budget is. I know how much I\u2019ve got and what my expenses are, so nothing comes as a surprise. I felt more of an impact when I was working during school, college and university. It was difficult paying for accommodation as well as dealing with my financial responsibilities at home. But I just had to find a way to make it work. I do have to watch my spending, and I\u2019m quite mindful about the future. I worry about what will happen if mum gets worse and we need to pay for her to go into a home. I\u2019m always thinking about how to make my money work harder: I invest in stocks and shares and art, and I have a pension. I don\u2019t have the luxury not to think about it.\u201d John Stefanyszyn, 64, lives in Sheffield and looks after his wife, Joanna, 46, and his niece, Lauren, 20, who both have ME \u201cMy wife has had ME since she was 14, but in the past year she\u2019s also suffered from pudendal neuralgia. She\u2019s in constant pain and has to spend a lot of time in bed. While a nerve-block injection last June improved her condition slightly, the past year has been very dark. I\u2019m between a rock and a hard place trying to survive. I stopped working as an NVQ enroller about three years ago to care for my wife. I receive a carer\u2019s allowance of just \u00a366.15 a week. Fortunately, I receive a private pension of \u00a3400 a month from my 16 years working in the civil service and as an Investors in People manager. Without that, I\u2019d be destitute. My wife receives employment support and personal independence payment (Pip) of about \u00a3700-\u00a3800 a month. But with outgoings such as mortgage, insurance, car and groceries, we struggle every month. We have to sit down and look at what goes in and out. A year ago, I thought about redecorating downstairs, but now we\u2019re struggling to get that done because of the cost. Fortunately the Sheffield Carers Trust managed to sort out a holiday for us to a B&amp;B in Scarborough in October. But otherwise there\u2019s no way you can pay for holidays and sustain your life. Without my pension we\u2019d be absolutely screwed \u2013 I don\u2019t know how we could afford anything. I try to stay on top of things but it\u2019s difficult. For the past three years I\u2019ve also looked after my niece. She\u2019s in her own flat, and carers go to visit, but I look after her advocacy and fight for her rights. I spend half my time worrying about money and the other half battling for basics and being an advocate. It\u2019s a constant fight for resources across the board, and it takes time, energy and capability. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to just give up and let injustice walk over you. I do worry for the future. If anything happens to me, who will look after my wife and niece? You do go through some bad moods, thinking you are better off dead. You don\u2019t choose this life. It\u2019s not fun, it\u2019s just basic survival.\u201d Helen, 48, lives in Salisbury and cares for her daughter, Maja, 21, who has Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, and has specialist learning and physical support needs \u201cMaja was born with Kleefstra syndrome, which means she has floppy joints and isn\u2019t so stable. She didn\u2019t start walking or talking until she was eight. She functions like a four- to seven-year-old, depending on the activity. She can write and has a good vocabulary. She\u2019s really sociable but she\u2019s prone to low moods and mental health problems. Maja attends a specialist college on Monday to Friday, 9am to 3pm. We live on benefits as it\u2019s difficult to find a job because of the holidays. Last summer Maja had eight weeks off, then there\u2019s Christmas holidays and so on. An employer that flexible just doesn\u2019t exist. I always try to keep an eye out for a job. I receive income support of \u00a387.60 every two weeks and a carer\u2019s allowance of \u00a366.15 every week. Maja receives personal independence payment of \u00a3350.60 and \u00a3588 in universal credit every month. Waiting five weeks for her universal credit to come through left me in debt. I\u2019ve a \u00a3500 overdraft now. I don\u2019t seem to be able to get out of it. I\u2019m recently married but my husband doesn\u2019t live with me, so I\u2019m financially in control. I pay the bills, but he does help out because he feels like he should but, at the same time, he has property elsewhere and has bills to pay. It\u2019s difficult to get a break. I receive income for a carer to come in for three hours a week. When Maja was 18, I received 43 nights of care per year, and she would go to a respite centre in Salisbury, which she loved. This was taken away in July. Maja misses it terribly. I miss it too. An overnight break is very important for us both. I\u2019m grateful that I live in the UK and that we have a benefits system at all. However, the problem is that if you\u2019re a carer like me, my daughter\u2019s condition isn\u2019t going to change. If it does, it will only get worse. What I mean is, there is no cure for my daughter \u2013 this is a permanent situation. So we live on benefits. I put money aside for Maja\u2019s pocket money and her needs, clubs, activities and special holidays, but we can\u2019t afford to replace old clothes, shoes or broken furniture, electrical appliances and to generally maintain and upkeep our place. My choice has always been: do I give my daughter a myriad of opportunities and experiences, or use the money to maintain my home and garden better?\u201d Syreeta Challinger, 38, founder of a lifestyle store, lives in Frome, Somerset, and cares for her husband Rob, 42, who is paralysed on his right side and has aphasia and epilepsy after having a brain haemorrhage and stroke in 2014 \u201cRob and I had been living and working in Hong Kong for several years when he suffered a brain haemorrhage and stroke while on holiday in Sydney. It resulted in Rob losing his speech and requiring 24-hour care. As we hadn\u2019t been recently residing in the UK, we were unable to claim any benefits for the first two years, and we moved in with Rob\u2019s parents in Lincoln. I managed to keep my job and work remotely, but it meant commuting to Hong Kong every three to four weeks. Commuting to another continent is not good for anyone, never mind with what we were going through. I ended up quitting to become a full-time carer. Over the years I\u2019ve applied for so many jobs, but once you tell employers your circumstances and that you potentially require flexible working, you\u2019re not such a suitable candidate any more. I did work part-time in a local shop for \u00a38 an hour, but having worked in high-end roles before meant I was probably too can-do for the job. At the moment, Rob receives Pip of \u00a3350 a month, and I receive carer\u2019s allowance of \u00a366 a week. What are you supposed to buy with \u00a366 a week? It hardly covers a food shop. In the summer we moved from Lincoln to Frome to be closer to friends. We\u2019re renting a bungalow, which is doable through financial support from family members and savings from the good jobs we had in Hong Kong. However, we\u2019re literally on zero now. The focus this year has been figuring out how to get back to supporting the three of us \u2013 our son, Grayson, was born in the summer. Rob doesn\u2019t receive employment and support allowance any more, as I\u2019m attempting to work. A job coach at the Department for Work and Pensions advised that I would be financially better off if I didn\u2019t work, but I\u2019m just 38 \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be staring at four walls every day. I\u2019m trying to figure out a solution that works around Rob\u2019s needs. I\u2019m excited but also extremely scared about how we\u2019re going to make this work, but I have hope \u2013 now Rob doesn\u2019t need 24/7 care, his speech is coming back and he communicates through drawings. In 2016 I launched Moments of Sense and Style, a lifestyle store selling products that align with our story and offering a message of courage, strength and hope. I spend 10 hours a week on it but I\u2019d love to market it more. For the future, I want to get on top of the bills and then have a little fun again and maybe take a holiday. Things have been really stripped back for us since the incident.\u201d Economic timebomb The proposed closure of UK borders to low-skilled workers after Brexit has caused carers to be dragged into the discussion. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has been heavily criticised in some quarters for suggesting employers could plug the gap with some of the 8 million Britons between the ages of 16 and 64 classed as economically inactive \u2013 a cohort that includes those with caring responsibilities, long-term sick and retired people, and students. Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK, says caring for a loved one round the clock can mean a real struggle to make ends meet. \u201cMany carers have to manage on a reduced income, and the majority spend that limited income or savings on the cost of care, specialist equipment or products \u2013 reducing their financial resilience. \u201cOur research shows that financial hardship worsens for carers the longer they are caring, with double the proportion of carers in debt after 15 years of caring, compared with those in their first year. More than half of unpaid carers save nothing for retirement. This has huge implications for carers and the economy in the long term, with many left drained of money in later life and in need of support from the state and our social care system \u2013 which in its current form is already creaking.\u201d Carers UK wants the government to increase the carer\u2019s allowance and allow unpaid carers to earn more and keep their benefit. \u201cWe must see unpaid carers put at the heart of a reformed and sustainable adult social care system,\u201d says Walker.",

In 2017, Virginia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/07/virginia-governor-race-results-ralph-northam\">elected a Democratic governor</a>, Ralph Northam, in the first major test of the depth of antipathy to Trump in suburban America. In 2018, Virginia Democrats flipped three congressional seats critical to the party\u2019s takeover of the US House. And in 2019, Democrats gained control of both chambers of the state legislature for the first time in a generation.</p> \n<p>A tradition-bound, business-friendly southern state isn\u2019t an obvious fit for a democratic socialist senator from Vermont.

      "bodyText": "On a crisp weekday afternoon before the Virginia primary on Super Tuesday, thousands of people turned out to see the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speak in the state\u2019s capital, Richmond. Four years ago, Democratic voters in the commonwealth delivered a resounding rebuke of the Vermont senator\u2019s promise for political revolution. But there are signs that this year might be different. After strong showings in the early primary voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Sanders stood before an adoring crowdat the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center, a shock of white hair against a sea of blue placards bearing his name, as the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Interest in the rally was so overwhelming that the campaign relocated to a larger venue. \u201cThat is getting the establishment very, very nervous,\u201d he said, gleefully conjuring images of a cabal of Democrats desperately searching for a way to slow his march. \u201cThey\u2019re staying up day and night trying to figure out how to stop us. And when they see turnout like this, they get even more nervous.\u201d Sanders wasn\u2019t exaggerating. That morning, the New York Times published a report based on interviews with dozens of Democratic Party officials who said they would attempt to block his nomination at the party\u2019s convention in July if Sanders arrived with the most delegates but fell short of a majority needed to win the nomination outright. With so much uncertainty around the mechanics \u2013 and the mathematics \u2013 of the nomination process, Sanders is dedicating precious time to competing for Virginia\u2019s 99 delegates before Tuesday\u2019s slate of primary contests, when 16 states and US territories will have their say on which of the eight major remaining candidates should take on Donald Trump in the November election. On Saturday, as South Carolina holds its primary, Sanders will return for events in northern Virginia, where he will appear with the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and Virginia Beach. Powered by moderate, suburban voters, Virginia has become increasingly Democratic since the election of Trump. In 2017, Virginia elected a Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, in the first major test of the depth of antipathy to Trump in suburban America. In 2018, Virginia Democrats flipped three congressional seats critical to the party\u2019s takeover of the US House. And in 2019, Democrats gained control of both chambers of the state legislature for the first time in a generation. A tradition-bound, business-friendly southern state isn\u2019t an obvious fit for a democratic socialist senator from Vermont. In the 2017 Democratic gubernatorial primary, Northam handily beat the former congressman Tom Perriello, who ran as a progressive with Sanders\u2019s endorsement. But a Monmouth University poll from last week showed Sanders neck-and-neck with Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who will appear on the ballot for the first time on Tuesday after foregoing the early-state contests. Virginia is a top target for Bloomberg, who launched his campaign in Norfolk and has blanketed the state with millions of dollars worth of political advertisements. \u201cMike Bloomberg has visited Virginia more than any other Super Tuesday state because of the importance our Commonwealth has in our overall strategy,\u201d said Melissa Gallahan, Bloomberg\u2019s 2020 Virginia state director. \u201cWith more than 80 staffers on the ground, seven offices open across the Commonwealth, and an unmatched field program, our campaign has been putting in the work to reach out to every voter in Virginia.\u201d \u201cIn some ways you could say Virginia is a battle for the soul of the Democratic party,\u201d said Bill Neidhardt, Sanders\u2019s Virginia state director, who previously served as the campaign\u2019s deputy state director in Iowa. \u201cBloomberg is trying to buy this election by basically flooding the state with as much money as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had hundreds, if not thousands, of volunteers who have been organizing here relentlessly for months \u2026 These two distinct models are about as far apart as it can get in the Democratic party. Which one can win here?\u201d But the race is not a neat showdown between Sanders and Bloomberg. The former vice-president Joe Biden is also a major force in the state. On Friday, he was endorsed by the Virginia senator Tim Kaine and he will hold a rally in Norfolk on Sunday. A new poll on Friday showed Biden regaining momentum as Sanders slipped to second, underscoring the uncertainty of the primary. In the survey by Christopher Newport University\u2019s Wason Center for Public Policy, 22% of Democratic voters said they preferred Biden compared with 17% who chose Sanders. Bloomberg trailed in third place with 13%. A strong showing in South Carolina on Saturday could boost Biden\u2019s standing further, particularly with African American voters. The survey also reflected the unease many Virginia Democrats feel about Sanders, averse to his populist policies or worrying that they will repel independent and moderate Republicans in crucial swing states in the general election on 3 November. Of the 18% of respondents who said they were uncertain or would definitely not support the party\u2019s nominee if their candidate did not win, two-thirds said they were concerned the nominee might be \u201ctoo liberal\u201d. This small slice of the Democratic electorate will be decisive in determining not only if the party carries Virginia in November but if congresswomen like Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, who flipped Republican-held seats in 2018, are re-elected in November, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. \u201cDemocrats cannot assume anything about Virginia,\u201d Sabato cautioned, adding: \u201cThe candidate matters.\u201d Already, Republican groups are targeting the once deeply conservative Virginia districts held by Luria, Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton in an effort to tie the freshman Democrats to Sanders and other leftwing members of the party such as the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Luria endorsed Biden last month, along with other freshman moderates who have raised concerns about the down-ballot risk of nominating Sanders. In a statement, she said the former vice-president would \u201cdefeat Donald Trump and win in tough districts like mine\u201d. More Virginia Democrats are likely to take sides in the final days before the primary. But, as has happened in other contests, the establishment is fractured among the many moderates still in the race, leaving an opening for Sanders to do well in a state that should be fertile ground for his rivals. In Virginia, voters of either party can cast ballots in the primary and there are indications that there could be more Republicans who participate this year than in 2016. Sanders, an independent senator, and Bloomberg, who was elected mayor of New York as a Republican and an independent, both see an opportunity to appeal to a crossover of disaffected voters. The Sanders campaign is targeting the state\u2019s growing immigrant communities, with an emphasis on turning out Muslim and Hispanic voters. They are also hoping to tap into the populist, anti-establishment streak that runs through the Appalachian corner of the state. Bloomberg has the largest staff in the state with seven offices and 80 members of staff on the ground. In visits, Bloomberg has presented himself to Virginia as a political pragmatist whose prolific spending on candidates in 2018 and 2019 played a role in Democratic victories across the state. Virginia unlocks only a fraction of the more than 1,300 pledged delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday. But in the rare event that no candidate wins the nomination outright, every delegate could matter. The Virginia delegate Lee Carter, a former marine who defeated the Republican House majority whip to win his seat in 2017 and identifies as a Democratic socialist, believes Sanders has every reason to be optimistic about his standing in the state. \u201cIf people have the choice between a halfway Republican and a whole Republican, they\u2019re going to pick the whole Republican,\u201d Carter said, as the rally emptied on Thursday. \u201cBut if you give them the choice between a Republican who is unabashedly fighting for corporate interests and a Democrat like Bernie Sanders who is unabashedly fighting for the people\u2019s interest, the people are going to show up to vote.\u201d",

She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. \u201cWorking out what kind of cook you are is also useful,\u201d says Jones, \u201cthen reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you\u2019re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"237646884df403b7fe60c1668acab38a9083a972\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237646884df403b7fe60c1668acab38a9083a972/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seeds cut-out inside green-rimmed circle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Buy half your food </strong><strong>locally</strong><br>The shorter the food chain, the less waste created before it reaches your kitchen. Hunter subscribes to buying 50% of food grown within 30 miles of where you live. \u201cIt\u2019s an achievable figure,\u201d he says, especially when producers, such as <a href=\"https://hodmedods.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hodmedod\u2019s</a> in Suffolk, are reviving homegrown pulses including British lentils, quinoa, carlin peas and fava beans (which Hunter ferments to turn into miso and soy sauce). The nutritional value of fruit and veg lasts for only a short time, adds Gyngell, so how far your food has travelled matters.</p> <p><strong>Pick your own</strong><br>\u201cForaging solves many problems,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cYou\u2019re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.\u201d Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter\u2019s, nettles (\u201cThey\u2019re so underrated\u201d). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups; wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating \u2013 check <a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">woodlandtrust.org</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wildfooduk.com/\" title=\"\">wildfooduk.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Switch your flours</strong><br>Crops can\u2019t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. \u201cSpelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,\u201d says Hunter. \u201cEating rye supports the farmers\u2019 rotation; I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Befriend a butcher</strong><br>\u201cThere is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,\u201d says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to \u201chug\u201d your butcher: \u201cSupport them and ask questions \u2013 they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.\u201d Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but \u201crespecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part\u201d. </p> <p><strong>Compost on the go</strong><br>Compost isn\u2019t just for the garden \u2013 think about reducing your food waste when you\u2019re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, \u00a312.99) is out in June. \u201cA reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps \u2013 take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Plan ahead</strong><br>Make the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. \u201cBlitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round; make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves; use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,\u201d says Hunter.</p> <p><strong>Minimise packaging</strong><br>Look for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. \u201cIf you are buying packaged food,\u201d says Miles, \u201clook at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option \u2013 oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.\u201d The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners; so if you can\u2019t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can.<br></p> <h2>All green on the home front</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1760f7e288f5f104d4c235d10a0b21f783f0e4f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1760f7e288f5f104d4c235d10a0b21f783f0e4f2/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Washing-up liquid bottle cut-out inside green-rimmed circle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Reduce your washing</strong><br>Erin Rhoads\u2019 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/waste-not-everyday-9781743795552.html\" title=\"\">Waste Not Everyday</a> (Hardie Grant Books, \u00a310) points out that \u201cthe majority of the environmental burden caused by fashion happens after we take the clothing home: 82% of the energy a garment will use is in the washing and drying we do each week\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Clean up your kitchen Love your leftovers Look at what basics you\u2019re binning. \u201cChefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that\u2019s not where we need to make changes,\u201d says Feast food writer Anna Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread \u2013 the items we don\u2019t put as much value on.\u201d Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of The Art Of The Larder (Quadrille, \u00a325), and substitute for some of the flour and water in bread dough. Treat \u201cfood waste\u201d as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of 30 Easy Ways To Join The Food Revolution (Pavilion, \u00a314.99). \u201cIt\u2019s easy to turn it into something else; aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise; fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack; cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up; wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.\u201d Use tech for good Apps are taking the fight to food waste. Olio connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared; Too Good To Go enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates; while Farmdrop connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at sharewaste.com. Shop little and often A lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one \u201cbargains\u201d in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. \u201cI\u2019m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,\u201d says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a \u201cscratch menu\u201d using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. \u201cWorking out what kind of cook you are is also useful,\u201d says Jones, \u201cthen reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you\u2019re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.\u201d Buy half your food locally The shorter the food chain, the less waste created before it reaches your kitchen. Hunter subscribes to buying 50% of food grown within 30 miles of where you live. \u201cIt\u2019s an achievable figure,\u201d he says, especially when producers, such as Hodmedod\u2019s in Suffolk, are reviving homegrown pulses including British lentils, quinoa, carlin peas and fava beans (which Hunter ferments to turn into miso and soy sauce). The nutritional value of fruit and veg lasts for only a short time, adds Gyngell, so how far your food has travelled matters. Pick your own \u201cForaging solves many problems,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cYou\u2019re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.\u201d Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter\u2019s, nettles (\u201cThey\u2019re so underrated\u201d). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups; wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating \u2013 check woodlandtrust.org or wildfooduk.com. Switch your flours Crops can\u2019t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. \u201cSpelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,\u201d says Hunter. \u201cEating rye supports the farmers\u2019 rotation; I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.\u201d Befriend a butcher \u201cThere is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,\u201d says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to \u201chug\u201d your butcher: \u201cSupport them and ask questions \u2013 they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.\u201d Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but \u201crespecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part\u201d. Compost on the go Compost isn\u2019t just for the garden \u2013 think about reducing your food waste when you\u2019re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, \u00a312.99) is out in June. \u201cA reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps \u2013 take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.\u201d Plan ahead Make the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. \u201cBlitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round; make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves; use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,\u201d says Hunter. Minimise packaging Look for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. \u201cIf you are buying packaged food,\u201d says Miles, \u201clook at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option \u2013 oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.\u201d The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners; so if you can\u2019t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can. All green on the home front Reduce your washing Erin Rhoads\u2019 Waste Not Everyday (Hardie Grant Books, \u00a310) points out that \u201cthe majority of the environmental burden caused by fashion happens after we take the clothing home: 82% of the energy a garment will use is in the washing and drying we do each week\u201d. Rhoads suggests spot-cleaning, and neutralising smells with a spritz of diluted vodka or lemon juice. Clean with castile By making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. \u201cOf all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,\u201d writes Jen Chillingsworth in Clean Green (Quadrille, \u00a37.55). \u201cOriginating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.\u201d For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth. Go for plastic-free personal care There is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a reusable tampon applicator. \u201cThe reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.\u201d Recycle as much as you can \u201cMost major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can\u2019t be recycled from home,\u201d says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body Wrap. TerraCycle rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has free national recycling programmes and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. Look after your electrical appliances The Restart Project is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. \u201cBy simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.\u201d Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting a directory of commercial repair options in London. (See also repaircafe.org for events in your area.) \u201cIf we don\u2019t have access to spare parts,\u201d says Gunter, \u201cthese appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.\u201d If your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you \u201ccall the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling\u201d. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity Emmaus accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too. Create clean air \u201cYou can never have enough house plants,\u201d says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: \u201cMother-in-law\u2019s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.\u201d According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms; weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas. Change your shower head \u201cInvesting in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,\u201d says Brian Horne at the Energy Saving Trust (EST). They inject air into the water stream, limiting water usage. \u201cA water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household \u00a370 a year on gas for water heating, and a further \u00a3115 on water bills if they have a meter,\u201d says Horne. Opt for green energy suppliers There are \u201cshades of green\u201d when it comes to choosing an energy supplier, says Horne. The EST identified four suppliers who clearly listed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites last year: Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity and Octopus Energy. \u201cBut just because you\u2019re on a green tariff, it doesn\u2019t mean you should stop worrying about how much energy you use,\u201d says Horne. Practise eco-driving Research by the RAC Foundation has found that eco-driving leads to safer, cleaner and more affordable journeys. Regular vehicle maintenance improves fuel efficiency by as much as 10%. Before a long journey, check tyre pressures (tyres underinflated by a quarter can cause a 2% increase in fuel consumption), remove unused roof racks and boxes, and don\u2019t overload the car (every additional 45kg reduces fuel economy by 2%). At less than 40mph, it\u2019s more fuel-efficient to open a window than use air conditioning. Turn off engines for waits of more than one minute (5-8% of fuel is consumed while idling), and avoid sharp acceleration and heavy braking: aggressive driving can significantly raise fuel consumption. Draught-proof your home One of the cheapest, most effective ways to save energy and money at home is to draught-proof windows, doors, letterbox, fireplaces and loft hatches, says Dr Sarah Price, head of building physics at Enhabit, a consultancy specialising in low-energy design. Done professionally, it costs about \u00a3200, or do it yourself with products such as Gap Seal. Buy vintage furniture \u201cReusing furniture is the best thing to do, and so much more fun than buying new,\u201d says Nicola Harding, founder of interior design studio Harding and Read. \u201cSecondhand items come with interesting stories and force you to think creatively, and give you have something far more unique.\u201d To keep mileage down, start at your local auction houses and charity shops (the British Heart Foundation has dedicated home stores and a free collection service), followed by a targeted trawl through Freecycle and Facebook Marketplace. Optimise your white goods According to independent energy comparison service U Switch, the cost of running your fridge and freezer equates to about 7% of your total energy bill (they are one of the few household energy devices that are on all the time). U Switch recommends replacing your fridge and/or freezer if it is over 10 years old. Even if it\u2019s working, the cost of a new model will be made up for in energy savings over the years. Keep your fridge at 5C or less (most are kept at about 7C, which means food will go off sooner) and ensure there is a 10cm gap behind your fridge to let heat flow away easily. Make sure the seal is strong \u2013 if it can\u2019t hold a piece of paper when shut, it could be letting in warm air, making it work harder. Let the garden grow Buy local flowers \u2013 or grow your own About 90% of the flowers sold through UK florists, supermarkets and wholesalers are imported, mainly from the Netherlands, but they are also flown in from countries as far away as Ecuador, Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia. Reduce your floral air miles and find a local supplier through flowersfromthefarm.co.uk, a co-operative of small independent flower growers. Alternatively, grow your own flowers to bring indoors. Gardener Sarah Raven suggests going for \u201cannuals which are cut and come again: pick above a pair of leaves and the plant will spring back and produce more flowers \u2013 and keep on doing so as long as you keep picking\u201d. Sow cosmos, snapdragons, zinnias and rudbeckias on a sunny window ledge in March, pot on and plant out after the last frosts. Encourage bees Honeybees visit only one type of flower in any one foraging trip, says Sarah Wyndham Lewis, author of Planting For Honeybees: The Grower\u2019s Guide To Creating A Buzz. \u201cThis is called \u2018flower fidelity\u2019 and is what makes them such effective pollinators. So plant large clumps or \u2018drifts\u2019 of single species and optimise each of the bees\u2019 trips.\u201d Think swathes of catmint, field scabious and hyssop. \u201cMarch to September are the key months for honeybees \u2013 they will fly whenever the temperature is above 10C, even in winter, so early- and late-flowering plants are especially valuable,\u201d she says. Spend less, propagate more Your own plot is the best garden centre there is: collect seed, learn to take cuttings and divide plants to stock your own backup nursery. Gaps can then be filled with home\u2011propagated stock plants. Increase what does well in your garden to build a healthy community of plants. If you do go shopping, research a plant\u2019s natural habitat to reduce failures. Lock up carbon In The Garden Jungle, Or Gardening To Save The Planet (out in paperback 2 April, Vintage, \u00a39.99), Dave Goulson explains that although many gardeners don\u2019t have room for large trees, \u201cThe basic rule is that the more vegetation you have, the more carbon you are storing.\u201d So the fuller the planting in your garden, the better, even if it verges on overgrown. Don\u2019t be too tidy, either. \u201cLog piles also lock up carbon for as long as it takes them to decay, which can be many years.\u201d Let the grass grow Letting your grass grow longer between cuts not only saves petrol or electricity, and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions, but also encourages more wildlife into your garden. Longer grass is more drought-resistant, too. Try cutting every three or four weeks and let dandelions, daisies and violets bloom in spring, followed by buttercups, clovers and selfheal in summer. Encourage hedgehogs Hedgehogs have a voracious appetite for pests such as caterpillars, slugs and snails. They need easy access in and out of gardens, say Helen Bostock and Sophie Collins, authors of How Can I Help Hedgehogs? (Octopus, \u00a314.99). They recommend that neighbours get together to arrange hedgehog holes between gardens. \u201cThis is simply a hole cut into the bottom of a fence \u2013 it should be around 13cm high and at least as wide, preferably in a sheltered corner.\u201d Reboot your wardrobe Set a bar If a year without buying anything new seems too big a challenge, try a month, or buy only secondhand. Livia Firth, founder of sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, follows the \u201c30 wears rule\u201d: ask, \u201cWill I wear it at least 30 times?\u201d before buying. Find a secondhand that works for you Opting for vintage or secondhand is one of the easiest ways to shop sustainably, but while some fans will extol the virtues of rifling through giant warehouses, this approach is not for everyone. Thankfully, there are other ways. Smaller stores with a curated selection may not offer quite the same bargains as a car boot sale, but they can be less intimidating. Many, such as Paper Dress Vintage or Cow, also have websites. Shop in person \u2013 and alone That said, shopping in person \u2013 especially if you walk there \u2013 is usually greener than online. Clothes shipped across the world have a significant carbon footprint, and often come packaged in plastic. You are also less likely to return things you have tried on. It can help to ditch your friends. \u201cWhen you ask a friend if you should buy something, you already know the answer will be yes,\u201d writes Lauren Bravo in How To Break Up With Fast Fashion (Headline, \u00a312.99). \u201cIt\u2019s an unwritten rule of sisterhood.\u201d Think of it as the new version of not going supermarket shopping when you\u2019re hungry. Choose materials wisely Some fabrics age better than others; the Guardian\u2019s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, recommends looking for leather when shopping secondhand. Leather jackets, shoes and belts last for years and often look and feel better once they have been worn in. The environmental impact of denim \u2013 another durable fabric \u2013 means jeans are also best bought secondhand. Unsubscribe and unfollow \u201cIf someone wants to quit fast fashion, I recommend unsubscribing from all the emails,\u201d says writer and fashion consultant Aja Barber. \u201cA brand that is constantly introducing new products might be sustainable in name only. Sending emails and pressuring consumers to buy, buy, buy is not sustainability \u2013 that\u2019s fast fashion.\u201d The same goes for influencers and brands on social platforms such as Instagram. Deleting fast-fashion shopping apps can help, too. Get swishing Clothes swaps \u2013 known as swishing \u2013 are one of the greenest ways to refresh your wardrobe. They offer credits based on the value of the items you bring, which can be swapped for items brought by others. Avoid trends and hunt for quality pieces you\u2019ll wear for years. Find one near you at swishing.com. Learn to mend Make your clothes fit Layla Sargent, founder of The Seam, a website to connect you with local tailors, seamstresses and embroidery artists, says: \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fit well, you\u2019re never going to wear it. Even by making trousers just the right length, or altering a waistband slightly, we will be inclined to wear them more.\u201d The service is currently only in the London area, but coming to Manchester and Birmingham this year. Meanwhile, start with your local dry cleaner. Learn how to sew on a button How many shirts and jackets do you keep unworn at the back of your wardrobe because they are missing a button? Sewing on a button is a simple skill that everyone should have. There are lots of online tutorials; try one by the environmental activist Wilson Oryema for Fashion Revolution. Make your own apron from a pair of old jeans Turn a pair of old jeans into a denim work apron by unpicking the inside leg seams and stitching them together. This is one of many hacks from The Great British Sewing Bee\u2019s book on Sustainable Style (Quadrille, \u00a327, published on 26 March). Darn your socks \u201cOnce a life skill, darning has skipped a generation (or two),\u201d says Emma Mathews of Socko (socko.shop), which makes socks from repurposed yarn. \u201cBut we can learn a lot from the way things were done in the past.\u201d Sew small running stitches up and down the area around the hole and then turn the repair around and stitch perpendicular to them, weaving the thread together until you have covered the hole. Highly therapeutic. Primp your trainers This is a growing service industry. Gr\u00e5el in Liverpool is a small business that specialises in cleaning \u201ccoveted footwear\u201d, offering laces cleaning (\u00a33), a deep clean (\u00a315) and the meticulous premium package from undersole to insole (\u00a335). Meanwhile, Jason Markk offers premium shoe care from branches in LA and Carnaby Street in London, where your trainers will be brought back to life by the brand\u2019s sneaker-care technicians. Give the bathroom a makeover Recycle in there While 90% of us recycle our kitchen waste, we recycle only 50% of our beauty packaging \u2013 probably because our recycling bins are in the kitchen. Joseph Joseph makes an attractive split-waste bathroom bin for \u00a320. You can reduce what ends up inside further by switching to bar soaps and shampoos (I love social enterprise Beco, from \u00a32.50 at Co-op, Boots and supermarkets) and plastic-free handwash such as Soap Co (\u00a319, 300ml, or \u00a3110 for a whopping 5l biodegradable container that should last a year). Lose the disposables A staggering 20,000 litres of water are needed to create only 1kg of cotton \u2013 that\u2019s enough to make just one T-shirt and a pair of jeans, so any cotton you buy should count. Replacing cotton wool is a good start. Remove the initial bulk of makeup with a reusable disc, such as Face Halo (\u00a37), soaked in plain water. These do an astoundingly good job, even on waterproof mascara. Follow with a cleanser and a wet terry-cotton flannel; both flannel and disc should last for hundreds of washing machine cycles. For toners, exfoliants and nail polish remover, use washable bamboo pads. A pack of 18, plus washbag, costs about \u00a310. Pick the right package There\u2019s no justifiable excuse for packaging short-use, everyday beauty products in virgin plastic. There are now a large number of brands packaging in post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), from the luxury (Aveda, REN, Biolage) to the mid-range (Soaper Duper, Lush), to the mass (all Simple and Dove bottles are now 100% PCR in Europe; L\u2019Or\u00e9al Elvive, the world\u2019s bestselling haircare brand, is rolling out 100% PCR bottles this summer \u2013 the caps are recyclable but not made from PCR \u2013 saving 7,000 tonnes of plastic globally a year). Alternatively, you could opt for products packaged in glass that haven\u2019t travelled too far. Neal\u2019s Yard mostly uses glass where safe, and distributes from Dorset. Don\u2019t be tempted by minis Those pick\u2019n\u2019mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in refillable travel bottles and pots from Muji (from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes \u2013 or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won\u2019t use them all, take them to your nearest homeless shelter, where their clients need them. Embrace baths Baths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but some research shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I\u2019ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub \u2013 the shampoo will create bubbles, too. Save to save the planet Save water and lower your bills Consider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems. Get free water-saving products from savewatersavemoney.co.uk. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay \u00a3300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O\u2019Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website good-with-money.com. Get a loan to improve your home\u2019s energy efficiency Some lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. Ecology Building Society offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to \u00a325,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties with energy-efficiency measures. Choose an environmentally friendly current account Nearly \u00a3150bn has been invested in fossil fuels by UK banks since the Paris climate agreement was adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which has the backing of Friends of the Earth, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank\u2019s track record, see lobbying organisation BankTrack, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide. Invest wisely \u201cLook at funds with sustainability in mind,\u201d says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment\u2019s responsible investment team. \u201cInvest in funds that are described as \u2018responsible\u2019, \u2018SRI\u2019 (socially responsible investment), \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018dark green\u2019. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.\u201d Evaluate your pension \u201cFor many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,\u201d says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. \u201cAsk your HR department or pension provider what funds you\u2019re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,\u201d says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus. Get a green financial adviser Last year, a new financial advice firm called The Path was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,\u201d says founder David MacDonald. \u201cWith very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.\u201d Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has 27 times more impact than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. \u201cIf you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of \u00a320,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the carbon equivalent of taking one car off the road,\u201d MacDonald says. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

An economy largely based on the production of sugar brought wealth and led to the beginnings of an imperial system. But that system was built on the almost unimaginably brutal reality of slavery, enforced by almost equally unimaginable cruelties and daily punishments and control. The system was ruthless and relentless. In the mid-18th century one plantation in Westmoreland Parish, site of the most serious slave revolt in 1760, recorded twice as many deaths as births, many from pure overwork. Importation of fresh slaves, often from the Gold Coast of Africa, filled the gap and reinforced the system \u2013 yet contained the seeds of the system\u2019s eventual destruction. Vincent Brown\u2019s Tacky\u2019s Revolt: The Story of An Atlantic Slave War, places the Jamaican revolts of 1760 firmly within the broader history of the time, notably the Seven Years War, for which Brown comments that \u201chistorians have barely noticed that the Jamaican insurrection was one of its major battles\u201d. The judgment is correct when one remembers that the Caribbean, not just Quebec, was key to British strategy. War suffuses this book: wars among African polities, wars between the European powers such as the War of Jenkins\u2019 Ear and the Seven Years War, war and violence on the daily life of the plantation between master and enslaved.

The daily violence of plantation life was a war for control no less than the broader contest in the Caribbean between Britain, France and Spain. It is thus a small step for Brown to conclude that \u201crecognizing slave revolt as a species of warfare is the first step toward a new cartography of Atlantic slavery\u201d. African commanders including Tacky, who had probably held \u201ca royal office or lineage in one of the Gold Coast\u2019s eastern kingdoms\u201d, and Apongo, a leader among the Akan-speaking peoples in both Africa and Jamaica, brought knowledge of military strategy and tactics.

Hopefully, that I was fun. Did you go on somewhere? No. I suggested we grab a drink but Adam had to get up early for work. And... did you kiss? No. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? It would have been good if Adam hadn\u2019t had an early start. Marks out of 10? 7.5. Would you meet again?

And... did you kiss? No, a hug as we departed to different trains. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? A romantic spark and a more eventful date to flesh out these questions! Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? Yes, as friends to compare the reviews when this comes out. \u2022 Helena and Adam ate at Beza, London SE17 Fancy a blind date?

      "body": "<p>I had been with my partner for six years when she announced, abruptly, that it was over. I remember she was crying. I was not: I was too stunned. It was as if, in the rulebook of how to end a relationship, she had torn out the last chapter. Disagreements, rows, eating meals in silence, sleeping in separate rooms: these things were all missing from our end sequence.</p> <p>So, at 52, I found myself unexpectedly single. As well as the pain of the breakup, I was also scared about single life. I had never struggled to meet women, but in the old-fashioned way: at parties, bars and clubs. This was the age of apps.</p> <p>I knew online dating was now a normal part of single life, so I signed up to Hinge, Happn, <a href=\"https://soulmates.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\">Guardian Soulmates</a> and Tinder. I was terrified by the sheer volume of people, all corralled together like items in a vending machine. One woman messaged me and simply said, \u201cHey.\u201d I thought there was a problem with the text, so I waited for the rest of the conversation to arrive. Then I realised that was it. I thought: is that all you have to say?</p> <p>I decided to be more considered in my approach. The majority of single women within my age range were divorced professionals who were juggling demanding jobs, young children and perpetual exhaustion. Many lived outside London and were struggling to find the time to accommodate the romance they were looking for. As a fiftysomething single person, the most critical factor in evaluating a potential new partner was availability and logistics: A&amp;L, as I call it. In my head, I invented an A&amp;L questionnaire, with questions such as:</p> <p><em>How far away do you live?<br>Who will do the travelling when we meet</em><em>?<br>How much will it cost to get there and back?<br>How old are your children?<br>Will I play a surrogate role with your kids?<br>How tricky is your ex, and will I have to deal with him?</em></p> <p>The list might seem cold and unromantic, but so is swiping the faces of strangers on a phone. I once dated someone with two children under 10, who only saw their father every other weekend. I was expected to fill that role, even though I have my own son. Meanwhile, in the background, her ex was still arguing with her over the children\u2019s school and other emotional residues of their divorce. There was a sense that I was in the middle of someone else\u2019s hurricane. I didn\u2019t want that again.</p> <p>Love begins with pragmatic choices. Romance is phase two, if we\u2019re lucky. Armed with these parameters, I revised all my online dating bios. This was my Tinder profile:</p> <p><em>6</em><em>ft 1in, made in Nigeria, born in London; got a big-mouthed smile wider than Julia Roberts\u2019</em><em>; into sports, the arts and walking in nature under big skies. I am short-sighted too, so you will look great for ever.</em></p> <p><em>Would love to hear from you if your values are emotional and spiritual, rather than material; ideally slim, fit, healthy, tallish, smart, funny, non-smoker, living in London. I am 52, with a 23-year-old son. Wordless profiles I generally swipe left.</em></p> <p>I thought clarity would help, but many of my matches ignored my A&amp;L. I was contacted by a woman in her 40s with two young children who lived in Aberdeen. I didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d swiped right on me: there was no way I could pop up there for a coconut cappuccino. Another woman slowly revealed that she was six months pregnant with a sperm donor baby, and was looking for a boyfriend who would also be a father. \u201cCan\u2019t we just start with coffee?\u201d I joked.</p> <p>While I could understand that some people hadn\u2019t put as much thought into the practicalities of dating, I was shocked by the number of encounters I had with women who expressed racist views. Whenever I mentioned that I was looking for a relationship rather than casual sex, this was met with surprise, as if I was going against type: You want love? What kind of black man are you?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anger doesn\u2019t play well on a first date and 'angry black man' is another stereotype I have to negotiate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was messaged by one divorced woman with two children who had never dated a black man and explained that she was \u201ctrying something new\u201d by connecting with me. She told me, without embarrassment, that sex with a black man was on her bucket list, alongside other post-divorce \u201cexperiences\u201d such as trekking in Nepal and zip-lining in Costa Rica.</p> <p>On another occasion, I went on a first date with a white divorcee who lived in the commuter belt outside London. We went to a wine bar adjacent to the station, and I ordered us two glasses of red. As we settled down, I asked why she\u2019d messaged me.</p> <p>\u201cYou looked fit, and I thought you were a playa.\u201d \u201cReally? But\u2026 I didn\u2019t say I was a playa in my profile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI just assumed you were.\u201d Eventually she admitted that she assumed I\u2019d be promiscuous because I was black. My heart sank.</p> <p>I would sometimes jokingly point out the racism implicit within these assumptions. I say \u201cjokingly\u201d because this is the only tone that worked, in terms of challenging their views. Anger doesn\u2019t play well on a first date and \u201cangry black man\u201d is another stereotype I have to negotiate. Using humour as a tool also meant that they didn\u2019t feel threatened by me, so were more candid about their prejudices. One woman felt comfortable enough to tell me that there was no doubt in her mind that black men were biologically and sexually different from white men.</p> <p>In the majority of these conversations, it became clear this was the first time these women had ever considered that they might harbour racist views. Although they all either lived or worked in London, almost everyone in their lives was white, and so their assumptions about race had never been challenged.</p> <p>I was unhappy about being seen as a hydraulic appendage rather than a person. The next woman I met online expressed the same unconscious prejudices. Despite her misconceptions, she was funny and charming, but when it came to sex I deliberately tried to make the experience mediocre. I wanted to smash the stereotype. I wanted sex to be normalised, finally, the way it is for white men.</p> <p>I learned to become a better emotional detective. By analysing the words and imagery within online profiles, I began to make better choices. I was once messaged on Tinder by a woman whose opening photo showed her from behind, riding away on a bicycle. What was she trying to tell me? Was she afraid? Was she cycling away from intimacy? I made a rule that I would always swipe left on anyone concealing rather than revealing. By avoiding those who appeared not ready, I was able to narrow the field further.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/15/lock-on-bedroom-door-how-to-have-a-sex-life-when-you-have-children\">\u2018Get a lock on the bedroom door\u2019: how to have a sex life when you've got children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I connected with women who were not motivated by racial stereotypes: scientists, psychotherapists, NHS directors, CEOs, actresses, TV personalities and film directors among them. I have since become good friends with three women, after we realised we weren\u2019t right for each other romantically. When people ask if online dating has been successful, I say yes. For me, a good date is one when I have gone out and come back safely, having met someone and learned something.</p> <p>Eventually, I also found romance on an app. She is white, 47 years old and, like me, works in the media. The sense of vanity so characteristic of many online profiles was absent from hers. When we started talking, she was honest and open, and we seemed to like the same things: Radio 4, running, Premier League football, red wine and cheese \u2013 result! Her A&amp;L were also a good fit. She lives in London, has two children in their late teens, who don\u2019t need surrogate parenting and are close to leaving home, plus an ex who is not causing trouble in the background. Emotionally, and geographically, she is available.</p> <p>We went to a pub after work one night. I\u2019d said beforehand that I could only meet for an hour. (One of my rules is that all first dates should be cheap and short.) But the attraction was instant, as if we\u2019d met before. There was a logic-defying sense of ease and familiarity, and we both smiled: we\u2019d found each other, finally.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>My<em> </em>Terrifying, Shocking, Humiliating, Amazing<em> </em>Adventures In Online Dating,<em><strong> </strong></em>by Ben Arogundade, is <a href=\"https://whitelabelsbooks.com/\">out now</a>,<em> </em>priced at \u00a39.99.</p> <p>If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

Another woman slowly revealed that she was six months pregnant with a sperm donor baby, and was looking for a boyfriend who would also be a father. \u201cCan\u2019t we just start with coffee?\u201d I joked. While I could understand that some people hadn\u2019t put as much thought into the practicalities of dating, I was shocked by the number of encounters I had with women who expressed racist views. Whenever I mentioned that I was looking for a relationship rather than casual sex, this was met with surprise, as if I was going against type: You want love? What kind of black man are you? I was messaged by one divorced woman with two children who had never dated a black man and explained that she was \u201ctrying something new\u201d by connecting with me. She told me, without embarrassment, that sex with a black man was on her bucket list, alongside other post-divorce \u201cexperiences\u201d such as trekking in Nepal and zip-lining in Costa Rica. On another occasion, I went on a first date with a white divorcee who lived in the commuter belt outside London. We went to a wine bar adjacent to the station, and I ordered us two glasses of red. As we settled down, I asked why she\u2019d messaged me. \u201cYou looked fit, and I thought you were a playa.\u201d \u201cReally? But\u2026 I didn\u2019t say I was a playa in my profile.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI just assumed you were.\u201d Eventually she admitted that she assumed I\u2019d be promiscuous because I was black. My heart sank. I would sometimes jokingly point out the racism implicit within these assumptions. I say \u201cjokingly\u201d because this is the only tone that worked, in terms of challenging their views. Anger doesn\u2019t play well on a first date and \u201cangry black man\u201d is another stereotype I have to negotiate. Using humour as a tool also meant that they didn\u2019t feel threatened by me, so were more candid about their prejudices. One woman felt comfortable enough to tell me that there was no doubt in her mind that black men were biologically and sexually different from white men. In the majority of these conversations, it became clear this was the first time these women had ever considered that they might harbour racist views. Although they all either lived or worked in London, almost everyone in their lives was white, and so their assumptions about race had never been challenged. I was unhappy about being seen as a hydraulic appendage rather than a person. The next woman I met online expressed the same unconscious prejudices. Despite her misconceptions, she was funny and charming, but when it came to sex I deliberately tried to make the experience mediocre. I wanted to smash the stereotype. I wanted sex to be normalised, finally, the way it is for white men. I learned to become a better emotional detective. By analysing the words and imagery within online profiles, I began to make better choices. I was once messaged on Tinder by a woman whose opening photo showed her from behind, riding away on a bicycle. What was she trying to tell me? Was she afraid? Was she cycling away from intimacy? I made a rule that I would always swipe left on anyone concealing rather than revealing. By avoiding those who appeared not ready, I was able to narrow the field further. Eventually, I connected with women who were not motivated by racial stereotypes: scientists, psychotherapists, NHS directors, CEOs, actresses, TV personalities and film directors among them. I have since become good friends with three women, after we realised we weren\u2019t right for each other romantically. When people ask if online dating has been successful, I say yes. For me, a good date is one when I have gone out and come back safely, having met someone and learned something. Eventually, I also found romance on an app. She is white, 47 years old and, like me, works in the media. The sense of vanity so characteristic of many online profiles was absent from hers. When we started talking, she was honest and open, and we seemed to like the same things: Radio 4, running, Premier League football, red wine and cheese \u2013 result! Her A&amp;L were also a good fit. She lives in London, has two children in their late teens, who don\u2019t need surrogate parenting and are close to leaving home, plus an ex who is not causing trouble in the background. Emotionally, and geographically, she is available. We went to a pub after work one night. I\u2019d said beforehand that I could only meet for an hour. (One of my rules is that all first dates should be cheap and short.) But the attraction was instant, as if we\u2019d met before. There was a logic-defying sense of ease and familiarity, and we both smiled: we\u2019d found each other, finally. \u2022 My Terrifying, Shocking, Humiliating, Amazing Adventures In Online Dating, by Ben Arogundade, is out now, priced at \u00a39.99.

Buildings can be read as part of an unbroken chain, supposedly embodying an uncomplicated continuity between the past and present, with little or no \u201crevisionism\u201d getting in the way of our admiration of the way things were.</p> <p>The commission \u2013 chaired by the late philosopher Roger Scruton \u2013 concluded this year with a much less antagonistic <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/living-with-beauty-report-of-the-building-better-building-beautiful-commission\" title=\"\">final report</a>, but not before Scruton swore to protect people from \u201cdisciples of Le Corbusier and Mies\u201d, two giants of global, modernist architecutre. It doesn\u2019t matter that architects haven\u2019t been building in the brutalist or Bauhaus style for decades. Their social idealism is still, apparently, a clear and present danger.</p> <p>Why? Modernism took the advances of the technological revolution, then tried to make a clean break with the styles of architecture that had preceded it. Its practitioners were designing for the masses, imagining egalitarian utopias and rejecting what had come before.</p> <p>Neoclassical architecture, on the other hand, harks back to a time when European nations were more powerful on the world stage, more homogeneous \u2013 and derived no small part of their power from the subservience of racial minorities and women.</p> <p>Fans of the neoclassical find plenty of material on the internet, where anonymous accounts pump out beguiling images of well-lit courthouses and town halls. To a casual observer these seem wholly innocuous, but it is worth reading between the lines.</p> <p>The popular Twitter account Architectural Revival tweets tips for identifying elements of the style such as pediments and porticos, paints modernist architects as villains, and repeats affirmations along the lines of beautiful buildings are ones \u201cyour ancestors would recognise\u201d. If your ancestors can spot a Doric column at 20 paces, it seems to be suggesting, then they\u2019re probably a white European. Frequent reference is made to the imagined \u201cour\u201d \u2013 our heritage, our history, our tradition. In creating an us, however, there must also be a them. The exclusionary nature of this false definition of beauty and ugliness becomes obvious.</p> <p>In short, the call to return to classical beauty often masks a desire to regress to a uglier place in the recent past where diversity was a vice and subjugation a virtue. Modernity and globalisation, and their material expressions, are the enemy. </p> <p>The far right operates by inciting fear about forces that threaten to topple white supremacy. Conspiracy theories, such as the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d, imagine that white Europeans are under threat from Muslim migration and the falling birth rates of emancipated women. Classical architecture, with its invocation of white power, is a visual and psychic balm for those anxieties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2020/feb/05/trump-wants-more-neoclassical-buildings-but-dictating-to-architects-has-a-dark-history\">Will Trump make architecture great again?

      "bodyText": "Architecture\u2019s endless war between the classical and the modernist has leaked into politics again. This month saw the emergence of a draft of Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again, an executive order from the desk of Donald Trump, which would mandate a return to the style chosen by the US\u2019s founding fathers for its associations with \u201cdemocratic Athens and republican Rome\u201d. New buildings would be designed \u201cto endure for centuries\u201d. By banning \u201cplain ugly\u201d modernism, the document suggests, the administration can restore the US\u2019s unsullied past. Modernist architecture has come under fire in Britain too. A couple of years ago, the then housing minister, Kit Malthouse, celebrated the launch of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission with a tweet comparing a neoclassical courthouse in Alabama with a glass and steel building in London. \u201cOne will stand for centuries, one won\u2019t,\u201d wrote Malthouse. A big part of the appeal of classical architecture for the right is this perceived ability to endure. Buildings can be read as part of an unbroken chain, supposedly embodying an uncomplicated continuity between the past and present, with little or no \u201crevisionism\u201d getting in the way of our admiration of the way things were. The commission \u2013 chaired by the late philosopher Roger Scruton \u2013 concluded this year with a much less antagonistic final report, but not before Scruton swore to protect people from \u201cdisciples of Le Corbusier and Mies\u201d, two giants of global, modernist architecutre. It doesn\u2019t matter that architects haven\u2019t been building in the brutalist or Bauhaus style for decades. Their social idealism is still, apparently, a clear and present danger. Why? Modernism took the advances of the technological revolution, then tried to make a clean break with the styles of architecture that had preceded it. Its practitioners were designing for the masses, imagining egalitarian utopias and rejecting what had come before. Neoclassical architecture, on the other hand, harks back to a time when European nations were more powerful on the world stage, more homogeneous \u2013 and derived no small part of their power from the subservience of racial minorities and women. Fans of the neoclassical find plenty of material on the internet, where anonymous accounts pump out beguiling images of well-lit courthouses and town halls. To a casual observer these seem wholly innocuous, but it is worth reading between the lines. The popular Twitter account Architectural Revival tweets tips for identifying elements of the style such as pediments and porticos, paints modernist architects as villains, and repeats affirmations along the lines of beautiful buildings are ones \u201cyour ancestors would recognise\u201d. If your ancestors can spot a Doric column at 20 paces, it seems to be suggesting, then they\u2019re probably a white European. Frequent reference is made to the imagined \u201cour\u201d \u2013 our heritage, our history, our tradition. In creating an us, however, there must also be a them. The exclusionary nature of this false definition of beauty and ugliness becomes obvious. In short, the call to return to classical beauty often masks a desire to regress to a uglier place in the recent past where diversity was a vice and subjugation a virtue. Modernity and globalisation, and their material expressions, are the enemy. The far right operates by inciting fear about forces that threaten to topple white supremacy. Conspiracy theories, such as the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d, imagine that white Europeans are under threat from Muslim migration and the falling birth rates of emancipated women. Classical architecture, with its invocation of white power, is a visual and psychic balm for those anxieties. One architecture nerd with a passion for the beautiful ruins of ancient Greece and Rome was, of course, Albert Speer. Hitler\u2019s favourite designer pioneered the concept of Ruinenwert, or ruin value. Together they planned entire cities that would speak of the greatness of the Third Reich, even as relics, just as the Roman empire\u2019s ruins communicated its imperial power down the ages. I hestitate to make a direct comparison, but it\u2019s hard not to be reminded of this on some level reading Trump\u2019s order to return to the glory of \u201crepublican Rome\u201d. In his memoir, Speer recalled that Hitler liked to philosophise: \u201cUltimately, all that remained to remind men of the great epochs of history was their monumental architecture \u2026 Periods of weakness are bound to occur in the history of nations, but at their lowest ebb, their architecture will speak to them of former power.\u201d Traditional narratives depict imperial Rome as a bulwark against invading barbarian hordes, an image that has clear appeal for the contemporary right. It was also a slave-owning society, and one where women\u2019s power was limited to the home, since they were unable to vote or hold public office. History, both ancient and more recent, is a place of refuge only for a select few. If you\u2019re not white, or not a man, the chances are that the past would not be such a beautiful place to return to. Aesthetic time travel is far more appealing to those who see classical architecture as a comforting symbol of their former power. Eulogising these styles without confronting their complicated history is a mistake. Diversity \u2013 in a society and in architecture \u2013 must be defended.

I also knew from watching movies and things that we should probably stock up on food at home, so we bought a bunch of instant noodles, which no one ended up eating. There was enough at the supermarket; the only thing we really couldn\u2019t find was disinfectants.</p> <p>My father is an office worker at a drug company and my mom went to school at a medical university, so they were good with helping analyse my situation. I started to self-isolate on 22 January. My room has its own tub and bathroom, so it is pretty convenient.

I had begun to cough. It was a very dry cough with a little yellow phlegm. The results showed that my situation was worsening, with the infection spreading to my entire lungs. The doctor gave me an IV drip, while the oral medicine remained the same. At the time the doctor told me I was suspected of having the virus, but that only an expert committee could decide who would be able to use the testing kit.</p> <p>By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life.</p> <p>It was then that I realised I needed some spiritual support or maybe I couldn\u2019t make it.

      "bodyText": "On 17 January my muscles became sore all over. I may have had a slight fever, but it wasn\u2019t strong enough to notice. Looking back, it is a little scary, because my house and the language school where I study Japanese are within a 5km radius of the Wuhan seafood market (where the virus is believed to have originated). To treat my muscle soreness, I took some cold tablets because I thought it was a normal cold. Now that I think of it, I might have missed the best time for treatment, failing to contain the virus with antiviral drugs in its early stages. I have no idea how I got the virus. I always eat at the same Hong Kong-style restaurant below my school. I wasn\u2019t walking around much at the time because it was very cold, and since I was tired after classes I always went back home. Once the semester break started, I stayed with my parents and not at the dormitory. I started wearing a mask a few days later when I saw everyone else around me wearing masks. Sickness and self-isolation By 21 January my body was still aching all over, so I called my dad. He sensed something was wrong with me and urged me to go home immediately. That evening I took my body temperature which showed a mild fever. My mom said that if my temperature still didn\u2019t drop later that night, we would go to the hospital. At 11pm that night, the fever hadn\u2019t gone away, so I went to Tongji hospital. On arrival I saw the hospital already overwhelmed with patients. Seeing doctors in their hazmat suits in real life for the first time, something I\u2019d only seen in documentaries about Sars, I realised something bad was happening. I wasn\u2019t that astonished or scared when I saw all the people, because it is one of the best hospitals in Wuhan and it is always very crowded. Because of the massive crowds, I decided to go to Wuhan pulmonary hospital instead, and that proved to be the right decision. There was not a single patient there at the time I arrived. There I had blood and liver function [tests] and a CT scan. The CT results came back showing patchy shadows on the lower sides of both of my lungs. I started to take some prescription medicine and Chinese medicine capsules prescribed by the hospital. When Wuhan started to be locked down, that\u2019s when my dad had me quarantine myself at home. I also knew from watching movies and things that we should probably stock up on food at home, so we bought a bunch of instant noodles, which no one ended up eating. There was enough at the supermarket; the only thing we really couldn\u2019t find was disinfectants. My father is an office worker at a drug company and my mom went to school at a medical university, so they were good with helping analyse my situation. I started to self-isolate on 22 January. My room has its own tub and bathroom, so it is pretty convenient. My grandma did the cooking for me and when she brought food in, she would wear a mask and we\u2019d use disposable chopsticks and things like that, so after I was done that all got thrown out. \u2018The worst time\u2019 On 25 January I had a checkup. I had begun to cough. It was a very dry cough with a little yellow phlegm. The results showed that my situation was worsening, with the infection spreading to my entire lungs. The doctor gave me an IV drip, while the oral medicine remained the same. At the time the doctor told me I was suspected of having the virus, but that only an expert committee could decide who would be able to use the testing kit. By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life. It was then that I realised I needed some spiritual support or maybe I couldn\u2019t make it. So I watched my favourite anime show and seeing their normal, happy lives, I thought I may have to say goodbye to this life forever. But watching the show, the heroine had troubles in the first half, but she finally made it and succeeded in her career. You see, I was going to fly to Japan in mid-February to go to a concert by Ayaka Ohashi, a Japanese voice actress and anime artist, but with the lockdown I thought everything might be cancelled. I had attended her solo performance last year, and after watching her I had decided I wanted to make a career out of managing voice actors. So watching the show, I thought: I must make it if I want to see her next concert alive. This really encouraged me and gave me some relief, along with the medicine. I dreamed twice that week that I met her. I had another re-exam on 28 January, which showed both my lungs were getting better. After a medical consultation between the doctors, they decided I was qualified for being tested for the coronavirus. The virus spreads My elder brother began to have a fever and cough on the 29th. His exam results showed there were small patches of glass-like shadows in his lungs. He was considered a suspected case. On the same day, my grandma also had a fever. As for me, my test results were positive and I was officially a confirmed case. The hospital gave me five days of an anti-HIV medicine for free, while my family were also starting to take prescribed medicine. Due to my improved situation and limited beds in the hospital, I was told to go home and isolate myself, and thus my IV therapy ended. My brother had a re-exam and he tested positive on 2 February. My grandmother had a fever for four days but then recovered. She was never tested, and neither was my mother, but they all took medicine. My brother also eventually recovered and is now negative for the virus. On 4 February, a CT scan showed continued improvements in my lungs, and my cough stopped. I was given another coronavirus test and prescribed more medicine. The next day test results showed I was negative for the virus, but according to instructions from the doctors, I needed to go back for another test. On 7 February results showed again that I was negative, and I was declared recovered. As told to Michael Standaert",

      "body": "<p>From Sunday Australia will ban foreign travellers arriving from Iran, the country with the highest death rate from coronavirus outside of China.</p> <p>On Saturday the health minister Greg Hunt said Iran\u2019s struggle to contain the disease meant anyone who is not a permanent resident or citizen of Australia would not be allowed to come to Australia until 14 days after they had left Iran, meaning they would have to first go to another country. Australian citizens and residents would be allowed to return, but must self-isolate for 14 days. This lifts the travel advice to the <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert\">same level as is current for China</a>. As with China, Australians are being told not to travel to Iran.</p> <p>There have now been 34 Covid-19 deaths in Iran, Hunt said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s been a very significant rise. That means there is likely at this stage a high level of undetected cases [in Iran],\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore those cases won\u2019t be intercepted on departure from Iran. As a consequence we have decided to prevent travel to Australia for non-nationals.\u201d</p> <p>There is concern Iran is not sharing all the information it has on the virus, and that the actual number of deaths may be higher. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy said Australia could not continue to isolate Australia from every country struggling to contain the virus.</p> <p>\u201cBut in this particular case we feel Iran presents at the current moment a very high risk,\u201d he said. He added that Australians did not need to take extreme measures like stockpiling months worth of food or medical supplies. But he did say, \u201cit\u2019s becoming disproportionate and ineffective to keep imposing very rigid quarantine requirements for what could be a very large number of countries\u201d.</p> <p>In future, Australia would instead have to test and isolate people returning rather than imposing widespread quarantine measures, he said. The national security committee and the chief health officers of each state and territory are reviewing quarantine measures on a daily basis.</p> <p>The decision comes as up to 40 customers of a hair and beauty salon in Queensland may have been exposed to coronavirus after an employee of a salon became ill with the virus after returning from Iran. The state\u2019s chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said there was an \u201cincredibly low\u201d risk the 63-year-old who had returned from Iran with the virus had passed it on.</p> <p>\u201cBecause as soon as she had her first symptom, and she is a highly intelligent, very sensitive lady, she spoke to her manager and she went home and she went to Gold Coast University hospital to get tested,\u201d Young said. \u201cShe came back from Iran, she was perfectly well on the flight back into Australia and up to the Gold Coast, and then a couple of days later she developed some symptoms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/explainer-how-worried-should-i-be-about-coronavirus-in-australia\">Explainer: how worried should I be about coronavirus in Australia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cQueensland Health has very rigorous contact-tracing procedures in place and we do this very well dozens of times a year for measles, a disease significantly more infectious than Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who attended the Hair Plus salon on the Gold Coast on Thursday 27 February, after 11am, has been urged to come forward. Young said the woman performed facials on \u201ca number of clients each for brief interactions\u201d of about 15 minutes.</p> <p>The woman is in a hospital isolation unit.

      "bodyText": "From Sunday Australia will ban foreign travellers arriving from Iran, the country with the highest death rate from coronavirus outside of China. On Saturday the health minister Greg Hunt said Iran\u2019s struggle to contain the disease meant anyone who is not a permanent resident or citizen of Australia would not be allowed to come to Australia until 14 days after they had left Iran, meaning they would have to first go to another country. Australian citizens and residents would be allowed to return, but must self-isolate for 14 days. This lifts the travel advice to the same level as is current for China. As with China, Australians are being told not to travel to Iran. There have now been 34 Covid-19 deaths in Iran, Hunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a very significant rise. That means there is likely at this stage a high level of undetected cases [in Iran],\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore those cases won\u2019t be intercepted on departure from Iran. As a consequence we have decided to prevent travel to Australia for non-nationals.\u201d There is concern Iran is not sharing all the information it has on the virus, and that the actual number of deaths may be higher. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy said Australia could not continue to isolate Australia from every country struggling to contain the virus. \u201cBut in this particular case we feel Iran presents at the current moment a very high risk,\u201d he said. He added that Australians did not need to take extreme measures like stockpiling months worth of food or medical supplies. But he did say, \u201cit\u2019s becoming disproportionate and ineffective to keep imposing very rigid quarantine requirements for what could be a very large number of countries\u201d. In future, Australia would instead have to test and isolate people returning rather than imposing widespread quarantine measures, he said. The national security committee and the chief health officers of each state and territory are reviewing quarantine measures on a daily basis. The decision comes as up to 40 customers of a hair and beauty salon in Queensland may have been exposed to coronavirus after an employee of a salon became ill with the virus after returning from Iran. The state\u2019s chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said there was an \u201cincredibly low\u201d risk the 63-year-old who had returned from Iran with the virus had passed it on. \u201cBecause as soon as she had her first symptom, and she is a highly intelligent, very sensitive lady, she spoke to her manager and she went home and she went to Gold Coast University hospital to get tested,\u201d Young said. \u201cShe came back from Iran, she was perfectly well on the flight back into Australia and up to the Gold Coast, and then a couple of days later she developed some symptoms. \u201cQueensland Health has very rigorous contact-tracing procedures in place and we do this very well dozens of times a year for measles, a disease significantly more infectious than Covid-19.\u201d Anyone who attended the Hair Plus salon on the Gold Coast on Thursday 27 February, after 11am, has been urged to come forward. Young said the woman performed facials on \u201ca number of clients each for brief interactions\u201d of about 15 minutes. The woman is in a hospital isolation unit. She is the ninth person in Queensland infected with the virus, with 25 Australians infected to date. Of those, 15 have fully recovered with the rest in a stable condition. The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, said people who went to the area but did not go to that particular hair salon on Thursday did not need to be concerned. Gold Coast Health had established extra fever clinics to help manage demand for testing, he said. \u201cThis patient will receive the very best care from the same team that treated Queensland\u2019s first coronavirus cases,\u201d he said. Young said the best weapon Queenslanders could deploy against the virus was hand-washing. The World Heath Organisation increased the risk of the spread of the disease to \u201cvery high\u201d, with the number of countries now infected rising to 55. \u201cThe continuing increase in the number of cases and number of affected countries over the last few days are clearly of concern,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. He said 24 Covid-19 cases had been exported from Italy to 14 countries and 97 cases had exported from Iran to 11 countries. The UN health agency had previously labelled the global risk as \u201chigh\u201d but was still not calling it a pandemic.",

On Friday, the CDC said it was working to distribute new testing kits, after the first batch turned out to be faulty. At other moments during his speech, Trump digressed to rattle off insults at the Democratic candidates running for president. He mocked the former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. \u201cHe wished he\u2019d never started. He wished he\u2019d never started. He said: \u2018Well, Trump can do it, I\u2019m going to do it too.\u2019 Was that the worst debate performance in history?\u201d Trump said. He attacked the billionaire Tom Steyer for spending millions on his own presidential campaign. \u201cBut this guy Steyer, he spends all this money. He spends all this money. He\u2019s not that wealthy,\u201d Trump said, urging the crowd to tell him which candidate would be easiest for him to beat. Between diatribes about his possible presidential opponents, Trump bragged about the unemployment rate in South Carolina and nationally, hailing a low jobless rate among African Americans. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has made outreach to black voters a key pillar of its strategy. In his speech, Trump attacked Democrats\u2019 record on race, saying they had \u201cbetrayed African Americans\u201d: \u201cThey forced their children into failing schools. They shipped their jobs to foreign countries. They pushed their unfair sentencing policies, you know about that \u2026 and they favoured illegal aliens over their own constituents, you know that,\u201d Trump said. He claimed his own administration was reversing such \u201cfailed policies\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re going to compete for every single vote in 2020 and we expect to win a historic share of the black vote come election day.\u201d",

The firings came as graduate students at the University of California, Davis, and University of California, Santa Barbara, began their own cost-of-living strikes in solidarity. One of their demands is that all UC Santa Cruz graduate workers who participated in strike activities be restored to full employment status. The 54 UC Santa Cruz graduate students who received termination letters on Friday are just a fraction of the 233 graduate student instructors and teaching assistants who have refused to submit nearly 12,000 grades from the fall quarter since December. This month, the students\u2019 grading strike expanded, as teaching assistants refused all teaching duties and research assistants refused additional work. Some classes and office hours have been canceled because of the strike. The students are striking for a $1,412-a-month cost-of-living adjustment, which they say they desperately need amid a growing housing crisis in California.

This will prove invaluable and help us understand where this virus is and who is infected. This will be essential if we are to implement measures to slow its spread and allow our NHS to respond. We can also do our bit by making sure that we are vigilant with our own personal hygiene.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Dr Michael Head</strong>, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, has said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Given the increase in cases around Europe and outside of China, it\u2019s unsurprising to see a probable case of human-to-human transmission here in the UK. There will be significant efforts to look at how this patient came to be infected, who is the index case in the UK, and to see if any there are any other secondary cases. Though this is a notable development here in the UK, the overall risks to the public right now remain unchanged.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Dr Stephen Griffin</strong>, an associate professor at the University of Leeds\u2019 section of infection and immunity, has said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Whilst the first person-to-person transmission within the UK may come as a shock to many, it was really only a matter of time. It is increasingly clear that SARS-COV2 is capable of being spread by people showing very mild, or perhaps completely unnoticeable symptoms, which has allowed it to escape the lockdown in China, albeit within a relatively small number of individuals.</p> \n   <p>However, this has been sufficient to promote the seeding of small, sporadic community outbreaks in numerous countries, the majority of which have been successfully contained. Nevertheless, we have also seen the beginnings of much larger outbreaks in countries like South Korea and elsewhere, which are likely to have been seeded after a similar fashion. This highlights the challenge faced once the virus becomes established.</p> \n   <p>What now becomes critically important is our ability to identify, isolate and care for infected individuals, and to trace their recent contacts.</p> \n   <p>If localised outbreaks remain contained then it should be possible to limit the impact upon the UK. However, I suspect the frequency of small outbreaks might increase in coming weeks as the source countries of imported cases become more diverse.</p> \n   <p>If we experience a burgeoning epidemic as seen in South Korea, it will represent a significant challenge to our already stretched NHS and public health infrastructure. As directed by WHO, we should use this time window to invest and prepare for such a potential outbreak, whether it happens or not. In particular, we must ensure that our health care professionals are equipped with the appropriate environments and protective measures such that they can provide the necessary care to the public with minimal risk that they might themselves become infected.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5994bf8f08e1332474c616\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-28T22:32:13.764Z\">10.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street will allow ministers to go on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme amid public concern over the spread of coronavirus, according to the Times:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1233504197980688391\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Downing Street has agreed to end boycott of Today programme so ministers can go on air to discuss Coronavirus<br><br>Lee Cain, No 10's director of communications, told aides tonight he had agreed with BBC that there was a 'public interest' in having ministers on national broadcaster</p>\u2014 Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1233504197980688391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 28, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e597c3c8f08e1332474c535\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-28T21:18:34.392Z\">9.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>El Salvador\u2019s migration authorities will be ordered to deny entry to travellers arriving from Iran, a health measure intended to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the former nation\u2019s president <strong>Nayib Bukele </strong>has said.</p> \n  <p>Bukele said on Twitter that Salvadorans and diplomats arriving from the Middle Eastern country, which has one of the largest outbreaks outside China, will have to spend 30 days in quarantine.

      "bodyText": "We will close out this live blog now, and continue our live coverage in our new blog. This is where we stand so far this morning: China has reported the lowest number of new cases in Mainland China since it began public reporting last month, with 427 new cases confirmed, of which only four were outside of Hubei province. The death toll from the virus in China has reached 2,835, up 47 from the previous day. The total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China since the outbreak began is 79,251. South Korea, which has the second-highest number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China, reported 594 new cases on Saturday \u2014 the biggest daily increase to date \u2014 with three new deaths. It brings its total accumulated number of cases to 2,931 The US has postponed an ASEAN summit planned for Las Vegas on 14 March over coronavirus fears. The US Centre for Disease Control has confirmed two new cases in California in people who have not travelled to affected areas, or had known contact with infected persons. Australia has reported two new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of cases in Australia to 25. The number of confirmed cases in the UK reached 20 and a 70-year-old passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is the first UK citizen to die of the virus. The death toll in Italy has reached 21, and and 820 people have been affected. The virus has now spread to 49 countries, and the World Health Organisation says the virus could reach most, if not all countries. Ferrari seeks travel assurance for Australian grand prix Ferrari will seek assurances from Australian authorities that its staff will be allowed to travel and not face quarantine restrictions before heading to Melbourne for the Australian Grand Prix, which opens the Formula One season on 15 March. The Italian giant suspended non-critical business travel and external access to its factory in Maranello, about 200km from the centre of the Italian outbreak in Codongo, on Wednesday. The Victorian sports minister Martin Pakula told The Guardian on Thursday that the event would go ahead, and the Australian Grand Prix corporation said it would comply with advice from the government and health authorities. But without Ferrari, the F1 would lose its biggest drawcard. Ferarri team principle Mattia Binotto raised the issue after his staff faced difficulties getting to the Bahrain F2 test this weekend. He said he would need confirmation from F1 and FIA officials that there would be \u201cno surprises\u201d before allowing staff to travel to Australia. He told Motorsport.com: What we will need is simply to have assurance before leaving. If there are any medical screenings, we need to know about them. You need to know exactly what\u2019s about. We need to understand what are the consequences in case of any problem? Obviously we need to protect our employees. We have got collective and individual responsibility towards them. And it\u2019s important, really, to make sure that before leaving, the picture, whatever is the scenario, is known and clear. Binotto said with Ferrari providing assistance to Haas and Alfa Sauber as well as their own AlphaTauri team, more than one team could be affected. What will be the situation that if eventually four teams cannot run and if the race will take place or not? That is not my decision. Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has warned party officials there would be \u201cserious consequences\u201d of failing to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus in that country. More from AFP: The impoverished nation, with a weak and ill-equipped healthcare system, has closed its borders to prevent the spread of the disease into its territory. Kim told a meeting of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea that the fight against the virus was a \u201ccrucial state affair for the defence of the people\u201d that required maximum discipline, according to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). \u201cIn case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,\u201d KCNA quoted Kim as saying. Two senior officials - party vice-chairmen Ri Man Gon and Pak Thae Dok - were sacked, and a party unit disbanded for corruption, the report said, indicating that they may have been involved in graft linked with the anti-epidemic measures. \u201cNo special cases must be allowed,\u201d he added, and ordered officials to \u201cseal off all the channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way\u201d. Pyongyang has not reported a single case of COVID-19, which has killed more than 2,800 people and infected over 84,000 people in dozens of countries since it emerged in neighbouring China. North Korea has banned tourists, suspended international trains and flights and placed hundreds of foreigners in quarantine to prevent an outbreak. It has also reportedly postponed the new school term. With loudspeakers blaring hygiene messages, ambassadors locked in their compounds, and state media demanding \u201cabsolute obedience\u201d, North Korea\u2019s anti-coronavirus measures have been described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d by diplomats. South Korea, meanwhile, is battling a major outbreak of the virus with more than 2,300 cases - the highest number outside mainland China. Germany\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations has said the Security Council would adopt humanitarian exemptions to the sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, and allow the export of equipment to help North Korea fight the coronavirus. But \u201cthe problem is that right now the North Koreans closed the borders,\u201d Christoph Heusgen said Thursday after a closed-door Security Council meeting about the reclusive state. The members of the Security Council called on North Korea \u201cto allow this equipment in. So the population can be protected,\u201d he added, without elaborating on the type of equipment. The number of new cases reported in Mainland China is the lowest since the national health authority started compiling nationwide data last month, Reuters has reported. Excluding Hubei province, where the new coronavirus outbreak originated in the country, there were just four new cases of infection reported on Friday. In Hubei itself, 423 new cases were reported, of which 420 were in Wuhan. So a total of 427 in mainland China. South Korea reported 571 new cases on Friday, taking its total \u2014 the highest in the world outside China \u2014 to 2,337, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Post amended to add total figure in China and correct number in Wuhan. The US will postpone an ASEAN regional summit in Las Vegas to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has reported. US president Donald Trump invited members of the 10-member association to a meeting on 14 March after he did attend a summit in Bangkok in November. California has reported two cases of coronavirus in people who had not travelled internationally, or come into close contact with any other identified cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that officials were \u201caware of a second possible instance of community spread of Covid-19 in California\u201d. The patient is an older woman with chronic health conditions in San Jose. She did not have a travel history or any known contact with an infected person. Ten of the 60 cases of the respiratory disease in the US are in California. Mainland China had 427 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday, up from 327 cases a day earlier. There were also 248 new suspected cases. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 79,251. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 2,835 as of the end of Friday, up by 47 from the previous day. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 45 new deaths, while in the provincial capital of Wuhan, 37 people died. We\u2019re expecting an update on that new coronavirus case in Queensland at 12.30pm local time. In the mean time, you can read Melissa Davey\u2019s explainer on whether Australians should be worried about coronavirus here. US \u2018totally ready\u2019 for coronavirus, says Trump US president Donald Trump has accused the democrats of politicising the coronavirus, and said the US are \u201cmagnificently organised\u201d and \u201ctotally ready\u201d for the virus. Addressing a rally in South Carolina, Trump also accused the media \u2014 specifically CNN \u2014 of \u201chysteria\u201d over the virus. This is from CNN reporter Daniel Dale. Trump then repeated his bit about South Korean film Parasite winning best picture at the Oscars (more on that here, if you\u2019re interested) before returning to coronavirus: The AHPPC said that with the increased spread of the disease, extending travel bans was \u201cnot likely to be feasible or effective.\u201d In the past few days, the numbers of cases of COVID-19 in South Korea, Italy, and Iran have been rapidly increasing. The AHPPC said the situation in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore also remains a concern. Whilst case numbers in some of these countries are rising quickly, the prevalence of illness is currently orders of magnitude lower than in Hubei Province. An assessment of the risk of COVID-19 in those countries is based on many factors, including the identification of transmission chains, the number of reported deaths, recent trends in incidence, the incidence of exported cases and modelled estimates of expected numbers of cases based on travel patterns. The ability of countries to respond effectively to infectious disease outbreaks is also an important consideration, along with the feasibility of stringent mobility restrictions given the current phase of the epidemic globally. With this change in epidemiology, extending travel bans to restrict travel from multiple countries is not likely to be feasible or effective in the medium term. However, it may be appropriate to consider self-isolation or practise social distancing upon return from higher risk regions. On Friday the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) issued a statement about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. It said over the past two weeks, direct connections between cases in other countries and China had decreased. It said the effectiveness of these quarantine measures and whether they remain adequate would be reviewed again in one week. The travel restrictions and self-quarantine procedures for people coming from mainland China had been effective so far, with a more than 60% reduction in travellers, and no cases detected in more than 30,000 Australians returning from mainland China since 1 February. The AHPPC statement said: The only new COVID-19 detections in Australia in the last two weeks are eight cases in Australian passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. There remains no evidence of community transmission in Australia, with thousands of negative tests for COVID-19 in the last week alone. The risk to the Australian community from travellers from mainland China appears to have reduced significantly since the inception of travel restrictions. This could justify some further easing of travel restrictions. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, has reportedly sacked two top officials for \u201ccorruption\u201d in a meeting on coronavirus in Politburo. The Party daily Rodong Sinmun and Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Saturday that the leader sacked the two Workers Party of Korea (QPK) officials for \u201ccorrupt\u201d acts. Both men were central committee vice-chairmen. They were \u201charshly criticized\u201d by Kim Jong Un \u201cand their gravity and consequences were sharply analyzed,\u201d the Rodong reported on its front page. Good morning, it\u2019s Calla Wahlquist in Melbourne taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. Two more cases of coronavirus have been reported in Australia overnight, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 25. One of those women is a 63-year-old woman on the Gold Coast in Queensland, who is now in the Gold Coast hospital. The woman had recently returned from Iran, which has emerged as a hotspot of the disease with the second-highest number of deaths outside of China. The Iranian deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi tested positive a few days ago. Authorities in Queensland are now trying to trace back the woman\u2019s movements to identify who she may have come into contact with. We\u2019re expecting a press conference on this soon. It is the ninth case in Queensland. Three cases are passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and five more were people who had travelled to the Gold Coast from Wuhan province on holiday. If you want to get in touch, you can follow me on twitter @callapilla and email me at calla.wahlquist@theguardian.com A man who was onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship became the first British person to die from the coronavirus, the Japanese health ministry confirmed. The passengers had been taken off the vessel to Japan for treatment. The UK said it had detected its 20th coronavirus case and the first case in Wales was confirmed. The latest patient in England is the first to contract the illness while in the UK. Italy\u2019s death toll reached 21 and some 820 people have been infected, the civil protection chief said. But the number of those who have recovered from the virus is increasing. Coronavirus could reach most, if not all, countries, according to the World Health Organisation. The body said its analysis showed there was a very high global risk of both the spread and the impact of Covid-19. The virus has now spread to about 49 countries. New Zealand, Belarus, Lithuania, and Nigeria (the first case in sub-Saharan Africa) reported their first cases in the last day. Many are linked to travellers from Iran. Markets around the world have taken huge hits, and the Chinese economy has seen its worst slump in two decades. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the technology-focused Nasdaq all dropped by about 3%, while other markets also tumbled. The UN security council decided to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea to help it fend off the virus. Pyongyang still says it has no reported cases. Amazon suspends job interviews over coronavirus fears Amazon will be suspending in-person job interviews indefinitely, according to screenshots reported on by Gizmodo on Friday. The move comes as the tech industry scrambles to respond to the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 3,000 people. Amazon already stated it would cancel its appearances at a number of events and restrict global and domestic travel. The interview policy will affect more than 39,000 jobs open at the company, according to its own hiring site, and appears to be indefinite. With racially tinged coronavirus fears keeping visitors from San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, Facebook is donating $25,000 to help the historic neighborhood\u2019s small businesses. Officials pledged today to donate $20,000 to the Chinese Newcomers Services Center, in addition to $5,000 in Facebook ad credits. They made the announcement alongside local lawmakers and San Francisco mayor London Breed, who declared a state of emergency in the city over the outbreak. There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in San Francisco. Whately said thoroughly washing hands and coughing or sneezing into a tissue before disposing of it remained the best way of limiting the spread of coronavirus. Asked about the increasing use of face masks, she told the BBC: The advice I have been given is that members of the public are not particularly recommended to use face masks. They may be used by clinicians but actually they are not something that is recommended for the general public. The important thing is the handwashing advice and the use of tissues. It is likely more people in the UK will contract coronavirus, a government minister has said. But Helen Whately, added that plans were in place should it become a pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care minister told BBC Newsnight: I can\u2019t reiterate enough that we are well prepared but we do have to recognise that it is likely we will see more cases in the UK. We have plans in place and have carried out exercises so in the event of something like a flu pandemic, we are ready. And those plans have been continuously updated ever since the outbreak in China of the coronavirus. Asked whether that meant mass gatherings could be banned and schools closed, such as in parts of Italy, she said such measures were \u201cbeing considered\u201d. Clearly, how to deal with those sorts of things absolutely has been considered and is being considered. That is rightly all part of the planning. But Whatley said there was still \u201cvery clear guidance\u201d that \u201cschools should not be, in general, planning to close\u201d. The Reuters news agency is reporting that the United States will postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it planned to host on 14 March. The US president, Donald Trump, had invited leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian nations to meet in Las Vegas after he did not attend a summit with the group in Bangkok in November. Reuters cited two unnamed US officials it said were familiar with the matter. The Guardian has not independently confirmed the report and the US State Department did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. BTS, the K-Pop band, have cancelled four concerts due to be held in Seoul in April as South Korea\u2019s coronavirus cases jumped by nearly 600 \u2013 a larger rise than the daily increase reported in China. The seven-piece boyband, one of the biggest acts in the world, had scheduled the gigs at the South Korean capital\u2019s Olympic Stadium to promote their new album \u201cMap of the Soul: 7\u201d. More than 200,000 fans were expected to attend, their agency Big Hit Entertainment said in a statement. A second coronavirus case in a northern Californian patient with no links to international travel has reportedly been identified. The Washington Post quoted Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins centre for health security, as saying: I think there\u2019s a strong possibility that there\u2019s local transmission going in California. In other words, the virus is spreading within California, and I think there\u2019s a possibility other states are in the same boat. They just haven\u2019t recognised it yet. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, has overseen military drills, state media KCNA say, in a rare public outing amid efforts to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus in the isolated country. The Reuters news agency reports that North Korea has not confirmed any cases of the virus, but that state media said a month-long quarantine period had been imposed for people showing symptoms and \u201chigh-intensity\u201d measures were taken including reinforcing checks in border regions and at airports and sea ports. On 16 February, Kim made his first public appearance in 22 days to visit a mausoleum marking the anniversary of the birth of his father and late leader Kim Jong Il. The military drill was to \u201cjudge the mobility and the fire power strike ability\u201d on the frontline and eastern units and ended to a \u201cgreat satisfaction\u201d of Kim, according to KCNA. The network said: In a separate dispatch, KCNA said Kim has also convened a meeting of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s powerful politburo where a stricter enforcement of \u201ctop-class anti-epidemic steps\u201d was discussed to prevent the spread of the virus. It quoted Kim as telling the meeting: In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences. No special cases must be allowed within the state anti-epidemic system. He instructed the officials to \u201cseal off all the channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way, and strengthen check-up, test and quarantine,\u201d KCNA added. The US state department has raised its alert level for travel to Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak, telling Americans to reconsider travel there. Tracing the origins of the latest case of coronavirus - the first to have been caught within the UK - will be \u201ccrucial\u201d in preventing more extensive spread, experts have said. Prof Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, has said: This case \u2013 a person testing positive for novel coronavirus with no known link to an affected area or known case \u2013 marks a new chapter for the UK, and it will be crucial to understand where the infection came from to try and prevent more extensive spread. This was always a concern \u2013 this is a virus that frequently causes symptoms very similar to mild flu or a common cold, and it\u2019s easily transmitted from person to person. This means it can easily go under the radar. This was always a real possibility and one of the reasons that the government introduced more extensive surveillance. This will prove invaluable and help us understand where this virus is and who is infected. This will be essential if we are to implement measures to slow its spread and allow our NHS to respond. We can also do our bit by making sure that we are vigilant with our own personal hygiene. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, has said: Given the increase in cases around Europe and outside of China, it\u2019s unsurprising to see a probable case of human-to-human transmission here in the UK. There will be significant efforts to look at how this patient came to be infected, who is the index case in the UK, and to see if any there are any other secondary cases. Though this is a notable development here in the UK, the overall risks to the public right now remain unchanged. Dr Stephen Griffin, an associate professor at the University of Leeds\u2019 section of infection and immunity, has said: Whilst the first person-to-person transmission within the UK may come as a shock to many, it was really only a matter of time. It is increasingly clear that SARS-COV2 is capable of being spread by people showing very mild, or perhaps completely unnoticeable symptoms, which has allowed it to escape the lockdown in China, albeit within a relatively small number of individuals. However, this has been sufficient to promote the seeding of small, sporadic community outbreaks in numerous countries, the majority of which have been successfully contained. Nevertheless, we have also seen the beginnings of much larger outbreaks in countries like South Korea and elsewhere, which are likely to have been seeded after a similar fashion. This highlights the challenge faced once the virus becomes established. What now becomes critically important is our ability to identify, isolate and care for infected individuals, and to trace their recent contacts. If localised outbreaks remain contained then it should be possible to limit the impact upon the UK. However, I suspect the frequency of small outbreaks might increase in coming weeks as the source countries of imported cases become more diverse. If we experience a burgeoning epidemic as seen in South Korea, it will represent a significant challenge to our already stretched NHS and public health infrastructure. As directed by WHO, we should use this time window to invest and prepare for such a potential outbreak, whether it happens or not. In particular, we must ensure that our health care professionals are equipped with the appropriate environments and protective measures such that they can provide the necessary care to the public with minimal risk that they might themselves become infected. Downing Street will allow ministers to go on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme amid public concern over the spread of coronavirus, according to the Times: El Salvador\u2019s migration authorities will be ordered to deny entry to travellers arriving from Iran, a health measure intended to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the former nation\u2019s president Nayib Bukele has said. Bukele said on Twitter that Salvadorans and diplomats arriving from the Middle Eastern country, which has one of the largest outbreaks outside China, will have to spend 30 days in quarantine. El Salvador has no reported cases of coronavirus. New measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak in Germany, including the widening of cross-border travel guidelines and the cancellation of major international events, have been enacted by Berlin\u2019s crisis committee. It expanded regulations for air and sea passengers, requiring passengers from South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran to report their health status before entry. Previously, only passengers from China had been required to do so. Lebanon will close its schools from 29 February until 8 March as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus, its education ministry statement has said. The country confirmed its fourth coronavirus case and has restricted flights from countries affected by the outbreak. During a live-streamed news conference with Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, Pence has said: \u201cIn every case, people are being treated and by all accounts are doing well.\u201d Only one American with coronavirus remains in hospital, the US vice president Mike Pence has said. Google will cancel an upcoming summit and restrict staff travel after confirming that an employee has been diagnosed with coronavirus. The staff member diagnosed with the illness is in the company\u2019s Zurich, Switzerland office, a Google spokesman told CNBC on Friday. The office will remain open. We can confirm that one employee from our Zurich office has been diagnosed with the coronavirus. They were in the Zurich office for a limited time, before they had any symptoms. We have taken \u2014 and will continue to take \u2014 all necessary precautionary measures, following the advice of public health officials, as we prioritise everyone\u2019s health and safety. The diagnosis comes as tech companies scramble to respond to the virus, which has infected at least 84,000 people worldwide. Google cancelled its Google News Initiative summit, which was scheduled to take place in Sunnyvale, California in late April. Major companies, including IBM and Verizon, pulled out of annual cybersecurity conference RSA in San Francisco this week and Facebook cancelled its upcoming F8 developer conference in May. Meanwhile, Amazon has begun to restrict all nonessential employee travel in the U.S. and has restricted all travel to China \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The British cruise ship turned away by the Dominican Republic is awaiting approval to dock on the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten, officials say. According to the Associated Press, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines said it had reported a small number of influenza-like cases on board that did not appear linked to the new coronavirus \u2013 and that the patients had recovered. The ship sailed to the island and is awaiting approval to dock there, local port officials have said. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll has reached 21 and some 820 people have been infected, the civil protection chief has said, while number of those who have recovered from the virus is increasing. Authorities say all the victims were elderly people who had also been suffering from other health issues. Lombardy\u2019s governor, Attilio Fontana, says the situation intensified sharply in Lodi, near Milan, on Thursday; with a sudden spike in the number of people hospitalised. \u201cUnfortunately another emergency broke out in Lodi overnight,\u201d Fontana, who has put himself into self isolation after a regional government employee tested positive, told La7 television. \u201cThere was a rush of hospitalisations yesterday afternoon with 51 people in a serious condition, including 17 who were put in intensive care.\u201d Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed the latest case is a resident of Surrey and it that it\u2019s working with the county council to manage the situation. Dr Alison Barnett, the centre director for PHE South East, said: Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19. One of the latest cases is a resident of Surrey and we\u2019re working closely with NHS colleagues in that area as well as Surrey county council to manage the situation and help reduce the risk of further cases. Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case. This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public. Surrey county council\u2019s interim director of public health, Ruth Hutchinson, added: Surrey county council is working with health colleagues to do everything we can to stop the virus spreading and ensure the people of Surrey are protected. Good hygiene is the best prevention and there are some simple steps you can take to protect you and your family by washing your hands regularly and thoroughly, and if you cough, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. The Department of Health and Social Care has said the virus was passed on in the UK but the original source of the virus was \u201cunclear\u201d. It added that there was no \u201cimmediately identifiable link\u201d to overseas travel. The virus was passed on in the UK but the original source of the virus is unclear at this stage. We do not currently have complete understanding of the chain of transmission in this case, but there is no immediately identifiable link to overseas travel. Given the recent increases in international case numbers, especially Europe, it is highly likely that we will soon see some instances of community transmission in the UK. Whitty has said: One further patient in England has tested positive for Covid-19. The virus was passed on in the UK. It is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019. The total number of cases in England is now 18. Following confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 20. A further patient in England has tested positive for coronavirus and the illness was passed on in the UK, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said. Amazon tells employees to defer all non-essential travel Amazon has said all employees should defer non-essential travel, including within the US, in a significant escalation by the world\u2019s largest online retailer to guard against the spread of the coronavirus among its ranks. Dave Clark, the senior vice president of worldwide operations, notified employees of the change on Thursday, which Amazon confirmed to Reuters. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has accused the media of stoking fear over the coronavirus as a plot to take down Donald Trump, Politico reports. Speaking at a conservative activist conference in Maryland, Mulvaney suggested the coronavirus was not as serious as other viral outbreaks. At any particular time, 20 million people in this country are going to have the flu. The flu kills people, it does. This is not Ebola, OK? And I\u2019ll tell you what that means in a sense. It\u2019s not Sars. It\u2019s not Mers. Why do we say that? When you look at the severity of diseases, one of the ways you can look at it is looking at the percentage of people who get it who die. I know that\u2019s sort of hard-hearted, but that\u2019s sort of how we look at it. But Mulvaney added that the US would \u201cprobably\u201d experience school closures as Covid-19 continued to spread around the world. Are you going to see some schools shut down? Probably. May you see impacts on public transportation? Sure. But we do this. We know how to handle this. So, that\u2019s one of the things \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of message you try to get out. There are professionals who know how to handle this.\u201d You can keep up with all our live US political coverage here: Boris Johnson has said that taking measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus is his government\u2019s top priority and that the public is right to be concerned, in his first television appearance to talk about the issue. The prime minister said: \u201cOn the issue of coronavirus, which obviously is a great concern to people, I just want to reassure everybody and say that the NHS is making every possible preparation. As you can imagine, the issue of coronavirus is something that is now the government\u2019s top priority. \u201cI have just had a meeting with the chief medical officer and secretary of state for health, talking about the preparations that we need to make.\u201d He added that he would be chairing a meeting of ministers and officials on the subject on Monday. Four more people have died in Italy from coronavirus, Reuters reports the country\u2019s civil protection agency as saying on Friday. The latest deaths bring the total in Italy to 21, while the number of those testing positive for the illness jumped to 821 from 650 the day before. The outbreak, which began last week in Italy\u2019s northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, has made the country the hardest-hit in Europe and has led to draconian measures and a sharp reduction in economic activity. Lombardy will ask the government to maintain the containment measures implemented against the outbreak for at least another week, the regional government said on Friday. Antonia Wilson, a reporter on the Guardian\u2019s travel desk, has investigated which countries currently have travel restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak. She writes: International travellers are facing tighter restrictions at airports as the number of countries denying entry to passengers who have recently visited China, Italy and other regions with reported cases of coronavirus increases. Cases of Covid-19 have now been confirmed in 58 countries. Restrictions are becoming more widespread, and major airports are putting preventive measures in place. A document featured on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) website, lists countries where restrictions are in place. Read more: The Vatican has dismissed speculation that Pope Francis is anything more than \u201cslightly unwell\u201d after he cancelled official audiences for a second day, Reuters is reporting. Francis, 83, appeared to have a cold and spoke with a slightly hoarse voice at his general audience on Wednesday. He coughed during an afternoon Ash Wednesday service in a Rome church, his last appearance outside the Vatican. Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, said on Friday morning that the pope had celebrated early morning mass as usual. \u201cBut he thought it was best to postpone today\u2019s official audiences. The meetings scheduled to take place in Santa Marta will take place regularly,\u201d Bruni said. Later, Bruni said: \u201cThere is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition. Even this afternoon, the Holy Father\u2019s meetings continued in Santa Marta.\u201d However, he conceded that the pope was still \u201cslightly unwell\u201d. A GP in Surrey is being taken to one of the UK\u2019s six specialist centres for infectious diseases amid fears he is the latest British case of coronavirus, Denis Campbell, the Guardian\u2019s health policy editor, reports. The development is understood to have triggered an urgent investigation to see if any of his patients have the coronavirus too. The case \u2013 which would be the 20th to emerge in the UK \u2013 has prompted particular concern among health officials trying to limit the spread of Covid-19. The GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week before he became ill in the last 24 hours. His diagnosis has yet to be publicly confirmed by Public Health England (PHE), NHS England or the Department of Health and Social Care. Public health chiefs are also worried by the unnamed doctor\u2019s diagnosis because his wife is also a GP. Read more: Iceland has confirmed its first case of Covid-19, local media reports. The man is in isolation at Landsp\u00edtali hospital after testing positive for the virus. The man is reportedly not seriously ill, but tested positive for coronavirus after recently returning from northern Italy \u2013 but outside the area considered especially high risk for catching the virus. Boris Johnson is under fire from opposition parties for waiting until next week to chair a Cobra meeting on the coronavirus outbreak. The meeting is scheduled to be held on Monday. Labour has accused Johnson of acting as a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cOur part-time prime minister needs to get a grip of this escalating situation quickly. It shouldn\u2019t take another three days for this meeting to take place.\u201d The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said: \u201cPeople across the country are anxious and concerned about coronavirus. They want to see leadership. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats called on Boris Johnson to chair a Cobra meeting weeks ago to ensure everything was being done to prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak. With the NHS already so stretched, it\u2019s gobsmacking that the prime minister has delayed chairing Cobra for so long. \u201cJust like his failure to visit communities hit by flooding, on coronavirus Johnson seems like he\u2019d rather bury his head in the sand than hear for himself what the experts are saying and what his ministers are doing.\u201d Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, says it is considering how to manage the dangers of a coronavirus outbreak disrupting this summer\u2019s GCSE and A-level exams, Richard Adams, education editor, reports. Students are due to sit A-levels \u2013 crucial for university entry \u2013 in May and June, but a widespread outbreak of Covid-19 at that point could mean that, in worst-case scenarios, students and staff may be unable to take the exams due to illness or quarantine restrictions. In a statement Ofqual said: \u201cWe are working closely with awarding organisations and the Department for Education to consider how to manage any particular risks to the smooth running of exams and assessments should there be a widespread outbreak of coronavirus. \u201cWe will update our existing guidance to reflect any specific arrangements schools and colleges should put in place if required. In the meantime, students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer exams and assessments as usual.\u201d A-levels and GCSEs are taken from the second week of May until the middle of June, with exam results published in mid-August. Disrupted A-level results could complicate the process of university applications, which rely in most cases on students gaining specific exam results. But in a period of difficulty universities may use other methods to allot places, such as previous exam results. The Foreign Office has confirmed the death of a Briton who was onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A spokesman said: \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Japan and are in contact with local authorities. Our sympathies and thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\u201d The WHO has said that the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of Covid-19 is now \u201cvery high at global level\u201d. The director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva that the continued increase in the number of coronavirus cases and in the number of affected countries over the last days was \u201cclearly of concern\u201d but there was still a chance it could be contained. China\u2019s 329 reported cases in the past 24 hours was the lowest figure there in more than a month, he added. There were more than 20 vaccines in development globally and several therapeutics were in clinical trials, Tedros said, and we could expect the first results in a few weeks time. Aer Lingus has confirmed that the person from Northern Ireland infected with Covid-19 travelled on the airline to Dublin airport. In a statement the airline said: \u201cAer Lingus can confirm that the patient in Northern Ireland who has been diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus travelled with the airline from northern Italy to Dublin. \u201cAer Lingus is co-operating fully with the HSE in relation to the Covid-19 developments and is liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs, other government departments and the relevant authorities as required. \u201cAer Lingus will continue to assess the situation based on the guidance received.\u201d Stocks are falling sharply in New York, as the coronavirus market rout continues. The Dow dropped by 761 points at the start of trading. That\u2019s a drop of 2.96%, to 25,005 points. The S&amp;P 500 is down just over 3%, and the technology-focused Nasdaq dropped by 3.1%. You can follow our live business coverage here: Moscow authorities are deporting 88 foreign nationals who violated quarantine measures imposed on them as a precaution against coronavirus, the RIA news agency cited the city\u2019s deputy mayor as saying on Friday. Hundreds of people have been quarantined in Russia and Moscow authorities have carried out raids on potential carriers of the virus \u2013 individuals at their homes or hotels \u2013 and used facial recognition technology to enforce quarantine measures. My colleague Kim Willsher, our Paris correspondent, reports: A woman from Cannes has tested positive for the coronavirus, the first in the C\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019Azur region in the south of France. The 23-year-old was admitted to a special isolation unit in hospital in Nice after being found to be carrying the Covid-19 virus on Friday following a visit to Milan in Lombardy. The authorities are waiting for the results of tests on a second person from the area. David Lisnard, the mayor of Cannes, said the woman\u2019s condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d. He said he had been in contact with the regional health agency and was reassured there was \u201cno particular cause for concern for the public health authorities\u201d. An investigation is under way to trace anyone with whom the patient was in contact. Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, who is seeking re-election in municipal elections next month, said he would be reducing the time spent campaigning. Estrosi announced that the Nice carnival this weekend was cancelled as a \u201cpreventative measure\u201d. The nearby town of Menton has cancelled its annual F\u00eate du Citron (Lemon F\u00eate), a series of events due to be held over the weekend. The Cannes film festival committee said it was monitoring developments and said it was too early to say whether the event would go ahead. The 73rd annual festival is due to take place from 12-23 May. \u201cIn due course and depending on the occurrences, the Festival de Cannes will naturally take all the necessary measures to ensure the protection of all those attending and to preserve their health during the Cannes event,\u201d a spokesperson told Variety. Mexican authorities have confirmed the country\u2019s first two cases of coronavirus, among the few confirmed cases in Latin America, says Reuters. The two men had travelled recently to Italy, where they had been in direct contact with an Italian national who resides in Malaysia, the deputy health minister Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell Ram\u00edrez, told reporters. A 35-year-old man with a possible coronavirus infection went through a second test that turned up positive early on Friday, L\u00f3pez-Gatell said. The man is in isolation in Mexico City. At least five family contacts have also been placed in isolation. His case is connected to the second confirmed case in the northern state of Sinaloa, which is still pending the results of a second test. The coronavirus could reach most \u201cif not all countries\u201d, the World Health Organization said on Friday after Nigeria confirmed sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s first case, Reuters is reporting. \u201cThe outbreak is getting bigger,\u201d Christian Lindmeier, a WHO spokesman, told a Geneva news briefing. \u201cThe scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while.\u201d Five more countries have reported their first case of Covid-19 \u2013 Nigeria, Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Lithuania. Estonia\u2019s social affairs minister Tanel Kiik said the affected individual in that country is an Iranian national resident in Estonia, who had not recently arrived in the country either by plane or by sea but by bus from Riga, Latvia. Lindmeier added that the WHO was looking very carefully into reports of some people getting re-infected. \u201cWe need to carefully look at how the tests were taken, how the person was examined, if it was maybe overlooked that the person still had the virus somewhere in the residue in the body, whether they got reinfected by different means or ways. We\u2019re not in a position to say it is possible or not to be coming back and being re-infected. \u201cIn general, we would expect that a person who had the coronavirus infection would be immune for at least a while afterwards. But again this is something we do not yet know.\u201d A British man who was onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has died from the coronavirus, the Japanese health ministry has confirmed. The first foreign passenger to die, his death brings the toll among passengers from the vessel to six. A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, which operates the Diamond Princess, said: \u201cAll of us at Princess Cruises, including the crew of the Diamond Princess, offer our sincere condolences to family members and friends for their loss. Our dedicated care team are on hand to provide support.\u201d Our Pablo Guti\u00e9rrez has created this set of maps illustrating how Covid-19 is spreading across the world. Prof Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, has responded to media reports of a dog in Hong Kong being tested \u201cweak positive\u201d for coronavirus. \u201cThere is no evidence that the human novel coronavirus can infect dogs and it would be incredible for a virus to make so many species jumps in such a short space of time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of a virus \u2013 these are very different \u2013 and the fact that the test result was weakly positive would suggest that this is environmental contamination or simply the presence of coronavirus shed from the human contact that has ended up in the dog\u2019s samples. \u201cIn truth this is incredibly irresponsible because the last thing we need to do is create mass hysteria about the possibility of dogs being infected, and therefore potentially transmitting this virus when there is absolutely no evidence for this whatsoever.\u201d Researchers at the Sacco hospital in Milan say they have isolated the Italian strain of the coronavirus, reports Lorenzo Tondo. The scientists say the discovery will help to develop a vaccine and new treatments to contain the virus. Early in February, Italian researchers from the Spallanzani hospital in Rome successfully isolated Covid-19, which allowed the country to immediately activate tests on patients. \u201cThe virus previously isolated by researchers at the Spallanzani hospital is precisely the Chinese one, originating in Wuhan, while the coronavirus that we have isolated prevents the viral strain spreading in Italy,\u201d Claudia Balotta, an immunologist at the Sacco hospital, told the Corriere della Sera. \u201cViruses reshuffle their genetic makeup to better bind to cells in the new host,\u201d Tullio Prestileo, a doctor of infectious diseases at the Benfratteli hospital in Palermo, told the Guardian. \u201cBy spreading from one country to another, the virus originating in Wuhan will obviously reshuffle its genetic patrimony and the virus strain in China will have some slight differences from the one in Italy or Germany.\u201d Thanks to the discovery, the Italian researchers believe they can now \u201ctrace the journey of the virus from China to Europe and detect the date of its first spread in the country\u201d. The GMB union is the latest body to issue a warning about the threat the coronavirus poses to workers in the gig economy. Mick Rix, the GMB national officer, said: The threat of Coronavirus is a huge problem for employers and workers across the UK. But workers in the so-called gig economy, or on zero-hours contracts, are left abandoned and penniless if they have to self-isolate. Once again the bogus self-employment model is screwing over the disadvantaged. GMB is calling on all employers \u2013 regardless of the contract \u2013 to do the right thing and pay their workers if they have to take time off due to the global health crisis. The union said that in one recent case a delivery driver was contacted by a customer who considered themselves high risk. The driver told the company, which instructed her not to come back into work. This meant she faced the prospect of not being able to earn any money until she was given the all-clear. Public Health England has issued new advice on the coronavirus in places of education. A revised poster issued this morning says: \u201cYou should wash hands with soap &amp; water or hand sanitiser \u2026 on arrival at any childcare or educational setting.\u201d. Nigeria\u2019s first confirmed coronovirus case entered the country on a Turkish Airlines flight that travelled via Istanbul, the Lagos state commissioner for health has told a news conference. In comments reported by Reuters, Akin Abayomi said the man, who travelled from Milan, Italy, and landed on the evening of 24 February, spent the night in a hotel near the airport, and continued to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state. He was treated on the evening of 26 February at his company\u2019s medical facility before health practitioners there called government biosecurity officers, who transferred him to a containment facility in Yaba, Lagos, the following day. The man is the first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa. The Geneva motor show has been postponed by six months, following Switzerland\u2019s ban on large gatherings. Organisers said it had become increasingly difficult for delegates to arrange visas, or fix flights to the show, given the escalating crisis over Covid-19. You can read the latest developments in our business live blog: Here\u2019s some more on the plans for a Cobra meeting: A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister is keen to chair Cobra on Monday to ensure that everything that can be done is being done.\u201d Boris Johnson spent four hours visiting Kettering hospital during the night shift on Thursday night. During his visit he spent time discussing preparations for dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak. The Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, Hannah Devlin, has this piece busting the most common coronavirus myths: The government is to hold an emergency Cobra meeting over the coronavirus outbreak on Monday. The Associated Press has this updated list of all the reported cases of coronavirus around the world: Mainland China: 2,788 deaths among 78,824 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. Hong Kong: 92 cases, 2 deaths. Macao: 10 cases. South Korea: 2,337 cases, 13 deaths. Japan: 927 cases, including 705 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 9 deaths. Italy: 650 cases, 15 deaths. Iran: 388 cases, 34 deaths. Singapore: 96. US: 60. Germany: 53. Kuwait: 45. Thailand: 41. France: 38 cases, 2 deaths. Bahrain: 36. Taiwan: 34 cases, 1 death. Malaysia: 25. Australia: 23. United Arab Emirates: 19. Spain: 17. Vietnam: 16. United Kingdom: 15. Canada: 14. Sweden: 7. Iraq: 6. Oman: 6. Russia: 5. Croatia: 5. Switzerland: 5. Greece: 4. Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death. India: 3. Israel: 3. Lebanon: 3. Pakistan: 2. Finland: 2. Austria: 2. Netherlands: 2. Egypt: 1. Algeria: 1. Afghanistan: 1. North Macedonia: 1. Georgia: 1. Estonia: 1. Lithuania: 1. Belgium: 1. Romania: 1. Belarus: 1. Nepal: 1. Sri Lanka: 1. Cambodia: 1. Norway: 1. Denmark: 1. Brazil: 1. New Zealand: 1. Nigeria: 1. Azerbaijan: 1. Health authorities in Ireland have said that people who sat within two rows of the person from Northern Ireland infected with Covid-19 on the plane from northern Italy to Dublin have been contacted. PA Media said the woman followed advice in reporting concerns to a GP, and \u201cself-isolated\u201d at home while awaiting the results of testing. The Irish health chief, Dr John Cuddihy, said: Each of the stages of this person\u2019s journey have been identified and all relevant contacts in all of those stages of transport have been contacted (and) traced. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, and the head of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, Dr Cuddihy, held a news conference in Dublin to provide details of Ireland\u2019s preparedness. Dr Holohan said they were depending on an individual with symptoms travelling back from an affected area identifying themselves, contacting the local health authorities, and that was what had happened in this particular case. The former chancellor and Evening Standard editor, George Osborne, says its time for the government to go on a \u201cwar footing\u201d with the coronavirus: So coronavirus has finally arrived in sub-saharan Africa, with an Italian man who arrived in Nigeria three days ago becoming the country\u2019s first case of the disease. The case is in Lagos, a massive overcrowded city, which will raise fears that the virus might already have spread in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, and possibly further afield. Nigeria is a major hub for air transport, commerce and culture. It has deep links with China, with continual and substantial traffic of people and goods. However, this first confirmed case appears to have originated in Italy. The WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has warned that the \u201cwindow of opportunity the continent has had to prepare for coronavirus disease is closing\u201d. Egypt had the first case of Covid-19 in Africa, announced on 14 February. Algeria declared it had a case on Tuesday \u2013 another Italian adult who arrived in the country on 17 February. Earlier this month, officials at the WHO warned that porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems meant the risk of an outbreak across Africa was \u201cvery, very high\u201d and raised significant concerns about the ability of \u201cfragile health systems\u201d to cope with the epidemic. But recent weeks have been used to reinforce testing regimes, isolation facilities and for public messaging too. \u201cNigeria has dramatically improved its ability to manage the outbreak of a major pandemic since the Ebola scare in west Africa in 2014. Many of the lessons from keeping the country free of Ebola have informed the steps taken since the news of the coronavirus epidemic first broke,\u201d wrote Folasade Ogunsola, professor of Clinical Microbiology, University of Lagos, on The Conversation website. A further two coronavirus cases have been confirmed in England, bringing the total to 19. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said: Two further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19. The virus was passed on in Iran and the patients have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres at the Royal Free Hospital. The total number of cases in England is now 17. Following confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 19. Wales\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton, said in a statement: I can confirm that one patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19). All appropriate measures to provide care for the individual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken. I can also confirm that the patient had travelled back to Wales from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents. Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public. A coronavirus case has been confirmed in Wales, in a patient who had returned from Italy. This takes the total number of UK cases to 17. While the government has not put anybody forward to be interviewed about the coronavirus this morning, Jeremy Hunt, the chairman of the Commons health committee and former Tory health secretary, has been on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said we need to consider the \u201csocial and economic trade-offs\u201d we are willing to make to contain Covid-19. In Wuhan, it appears that it has peaked at less than 5% of the population getting it. And we are having to make contingency plans for 70% of the population getting it, and in terms of the number of lives lost, there is a massive difference, hundreds of thousands of lives difference, if you can contain it to less than 5%. And, so, the question we have to ask ourselves, and I think the government is right to start to spell this out \u2013 but I think they need to go further \u2013 is what are the social and economic trade-offs that we are prepared to make to keep the spread of the virus at that low level. We are starting to hear some of the things that the government is considering. We are a mature democracy and I think it is perfectly possible to count on the co-operation of the public to comply with guidelines and recommendations made by the government without the kind of authoritarian measures that we have seen on our TV screens. The trade union umbrella body, the TUC, is urging employers to give workers time off to seek medical advice if they feel they are developing symptoms of coronavirus. The organisation says many people are at risk of getting no financial support when sick because their pay is too low or they are on zero-hours contracts. The TUC warned that almost 2 million workers do not earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay, including one in 10 working women. They said that people forced to self-isolate because of the virus, and those who become ill, should not lose out on pay. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: Employers have a duty of care to support workers affected by coronavirus. No one should have to worry about making ends meet if they have to self-isolate or if they fall ill. They should be able to focus on getting better. The threat of coronavirus shows why sick pay should be a day one right for everybody. It\u2019s not right that millions of UK workers miss out on this protection. The government must ensure everyone gets statutory sick pay, however much they earn. Reuters is reporting that Kuwait has confirmed two more cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 45. A health ministry official said there had been no deaths and that those infected had either travelled to Iran or been contaminated by people who went there. European stock markets have, as we feared, tumbled at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index of the biggest UK-listed companies has hit its lowest level since December 2018 (corrected). It\u2019s down a further 2.8%, or 188 points, at 6607. That means it\u2019s lost about 10% of its value this week. We\u2019ve not seen such a slump since since the eurozone crisis of 2011, and the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Two airlines have warned that their earnings are being hit by the crisis. IAG, which owns British Airways, said business travel has been hit by the cancellations of various trade fairs, and corporate travel restrictions. Budget airline easyJet reported it is cutting flights to Italy, and implementing \u201crecruitment, promotion and pay freezes\u201d across its network as it tries to cut costs. Germany\u2019s Dax is also suffering fresh losses, down another 3.6%, as investors fear the coronavirus outbreak will cause a global recession. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: Global stocks have entered correction territory and it\u2019s now that we can start to consider the market is entering the period of peak fear. Our business live blog has more details. Guardian US reporter Amanda Holpuch writes about the unique challenges the US might face in tackling the coronavirus: The US health agency overseeing coronavirus has told Americans that to curb the inevitable spread of the respiratory illness, they only need to take simple steps: wash your hands, stay home from work if you feel sick and speak to a doctor if you have symptoms of the disease. But in the US healthcare system, things are never as simple as they seem. From the cost of healthcare to the lack of guaranteed paid sick days in the US, experts say containing the coronavirus requires systemic change beyond more people washing their hands. \u201cFor many Americans who have insurance and have a good job with an understanding employer, and I\u2019m not an expert on the labor market, those recommendations are plausible,\u201d David Blumenthal, president of the global health thinktank the Commonwealth Fund, told the Guardian. \u201cThey are not necessarily workable for people who have no health insurance or poor health insurance \u2013 so that\u2019s about a fifth of the American population.\u201d Here\u2019s a reminder of the situation in the UK: As of 27 February, a total of 7,690 people have been tested in the UK, of which 7,675 were confirmed negative and 15 positive. (The Department of health updates the figures every day at 2pm.) The official advice to Brits returning from abroad is to call NHS 111, stay indoors and avoid contact with other people immediately if you\u2019ve travelled from: Hubei province in China in the last 14 days, even if you do not have symptoms. Iran, lockdown areas in northern Italy or special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, even if you do not have symptoms. Other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan or Thailand in the last 14 days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are mild). Other parts of northern Italy (anywhere north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar or Vietnam since 19 February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are mild). After President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s warning on Thursday that France was on the brink of a coronavirus epidemic, officials there have announced 20 new cases emerging in the past 24 hours. A dozen cases are centred in the Oise area of northern France, which has emerged as one of the most significant clusters, and concern has homed in on connections to the 110 military airbase in Creil. Although the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said France was not yet in an epidemic he said the country was prepared for one. Two other French citizens who had recently returned from a trip to Egypt were reported hospitalised in Dijon and Brest. Another individual, in Annecy, had recently returned from northern Italy. Good morning from London. One hundred and sixty-eight Britons remain confined to the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after at least four guests were diagnosed with coronavirus. Sources told the PA Media news agency that about 50 of them will be allowed to leave if they wish. The minister of health in Tenerife said about 130 guests from 11 different countries will be able to leave the hotel if they arrived on Monday, after infected guests had already left. Airline Jet2 has said it will not fly back any people who have been staying at the hotel until they have tested negative for the illness. We will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have been explicitly tested for Covid-19 by a recognised authority and are confirmed as clear of the virus. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleagues in London shortly, but here\u2019s a quick look at the latest developments. The virus has now spread to about 49 countries, with New Zealand, Belarus, Lithuania, and Nigeria (the first case in sub-Saharan Africa) reporting their first cases in the last day. Many are linked to travellers from Iran. Markets around the world have taken huge hits, and the Chinese economy has seen its worst slump in two decades. The UN security council has decided to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea to help it fend off the virus. Pyongyang still says it has no reported cases. All passengers and crew are now off the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The ability of the US vice-president, Mike Penc,e to lead the country\u2019s response has been questioned by experts. UK schools and offices could close for up to two months if the country is hit by a pandemic. Tokyo\u2019s Disneyland and DisneySea will be closed until mid March. Hyundai has suspended manufacturing at its factory in Ulsan. The bloodletting has ended \u2013 for now \u2013 in some key Asia Pacific markets. They\u2019re still going in China and getting ready for heavy losses in Europe and the US. The Nikkei has closed down 3.67% in Tokyo In Sydney the ASX200 finished off 3.2%. The Kospi ended 3.6% worse off. Hang Seng currently down 2.65% Shanghai down 2.95% The MSCI world index has fallen fell 0.6% and is down 9.4% this week. It\u2019s on course for its biggest weekly decline since November 2008. London and Wall Street both set for heavy losses at the opening The VIx volatility index has spiked to 39, its highest since 2011 Brent crude oil is down almost 3% and threatening to go below $50 a barrel Safe havens such as gold and the yen are up. US government 10-year bond yields are at record lows as investors seek security (yields are inverse to bond prices). Belarus has reported its first coronavirus case, an Iranian student who arrived in the country from Azerbaijan last week, AFP reports. The health ministry said the patient was in a \u201csatisfactory\u201d condition. People with whom the student had been in contact since their arrival on 22 February had been placed in quarantine in the hospital for infectious diseases in the capital, Minsk, it added in a statement. The ministry also said that there would now be health checks on anyone arriving in the country from Italy - the worst affected country in Europe - Iran and South Korea. Travellers from China were already subject to such controls. New Zealand heath and government authorities are detailing the country\u2019s responses, and the individual case which has been reported today. It\u2019s a New Zealand citizen who recently returned from Iran, and they are improving. Public health will be contacting people who were in the same row, and the two rows ahead and behind the person on their final leg - a flight from Bali on 26 February. They\u2019ll be required to self-isolate for 14 days, under regular communication with local public health. The chance of a community outbreak remains low. \u201cThe risk of this disease is being very well managed,\u201d said health minister David Clark, adding that all protocols have been put in place. When they arrived back in New Zealand they traveled home in a private car and then called health workers when they began to feel unwell. \u201cThey followed all of the steps you\u2019d hope would be followed,\u201d said Clark. They tested negative twice before testing positive. New Zealand is the 48th country to identify a case of the virus, Clark said, although a widespread outbreak was still thought to be unlikely. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield added: \u201cWe have been preparing for this for some weeks, and we are ready.\u201d \u201cA range of cross government groups are working together\u201d and guided by the pandemic plan, said Clark. \u201cWe are well prepared because we\u2019ve had time to be prepared.\u201d Border restrictions have minimised the chance of further cases arriving. He said his main message to the community was for anyone concerned to ring the helpline number 0800 358 5453, use good handwashing hygiene and cough etiquette. We are expecting a press conference from New Zealand authorities shortly, on the case detected there. In the meantime we have a few more details from AFP. Health officials said the person, reportedly a woman aged in her 60s, was being treated in Auckland City Hospital, and they are \u201cin an improving condition in isolation\u201d. Officials said the person arrived in Auckland on Wednesday and family members went to the hospital after becoming concerned about the individual\u2019s condition. The officials urged any passengers on Wednesday\u2019s final leg of the Emirates airline journey, which goes from Bali to Auckland, to contact authorities if they were concerned. However, authorities downplayed the risk to the public saying the situation was being well managed. \u201cAlthough we have our first case of Covid-19, the chances of community outbreak remain low,\u201d the statement said. AFP has written about the measures being taken in Beijing to control the spread of the virus, amid fears there could be a resurgence. There was a fresh cluster of cases this week, and two deaths reported on Friday. This week, Beijing authorities announced new rules in a bid to disperse crowds in the city of over twenty million people, including many migrant workers from other regions. Supermarkets must allow an average of two square metres per customer - a mandate which not only forces shops to track how many patrons enter, but also means shoppers have to wait outside once stores hit maximum capacity. To prevent crowds from gathering, Beijing authorities have also tightened admission into its parks, especially as spring approaches. After a spike of activity over the weekend, reported official news agency Xinhua on Tuesday, the city\u2019s park authority has clamped down on the flow of visitors. Ten of the capital\u2019s top parks, including the historic Summer Palace, will cap the number of visitors at any given time to 30 percent of their maximum capacity, said Xinhua. The Sacramento Bee is reporting three students living in dormitories at UC Davis has been placed in isolation after one showed \u201cmild\u201d symptoms of the virus. The student has a runny nose and a cough after potentially being exposed to someone with coronavirus, officials said. The individual is in isolation at a home off campus. The two other individuals in isolation are the student\u2019s roommates and are not showing signs of the virus. Important info for New Zealanders who have traveled recently. Capital Economics says China\u2019s economy will shrink in the first quarter of this year despite the slowdown in the number of new virus cases. Activity is still subdued in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, Capital says, and the impact on domestic demand and international supply chains will have a profound effect on the global outlook. The consultancy, which has a page monitoring economic activity in China which is open to the public, says: The extended disruption from efforts to contain COVID-19 means that China\u2019s economy is already in the midst of the deepest contraction in at least two decades. And the potential hit to foreign demand and supply chains from the global spread of the virus risks dampening the subsequent recovery. Lithuania has reported its first case of the virus, in a woman who returned this week from a visit to Italy\u2019s northern city of Verona. In a statement, the Lithuanian government said the woman had been isolated in hospital in the northern town of Siauliai following her return on Monday. She has been under observation since, and is showing only slight symptoms, with no elevated temperature at the moment, it added. There are also more details about the case in Nigeria, the first for sub-Saharan Africa, via Reuters. The country\u2019s health minister Osagie Ehanire, said in a statement the case was an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria and returned from Milan, Italy to Lagos on 25 February. His infection was confirmed by the Virology Laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, part of the Laboratory Network of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. \u201cThe patient is clinically stable, with no serious symptoms,\u201d said the minister, adding that he was being treated at a hospital in the Lagos district of Yaba. \u201cWe have already started working to identify all the contacts of the patient, since he entered Nigeria,\u201d said Ehanire. New Zealand has confirmed the first case of the virus, according to RNZ. It\u2019s reporting the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has confirmed the diagnosis in a permanent resident of New Zealand who had recently been in Iran. Things are going from bad to worse on the financial markets with the selloff intensifying throughout the Asian trading session. The Nikkei is down 4.12% in Tokyo ASX200 in Sydney is down 3%. In Seoul, the Kospi index has lost 2.87% Hong Kong has shed 2.5% Shanghai is off by 3.37% after escaping the worst in the last few days. MSCI world index down 0.5% after 3.3% drop on Thursday. It is off 9.3% this week, on course for its biggest weekly decline since a 9.8% plunge in November 2008. The Vix volatility index \u2013 also known as the fear index \u2013 spiked to 39, its highest since the European debt crisis of 2011. Brent crude oil is down 2.2% at $51.01 per barrel Currencies seen as risky bets such as the Australia dollar, the Indonesian rupiah and the Indian rupee were sharply down. Safe havens such as gold, Japanese yen and US government bonds were up. AFP: Internet search giant Baidu has warned the deadly coronavirus outbreak could drive revenues down in the first quarter, as it reported steady annual revenue growth. The Beijing-based group has forecast a plunge of between five percent and 13 percent due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the new virus, which is rapidly spreading around the world. It is forecasting revenues between 21.0 billion yuan ($3.0 billion) and 22.9 billion yuan in the first three months of the year. \u201cThe coronavirus situation in China is evolving, and business visibility is very limited,\u201d the firm said in its statement, adding that the outlook was \u201csubject to substantial uncertainty\u201d. The operator of Tokyo\u2019s two Disney resorts, Disneyland and DisneySea, said Friday the parks would be closed for around two weeks on fears over the outbreak of the new coronavirus. \u201cTokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea have decided to proceed with an extraordinary closure from Saturday February 29, 2020, through Sunday 15 March\u201d, after the government urged measures to limit the spread of the virus, the operator said in a statement. The operator Oriental Land said it currently hoped to resume operations from 16 March. \u201cCurrently, we plan to reopen on March 16. But we\u2019ll decide when to open by looking at the situation and developments. We\u2019ll also consult (official) agencies concerned,\u201d a spokesman told AFP. Hong Kong\u2019s Disneyland Resort remains closed \u201cas a precautionary measure in line with preventive efforts\u201d against the coronavirus. Coronavirus chaos is causing congestion as high trade volumes clog the systems of brokers. \u201cWe are seeing high volumes of trading today,\u201d onliner broker Commsec, which is owned by the Commonwealth Bank, says in a message to website customers. \u201cPlease be advised that our contact centres are busier than usual and you may experience longer than usual wait times.\u201d At about 2.45pm on Friday the benchmark ASX200 index was down 2.9%, with the falls led by the Harvey Norman retail empire controlled by Gerry Harvey. Harvey Norman shares have plummeted more than 11% so far today. While other retails have suffered from coronavirus contagion this week, until today, when it released a disappointing profit result, the Harvey Norman empire had largely escaped unscathed. Also smashed were gold miners Gold Road Resources - down 14% - and Silver Lake resources, which was down more than 10.5%. But every sector has been hammered today, with all but 13 stocks in the index recording a fall. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton says Australia has \u201cone of the toughest border protection system in the world, and probably the best health system in the world\u201d and is well prepared. He urged Australians to continue to go out and support communities and small businesses, and travel, especially to bushfire affected areas of NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. New Zealand said on Friday that it was placing temporary restrictions on incoming travellers from Iran as a precautionary measure to protect against the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis means people will not be able to travel from Iran to New Zealand and anyone who has been in Iran in the last 14 days will need to self-isolate,\u201d Health Minister David Clark said in a statement. The death toll in Iran from coronavirus had risen to 26, by far the highest number outside China. New Zealand also decided not to allow any exemptions for overseas students from China to enter the country. Clark added there would be an increased presence of health staff that would meet direct international flights landing at New Zealand airports from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Hyundai has suspended production at one of its South Korean factories, in the city of Ulsan, after a worker tested positive for the virus, a union source has told Reuters. A Hyundai spokesman said the company was checking the report. Shares of the automaker dropped more than 5% after the news, while the wider market was down 2.6%. Some developments in business and finance: Hyundai, the South Korean carmaker, has suspended production at a factory in Ulsan after one of its workers tested positive for the virus. Shares of the automaker dropped more than 5% after the news, while the wider Korean market was down 2.6%. Tokyo Disneyland says it will be closed until mid-March because of concerns about transmission in large crowds. Both Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea will be closed starting Saturday, the theme parks\u2019 operators, Oriental Land, said on Friday. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe said on Friday that the government had reserve funding it could use to tackle the hit from the virus. \u201cI\u2019m aware of views that if the virus spreads, it could have a huge impact on the economy,\u201d Abe told parliament. \u201cWe\u2019re therefore watching developments carefully.\u201d Futures in Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, have fallen 1.7% to $50.83 a barrel, a 14-month low. Fears of a major economic slump also sent US crude futures to $46.28 per barrel. From AP: K-pop superstar group BTS has canceled a series of planned concerts in Seoul in April due to concerns about a soaring viral outbreak in South Korea. The band\u2019s management agency said Friday: \u201cWe regret to announce that the BTS MAP OF THE SOUL TOUR ... has been cancelled.\u201d A statement from Big Hit Entertainment says the band was supposed to perform on April 11-12 and April 18-19 at Seoul\u2019s Olympic Stadium. It said the Covid-19 \u201coutbreak has made it impossible at this time to predict the scale of the outbreak during the dates of the concert in April.\u201d Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish are among riders who will be tested for the coronavirus after the UAE Tour was cancelled on Thursday when two participants contracted Covid-19. The final two stages of the race were due to take place on Friday and Saturday but the race was abandoned when the Italian duo were taken ill. All riders and staff were confined to their rooms at the Crowne Royal Plaza Abu Dhabi Yas Island, with concerns that the potential outbreak could now extend to the UCI world track championships in Berlin after some riders who took part in the early stage of the UAE Tour already in Germany. From Reuters: Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the U.S. Congress on Thursday that his agency is aggressively evaluating how long coronavirus can survive and be infectious on surfaces. \u201cOn copper and steel its pretty typical, it\u2019s pretty much about 2 hours,\u201d Redfield said at a House of Representatives hearing on the government response to the fast-spreading virus. \u201cBut I will say on other surfaces - cardboard or plastic - it\u2019s longer, and so we are looking at this.\u201d He said infections contracted from surfaces rather than through the air could have contributed to the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. There are few details yet, but Nigeria has reported one case of the virus detected. This is the first case in sub-Saharan Africa. The case was confirmed on 27 February, the health ministry said. Asia Pacific stocks are being hammered for the fifth day running as investors scramble to offload shares and other risky assets. The Nikkei is down 3.2% in Tokyo and the ASX200 in Sydney is down 2.4%. In Seoul, the market is down 2.3%, Hong Kong has shed 2% and Shanghai is off by 1.7%. It follows a record points loss on Wall Street on Thursday. Safe havens benefited in contrast. US 10-year bond yields hit another record low 1.241%. It last stood at 1.274%. The move indicates a strong likelihood of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year. Tomoaki Shishido, senior economist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said the Fed would not even have to wait for data to make up its mind: We don\u2019t even need to wait for economic data to see how badly the economy is being hit. You can tell that the sales of airlines and hotels are already falling by a half or something like that. It is fair to say the impact of the coronavirus will be clearly much bigger than the US-China trade war. So the Fed does not have a reason to take a wait-and-see stance next month. The chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, says part of Australia\u2019s planning is setting up dedicated primary care clinics to try to get people who get infection to isolate at home and delay the spread. He said it\u2019s significant that children seem to be less affected by this virus on the evidence so far. One of the surprising features about this is how few children seem to have been identified as infected. That is very unusual compared to, say, influenza. We don\u2019t know whether children are getting the disease but also mild they are not being picked up as being sick or they are somehow less susceptible. That will be an important thing to find out. Whatever the reason, the fact that we\u2019re not seeing lots of children getting sick in China other parts of the world is a great thing. Hunt was also asked about the Olympics in Japan later this year: \u201cThe question of the Olympics will be determined in some months. Japan and the IOC will be making global decisions and Australia will be a part of those discussions,\u201d he says. The health minister, Greg Hunt, says the government has led an advanced primary care planning process, working with doctors and with specialists around the country, including in aged care facilities. But Hunt says the main message Australians is to \u201cgo about your ordinary business\u201d. Murphy says being flexible in responding to the virus is key: We don\u2019t quite know how this virus, if it comes to Australia, will behave. And if it will be a slow or a rapid spread. We just need to be prepared for all eventualities. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is speaking now. He says more than 80% of people who get coronavirus have a mild disease, and reassures Australians that the situation is well prepared for. \u201cAt this stage we are still contained inAustralia. We do not have any evidence whatsoever of community transmission\u201d. \u201cOur concern of course is preparing for any patients who have the more severe delays who need hospital treatment and respiratory and other support. I do want to reiterate though that at this stage, we are still contained in Australia. \u201cNo one should go around wasting face masks,\u201d he says, adding it is \u201cvery likely we will get some more cases in Australia\u201d in the coming weeks. We\u2019re hearing from Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. He says the federal government will lead an advanced primary planning process, including an aged care planning process as part of its emergency response to the coronavirus outbreak. Australia enacted its pandemic plan on Thursday. Peru has put specialists on round-the-clock shifts at its biggest airport, in preparation for the emergence of Covid-19, and begun setting up specialist mobile units. South Korea\u2019s centres for disease control and prevention reported 256 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the total number of infected in the country to 2,022. 182 of the new cases were in the southeastern city of Daegu, the location of a church at the centre of South Korea\u2019s outbreak. The death toll is unchanged, at 13. Coronavirus fears are spreading to the Caribbean, where several countries are turning cruise ships away from their ports, Bloomberg reports. On Thursday local officials in the Dominican Republic refused to let passengers off the Braemer, with about 1,500 people on board. The company reportedly labeled this an \u201coverreaction\u201d, due to a \u201csmall number of influenza-like cases on board\u201d, while also saying no guests or crew had shown symptoms consistent with coronavirus. In Cozumel, Mexico, passengers on the MSC Meraviglia are waiting for test results after the ship was refused docking in Jamaica and GRand Cayman. From AFP: The UN Security Council on Thursday declared that it would adopt humanitarian exemptions to the heavy economic sanctions imposed on North Korea to help the impoverished country fight the novel coronavirus, Germany\u2019s ambassador to the UN said. \u201cThe coronavirus issue was discussed and the committee immediately had given permission to export the equipment\u201d used to fight the illness, said Christoph Heusgen, who heads the United Nations body that applies the sanctions imposed on Pyongyang in an effort to force it to give up its ballistic and nuclear programs. Ill-equipped North Korea has weak medical infrastructure and has cut itself off from the outside world, closing its borders as analysts say prevention is its only option. \u201cThe problem is that right now the North Koreans closed the borders,\u201d Heusgen said after a closed-door Council meeting about the reclusive state. The members of the Security Council called on North Korea \u201cto allow this equipment in. So the population can be protected,\u201d he said, without elaborating on the type of equipment. After three weeks in quarantine, all passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have been evacuated, the Australian is reporting. \u201cPrincess Cruises can confirm that disembarkation of all guests aboard Diamond Princess is complete,\u201d the company said. \u201cSpecialists from the Princess Care Team and Family Assistance programs remain available to both guests and team members.\u201d It had been under strict quarantine since early February, when 10 people tested positive. Crew members will be allowed to return home if they test negative for the virus after two weeks in quarantine in Tokyo. The Diamond Princess has been a particular flashpoint for the virus, with more than 3,500 passengers on board. The vuris spread among the passengers and more than 700 developed Covid-19, and four died. A significant number of passengers were allowed to disembark and return to their home countries - many of which then put them in quarantine, suggesting unease with Japan\u2019s handling of the trip. Several of those returned later developed Covid-19. The National Health Authority has released its infection figures for Thursday. Of the 327 new confirmed cases of the virus, 318 were in the province of Hubei - the epicentre of the outbreak. Most of the deaths (41) were also in Hubei, as well as two in Beijing, and one in Xinjiang. Another 452 suspected cases have been added to China\u2019s reported figures. In more Donald Trump news, the president called the press pool for an unscheduled event, shortly after the Dow Jones index suffered its biggest points fall in history amid coronavirus fears. The president planned to discuss his \u201csuccess in empowering members of the African-American community\u201d, and included guests such as conservative commentator Candace Owens and media personalities Diamond and Silk. The event turned into an impromptu press conference, and Trump started to talk about coronavirus. A quick recap on the devastation in financial markets. Graeme Wearden reports financial markets have suffered fresh, heavy losses, as the coronavirus crisis escalates - threatening to cause major economic disruption. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 slumped by 3.5%, taking it down more than 10% from its recent peak. The index has lost 8%, or \u00a3152bn, this week alone. There were similar heavy losses across Europe, where stocks were hit by fresh cases of Covid-19 - including in Italy - and a warning from France\u2019s president that an epidemic could be close. Wall Street had another turbulent day too, with the Dow suffering its worst points fall ever - down 1,20 points. Further losses are expected on Friday. Traders are very concerned about the impact of more cases in the US, with California revealing it is tracking 8,400 people. Goldman Sachs\u2019s warned that US corporate profit growth could be wiped out is also casting a shadow.... while Bank of America cutting its growth forecasts to an 11-year low. There are also fears that the virus could even push the eurozone into recession. In Australia, Ben Butler reports: Coronavirus fears have driven the Australian market down for the fifth day running, with the benchmark ASX200 index dropping almost 3.2% shortly after the opening bell. Retailer Harvey Norman, which had experienced only very small falls this week, finally succumbed to selling pressure after releasing its half year results this morning. Within half an hour of the opening bell its shares tumbled 7.9%, the third biggest fall among ASX200 stocks. The company blamed \u201cwidespread bushfires and associated severe reductions in air quality that affected many communities\u201d that hit franchisees during the peak Christmas shopping season for a 4.1% fall in its profits for the six months to the end of December compared to the same time the previous year. Buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay, which has been something of a market darling, was the biggest loser in early trade, diving 9.4%. Also plunging were stocks with exposure to the Chinese market or international travel, both of which have been disrupted by the virus crisis. Online flight booking site Webjet and travel agency Flight Centre both fell more than 4%, national carrier Qantas dropped 3% and Air New Zealand, which is listed on the Australian exchange but is not part of the ASX200 index, was also down 3%. Also punished was Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals, which exports iron ore to China. Its stock fell almost 5.8%. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Catch up on our earlier coverage here. Before we begin, here\u2019s a summary of the top news lines so far: The Dow Jones index of leading US shares has suffered its biggest points fall in history amid the coronavirus crisis, closing down 1,190.95 in New York. The Australian market plummeted on opening. Northern Ireland and the Netherlands have reported their first cases of the virus. In the US Californian health officials are monitoring 8,400 people for symptoms after their arrival on domestic flights, but they have only an \u201cinadequate\u201d 200 test kits.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n      <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n      <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n      <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n      <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n      <p></p>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Texan Republican Michael McCaul spoke to back the strikes.

But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Lies_the_Crown\">heavy lies the crown</a>\u2026 with his new status came the avalanche of attacks from opponents that Sanders sceptics have long-warned the self-proclaimed \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d would face if he ever began to lead the pack. His <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-cold-war-travels-bernie-sanders-found-much-to-admire-behind-enemy-lines-now-thats-a-problem-for-his-campaign/2020/02/24/fd02fb50-572a-11ea-8753-73d96000faae_story.html\">\u201choneymoon\u201d to Moscow</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBerman/status/1232299147455234048\">unwise articles</a> he <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bloomberg-campaign-adviser-shocks-cnn-host-claiming-bernie-sanders-believes-women-get-cancer-1488978\">wrote</a> for an underground zine in the 60s and 70s about cancer, orgasms and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/bernie-sanders-rape-essay-1972/index.html\">rape fantasies</a>\u2026 Indeed, Sanders fanned the flames himself this week with typically unapologetic comments about Fidel Castro, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-democratic-presidential-front-runner-anderson-cooper-60-minutes/\">telling CBS News</a> he was \u201copposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba\u201d but adding: \u201cHe had a massive literacy program.

Even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d There will be much more of this if Sanders\u2019 success continues with a strong showing in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html\">South Carolina</a> tomorrow and victory on Super Tuesday, 3 March.</p> \n  <h2>Good week: Joe Biden</h2> \n  <p>Whisper it, but is Biden back? Democratic centrists will eventually have to coalesce around someone to take on Sanders, and after flirting with Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, they may end up concluding that the former vice-president \u2013 for all his faults \u2013 looks the strongest. He was more focused and aggressive at the debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night, and employed some amusing self-deprecation at one point when he gave way to the moderator: \u201cWhy am I stopping? No one else stops. It\u2019s my Catholic school training.\u201d Relying on his firewall of African-American support, Biden has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html\">solidified his lead in South Carolina</a> and can reasonably hope for a strong victory there on Saturday that might reboot his campaign. He can expect to scoop up a fair number of delegates on Super Tuesday too, particularly in Texas and North Carolina, although Sanders is increasingly leaving him for dust in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ca/california_democratic_primary-6879.html\">California</a>. Can he stage a comeback? Cutting out the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/biden-south-africa-arrest-mandela.html\">questionable stories</a> about being arrested in South Africa might help.</p> \n  <h2>Not a great week: Mike Bloomberg</h2> \n  <p>Bloomberg had a better debate this week, but his social-media tactics came under fire after his team posted a controversial set of satirical tweets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/mike-bloomberg-bernie-sanders-dictator-tweets-twitter\">featuring false comments</a> supposedly made by Sanders about various dictators. It wasn\u2019t his first offence \u2013 many objected to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/20/mike-bloomberg-debate-video-facebook-twitter-instagram\">misleadingly-edited video</a> his team had put out after the debate in Nevada \u2013 and the Bernie tweets were deleted. \u201cIt\u2019s the embracing of a cynical outlook: \u2018lol nothing matters\u2019,\u201d Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/26/mike-bloomberg-social-media-strategy\">told the Guardian</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s leaning into nihilism.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s national poll ratings have <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">flatlined</a> since his disastrous first debate performance \u2013 he remains in third place behind Biden and Sanders \u2013 and he has dipped back below Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg too in the crucial Super Tuesday state of California, when he enters the race proper.</p> \n  <h2>Bad week: Donald Trump</h2> \n  <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that the coronavirus Covid-19 could could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">adding</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d Donald Trump didn\u2019t like that. On a trip to India earlier that day he had already told reporters that the coronavirus was \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. He later hit out at the media for \u201cdoing everything possible to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible\u201d. That last element seemed key \u2013 an economic slowdown caused by the virus could seriously damage Trump\u2019s chances of re-election, and the stock market is his favourite measure of his own success. The day after a less-than-reassuring press conference in which Trump put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of the anti-virus effort, the Dow had its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/dow-suffers-record-decline-in-points-as-wall-street-leads-global-stocks-lower-idUSKCN20L05A?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top\">worst-ever daily drop</a> and the S&amp;P 500 posted its largest fall since August 2011<strong>.</strong></p> \n  <h2>Worst week: Mike Pence.</h2> \n  <p>Well, would you want to head up the coronavirus response? Such a poisoned chalice is the VP\u2019s new job that there was even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/1233017450318434306\">speculation</a> Trump could eventually use it as a pretext for dropping Pence from the 2020 ticket \u2013 perhaps replacing him with a telegenic woman such as former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Not to worry, though, Pence is \u201creally very expert at the field\u201d of healthcare, as Trump told his press conference on Wednesday. So expert that he notoriously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/27/mike-pence-coronavirus-response-experts\">wrote on his website</a> in 2000: \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e58f0898f08e1332474be4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-28T12:21:20.903Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yes, it is a crucial primary on Saturday for Joe Biden.

Here\u2019s a rundown of the top stories: A federal court blocked Trump\u2019s Remain in Mexico policy, which barred asylum seekers from the country while their claims were under consideration in immigration court. Here\u2019s a full report. The House judiciary committee launched an investigation of attorney general William Barr and DOJ, over concerns that Barr has politicized prosecutions. Donald Trump nominated Congressman John Ratcliffe to be the director of national intelligence \u2013 for the second time. Ratcliffe was nominated last summer but was quickly withdrawn from consideration when questions were raised about his qualifications. Joe Biden admitted that he was not arrested in South Africa. Donald Trump is holding a rally in South Carolina. A Wisconsin court of appeals overturned an order to purge 200,000 voters from the state\u2019s rolls. A federal appeals court said that it would not get involved in Congress\u2019s efforts to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify, effectively letting him off the hook from a congressional subpoena. And finally, Democratic presidential rivals are holding last minute get-out-the-vote rallies ahead of tomorrow\u2019s South Carolina primary. We have a full day of coverage planned for you, and you can keep on top of the latest news on the coronavirus in our ongoing liveblog here. Trump is ad-libbing on the coronavirus at his rally in South Carolina, Oliver Laughland reports. The president is using the epidemic to justify his anti-immigration policy \u2013 and attack Democrats: We are doing everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering the country. We have no choice. Whether it\u2019s the virus that we\u2019re talking about, or the many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus\u2026 when you have this virus, or any other virus, or any other problem coming in, it\u2019s not the only thing that comes in through the border\u2026 and we\u2019re setting records at the border, we\u2019re setting records, and now, just using this, important, so important. For factual information about the coronavirus, please see our rolling coverage here. Another assault on reproductive rights (and the US constitution) just passed the state senate in Utah. The proposed law, Senate Bill 174, is unconstitutional. It would outlaw all elective abortions, with exceptions only for cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother\u2019s health. Abortion is legal under current Supreme Court precedent. Many states have passed similarly unconstitutional laws in recent years. If enacted, the laws are generally struck down quickly by federal courts. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence committee, also has harsh criticism for Trump\u2019s re-nomination of John Ratcliffe as DNI. Guardian US reporters are out and about in South Carolina on the eve of the \u201cfirst in the south\u201d primary. Joan Greve is in Columbia, where voters are line-dancing ahead of a Tom Steyer rally. Meanwhile, Oliver Laughland and Daniel Strauss are keeping an eye on the 22nd Amendment of the US constitution at the Trump rally in North Charleston. Lest you thought Senate Democrats would forget that they did not want John Ratcliffe appointed director of national intelligence, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer just came out with a strong statement opposing the nomination: Former White House counsel Don McGahn can ignore a subpoena from Congress, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The decision is a blow to Congressional Democrats, who had sought judicial intervention after Donald Trump barred his top advisers from testifying. The decision, by a three-judge panel of the DC circuit court of appeals, reverses a lower court ruling that would have forced McGahn to testify, the AP reports. Per the AP: \u201cThe walk from the Capitol to our courthouse is a short one, and if we resolve this case today, we can expect Congress\u2019s lawyers to make the trip often,\u201d wrote Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of former President George W. Bush. He was joined in the 2-1 ruling by Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush. Judge Judith Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, dissented. She said her colleagues\u2019 opinion \u201call but assures future Presidential stonewalling of Congress, and further impairs the House\u2019s ability to perform its constitutional duties.\u201d Congress can still ask the full appeals court to review the case. It can also appeal to the Supreme court. Speaking of intelligence chiefs ... Leon Panetta, whose long career in government includes stints as CIA director and secretary of defense during the Obama administration, just endorsed Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. If the announcement of John Ratcliffe as Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence gives you a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, it\u2019s because we were here \u2013 literally \u2013 just seven months ago. My colleague Julian Borger wrote about some of the concerns over Ratcliffe\u2019s \u2013 \u201can inexperienced but loyal partisan\u201d \u2013 at the time. \u201cTrump is consolidating his personal control over the intelligence community,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former CIA intelligence officer. He said the current directors of the CIA and FBI have found their hands tied increasingly when it comes to accurate intelligence assessment, by risk of being fired for something at odds with Trump\u2019s views. \u201cI fear that there is a slow takeover of the norms and procedures of governance by this president, amassing unprecedented executive power,\u201d Mowatt-Larssen, now at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, added. \u201cTo do that he needs to neutralise or at least silence the intelligence community. He has been doing that for three years, but this takes it to the new level.\u201d You can read Julian\u2019s full report here. Donald Trump just announced the nomination of John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman from Texas, as director of national intelligence (DNI). The position is the highest ranking intelligence officer and oversees coordination among the US\u2019s 17 intelligence agencies. This is the second time that Trump attempted to name Ratcliffe to the position. In late July 2019, Trump announced the Texan as his intended choice for the position, only to withdraw the name following critical press reports of Ratcliffe\u2019s record and experience. The announcement comes just over a week after the president named Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist who was serving as the US ambassador to Germany, as the acting DNI. Grenell\u2019s nomination, which was not subject to senate confirmation, sparked immediate controversy. Grenell has no experience in intelligence or the military, and was best known as a fierce partisan for Trump. It\u2019s been a lively afternoon and the evening will be no less action-packed, as Donald Trump prepares for his rally in South Carolina on the eve of that state\u2019s crucially-important Democratic primary voting. My colleague in Oakland, California, Julia Carrie Wong, is taking the reins of this blog now and will keep you posted on events in the coming hours. As a reminder, we have a separate, dedicated, live blog covering global news developments related to the coronavirus outbreak. You can follow that here. The issue gets an occasional mention in this blog, depending on what the Trump administration is up to moment to moment. Here are the main US politics news events that have happened this afternoon: Trump wants the US Federal Reserve to \u201cget involved\u201d to support the economy as coronavirus concerns hit the financial markets. An appeals court in Wisconsin has overturned a ruling that would have allowed a mass purge of voter rolls, which would have disproportionately affected Democrats. The president is on his way to an eve-of-primary rally in North Charleston, South Carolina. It starts at 7pm ET. A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration\u2019s controversial \u201cWait in Mexico\u201d US-Mexico border policy, with many prominent Democrats tweeting heartfelt reaction, praising the ruling. The president is on his way to a rally in South Carolina and has been making remarks on his way to Air Force One. Here\u2019s one: He\u2019s referring to anticipation that the Fed might lower interest rates to offset economic jitters caused by the spreading coronavirus. Farage barrage Nigel Farage, dubbed \u201cthe Godfather of Brexit\u201d in the official CPAC programme, urged attendees of the conservative event to help Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination \u2013 and thus, in his view, guarantee a landslide victory for his \u201cfriend\u201d Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. Farage, always a popular turn at CPAC, said of the recent British general election: \u201cOne of the things that made it easier for Boris [Johnson] was a man called Jeremy Corbyn. The British Labour party had been hijacked by hard left, unpatriotic socialism.\u201d US Democrats will suffer the same fate under democratic socialist Sanders, he suggested. \u201cYou should be backing Bernie Sanders. You should be campaigning for Bernie Sanders. You should be donating money to Bernie Sanders.\u201d Farage, who waved a small Union flag on stage, added: \u201cI think with Bernie, you won\u2019t just get Trump. I think with Bernie, you can retake the House too.\u201d The crowd at this year\u2019s CPAC event, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, burst into chants of \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d Environmental gaslighting Donald Trump\u2019s environment chief, in a panel discussion at the high-profile Conservative Political Action Committee event near Washington, earlier today claimed that \u201cour environment is cleaner today than it has ever been,\u201d my colleague Emily Holden writes, from the CPAC event. Andrew Wheeler, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, has led the administration\u2019s rollbacks of dozens of environmental protections. Wheeler said the media doesn\u2019t tell the story of a cleaner environment. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear that in most news organizations or the newspapers,\u201d he said. Wheeler frequently cites the statistic that air pollution has declined 74% since 1970. But recent data has shown that after years of improvement, the air has gotten dirtier since 2016. The Environmental Protection Agency administrator also defended his policy of considering only studies that have publicly-available data, which scientists have said will prevent the government from incorporating the findings of research that involves private health data. Clean water A Wisconsin court of appeals has overturned an order to purge more than 200,000 voters from rolls in this important swing state. The court had previously put on hold an order to immediately remove up to 209,000 names from the state\u2019s voter registration rolls, handing Democrats who had fought the move a victory in the battleground state, my colleague Sam Levine wrote last month. The appeals court had sided with the bipartisan state elections commission in putting the brakes on removing any voters while the court fight continues. It also put on hold a ruling from Monday in which a judge found the commission and its three Democratic members in contempt for not proceeding with removing the voters The orders came as the commission was meeting in a closed session with attorneys from the state justice department to discuss the case. A conservative law firm that brought the case, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, had wanted the purge to happen immediately, even though the elections commission raised concerns about the accuracy of data used to identify voters who would have their registrations deactivated. On Friday, the Hill writes, the order was overturned and would be: A boost to Democrats in a state that\u2019s poised to play a decisive role the 2020 presidential race. Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. The Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty, said it plans to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. A lower court judge in January ordered the purging of more than 200,000 people from voter rolls because they may have moved. On Friday, the appeals court also overturned an order by the same judge that had found the state elections commission in contempt for not moving forward with the voter roll purge. The plaintiffs in the original case argued that the state elections commission should have immediately deactivated registered voters who didn\u2019t respond within 30 days to a mailing sent in October, an indication that the person may have moved. \u201cViolated due process\u201d Judiciary committee chairman and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler (who this morning wrote to attorney general Bill Barr requesting congressional interview with key officials amid concerns over presidential interference in the justice system), has also responded on Twitter to the court ruling blocking Trump\u2019s \u201cWait in Mexico\u201d border policy. \u201cFrom day one, @HouseJudiciary has said the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy was illegal and violated due process, which is why we launched a comprehensive investigation into its origins. Proud to see the 9th Circuit put a halt to this fatally flawed program,\u201d he said. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said: \u201cThe courts agree the Trump admin\u2019s remain in Mexico policy is cruel &amp; inhumane. As a country we should not banish people fleeing persecution to continue to wait in unsafe uncertainty. A clear violation of the law.\u201d And Texas congressman Filemon Vela said: \u201cThough the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision almost certainly will be appealed, for now it stops the policy nationwide. The Trump admin. had been declaring near-victory in stemming immigration just weeks ago, in part because of MPP\u2019s success. We must #EndMPP for good.\u201d \u201cPuts asylum seekers in danger\u201d Current presidential contender Elizabeth Warren has also weighed in on the hammering of Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d border policy. She tweeted that the news of this morning\u2019s court ruling was excellent. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s cruel \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy put asylum seekers in danger. As president, I will reverse the Trump administration\u2019s cruel immigration policies and ensure that asylum seekers are welcomed at our borders,\u201d she said. New Mexico Senator Tom Udall tweeted that the policy news was a relief. \u201cWe cannot allow the Trump administration to continue punishing asylum seekers with its hateful and dangerous policies. Offering a place for those who need refuge is a bedrock part of what America is all about,\u201d he said. House foreign affairs committee chairman, Eliot Engel, called the policy heartless, in a tweet. \u201cI applaud the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy is heartless for those seeking asylum in our country. The Administration continues to demonize people coming to our country, but they are on the wrong side of history,\u201d he said. One of the impeachment managers in Trump\u2019s recent Senate impeachment trial, congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, called the policy \u201cinhumane\u201d in her tweet, saying: \u201c\u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 is inconsistent w/@DHSgov\u2019s authority &amp; inhumanely forces thousands to wait in dangerous conditions before their asylum claims are heard. It\u2019s a harmful policy &amp; I\u2019m glad the court rejected it.\u201d \u201cHeartless and unlawful\u201d Reaction is still coming in to the news that a federal appeals judge in California has blocked the harsh Trump administration policy of forcing asylum seekers who cross the US-Mexico border to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration court cases. New Jersey Senator and former 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker just tweeted that: \u201cTrump\u2019s war on immigrants is an affront to our values and ideals. I\u2019m glad that this heartless and unlawful policy is suspended. We must treat all people with dignity and respect. Period.\u201d Biden still working for votes in SC My Washington colleague Joanie Greve reports from Columbia, South Carolina, that Biden is on the move: Joan will be back in her usual spot helming this blog tomorrow evening as we await the results of this nail-biting primary, but on location! About an hour from now, Donald Trump will emerge from the White House en route for North Charleston, South Carolina, where he will hold a rally tonight, in what has become a classic Trumpian move to troll his Democratic opponents just before the latest caucus or primary. My colleague, Oliver Laughland, is in the state ahead of tomorrow\u2019s primary and will be reporting from the rally tonight. He\u2019s mentioned that voters in Trump\u2019s base have been camping out all night to attend the rally. More: Gosh, meanwhile, another witness reported this: Meanwhile, earlier today, as Olly reports, he spent some time with the family of Walter Scott, ahead of this very important primary. Olly writes: Walter Scott\u2019s fatal encounter with a white North Charleston police officer gripped the national and international news agenda in 2015 as the most powerful example of the fatal consequences of racially biased policing. The incident was captured on video by a witness, which showed Scott running away as he was shot five times in the back by officer Michael Slager, who is now serving a 20 year federal prison sentence following a rare conviction against a police officer caught using excessive force. The case also propelled Scott\u2019s family into the national conversation about race and policing, which dominated the final years of the Obama administration before mostly shrinking away from mainstream discourse as Donald Trump entered office in 2016. But as the fifth anniversary of the shooting approaches in April, Anthony and others associated with the case hope the South Carolina primary on Saturday will serve as a reminder of the truths it unveiled, and thrust police and criminal justice reform into the spotlight again on the 2020 ballot. Here\u2019s the full report. Trump statement on Afghanistan: Here\u2019s the full statement: Nearly 19 years ago, American service members went to Afghanistan to root out the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks. In that time, we have made great progress in Afghanistan, but at great cost to our brave service members, to the American taxpayers, and to the people of Afghanistan. When I ran for office, I promised the American people I would begin to bring our troops home, and seek to end this war. We are making substantial progress on that promise. Soon, at my direction, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will witness the signing of an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, while Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will issue a joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan. If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home. These commitments represent an important step to a lasting peace in a new Afghanistan, free from Al Qaeda, ISIS, and any other terrorist group that would seek to bring us harm. Ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future. We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country. I thank the hundreds of thousands of American warriors who have proudly served in Afghanistan. We have killed or captured many ISIS and Al Qaeda terrorists. We honor your service and the sacrifices you and your families have made for the American people. These agreements are a result of the strenuous efforts of those who fought so hard in Afghanistan for the United States of America. With some more detail, here the Associated Press: Trump said he\u2019s dispatching the nation\u2019s top diplomat to sign an agreement with the Afghan Taliban aimed at beginning a draw down of thousands of US troops and ending America\u2019s 18-year involvement in the war. Trump said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would soon, at his direction, witness the signing of an agreement with the Taliban, an event that will see him stand with leaders of militants, who harbored al-Qaida before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US and are responsible for the deaths of thousands of American servicemen and women. He said defense secretary Mark Esper also will issue a joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan. Trump did not say where the deal would be signed, but it\u2019s been previously reported that it would occur on Saturday in Doha, Qatar. Signing the deal comes after a week in which both US-led forces and the Taliban committed to a reduction in violence. Under the plan being signed, the US is to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 from about 13,000. Donald Trump has just issued a statement from the White House. The key paragraph says this: Soon, at my direction, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will witness the signing of an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, while Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will issue a joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan. If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home..... Ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future. We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.\u201d Schumer slams Mulvaney over coronavirus rubbish Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, has fired back at acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney over remarks the Republican made this morning about the coronavirus outbreak, where he blamed concerns as nothing more than a \u201choax\u201d by Dems to sway the election and accused the media of stoking fears. This bearing in mind other countries are closing schools, canceling public events and the US government\u2019s own health advisers have warned of impending disruption to American life as the illness inevitably spreads. You can follow our coronavirus global live blog here. \u201cFor Mick Mulvaney to suggest that Americans turn off their TVs and bury their heads in the sand when they\u2019re worried about a global health pandemic is Orwellian, counterproductive, dangerous, and would be repeating China\u2019s mistake,\u201d Schumer just tweeted. Oh and the Fed said it might drop interest rates to calm market jitters. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) today that Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been forced to \u201ccorrect\u201d the wishful thinking mistakes of its predecessors. \u201cNo policy built on fantasy has worked,\u201d he told attendees. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve had to correct in our time.\u201d Past administrations were proud of past agreements, such as the Iran nuclear deal or Paris climate accords, he said, and enjoyed attending signing ceremonies. \u201cThe point is changing behaviour, not signing documents,\u201d Pompeo continued. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s a smart business leader. We changed course. We got better deals for each and every one of you.\u201d The secretary sent a defiant message to critics who said US-Mexico border security could never be strengthened or trade deals could never be renegotiated. Both have been achieved, he claimed. \u201cThey said taking out Qassem Suleimani would lead to world war three and it\u2019s actually made our world far safer,\u201d Pompeo added. \u201cThey said moving our embassy to Jerusalem would set the Middle East alight and that didn\u2019t happen. Our plan represents the best chance for peace in decades.\u201d It\u2019s been a busy morning in US politics and there is plenty more drama to come. Reaction is still emerging to the latest breaking news story that a court has blocked Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d border policy. Later this afternoon, the president is due to leave the White House just after 4pm ET to head for the chopper and then Air Force One to fly to a rally in...Charlesteon, South Carolina, tonight - a classic Trump catfish move the night before the Democratic primary there. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: A federal appeals judge in California late this morning blocked the Trump policy of forcing asylum seekers crossing the border from Mexico into the US to go back to Mexico and stay there for the duration of their immigration court cases in America (which can take an eternity to process). Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney called concerns about the coronavirus outbreak a hoax engineered by Democrats and stoked by the media. He was speaking at the CPAC event. Our dedicated coronavirus live blog is here). Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine endorsed Joe Biden this morning, a valuable boost for the struggling presidential candidate ahead of Super Tuesday next week. Meanwhile, Biden admitted he was never arrested in South Africa while trying to visit Nelson Mandela in prison. And the biggest news of the morning was that Congress wrote to attorney general Bill Barr and wants to question Department of Justice officials, including the prosecutors from the Roger Stone case, over concerns of presidential political interference in the justice process. \u201cThis policy is flatly illegal\u201d Harvard law professor Larry Tribe has this reaction to the news that a court has blocked Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy that sends asylum seekers crossing into the US back across the border to Mexico, where they find themselves waiting for months and months in often squalid and dangerous conditions for their court hearings in America. Responding to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, upholding the preliminary injunction halting the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, under which the U government forcibly returns asylum-seekers to Mexico indefinitely while they ask for asylum in the US, Amnesty International USA\u2019s advocacy director for the Americas, Charanya Krishnaswami, said: \u201cThis policy was never designed to work; it was designed solely to deter people from exercising their right to seek asylum. \u201cNow that the Ninth Circuit has halted this unconscionable policy, the tens of thousands of asylum-seekers already subjected to it must immediately be given the chance to make their asylum claims from within the United States - a chance they should have all along. \u201cRather than appealing this decision, the U.S. government should instead seek to reverse the harm this policy has wrought upon people seeking safety and restore its commitment to the right to seek asylum at the US border.\u201d Reaction is coming in to the news that a federal appeals court has immediately blocked the Trump administration\u2019s policy that forces asylum seeking migrants crossing the US-Mexico border to return to Mexico and remain there indefinitely while their asylum applications are processed in the United States, which can drag on indefinitely. The American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies, and Southern Poverty Law Center are challenging the policy and presented arguments in October 2019 to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The groups won a preliminary injunction in April, and in May the Ninth Circuit temporarily allowed the policy to take effect as the government appealed the injunction. ACLU attorney Judy Rabinovitz, who argued the appeal, said this afternoon: \u201cThe court forcefully rejected the Trump administration\u2019s assertion that it could strand asylum seekers in Mexico and subject them to grave danger. It\u2019s time for the administration to follow the law and stop putting asylum seekers in harm\u2019s way.\u201d The case, Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, was brought on behalf of 11 individual asylum seekers who were forced to return to Mexico to wait, and organizational plaintiffs Innovation Law Lab, the Central American Resource Center of Northern California, Centro Legal de la Raza, the University of San Francisco School of Law Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic, Al Otro Lado, and the Tahirih Justice Center. Major development in the story of the one of the many cruel strands of the Trump administration\u2019s US-Mexico border policy. A federal court on Friday upended a central pillar of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda, ruling that asylum seekers must be allowed into the United States while their often lengthy cases meander through American immigration courts. A three-judge panel in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco blocked a policy that has required people applying for asylum at the border to wait in Mexico while their claims for protection are reviewed, a process that often takes months or years, the New York Times\u2019s Caitlin Dickerson reports. A panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled today in a 2-1 vote to put on hold the policy that furthered Donald Trump\u2019s asylum crackdown, the AP adds. The \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy - known officially as \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols\u201d - took effect in January 2019 in San Diego and has spread along the border. Nearly 60,000 people have been sent back since the policy began. The question before the judges was whether to let the policy take effect during legal challenges. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has said concerns in the US over the coronavirus outbreak is A. a Democratic party hoax and B. is all about the media stoking fear as a plot to take down Donald Trump. Just a note that our main coverage of the coronavirus outbreak is on the website and in our dedicated live blog. But this latest news dev should be mentioned here, too. And this: Mulvaney was talking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Republican love-in at the National Harbor near Washington, from where my colleague David Smith sent a report published earlier today. Bill \u201clet me do my job\u201d Barr Attorney general William Barr has made efforts in recent days to beat back critics\u2019 concerns that he was doing the president\u2019s political bidding, by urging Donald Trump to stop tweeting about criminal cases - after Trump intervened in the Roger Stone case ahead of sentencing - because his comments were undercutting his ability to do his job. Trump had intervened in the form of a tweet calling prosecutors\u2019 sentencing recommendation \u201ca horrible and very unfair situation\u201d. Barr then caused the recommendation to be changed, prompting a call for the attorney general\u2019s resignation from more than 2,600 former justice department officials, my colleague Tom McCarthy wrote last week. Barr\u2019s public plea for Trump to back off was characterized by former US attorney and Trump foil Preet Bharara thusly in a tweet: \u201cI think Bill Barr is shrewd, deliberate, smart, calculating, careful, and full of it,\u201d tweeted the former US attorney Preet Bharara. Amid this scandal, Trump also abruptly withdrew the nomination of Jessie Liu, the former US attorney for the District of Columbia, who oversaw the Roger Stone case, for a new top post at the Treasury Department overseeing economic sanctions, the AP writes today. Judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler, in his letter to Barr this morning, said he also wants to interview Liu, as well as Tim Shea, the current interim US attorney for the District of Columbia whom Barr appointed to replace Liu. Despite Barr\u2019s pleas, Trump has nevertheless continued tweeting and has attacked the judge, jurors and prosecutors involved in the Stone case. At Stone\u2019s sentencing last week, US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Trump\u2019s tweets were inappropriate and would have no bearing on her decision-making. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment on the committee\u2019s request. Trump aggrieved over Fox poll Yes indeed. Here\u2019s the tweet (bearing in mind America\u2019s federal disease prevention agency is warning of impending disruption in the US caused by the coronavirus, while Trump is tweeting only about himself this morning): And here\u2019s a story on the new Fox News poll from last night. It shows the six leading Democratic candidates, from Amy Klobuchar up to Joe Biden, beating Trump in a match-up in November\u2019s election. Biden and Mike Bloomberg would beat Trump by eight points, according to the poll, Sanders by seven points, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg by three and Klobuchar by one point. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has voiced skepticism that the president can be trusted to steer America through the coronavirus outbreak. As just mentioned, all the main global and US news on the illness is being covered separately, especially in our dedicated coronavirus liveblog, but there is the odd moment of crossover with our general politics live blog and this is one such. Biden spoke about the apparent sidelining of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the US\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and a primary figure in the frontline of America\u2019s response to the outbreak and spread of the virus. And about, as just mentioned, the qualification or otherwise of vice president Mike Pence to helm US action on this. \u201cI can understand a vice president coordinating it, I have coordinated a number of things,\u201d said Biden, the former vice president in Barack Obama\u2019s administration. He went on in a TV interview: \u201cNo-one takes the president\u2019s word for these things...he stands there and says everything is fine - who\u2019s going to believe him?\u201d And he said: \u201cDr Fauci is not allowed to speak publicly. What is all this about?\u201d A quick reminder that while this blog is focusing on general US politics news today the Guardian also has a terrific live blog dedicated to covering the coronavirus outbreak as well as our regular business live blog that\u2019s keeping an eye on related plunges in the markets, as the Dow nosedives again today. And there are separate extrapolations of all the most important angles in articles on our website, too, of course, such as whether vice president Mike Pence is suitably qualified to helm the Trump administration\u2019s response to the outbreak. And this is worth noting: Allegations of political interference in the DoJ by Donald Trump In his letter to attorney general Bill Barr this morning, House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler expresses the need to interview many Department of Justice officials who have worked on cases involving Trump close associates, such as disgraced national security adviser Michael Flynn (who has yet to be sentenced despite pleading guilty more than two years ago to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts). The judiciary committee also wants to interview officials \u201cwho were tapped by Barr to review cases Trump has openly criticized\u201d, according to this Politico piece, which continues: Among the officials Nadler is seeking to interview are John Durham, the US attorney from Connecticut who was picked by Barr to review the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election; Jeff Jensen, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, whom Barr selected to review the case of Flynn; Robert Khuzami, the former New York-based prosecutor who oversaw the case against Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen; and Richard Donoghue, the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, whom Barr picked to review all matters related to the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment in the House last year. But the most head-turning in the breakneck speed world of Trump scandals is the request to interview the prosecutors in the Roger Stone case. Mixed poll news for Biden It\u2019s a nail-biting, see-sawing kind of day for Joe Biden as he launches into the absolutely crucial five days for his presidential campaign that span the South Carolina primary tomorrow and Super Tuesday voting in more than a dozen states on March 3. Just hours before he received Senator Tim Kaine\u2019s endorsement, a new ABC-Ipsos poll out this morning asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, based on the most recent candidate debates (in Las Vegas and Charleston), who has the best chance of beating Donald Trump in November. A booming 34% said Bernie Sanders, while only 25% said Biden. In more worries for Elizabeth Warren, she was behind Mike Bloomberg, at 11% support in the \u201celectability\u201d poll in contrast to his 15%. It looks even more bleak for Amy Klobuchar at 3%, behind Pete Buttigieg at 8%. But a poll in South Carolina yesterday still had Biden narrowly ahead of Sanders in his chances of winning the primary there. Virginia Democratic Senator and Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice for the vice presidential place on her 2016 ticket, Tim Kaine, has just endorsed Joe Biden in a welcome boost for Biden the day before the crucial South Carolina primary tomorrow and just four days before Super Tuesday, when Virginia voters go to the polls to choose their candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump in the November election. Virginia is a key swing state and it will be interesting to see if and where Kaine hits the campaign trail for Biden this weekend. It is unclear whether the department of justice will cooperate with any part of the new House committee probe that was just revealed. Donald Trump has previously vowed to block \u201call\u201d of the subpoenas from Democrats and refused to cooperate with their impeachment inquiry last year. Still, despite his declarations, many administration officials came forward during the impeachment probe once they were faced with subpoenas, the AP further reports. Barr has already agreed to testify before the committee on March 31. It will be the first time he has appeared before the panel since he became attorney general a year ago, and the meeting is sure to be contentious. Since Barr was sworn in, House Democrats have questioned whether he was too close to Trump, criticized his handling of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s 2019 report resulting from the Trump-Russia investigation, and then impeached Trump for his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats, principally his election rival Joe Biden. The Senate acquitted Trump earlier this month after the historic impeachment trial. In the letter this morning, Nadler asked for a broad swath of documents related to the committee\u2019s concerns, including communications between Trump and the Justice Department. The committee is unlikely to get any of those documents, as a president\u2019s personal conversations are generally considered privileged by the courts. Just after the Senate voted to acquit Trump, Barr faced blowback over his decision to overrule the prosecutors in the Stone case. Trump congratulated Barr shortly afterward. Stone was convicted of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election. He was sentenced last week to more than three years in prison. When Stone was convicted last November, the Guardian detailed how he had been accused of having connections to Wikileaks and being involved in the leaking of US Democratic party emails stolen by the Russians during the 2016 election. The House Judiciary Committee is launching a wide-ranging probe of attorney general William Barr and the US Justice Department, demanding briefings, documents and interviews with 15 officials - including the prosecutors who quit the Roger Stone case - as it tries to determine whether there has been improper political interference in federal law enforcement. Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic congressman of New York, this morning sent Barr a letter listing a series of matters that the committee finds \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d the AP reports. This includes Barr\u2019s involvement in the case of Donald Trump\u2019s longtime confidant Roger Stone, in which the president also intervened prior to Stone\u2019s sentencing last week. Stone was convicted in November of lying to Congress and other charges. Barr overruled prosecutors who had recommended that Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison, leading the four top prosecutors on the case to step down from it. Nadler also is questioning Barr about his involvement in other cases related to friends and associates of Trump and about internal investigations into department employees who investigated Trump after the 2016 election. \u201cAlthough you serve at the President\u2019s pleasure, you are also charged with the impartial administration of our laws,\u201d Nadler wrote to Barr. \u201cIn turn, the House Judiciary Committee is charged with holding you to that responsibility.\u201d The committee is asking for briefings on the issues listed and interviews with 15 Justice Department officials involved in those matters, including the four prosecutors who resigned from the Stone case. Breaking news: The House is asking the Department of Justice to present as witnesses the four career prosecutors who quit the legal case of Roger Stone after Donald Trump intervened to defend his convicted friend before his sentencing. Stone was sentenced to a lengthy prison term last week in federal court in Washington, DC. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and progressive firebrand congresswoman Ilhan Omar just had a spirited exchange at the foreign affairs committee hearing that is still underway on Iran and Iraq. You can watch the livestream here. Pompeo argued that the assassination by the US of Iran\u2019s military top dog, Qassem Suleimani, in Iraq at the beginning of January has made things \u201cfar safer\u201d for the American people. But committee member Omar asked how that could be when, in prior Iranian-backed, storming protests at the US embassy in Baghdad, \u201cthe people who were at the US embassy said they were not warned\u201d and yet in the fall-out from the killing of Suleimani, US diplomats, such as Iran specialist Brian Hook, have needed a special \u201ccounter assault team\u201d when at public eventsw. Omar cited special protection measures taken when Hook, special representative for Iran and senior policy adviser to Pompeo, attended an event in Los Angeles where he defended the US strike on Suleimani. Uncle Sam\u2019s nightmare? Here\u2019s what the conservative-leaning Economist magazine thinks of the prospect of a Donald Trump vs Bernie Sanders match-up in the 2020 election. It\u2019s more really terrible timing for Joe Biden. On the eve of the South Carolina primary, where strong support from black voters is crucial to his floundering campaign, he\u2019s just been obliged to clarify a story that\u2019s been dogging him and admit that he was NOT once arrested in South Africa while trying to visit that greatest civil rights icon, Nelson Mandela, in prison. His campaign had been struggling to deal with reports for days that this \u201carrest\u201d he has boasted of never happened and a recent, incomplete, explanation was that Biden was forcibly separated from a group of African campaigners, in a process of being coerced to go through segregated doors in apartheid South Africa during a congressional human rights trip in the 1970s. Appearing on CNN this morning, Biden was finally obliged to tell the truth of it, after yet another series of unforced errors in his campaign that has been nosediving since a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses in early February. Biden, however, is still just ahead of Bernie Sanders is South Carolina polling. He also told CNN that Democrats \u201ccannot shoot and miss\u201d in their efforts to oust Donald Trump from the White House in November. Hello, everyone, the US politics live blog helm now switches from London to (today) New York and we\u2019ll take you through the rest of another action packed day before handing over to our colleagues in Oakland, California for the evening. Just a reminder that although we may touch here and there on the US political angle of the coronavirus outbreak in this blog, all the main US and global news on this vital story is being covered in our separate, dedicated live blog, here, and in other US-related coronavirus articles. Although, here\u2019s the next New Yorker cover: The session has now returned to the discussion of Qassem Suleimani, and the US strike to kill him. Pompeo said that \u201cHe was in the region actively plotting to kill Americans\u201d and that \u201cIt was my judgement that this reduced risks to America to take this strike.\u201d He said it would reduce risks short, medium and long-term. Texan Republican Michael McCaul spoke to back the strikes. He said \u201cAmericans in the region are certainly safer because of this decision. I was in some of these discussions and the president was very clear \u2018I do not want to go with war with Iran\u2019. They crossed a red line when they attacked our embassy.\u201d There have been some sharp words of criticism for Pompeo\u2019s unwillingness to appear at this session - with it being pointed out that it has taken him two months to appear. Brad Sherman asked if it would take two months from now before he would appear to answer questions about coronavirus. Pompeo has only agreed to appear for two hours, and this has been contrasted with the eleven hour session that Hillary Clinton endured when the same committee, with Pompeo as part of it, interrogated her about Benghazi. Although the theme of the House Foreign Affairs Committee session this morning was due to be Iran and Iraq, discussion has immediately and inevitably pivoted to discussing the coronavirus outbreak. Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline attacked the administration, saying that after three years the American people weren\u2019t sure they could trust the government to handle the crisis Pompeo has criticised Iran for not sharing information about the outbreak in the country, and confirmed that the US had offered to help Iran. He was also a little testy about the change of topic. California Democrat Ami Bera has suggested that US policy of isolating Iran has hampered Iranian efforts to combat the virus outbreak. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has just begun his appearance before the House committee on foreign affairs. The title of the session is \u201cEvaluating the Trump Administration\u2019s Policies on Iran, Iraq and the Use of Force\u201d. Pompeo has already deposited an opening witness statement, which you can read here. The session is being live-streamed here. Amy Klobuchar has just tweeted to highlight a negative comparison from Connecticut senator Chris Murphy between the way that president Barack Obama set about preparing for potential medical emergencies, and the de-funding of those plans that has been done by the Trump administration. \u201cLeadership is thinking ahead and thinking farther than the next tweet\u201d she says. Klobuchar is due to campaign today in Virginia and Tennessee. 29 February South Carolina votes \u2013 with Biden hoping to hoist himself back into contention with a strong win 3 March Super Tuesday: more than a dozen states including California and Texas vote, with one-third of Democratic delegates up for grabs on this day alone. Bernie Sanders is expected to lead, with Biden, Bloomberg, Warren and Buttigieg all hoping to emerge as his clear opponent. 17 March Another big day, with votes in key states of Florida and Illinois. 28 April The north-east has its say, with votes in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and their neighbours. 13 July Democratic convention begins 24 August Republican convention begins 3 November Election day Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is currently talking at CPAC, being interviewed by Stephen Moore. You can watch a video stream of it live. He\u2019s been talking about Congress being \u201cbroken\u201d, and has just described his job as \u201cthe coolest job in the world\u201d. He has also revealed that Donald Trump did not sleep on his overnight flight back from India, and that the president texts, emails and calls him from 6am every morning until midnight. He is now talking about what Donald Trump will do in his second term - suggesting a 1% cut in corporation tax to 20% because the president thinks \u201cit is a better number\u201d. Whatever you think about Bernie Sanders as a potential president, it is wrong to dismiss his chances of winning the office. Not only does most of the available empirical evidence show Mr. Sanders defeating President Trump in the national popular vote and in the critical Midwestern states that tipped the Electoral College in 2016, but his specific electoral strengths align with changes in the composition of the country\u2019s population in ways that could actually make him a formidable foe for the president. So says Steve Phillips in the New York Times opinion section today. It\u2019s quite an in-depth look at how the people that Sanders particularly appeals to are sections of the electorate that could potentially hold huge sway in November - with little demographic nuggets like this: \u201cMr. Trump won Arizona, for example, by 91,000 votes, and 160,000 Latinos have turned 18 in that state since then.\u201d Read it here - New York Times: Bernie Sanders Can Beat Trump. Here\u2019s the Math. There\u2019s also been a couple of bits of positive polling news for Bernie Sanders today. First off, it looks like he could deprive Elizabeth Warren of victory in her own state of Massachusetts. As recently as October, [Warren] held a 20-percentage point lead over Sanders, according to a WBUR poll. In the latest version of the poll, released Friday, she trailed him by 8 points. Read it here - Politico: Warren at risk of losing her home state There\u2019s also data showing that Sanders\u2019 debate performances have enhanced his standing with engaged Democrat voters, who now think he stands the best chance among the contenders of taking on and beating Donald Trump for the White House. After seeing either of the ninth and tenth debates, 34% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said Sanders has the best chance of defeating the incumbent president. The next closest competitor is Biden, with 25%, followed by Mike Bloomberg, 15% Read it here - ABC News: Recent debates give emboldened Bernie Sanders electability edge Bernie Sanders steamrollered through the Nevada primary and Donald Trump played down the coronavirus threat. Who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down this week in US politics? Best week: Bernie Sanders The leftwing senator from Vermont\u2019s landslide victory in Nevada forced Democratic and media doubters to admit he was now the man to beat (even the day before the New York Times was still calling him the \u201cnominal\u201d frontrunner). But heavy lies the crown\u2026 with his new status came the avalanche of attacks from opponents that Sanders sceptics have long-warned the self-proclaimed \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d would face if he ever began to lead the pack. His \u201choneymoon\u201d to Moscow, unwise articles he wrote for an underground zine in the 60s and 70s about cancer, orgasms and rape fantasies\u2026 Indeed, Sanders fanned the flames himself this week with typically unapologetic comments about Fidel Castro, telling CBS News he was \u201copposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba\u201d but adding: \u201cHe had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d There will be much more of this if Sanders\u2019 success continues with a strong showing in South Carolina tomorrow and victory on Super Tuesday, 3 March. Good week: Joe Biden Whisper it, but is Biden back? Democratic centrists will eventually have to coalesce around someone to take on Sanders, and after flirting with Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, they may end up concluding that the former vice-president \u2013 for all his faults \u2013 looks the strongest. He was more focused and aggressive at the debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night, and employed some amusing self-deprecation at one point when he gave way to the moderator: \u201cWhy am I stopping? No one else stops. It\u2019s my Catholic school training.\u201d Relying on his firewall of African-American support, Biden has solidified his lead in South Carolina and can reasonably hope for a strong victory there on Saturday that might reboot his campaign. He can expect to scoop up a fair number of delegates on Super Tuesday too, particularly in Texas and North Carolina, although Sanders is increasingly leaving him for dust in California. Can he stage a comeback? Cutting out the questionable stories about being arrested in South Africa might help. Not a great week: Mike Bloomberg Bloomberg had a better debate this week, but his social-media tactics came under fire after his team posted a controversial set of satirical tweets featuring false comments supposedly made by Sanders about various dictators. It wasn\u2019t his first offence \u2013 many objected to the misleadingly-edited video his team had put out after the debate in Nevada \u2013 and the Bernie tweets were deleted. \u201cIt\u2019s the embracing of a cynical outlook: \u2018lol nothing matters\u2019,\u201d Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s leaning into nihilism.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s national poll ratings have flatlined since his disastrous first debate performance \u2013 he remains in third place behind Biden and Sanders \u2013 and he has dipped back below Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg too in the crucial Super Tuesday state of California, when he enters the race proper. Bad week: Donald Trump The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that the coronavirus Covid-19 could could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d Donald Trump didn\u2019t like that. On a trip to India earlier that day he had already told reporters that the coronavirus was \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. He later hit out at the media for \u201cdoing everything possible to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible\u201d. That last element seemed key \u2013 an economic slowdown caused by the virus could seriously damage Trump\u2019s chances of re-election, and the stock market is his favourite measure of his own success. The day after a less-than-reassuring press conference in which Trump put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of the anti-virus effort, the Dow had its worst-ever daily drop and the S&amp;P 500 posted its largest fall since August 2011. Worst week: Mike Pence. Well, would you want to head up the coronavirus response? Such a poisoned chalice is the VP\u2019s new job that there was even speculation Trump could eventually use it as a pretext for dropping Pence from the 2020 ticket \u2013 perhaps replacing him with a telegenic woman such as former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Not to worry, though, Pence is \u201creally very expert at the field\u201d of healthcare, as Trump told his press conference on Wednesday. So expert that he notoriously wrote on his website in 2000: \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\u201d Yes, it is a crucial primary on Saturday for Joe Biden. But that equally applies to the other candidates vying to be the main rival to early front-runner Bernie Sanders. Surely someone will have to drop out of this crowded field after Super Tuesday, so that the more centrist candidates can unite around one \u201canti-Sanders\u201d option? Here\u2019s Moira Donegan with a look at what could happen next for Elizabeth Warren and how her campaign has become energised since that Nevada debate performance. Perhaps this is why Warren now feels free to be frankly angry: not just because playing nice has stopped working, but because her treatment has been deeply unfair. She is the most qualified, the most intelligent and she has run the best campaign, and yet she is being passed over in favor of candidates who are less honest, less prepared, less capable, less morally committed, or simply male. And here is Sam Levin in Los Angeles with a look at how Warren has found trans activists rallying behind her: \u201cElizabeth is teachable,\u201d said Blossom C Brown, an LA-based activist, who protested the exclusion of black trans women at a candidate forum last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect her to get it right 100% of the time. But she is the one willing to listen.\u201d One of the problems facing Joe Biden as he goes into the South Carolina primary is that he is attempting to defy history. Over on Bloomberg Paul Murray has put together a series of charts showing historical polling data for the primaries since 1980. He says of Biden: He\u2019s not the only perceived frontrunner to falter in recent elections. Biden joins five other candidates since 1988 who lost their national polling lead after the Iowa caucuses; none of the others were able to recover from their decline. To put it bluntly: \u201cno candidate has held a polling lead going into the first nominating contest, lost that lead and then come back to win the nomination.\u201d That\u2019s quite some challenge for Biden. You can see the data here. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off, and make sure that they\u2019re ready,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at his White House news conference on the coronavirus. Accordingly schools across the United States are canceling trips abroad, preparing online lessons and even rethinking their \u201cperfect attendance\u201d awards as they brace for the possibility that Covid-19 could begin spreading in their communities. There\u2019s also a big question mark about how the healthcare system could cope if there was a sharp increase in the number of cases in the US. And there\u2019s a specific factor that could make a difference to how the coronavirus might spread - the uninsured. Carl Gibson is one of those 27.5 million people - here are his thoughts on what the impact of the coronavirus could be. Here is Amanda Holpuch in New York, looking at how it is low-income Americans who are most likely to be at risk. There\u2019s also a potentially worrying development in terms of how America has been handling the virus. The Washington Post was reporting last night that a whistleblower has come forward to say that officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear. They then wren\u2019t tested to see if they had contracted the new coronavirus themselves. The Democratic race is in full swing, with votes in South Carolina on Saturday and then in over a dozen states including California on Super Tuesday, 3 March. Who are the key contenders as the race enters its next phase? Bernie Sanders Who: Veteran socialist senator from Vermont and Democratic frontrunner who thinks his ship may finally have come in. Strengths: Huge army of passionate voters. Distinctive and consistent policy platform. Powerful momentum from success in first three contests of primary race. Weaknesses: Leftwing policies and \u201csocialist\u201d label may prove a bridge too far for many moderate Americans. Decades of outspoken affinity with leftwing causes is already being weaponised against him. Key quote: \u201cEvery other major country on Earth has achieved universal health care. This is the wealthiest nation in the world and there is no reason we cannot do the same.\u201d Key policies: Universal public healthcare system and abolition of health insurance. Paid parental leave. Free college tuition. Support for radical Green New Deal to tackle climate change and create jobs. Joe Biden Who: Personable former vice-president to Barack Obama whose shaky performance in the primary race has seen his lead disintegrate and his frontrunner status disappear. Strengths: Pundits thought his folksy manner, working-class roots and moderate policies would appeal to rust-belt voters won by Donald Trump in 2016. Weaknesses: Voters seemed less convinced after a series of muddled debates and gaffe-prone public appearances. Although many make the argument that \u201cyour uncle would vote for him\u201d, it\u2019s hard to find anyone actually excited about the prospect of President Biden. Key quote: \u201cI ain\u2019t a socialist, I ain\u2019t a plutocrat, I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d Key policies: \u201cPublic option\u201d to compete with private health insurance. Green New Deal. Repealing capital punishment. Decriminalisation of cannabis. Michael Bloomberg Who: Billionaire businessman and former New York mayor distrusted by many liberals who has steadily climbed in the polls thanks to big spending. Strengths: Limitless spending power. Centrist policies that may win over some Republicans. Record of business success that contrasts favorably with Trump\u2019s. Weaknesses: Originally elected in New York as a Republican, Bloomberg is viewed by many liberals as a Democrat in name only and the kind of super-rich businessman they exist to rein in. Controversies over alleged sexist, racist and anti-trans remarks, a discriminatory policing policy known as \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, and the treatment of women at his business have not helped. Key quote: \u201cTwo billionaires [running]? Who\u2019s the second one?\u201d Key policies: Universal background checks for gun purchases, assault weapons ban and crackdown on gun trafficking. Net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cPublic option\u201d for healthcare. Elizabeth Warren Who: Liberal Massachusetts senator and financial services expert who has been crowded out by Sanders and the moderates. Strengths: Less leftwing than Sanders, much less rightwing than Bloomberg, more experienced than Buttigieg, more convincing than Biden. Would be the first woman president. Weaknesses: Not as ideologically pure as Sanders, not as rich as Bloomberg, not as fresh as Buttigieg, less appeal in the heartland than Biden. Sexism is probably playing a role in dragging her down. Key quote: \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. No, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump. I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d Key policies: Wealth tax on those worth more than $50m. Universal childcare. Relief of student loan debts. Supports the Green New Deal, public healthcare replacing health insurance and breaking up the big tech companies. Pete Buttigieg Who: Small-town Indiana mayor who would be first gay president and needs to build on strong early start in Iowa or risk fading away. Strengths: Millennial military veteran who presents himself as the young and upbeat voice of moderation, compromise and national unity. Weaknesses: His main political experience comprises eight years as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city of 100,000 people. As mayor he made enemies of many black voters \u2013 something that has hobbled him in the Democratic race. It remains to be seen how homophobia would affect his chances if he became the nominee. Key quote: \u201cWe need a president focused on the future and ready to leave the politics of the past in the past.\u201d Key policies: Backs a publicly run health insurance scheme, background checks for gun-buyers, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and a moderate climate change plan. Also running Businessman Tom Steyer has poured money into South Carolina and is hoping for a strong showing there. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar has had her moments but it\u2019s hard to see where she goes from here. The quixotic Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard made the most impact when she sued Hillary Clinton for calling her a Russian asset. Ahead of his appearance at the House committee of foreign affairs this morning, Mike Pompeo has published his opening witness statement, and it is fair to say that he does not mince his words about the Trump administration\u2019s attitude to Iran. Among other things he says: Iran is the world\u2019s number one state sponsor of terrorism \u2013 and anti-Semitism. Its forces, and the militias it supports, prop up Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad, undermine democracy in Lebanon and Iraq, and steal humanitarian aid in Yemen. Iran is responsible for downing a civilian airliner in January. 176 people were killed. The regime lied about that tragedy, and still hasn\u2019t turned over the black box. The regime just rigged an election \u2013 yet again denying the Iranian people the free and fair elections they\u2019ve sought for 41 years. You can read the full statement here. Good morning - there\u2019s quite a bit on the agenda today. It is the final full day of campaigning before the South Carolina primary, and Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Tom Steyer are all in the state today. Joe Biden has been considered the frontrunner in the southernmost state to vote so far, but he needs a decisive victory over Sanders if he\u2019s to convince people that his campaign has a chance of eclipsing the leftwing senator and making a strong push for the nomination. Donald Trump will also be out campaigning in South Carolina. There\u2019s no Republican primary, but nevertheless he\u2019s attending a rally at 7pm EST in North Charleston. Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, is visiting Virginia and Tennessee with an eye on Super Tuesday. We can expect a lot of focus on the coronavirus. Much of Trump\u2019s upbeat messaging about the outbreak was designed to keep the markets steady. That approach seems to have failed as Wall Street and markets around the world tanked yesterday on fears about the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that two people in the US have the coronavirus from person-to-person transmission, rather than exposure to the disease overseas. There\u2019s a host of big names appearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Fort Washington, Maryland, just outside of Washington DC. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, Donald Trump Jr, Candace Owens, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the so-called \u201cAnti-Greta\u201d Naomi Seibt are all appearing today. There are sessions on what the map of Israel should look like, how to fight the left\u2019s \u201cvoter fraud machine\u201d, \u201chow the left justifies acts of violence\u201d and the culture war. It should be a lively day. You can see the full line-up here. And another big draw is that secretary of state Mike Pompeo will be appearing before the House committee on foreign affairs to be grilled on US policy on Iran and Iraq. You\u2019ll be able to watch the session here.",

In 1990, 30 years before Johnson took the UK out of the European Union, an article he penned as the Telegraph\u2019s EC (European Community) correspondent warning of the threat the EC posed to national sovereignty was in Thatcher\u2019s briefing pack as she delivered the combative speech to parliament. Johnson\u2019s article was accompanied by a covering note from the Foreign Office in which Thatcher had underlined the words: \u201cFederation of Europe\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s address on 30 October 1990, pushing back against Delors, then European commission president, came as the government was hugely unpopular and Thatcher was trying to balance divisions over Europe within the party. Seen as a way for her to reassert her authority, it provided succour for Eurosceptics within the party and the press but was too much for some Conservatives. Two days later the Sun ran its famous \u201cUp Yours Delors\u201d front page but, on the same day, the deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, resigned, criticising Thatcher\u2019s stance towards Europe. It was the beginning of the end for the prime minister, who would make her tearful exit from No 10 by the end of the month. Chris Collins, a historian at the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, described the presence of the article by Johnson as \u201cpoignant given what\u2019s happened since\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s part of the trigger. Clearly, it\u2019s there \u2026 to remind her to have a bash at Delors, which is good politics in this context but also I guess to remind her of the mood that is surrounding this issue. I mean, a lot of Conservatives would read articles like that one by Boris Johnson \u2026 and say yes, that\u2019s what these guys [like Delors] are up to.\u201d Johnson has often sought to channel the legacy of Thatcher during his political career, not least on Europe, despite her position on the issue having been more complex than often presented by Eurosceptics. During his time as the Telegraph\u2019s EC correspondent, he was a prolific peddler of Euromyths, including plans to ban prawn cocktail crisps and for a \u201cbanana police force\u201d to regulate the shape of bananas, often with little foundation in fact. And despite the fact that Johnson\u2019s article \u2013 headlined \u201cBritish right of veto faces axe in Delors plan\u201d \u2013 was included in Thatcher\u2019s folder for her all-important speech, the Foreign Office, in its covering note, made the observation that it was actually wrong. Her private secretary, Richard Gozney, wrote that the commission\u2019s opinion \u201cdoes not contain what M Delors is reported by the Daily Telegraph as having suggested. It does not propose any radical change in the present institutional plans of the community \u2013 although it does contain a lot of horrors.\u201d Thatcher was clearly aware of this as she highlighted the word \u201cnot\u201d in yellow highlighter.

So, you know, in a way that\u2019s an easy one. And you just hammer that one and she does a marvellous performance and so on.\u201d Howe begged to differ, delivering a devastating critique of her in his resignation speech on 13 November, paving the way for a leadership challenge by Michael Heseltine. After Thatcher fell short of the votes required to avoid a second round she announced her departure on 23 November, leaving Downing Street five days later. The papers, the last to be released of Thatcher\u2019s premiership, provide little insight into her feelings towards those she undoubtedly blamed for bringing her down. However, Collins said the stock replies sent in her final days as prime minister to some well-wishers \u2013 compared with the highly personalised letters sent to others \u2013 \u201cwere probably meant to sting\u201d. A letter from the then education secretary, Kenneth Clarke, one of those who advised her to resign after the first leadership ballot, was florid in its praise of \u201ca truly great prime minister\u201d and said he only acted to save her from \u201chumiliating defeat\u201d in the second round.

      "bodyText": "One in five students would be financially better off if they skipped higher education, according to groundbreaking research that compares the lifetime earnings of graduates and non-graduates. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found while 80% of former students gained financially from attending university, about 20% earned less than those with similar school results who did not attend, highlighting how some subjects, such as creative arts, offer negative financial returns. The IFS research \u2013 which uses tax data to measure the earnings of those who went to university from the mid-90s onwards \u2013 found that after accounting for taxes and student loans, men gained on average \u00a3130,000 and women \u00a3100,000 over their careers, compared with their peers who didn\u2019t enter higher education. As well as the total \u201cgraduate premium\u201d being different between the sexes, it is also unevenly distributed over time, with women reaching a glass ceiling on earnings growth in their 30s and 40s, even among Oxbridge graduates. The premium also differed depending on the subject studied. The report comes as the government in England is applying additional scrutiny to universities and outcomes for graduates, with some ministers looking to restrict the numbers taking so-called \u201clow-value\u201d courses. Overall, the IFS found the government benefited from extra tax revenue and national insurance contributions of \u00a3110,000 per man and \u00a330,000 per woman, over and above the costs of study to the government. \u201cThe exchequer gains a lot on average from higher education, despite the high costs of writing off unpaid student loans. That is mainly because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax,\u201d said Ben Waltmann, an IFS economist and co-author of the report. \u201cBut this analysis also shows that the government makes an overall loss on financing the degrees of nearly half of all graduates. These losses are concentrated amongst those studying certain subjects. \u201cFor creative arts, for example, the losses are substantial. This need not mean that the government is misallocating funds but it is important to be aware of the costs involved.\u201d Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said that while the benefits of higher education included \u201cunquantifiable experiences and friendships,\u201d she was still concerned about value for money. \u201cIt is no surprise our universities attract students from all over the world. However, that prestige is built on quality and my role is to work with the regulator to safeguard that, while ensuring students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment,\u201d Donelan said. The Department for Education said the earnings data would define the benefits of higher education and \u201chelp students of all ages make smart choices about their future\u201d. However, Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: \u201cIt is vital to recognise that education is about much more than just financial benefit. Focussing on future income following university ignores the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society.\u201d The data also revealed a chasm between men and women in earnings, with the top 10% of males who studied economics or medicine earning on average \u00a3500,000 more than their peers, while women studying the same subjects had average gains of just \u00a3250,000.

He\u2019s been given a fair mark for this handicap debut, despite an authoritative performance at Chepstow last month.</p> \n<p><strong>2.12 Kelso </strong>Dali Mail is on a stiff enough mark for this handicap chase after just a couple of spins in novice events, in one of which he fell. <strong>Albert\u2019s Back</strong> appeals more after a steady introduction to fences. He couldn\u2019t get near First Flow last time but meets nothing of his calibre now.</p> \n<p><strong>2.25 Doncaster</strong> On what could be a great card for Nicholls, <strong>Dolos</strong> can follow up on his recent Sandown success, when he was giving 22lb to the runner-up, First Flow. That one has upheld the form with two wide-margin victories in the past fortnight. Gino Trail is interesting on his debut for Fergal O\u2019Brien but is 13 now.</p> \n<p><strong>2.45 Kelso</strong> Calva D\u2019Auge deserves his place after a couple of battling wins but ratings suggest he has nothing in hand on these terms with <strong>Clondaw Caitlin</strong>, who has been really impressive in a couple of mares\u2019 hurdles. The mudlover can make her sex allowance tell.</p> \n<p><strong>3.00 Doncaster </strong>Clear of her rivals by 8lb on official ratings, <strong>Cill Anna</strong> is a worthy odds-on shot. Her Wincanton success last time was easily a career best, so she is going the right way.</p> \n<p><strong>3.22 Kelso </strong>The Premier Chase will benefit from the presence of Definitly Red and Saint Xavier, who run here rather than in Doncaster\u2019s Grimthorpe, where they were also declared. Definitly Red is rated a few pounds higher and a small field suits him, but <strong>Saint Xavier </strong>should have plenty more to offer now that he switches to fences. He has some very strong form to his name over fences in France and gives his amateur rider, David Maxwell, a fair shot at a decent prize.</p> \n<p><strong>3.35 Doncaster</strong> The fitting of blinkers has done plenty for <strong>Worthy Farm</strong>, who has won his last two races in them. It looked as though he could be a fair way ahead of his mark at Wincanton last month and a half-stone rise is reasonable. He has his quirks but may be worth chancing. <strong>Chris Cook</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0e7d1cbe-126c-4386-b929-6eacedce45b5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Newbury </b>Racing abandoned&nbsp;<br><b>Kelso </b><b>1.37</b> Stratagem <b>2.12</b> Albert\u2019s Back <b>2.45</b> Clondaw Caitlin <b>3.22</b> Saint Xavier <b>3.57</b> Black Pirate <b>4.32</b> Dunly <b>5.07</b> Monbeg River (nb) <b>Doncaster </b><b>1.50</b> Blackjack Kentucky (nap) <b>2.25</b> Dolos <b>3.00</b> Cill Anna <b>3.35</b> Worthy Farm <b>4.10</b> Firak <b>4.45</b> Stonific <b>5.20</b> Nells Son <br> <b>Lingfield </b><b>1.25</b> Superseded <b>2.00</b> Top Breeze <b>2.35</b> Spirit Warning <b>3.10</b> The Perfect Crown <b>3.45</b> Karibana <b>4.20</b> Pentimento <b>4.55</b> Blazon <b>Southwell </b><b>5.30</b> Mister Music <b>6.00</b> Hatcher <b>6.30</b> Harbour Front <b>7.00</b> Ubla<b> 7.30</b> War Empress <b>8.00</b> The Eagle\u2019s Nest</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Henderson posts positive bulletin on Epatante</h2> \n<p>Supporters of Epatante, who was displaced as favourite for the -Champion Hurdle on Thursday following a report that she had been intermittently coughing, received a more encouraging update from Nicky Henderson on Friday night when the trainer confirmed that his mare remains \u201con course\u201d for hurdling\u2019s championship race.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can tell you Epatante didn\u2019t cough today,\u201d Henderson said after saddling Monte Cristo to win a juvenile hurdle at Newbury.

Willie Mullins\u2019s Benie Des Dieux, who has an alternative option at the Festival in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle the same afternoon, heads the market at 3-1, while Pentland Hills, a stable companion of Epatante, is next in the betting at 5-1.</p> \n<p>No inspections are currently planned for Saturday\u2019s three meetings over jumps in Britain ahead of the arrival of the latest storm from the Atlantic, but the meeting at Navan in Ireland, which was due to include the Grade Three Flyingbolt Novice Chase, has been postponed with details on a rearranged date to follow.

      "bodyText": "Saturday afternoon\u2019s meeting at Newbury has been abandoned due to a waterlogged track. An impromptu 8.30am inspection was called just after 6.30am as 12mm of rain had fallen on already soft ground. However, by 8.15am the decision had already been taken to call the meeting off with no sign of the rain abating and to compound matters strong winds are forecast later in the afternoon. A tweet from the Newbury Racecourse twitter account read: \u201cRACING ABANDONED. The inspection has been brought forward and the racing has been abandoned. The ground is waterlogged following significant rain overnight, and we are expecting more rain and strong winds throughout the day.\u201d The highlight of the card was the William Hill Supporting Greatwood Gold Cup Handicap Chase. Doncaster\u2019s 888Sport Grimthorpe Chase meeting will go ahead as scheduled, however, last year\u2019s winner Chidswell and one of the favourites, Boldmere, are non-runners due to the heavy going. 1.50 Doncaster This weather is ideal for Blackjack Kentucky, who \u201ccan\u2019t have it soft enough\u201d, according to Nicholls. He\u2019s been given a fair mark for this handicap debut, despite an authoritative performance at Chepstow last month. 2.12 Kelso Dali Mail is on a stiff enough mark for this handicap chase after just a couple of spins in novice events, in one of which he fell. Albert\u2019s Back appeals more after a steady introduction to fences. He couldn\u2019t get near First Flow last time but meets nothing of his calibre now. 2.25 Doncaster On what could be a great card for Nicholls, Dolos can follow up on his recent Sandown success, when he was giving 22lb to the runner-up, First Flow. That one has upheld the form with two wide-margin victories in the past fortnight. Gino Trail is interesting on his debut for Fergal O\u2019Brien but is 13 now. 2.45 Kelso Calva D\u2019Auge deserves his place after a couple of battling wins but ratings suggest he has nothing in hand on these terms with Clondaw Caitlin, who has been really impressive in a couple of mares\u2019 hurdles. The mudlover can make her sex allowance tell. 3.00 Doncaster Clear of her rivals by 8lb on official ratings, Cill Anna is a worthy odds-on shot. Her Wincanton success last time was easily a career best, so she is going the right way. 3.22 Kelso The Premier Chase will benefit from the presence of Definitly Red and Saint Xavier, who run here rather than in Doncaster\u2019s Grimthorpe, where they were also declared. Definitly Red is rated a few pounds higher and a small field suits him, but Saint Xavier should have plenty more to offer now that he switches to fences. He has some very strong form to his name over fences in France and gives his amateur rider, David Maxwell, a fair shot at a decent prize. 3.35 Doncaster The fitting of blinkers has done plenty for Worthy Farm, who has won his last two races in them. It looked as though he could be a fair way ahead of his mark at Wincanton last month and a half-stone rise is reasonable. He has his quirks but may be worth chancing. Chris Cook Henderson posts positive bulletin on Epatante Supporters of Epatante, who was displaced as favourite for the -Champion Hurdle on Thursday following a report that she had been intermittently coughing, received a more encouraging update from Nicky Henderson on Friday night when the trainer confirmed that his mare remains \u201con course\u201d for hurdling\u2019s championship race. \u201cI can tell you Epatante didn\u2019t cough today,\u201d Henderson said after saddling Monte Cristo to win a juvenile hurdle at Newbury. That is the official line today. We are forced to say these things before somebody gets it out, and then it\u2019s headline news. Unfortunately, we have to say it before it leaks out and it is drifting [in the betting]. You virtually have to let everyone know before she has even coughed. \u201cBut that is what they are making you do. She has not coughed this morning and we are all on course.\u201d Epatante had been the clear favourite for the Champion Hurdle for two months following her impressive success in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, but she is currently second-favourite with all major layers at a top-price of 9-2. Willie Mullins\u2019s Benie Des Dieux, who has an alternative option at the Festival in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle the same afternoon, heads the market at 3-1, while Pentland Hills, a stable companion of Epatante, is next in the betting at 5-1. No inspections are currently planned for Saturday\u2019s three meetings over jumps in Britain ahead of the arrival of the latest storm from the Atlantic, but the meeting at Navan in Ireland, which was due to include the Grade Three Flyingbolt Novice Chase, has been postponed with details on a rearranged date to follow. Monday\u2019s card at Chepstow has also succumbed to waterlogging, after 25mm fell at the Welsh track up to 3pm on Friday. Greg Wood",
