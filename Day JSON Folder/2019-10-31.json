But Corbyn pointed out that it was Trump who had said it did only a few months ago.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president used the</strong><strong> interview with his ally Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, </strong><strong>to try to offer backing to Boris Johnson.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/31/general-election-latest-news-brexit-labour-tory-real-change-is-coming-says-corbyn-at-labours-campaign-launch-live-news?page=with:block-5dbb148e8f08d669cdab08ac#block-5dbb148e8f08d669cdab08ac\">He said Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK</a> and that Farage and Johnson would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d if they joined up.

It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform.

He also sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/31/general-election-latest-news-brexit-labour-tory-real-change-is-coming-says-corbyn-at-labours-campaign-launch-live-news?page=with:block-5dbacf7e8f08d669cdab04e7#block-5dbacf7e8f08d669cdab04e7\">You can read a summary of his key points here</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-accused-report-russia-dominic-grieve\">accused of preventing the publication of a report</a> assessing the security threat posed to the UK by Russia. </strong>The cross-party intelligence and security committee said it had expected him to approve publication by now.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, joined the Lib Dems.</strong> Sandbach, one of 21 Tory MPs to be kicked out for voting against the government, will contest her current seat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/31/general-election-latest-news-brexit-labour-tory-real-change-is-coming-says-corbyn-at-labours-campaign-launch-live-news?page=with:block-5dbb5a628f08cb84c60a2797#block-5dbb5a628f08cb84c60a2797\">on behalf of her new party</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>A \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s Hacker House company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/jennifer-arcuri-100k-grant-was-appropriate-says-government-report\">has been declared \u201cappropriate\u201d</a> by the government\u2019s internal audit agency. </strong>The report was immediately labelled a \u201cwhitewash\u201d by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson.</li> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister could be poised to sound the death knell for the UK\u2019s controversial shale gas industry after more than a decade of support for fracking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-poised-to-rule-out-new-fracking-say-sources\">according to sources</a>. </strong>Johnson could promise an effective ban as part of his election campaign and green groups believe it could help kill off the industry.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Labour MP Keith Vaz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/keith-vaz-suspended-from-commons-for-six-months\">has been formally suspended</a> from the Commons for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation. </strong>The move was endorsed without a vote after<strong> </strong>a brief Commons debate.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> has the full story:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">Trump says Johnson and Farage could form 'unstoppable force'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T23:26:29.427Z\">at 11.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dbb69ed8f08c428d8934673\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T23:11:30.365Z\">11.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague, <strong>Peter Walker</strong>, has just published a story on Sandbach joining the Lib Dems:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/tory-rebel-antoinette-sandbach-joins-lib-dems-ahead-of-election\">Tory rebel Antoinette Sandbach joins Lib Dems ahead of election</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dbb64df8f08cb84c60a27e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T22:54:17.767Z\">10.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In June, as the Tory leadership contest raged, Sandbach complained of abuse at the hands of male party colleagues.

Together Johnson and Farage would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d, Trump said.</p> \n  <p>Trump also said that there were aspects of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal that would obstruct a UK-US trade deal. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To be honest with you, this deal, under certain aspects of the deal, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t trade. We can\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK ...</p> \n   <p>Under certain ways, we\u2019re precluded - which would be ridiculous. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>From the extract broadcast just now, it is not clear exactly why Trump thought the Brexit plan would hinder a trade deal, but he may have been referring to its level playing field proposals.</p> \n  <p>Trump rejected claims, which Jeremy Corbyn has been making strongly, that the NHS would be threatened by a UK-US trade deal. Health would not be a part of any deal, Trump claimed. \u201cIt is not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>Trump claimed UK-US trade could be four or five times higher than it is now under a deal, which he said would make Britain \u201cmuch bigger economically than it is right now\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And Trump claimed Corbyn would bad for the UK. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Corbyn would be so bad for your country, he\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you on such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn is unlikely to lose any sleep over this non-endorsement. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Donald_Trump\">According to YouGov, </a>two thirds of Britons have a negative opinion of Trump.

It was Labour\u2019s platform that mattered, he said. He replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election ... It\u2019s about each and every one of us standing as labour candidates - the Labour shadow cabinet or any other position - with all the diversity that we\u2019ve got and all the different life experiences we bring to this country and to our party and to our parliament. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a lot of truth in this. People do vote for candidates and parties, not individual leaders, and at the last election Labour performed far better than was expected by people who thought that Corbyn\u2019s leadership would be the decisive factor. But elections do decide who serves as prime minister, and you cannot pretend leadership is irrelevant.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he wanted all NHS services to be delivered by NHS employees. </strong>In response to a question about whether he wanted to stop some NHS services being provided by private companies, as is the case now, he said it was possible to visit a hospital pharmacy now and find that the staff there were not NHS employees. But they wanted to be NHS employees, he said. He went on: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, I do want our NHS to be one where everyone delivering the services of the NHS are NHS employees, part of the family of NHS employees. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. </strong>Corbyn has repeatedly refused to answer this question, fuelling speculation that he might personally remain neutral.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to commit Labour to abolishing public schools. </strong>Asked if Labour would get rid of schools like Eton, he said that the manifesto would be decided at a clause V meeting (a meeting of the shadow cabinet, Labour\u2019s national executive committee and union leaders). But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For starters, we will definitely be making sure that all those private schools \u2013 public schools as they call themselves \u2013 will actually have to pay their taxes in a fair and proper way.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This will not come as any surprise to anyone who looked closely at what Angela Rayner, the shadow education, was promising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/22/labour-conference-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-party-to-have-two-deputy-leaders-live-news?page=with:block-5d8748438f08f30dc5bc014b#block-5d8748438f08f30dc5bc014b\">in her speech to the Labour conference in September.</a> But there was a difference between what Rayner actually promised (integrating private schools with state schools), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/22/labour-conference-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-party-to-have-two-deputy-leaders-live-news?page=with:block-5d87aaee8f08f9df5bdd9591#block-5d87aaee8f08f9df5bdd9591\">what the much more radical motion passed by delegates actually promised</a>, and the way Momentum, the organisation for Corbyn supporters, described the significance of the motion.

He recovers, and jokes about there only being seven more weeks of this to go.</p> \n  <p>He says Labour will properly fund youth services.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: How will Labour fix the education system?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says the Tories said they were introducing a fair funding system for schools. But that was Orwellian, he says. It was cut after cut after cut.</p> \n  <p>He says he wants to remove the stress on children they suffer under the education system. League tables are great things, he says. He says that as an Arsenal supporter. But he says they do not work for education. They are contributing to rising stress for chldren.

Almost 40% of the children in his community are in poverty. A third of people live in the rented sector. People are terrified of universal credit. He says his community has people who are totally up against it. He has been proud to represent his constituency.</p> \n  <p>And, whatever position he has held, he has always worked flat out to represent the people who elected him.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you appoint all your shadow cabinet to the same jobs in cabinet?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says it would not be appropriate to decide who will serve in cabinet now.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you serve a full five-year term as PM?</em></p> \n  <p>He says he loves meeting people, he loves campaigning, and he will be so proud to lead a Labour government that ends universal credit and builds the homes the country needs.</p> \n  <p>When he joined Labour in the 1960s, he wanted a more just society and a peaceful world. Nothing in those beliefs has changed.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would Labour abolish Eton?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says the manifesto is still being written. He says it will be discussed at the clause V meeting. For starters, Labour will ensure public schools have to pay their taxes in full.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Do you think all leaders should publish their tax returns? </em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says he and John McDonnell publish theirs in full. The first time he did this, it turned out he had overpaid tax by about \u00a3300.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: When did you last speak to Nicola Sturgeon?</em></p> \n  <p>About 10 days ago, Corbyn says.

It is true that Labour voted against the programme motion, setting aside just three days for MPs to debate the bill. But the programme motion was defeated because the DUP (supposedly Johnson\u2019s allies) and former Tories who had had the whip removed voted against it, and Labour offered to strike a deal with the government on a programme motion giving MPs more time to debate the bill, which may well have passed. But Johnson did not try this, and instead shelved the bill and went for an election.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claims there would be two referendums in 2020 under Labour.</strong> It is true that Labour wants to hold a second Brexit referendum next year, but the party says it would not allow a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020.

      "bodyText": "But that\u2019s it from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: Aspects of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would obstruct US-UK trade, Donald Trump claimed in a UK radio interview. No 10 sought to counter the claim, which has the potential to seriously damage Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign, shortly after the interview was broadcast on LBC. Labour batted away criticism from Trump, with the party\u2019s leader accusing the US president of interfering in the UK\u2019s general election. Trump claimed the US did not require the NHS to be on the table in any post-Brexit bilateral trade talks. But Corbyn pointed out that it was Trump who had said it did only a few months ago. The US president used the interview with his ally Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, to try to offer backing to Boris Johnson. He said Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK and that Farage and Johnson would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d if they joined up. Some observers suggested the comments could be more useful to Corbyn than to Johnson. Labour launched its general election campaign, with the party\u2019s leader insisting he will not be its focus. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election,\u201d Corbyn said when asked about his own personal extremely low approval ratings. Corbyn pledged to immediately begin buying property to house rough sleepers if Labour win the election. The Labour leader added that everyone delivering NHS services should be an NHS employee but he refused to commit Labour to abolishing public schools. He also sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. You can read a summary of his key points here. Johnson was accused of preventing the publication of a report assessing the security threat posed to the UK by Russia. The cross-party intelligence and security committee said it had expected him to approve publication by now. The former Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, joined the Lib Dems. Sandbach, one of 21 Tory MPs to be kicked out for voting against the government, will contest her current seat on behalf of her new party. A \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s Hacker House company has been declared \u201cappropriate\u201d by the government\u2019s internal audit agency. The report was immediately labelled a \u201cwhitewash\u201d by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. The prime minister could be poised to sound the death knell for the UK\u2019s controversial shale gas industry after more than a decade of support for fracking, according to sources. Johnson could promise an effective ban as part of his election campaign and green groups believe it could help kill off the industry. The Labour MP Keith Vaz has been formally suspended from the Commons for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation. The move was endorsed without a vote after a brief Commons debate. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: My colleague, Peter Walker, has just published a story on Sandbach joining the Lib Dems: In June, as the Tory leadership contest raged, Sandbach complained of abuse at the hands of male party colleagues. She tweeted an image of messages she said were from one and suggested that similar abuse had been behind the decisions of three female former Conservative MPs to leave the party. Sandbach, who was then still a Tory MP and was supporting Rory Stewart in the party\u2019s leadership race, said the message read: \u201cYou too are a disgrace. Time you left the party I think.\u201d She added: Barely is the ink dry on the results and the dark ops begin. This from a male conservative MP to me as I sit on the train home. She tagged it with the words \u201ccompletewankspangle\u201d but later deleted the tweet. In a supplementary tweet that remained live, she wrote: It\u2019s bad enough when you get it from complete strangers. Is it any wonder three female MPs left. Just last week, my colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson visited Sandbach\u2019s constituency; a safe Tory seat is estimated to have voted 52% in favour of leave in the referendum. She reported that Sandbach felt her stance \u2013 voting for Theresa May\u2019s deal, but against a no-deal Brexit \u2013 reflected her constituents\u2019 views. Here\u2019s what she found when she spoke to some of them: Earlier this month, Sandbach lost a vote of confidence among members of her local Conservative party association. She was appealing the withdrawal of the Tory whip, following the prime minister\u2019s decision to remove it after she voted with opposition MPs to take control of the Commons order paper in September. But Tory party members in her Eddisbury constituency in Cheshire passed a vote of no confidence in her. The ballot was symbolic but opened the door to formal deselection. At the time, Sandbach complained of \u201centryism\u201d and said she was granted only six minutes to set out her defence. This is obviously deeply disappointing, but I won\u2019t allow an unrepresentative handful of people decide who gets to be the MP for tens of thousands of Eddisbury voters. All my constituents can rest assured that I will continue to represent them in parliament, standing up for a sensible, pragmatic Brexit deal and confirming that it is what the people want through a \u2018final say\u2019 confirmatory referendum. Antoinette Sandbach has become the latest of the 21 MPs from whom the Tory whip was withdrawn last month to move over the Lib Dems, the party has announced. Sandbach will stand for the party for her current seat in the constituency of Eddisbury, in Cheshire, on 12 December. As the news was announced tonight, she said: This general election will be the most important in my lifetime. People have a very clear choice, the Conservative party offers years of uncertainty whilst the Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit. I\u2019m so proud to stand alongside other Liberal Democrat candidates across the country to fight for a brighter future with Jo Swinson, our candidate to be prime minister. I will stand on my strong local record, helping to secure local investment, fighting for fair funding for our schools and to secure additional funding in local health services. Our country deserves so much better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. I can\u2019t wait to get to work, win this election and then deliver for my constituents and our country. Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has added: I am delighted to welcome Antoinette to the Liberal Democrats. She is a passionate campaigner, and will be a fantastic candidate at the general election and a great addition to our party. Her defection clearly shows that the Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and attracting support from right across the political spectrum. Antoinette is one of the millions of people who are tired of the two old parties, led by people who will take our country backwards, not forwards. It is only the Liberal Democrats that will stop Brexit and build the brighter future that our country deserves. The BBC is set to reject Labour\u2019s complaint about a Panorama documentary which alleged widespread antisemitism in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party, according to individuals with knowledge of the case. The decision is likely to set up a clash between the public broadcaster and the opposition that will run during the forthcoming general election campaign. The episode of Panorama entitled \u201cIs Labour Anti-Semitic?\u201d was broadcast this summer and made a number of claims about Labour\u2019s attitude towards the issue in recent years. It interviewed party activists and officials who said they were undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism. Labour strongly rejected the programme\u2019s conclusions, which included suggestions from a group of whistleblowers including the former general secretary Iain McNicol that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s director of strategy and communications, Seumas Milne, and the current general secretary, Jennie Formby, interfered with investigations into antisemitism. However, the Guardian has learned that the BBC\u2019s Executive Complaints Unit, the top level of the broadcaster\u2019s internal complaints process, has finished investigating the concerns raised by Labour and decided to back the programme-makers. A BBC spokesperson declined to comment. My colleague, Rowena Mason, has just published this story on Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cPR stunt\u201d visit to a Cambridgeshire hospital: Julia Simons, a 23-year-old medical student, who had confronted the prime minister, said: Staff were not informed even when he was in the hospital. He was too cowardly to face the uncensored opinions of staff because we know the reality the effects of his government\u2019s and party\u2019s policies on patients. A No 10 spokesman has contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that a UK-US trade deal might not be possible under Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal agreement. The PM negotiated a new deal which ensures that we take back control of our laws, trade, borders and money; a deal which people said he would never negotiate. Under this new deal, the whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union, which means we can strike our own free trade deals around the world from which every part of the UK will benefit. Last night, my colleague Rowena Mason reported that the Tories\u2019 election campaign was set to be run by Isaac Levido, the former right-hand man of Lynton Crosby. The PM\u2019s de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, was not due to be centrally involved and had remained in Downing Street, she reported. This evening, she has this update: It emerged earlier this afternoon that an inquiry had concluded the \u00a3100,000 government grant given to a firm run by Jennifer Arcuri, the US businesswoman embroiled in a conflict of interest row over her close friendship with Boris Johnson, was \u201cappropriate\u201d. The shadow culture secretary and Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, has now said: This \u2018review\u2019 is a complete whitewash. The documents published raise more questions than we had before. No one reading Hacker House\u2019s grant application would give the company a penny, let alone \u00a3100,000 of tax payers\u2019 money. The fundamental question of why Hacker House was ever given this grant remains unanswered. The public deserve to know why their money was handled so irresponsibly. We will not let this lie. On Corbyn, Trump said: I have great relationships with many of the leaders, including Boris. He\u2019s a fantastic man and I think he\u2019s the exact right guy for the time and I know you and him will end up doing something that could be terrific if you (Farage) and he, if you and he get together as, you know, an unstoppable force. And Corbyn would be so bad for your country. He\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you in such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places. But, your country has tremendous potential, it\u2019s a great country. Trump told LBC he has got on well with both the current and former prime ministers on a personal level. Referring to the current occupant of No 10, Trump said: Oh yeah, Boris and I have a great friendship, we\u2019ve become friends. Boris and I, when he was running they were saying: \u2018He\u2019s the Trump, he\u2019s the Trump.\u2019 We have a lot of the same things going, I guess. Boris is a terrific guy, you know that he\u2019s a terrific guy. I think it was time for Boris, it was time you needed him. As some correspondents in Westminster have pointed out, this could end up playing better for Labour than for the Conservatives: Referring to his relationships with Theresa May, Trump told LBC: Well, I liked her very much. You know, I disagreed with certain things that she did but I like her; she was always very nice to me, I was nice to her ... I told her exactly how to make a deal but she didn\u2019t listen to me and that\u2019s okay; not everybody listens to me. Some people do. According to May, Trump\u2019s advice to her was to \u201csue the European Union\u201d. Trump also suggested that gossip about the US having its eyes on the NHS may have started with the Labour leader, telling LBC: I don\u2019t even know where your healthcare system started with respect to us taking over your healthcare system. I mean it\u2019s so ridiculous I think Corbyn put that out there. In reality, besides Trump having himself put it out there (see previous post), his ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, has also explicitly and publicly raised the prospect. On US designs on parts of the NHS, Trump told LBC: No, not at all, we wouldn\u2019t even be involved in that no. We\u2019re trying to fix our health service. We all have our health service problems ... No. it\u2019s not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system. No, we\u2019re just talking about trade. The US president has previously contradicted himself on whether or not Washington would want the NHS on the table in trade talks. In June, he said: When you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So NHS or anything else. A lot more than that. Later the same day, he said: I don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. Here\u2019s what Trump told Farage on his discussions with the prime minister over the latter\u2019s Brexit deal: We wanna do trade with the UK and they wanna do trade with us and, to be honest with you, this deal \u2013 under certain aspects of the deal \u2013 you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t trade. Trump added that the US would be barred from some parts of the UK market under Johnson\u2019s deal; a situation that he said \u201cwould be ridiculous\u201d. Reacting to Trump\u2019s LBC interview, the Lib Dems\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, has said: Donald Trump is unfit to hold the office of president of the United States. Boris Johnson is unfit to be prime minister of the United Kingdom. This endorsement is yet another example of the cuddly relationship between the two men. As the saying goes, you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep. Trump is a bully, a misogynist and a racist. Yet the Conservatives have fawned to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with him. A trade deal that would threaten food standards and our precious NHS. Liberal Democrats will continue to stand up to regressive politics and will continue to fight to stop Brexit and build a brighter future. As has been suggested elsewhere, Farage has opened himself up to claims of hypocrisy by inviting a sitting US president to intervene when the UK is preparing to vote on its future. Here\u2019s what the Brexit party leader told Fox News in 2016 in reaction to Barack Obama saying the UK would be at the back of the queue in trade negotiations if it voted to leave the EU: Vladimir Putin behaved in a more statesmanlike manner than President Obama did in this referendum campaign. Obama came to Britain and, I think, behaved disgracefully; telling us we would be at the back of the queue. Vladimir Putin maintained his silence throughout the whole campaign. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has responded to Trump\u2019s interview with LBC, tweeting: Corbyn\u2019s referring to Trump\u2019s claim that the US would have no involvement in the NHS under a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal. The US president has, at different times, said the NHS would and would not be on the table in any such negotiations. Donald Trump opened his interview with LBC by again repeating his nonsense claim to have correctly predicted the result of the Brexit referendum when he opened his Turnberry golf course on 24 June 2016. The Brexit referendum was held on 23 June 2016. Trump\u2019s interviewer, the political campaigner and Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, nodded, said \u201cyep\u201d and allowed the false claim to pass. Donald Trump has used an interview with his ally Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader and LBC broadcaster, to intervene in the UK election. Trump said that Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK, and that Farage and Boris Johnson would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d if they joined up in some way. (See 5.28pm.) Trump also criticised Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, saying it could obstruct a UK-US trade deal. (See 5.28pm.) Corbyn has insisted Labour\u2019s 2019 general election campaign is \u201cnot about me\u201d, as he declined to say whether he would step aside if the party failed to dislodge Johnson from Downing Street in six weeks. Johnson has been accused of preventing the publication of a report assessing the security threat posed by Russia to the UK and whether a future general election could be affected by Kremlin-sponsored disinformation. A \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s Hacker House company by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) has been considered \u201cappropriate\u201d by the government\u2019s internal audit agency. The prime minister could be poised to sound the death knell for the UK\u2019s controversial shale gas industry after more than a decade of support for fracking, according to sources. The Labour MP Keith Vaz has been formally suspended from the Commons for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation, after the Commons endorsed the findings of an inquiry. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. On Radio 4\u2019s PM programme Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, dismissed President Trump\u2019s claim that a Jeremy Corbyn government would take Britain into a bad place. (See 5.28pm.) McDonald said: I think the bad place a lot of Americans experienced [is] at the hands of Donald Trump. So I\u2019m really not concerned that Nigel Farage and Donald Trump have reaffirmed their commitment to one another. We do know that the American pharmaceutical industry is very interested in our national health service and we have made it abundantly clear that the NHS is not for sale and Donald Trump is not going get anywhere near our NHS. And nor are we enthused at the prospect of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef coming into our country with low standards for food safety. We are not going to be tolerating anything like that. Here is some comment from journalists on the Trump interview. From the BBC\u2019s Jon Sopel From my colleague Paul Johnson From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has recorded an interview with his political ally Donald Trump for his LBC radio show. The whole thing is being broadcast later, but LBC has just broadcast a clip, and it included Trump saying that he thought Farage should be uniting in some way with Boris Johnson. Together Johnson and Farage would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d, Trump said. Trump also said that there were aspects of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal that would obstruct a UK-US trade deal. He said: To be honest with you, this deal, under certain aspects of the deal, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t trade. We can\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK ... Under certain ways, we\u2019re precluded - which would be ridiculous. From the extract broadcast just now, it is not clear exactly why Trump thought the Brexit plan would hinder a trade deal, but he may have been referring to its level playing field proposals. Trump rejected claims, which Jeremy Corbyn has been making strongly, that the NHS would be threatened by a UK-US trade deal. Health would not be a part of any deal, Trump claimed. \u201cIt is not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system,\u201d he said. Trump claimed UK-US trade could be four or five times higher than it is now under a deal, which he said would make Britain \u201cmuch bigger economically than it is right now\u201d. And Trump claimed Corbyn would bad for the UK. He said: Corbyn would be so bad for your country, he\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you on such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places. Corbyn is unlikely to lose any sleep over this non-endorsement. According to YouGov, two thirds of Britons have a negative opinion of Trump. Only 19% have a positive view of him - and they are unlikely to include many potential Labour voters. The legislation to allow the early election has now had royal assent, the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley reports. With John Bercow standing down as Speaker at the end of today, here is a Guardian compilation of some of the highlights of his time in the chair. And here are some excerpts from what was said when MPs paid tribute to him yesterday. Boris Johnson was booed as he ended a visit to Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, the Cambridge News reports. There is a story here and a live blog covering the visit here. The pro-Labour Skwawkbox blog has also posted some footage. These are from Mark Urban, Newsnight\u2019s diplomatic editor, on the story that Boris Johnson has been accused of holding back the publication of a report from parliament\u2019s intelligence and security report looking at the issue of Russian interference in British elections. Labour would rather run a minority government if necessary than try to form a coalition or pact with another party, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. Speaking to Sky News this morning, at the Labour campaign launch, McDonnell said he expected the party to win a majority. But when asked what would happen if it didn\u2019t, but if it was still in a position to govern (ie, it was the largest party in a hung parliament), he replied: We would run a minority government. We\u2019d implement the policies and we\u2019d expect the other parties to support them. If they didn\u2019t, well, we\u2019ll go back to the people. Look, who wouldn\u2019t vote for a \u00a310 living wage? Who wouldn\u2019t vote for the way in which we want to solve Brexit, going back to the people? Who wouldn\u2019t vote for actually ensuring we invested in all our public services, and a fair taxation system? Asked if Labour would consider a confidence and supply agreement with one of the smaller parties, McDonnell went on: No deals, no deals. We do in as a majority government. If there is a minority, we will implement our manifesto, full stop. Jeremy Corbyn has said that Labour will \u201cimmediately\u201d start rehousing the homeless if it wins the election. Speaking at a campaign event in Milton Keynes, Corbyn called the level of homelessness in the UK a \u201cdisgrace and insult to our country\u201d, and promised a Labour government would end austerity. As the Press Assocaition reports, he said: On our first day in office, we will immediately buy all the properties necessary to house the rough sleepers. Boris Johnson made an election stop at a primary school in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where he joined a group of children in an activity sorting pictures of London into past and present, the Press Association reports. The PM held one black and white image aloft and suggested \u201cpast?\u201d. One pupil agreed and said it \u201clooks dirtier\u201d, to which the prime minister replied: \u201cThat was when Ken Livingstone was running it.\u201d Referring to a photo of London Bridge, Johnson told the youngsters: \u201cYou know what they used to do? They used to stick the decapitated heads of the enemies on spikes.\u201d He also visited a classroom where children were mummifying pumpkins with salt, and another where they made firework collages. At the last election the conventional opinion polls turned out to be a very poor guide to the result. On that basis some people argue they should be ignored completely, but the political parties take them seriously, they are better than most other ways of trying to gauge public opinion and even sceptics will admit that they pick up movements in opinion, even if they don\u2019t provide a reliable guide to the final result. With that in mind, here are the results of the three polls around today. An Ipsos Mori poll for the Evening Standard gives the Tories a 17-point lead over Labour. The poll also confirms that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal approval ratings remain dismal. The Standard reports: Mr Johnson has the best personal scores of any leader since 2017, with 46% satisfied and 44% dissatisfied \u2014 a net score of plus 2. Conservatives are overwhelmingly happy with their leader, with 80% satisfied and 9% dissatisfied. Mr Corbyn has failed to improve since last month\u2019s record-breaking low personal scores. Just 15% of voters are happy with his performance and 75% are unhappy \u2014 a net score of minus 60. Labour voters are divided about their leader, with 46% satisfied and 49% dissatisfied. A YouGov poll gives the Tories a 15-point lead over Labour. A Survation poll for the Daily Mail gives the Tories an eight-point lead over Labour. As the Mail reports, it also gives Boris Johnson a small lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the issue of health. It says: Asked which leader had the best health policies, 36% of voters said Mr Johnson while 34% opted for Mr Corbyn. There is more information here on the Guardian\u2019s election poll tracker. I missed this picture earlier. Perhaps Jeremy Corbyn was practising for when he meets the Queen ... The House of Commons has just approved the recommendation from the Commons standards committee for Keith Vaz to be suspended for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers. The motion was passed without a division. With parliament due to be dissolved at the end of Tuesday ahead of the general election, the decision may have little practical effect. Vaz is under pressure not to stand again as a candidate. (See 9.47am). The debate was marked by a bitter exchanges between Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative backbencher, and John Bercow, who is on his last day as Speaker. Bridgen accused Bercow of being biased in favour of Vaz. Bercow denied this and, referring to Bridgen, he told MPs: He can try to smear me, he will get the square root of nowhere. Here is a good question from below the line. You are right, but you are missing something. It was Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby who put it to Jeremy Corbyn that he has the lowest approval rating for any opposition leader since 1977. (See 11.51am.) She was referring to this Ipsos Mori survey. But I don\u2019t think she meant it in the way you have interpreted it. What Ipsos Mori says is that Corbyn has \u201cthe lowest net satisfaction ratings of any opposition leader since the survey began in 1977\u201d - not the lowest rating since the opposition leader in 1977, Margaret Thatcher. Here are the figures. Boris Johnson has been accused of sitting on a key report assessing the threat posed by Russia to Britain\u2019s democratic processes, the Press Association reports. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve argued voters must have access to the report by the intelligence and security committee, which he chairs, given an election has been called for 12 December. He said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the prime minister to \u201csit on it\u201d, informing the Commons that Johnson should have confirmed on Thursday that no classified matters were remaining in the report. The full story is here. After his failure to meet his cast-iron, \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by 31 October (today), you might have thought that Boris Johnson would think twice before setting a fresh deadline for Brexit. But he has been at it again. During a visit to Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, he said if the Conservatives were elected, Brexit would definitely happen by the end of January. He said: If you vote for us and we get our programme through ... then we can be out at the absolute latest by January next year. He also said he had an \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit deal ready to go if he won the election. This morning the Telegraph splashed on a story saying the Brexit party could stand aside in hundreds of seats - a move that could considerably help the Conservatives, who are at risk from the pro-Brexit vote being split. As Gordon Rayner and James Rothwell report in their story (paywall): Splits have emerged in Nigel Farage\u2019s party over its election strategy, with several senior figures backing the \u2018sensible\u2019 option of focusing its resources on a small number of Leave-voting Labour seats that it stands a realistic chance of winning. One senior Brexit party MEP suggested the party could field as few as 20 candidates, while other sources suggested the figure would be nearer 100. Mr Farage, who previously suggested he would field 600 candidates, said on Wednesday night he was still \u2018working through\u2019 his options, but there are fears at the top of the party that splitting the Leave vote in marginal constituencies could lead to a Jeremy Corbyn premiership. Asked about the report today, Farage played it down, but did not deny it outright. He told PA Media: This is idle speculation. I have not spoken to anyone of any seniority in the party [about this]. The Lib Dems have confirmed they are standing aside in Beaconsfield to help Dominic Grieve, the former Tory, run as a pro-remain independent candidate. Rob Castell, the party\u2019s former parliamentary candidate, said it was true that he would step back because of these \u201cunprecedented times\u201d. Grieve, a supporter of a second referendum and key architect of the parliamentary battle against no deal, said today: I will run as an independent. I have no idea what the outcome will be. All I can do is offer myself to my constituents as an individual. If they want me, I\u2019m here to serve. If they don\u2019t, no hard feelings. In Grieve\u2019s Buckinghamshire seat of Beaconsfield, he won 36,559 votes for the Tories in 2017, compared with Labour\u2019s 12,016 and 4,448 for the Lib Dems. At first minister\u2019s questions in the Scottish parliament the Scottish Tories\u2019 interim leader, Jackson Carlaw, immediately asked Nicola Sturgeon if she\u2019d like to thank Jeremy Corbyn for allowing her a second independence referendum. (Actually Corbyn was yesterday using the same form of words that the Labour leadership has done since the summer: opposing independence but not refusing another referendum, though not in early years of a Labour government. The trouble is that this contradicts Scottish Labour\u2019s official policy and, like their Brexit stance, isn\u2019t easy to put across on the doorsteps.) Sturgeon hit back by asking Carlaw about a story in this morning\u2019s Times, suggesting an electoral pact by Tories and Labour to step back and allow the Lib Dems a clear run in their attempts to oust SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, in his Highland constituency, previously held by the late Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy. She also hit a nerve by telling Carlaw that she sympathised with him, given that his party had so little confidence in him that they used a backbencher\u2019s photo in their election material. This refers to leaflets bearing the face of recently departed leader Ruth Davidson: the loss of her personal voter appeal is something the Scottish Tories are expected to feel keenly during this campaign. While Sturgeon hammered her message that only a vote for the SNP could keep the Tories out of Downing Street, and Carlaw pitched the Tory guarantee of no more referendums, don\u2019t expect the electioneering at Holyrood to let up anytime soon .... Jeremy Corbyn will be pleased with that speech. It had a clear message, it was very well received from the activists in the hall and even the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges, who has cast more vitriol over Corbyn than almost anyone else in the British commentariat, had to concede that Corbyn had done a good job. It did not contain any surprises, but it set out Labour\u2019s platform quite compellingly. The key points from the speech are summarised at 9.02am and at 9.24am. As usual, the more unexpected stuff came in the Q&amp;A. Here are the main points. Corbyn said the election was not about him personally. In response to a question about his own personal extremely low approval ratings, he said it was not a \u201cpresidential election\u201d. It was Labour\u2019s platform that mattered, he said. He replied: It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election ... It\u2019s about each and every one of us standing as labour candidates - the Labour shadow cabinet or any other position - with all the diversity that we\u2019ve got and all the different life experiences we bring to this country and to our party and to our parliament. There is a lot of truth in this. People do vote for candidates and parties, not individual leaders, and at the last election Labour performed far better than was expected by people who thought that Corbyn\u2019s leadership would be the decisive factor. But elections do decide who serves as prime minister, and you cannot pretend leadership is irrelevant. He said that he wanted all NHS services to be delivered by NHS employees. In response to a question about whether he wanted to stop some NHS services being provided by private companies, as is the case now, he said it was possible to visit a hospital pharmacy now and find that the staff there were not NHS employees. But they wanted to be NHS employees, he said. He went on: Yes, I do want our NHS to be one where everyone delivering the services of the NHS are NHS employees, part of the family of NHS employees. He sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. Corbyn has repeatedly refused to answer this question, fuelling speculation that he might personally remain neutral. He refused to commit Labour to abolishing public schools. Asked if Labour would get rid of schools like Eton, he said that the manifesto would be decided at a clause V meeting (a meeting of the shadow cabinet, Labour\u2019s national executive committee and union leaders). But he went on: For starters, we will definitely be making sure that all those private schools \u2013 public schools as they call themselves \u2013 will actually have to pay their taxes in a fair and proper way. This will not come as any surprise to anyone who looked closely at what Angela Rayner, the shadow education, was promising in her speech to the Labour conference in September. But there was a difference between what Rayner actually promised (integrating private schools with state schools), what the much more radical motion passed by delegates actually promised, and the way Momentum, the organisation for Corbyn supporters, described the significance of the motion. It put out a press release after the composite was carried saying: \u201cLabour commits to abolishing private schools in next manifesto.\u201d From what Corbyn is saying today, it sounds as if the manifesto will not be saying that. Corbyn refused to commit himself to serving a full five-year term if elected prime minister. He refused to commit to appoint members of the shadow cabinet to the cabinet posts they currently shadow. He said that he last spoke to Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minster, about 10 days ago. He implied that, if he were prime minister, he would be better than Johnson at maintaining good relations with other parties. I do keep in touch with, obviously, political leaders around the country because that is what leading the party is all about. You know what, when we go into government, it\u2019s going to be so much different and so much better, because we\u2019ll have a different world and a different society and take government that doesn\u2019t try and divide people, but instead tries to bring them together. According to the Times Scottish political editor, Kieran Andrews, Sturgeon was less cordial when speaking about Corbyn at first minister\u2019s questions today. Corbyn said he would like the media to \u201cjust report what we say\u201d. Talking about the campaign, he said: I\u2019ll be all over the country, meeting people, listening to people and taking that message there. And I ask our media, as good journalists, to just report what we say. This was just a plea for fair reporting, but it has attracted some comment on Twitter from journalists who have had to put up with complaints from left that reporting what No 10 says amounts to mere stenography. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said when asked about his own personal extremely low approval ratings. He said it was not a \u201cpresidential election\u201d. It was Labour\u2019s platform that mattered, he said. He explained: It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election ... It\u2019s about each and every one of us standing as Labour candidates \u2013 the Labour shadow cabinet or any other position \u2013 with all the diversity that we\u2019ve got and all the different life experiences we bring to this country and to our party and to our parliament. The event is now over. I will post a summary shortly. Corbyn is now taking questions from Labour supporters at the event. Q: What will Labour do to improve youth services? Corbyn says we should be cherishing and supporting young people. Some councils have been able to maintain youth services. He says he wants to say thank you to youth workers for what they do. At this point his voice seems to give out for a moment. He recovers, and jokes about there only being seven more weeks of this to go. He says Labour will properly fund youth services. Q: How will Labour fix the education system? Corbyn says the Tories said they were introducing a fair funding system for schools. But that was Orwellian, he says. It was cut after cut after cut. He says he wants to remove the stress on children they suffer under the education system. League tables are great things, he says. He says that as an Arsenal supporter. But he says they do not work for education. They are contributing to rising stress for chldren. That is why Labour would end testing at key stage one and key stage two. More questions. Q: Are you part of the Islington elite? Corbyn says he has been MP for Islington North since 1983. Almost 40% of the children in his community are in poverty. A third of people live in the rented sector. People are terrified of universal credit. He says his community has people who are totally up against it. He has been proud to represent his constituency. And, whatever position he has held, he has always worked flat out to represent the people who elected him. Q: Would you appoint all your shadow cabinet to the same jobs in cabinet? Corbyn says it would not be appropriate to decide who will serve in cabinet now. Q: Would you serve a full five-year term as PM? He says he loves meeting people, he loves campaigning, and he will be so proud to lead a Labour government that ends universal credit and builds the homes the country needs. When he joined Labour in the 1960s, he wanted a more just society and a peaceful world. Nothing in those beliefs has changed. Q: Would Labour abolish Eton? Corbyn says the manifesto is still being written. He says it will be discussed at the clause V meeting. For starters, Labour will ensure public schools have to pay their taxes in full. Q: Do you think all leaders should publish their tax returns? Corbyn says he and John McDonnell publish theirs in full. The first time he did this, it turned out he had overpaid tax by about \u00a3300. Q: When did you last speak to Nicola Sturgeon? About 10 days ago, Corbyn says. He says as a political leader he has to keep in touch. Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: Your pitch to the public is similar to your one in 2017. Why do you think the message will work now when you did not win then? Corbyn says he is putting a pitch to the public about what can be achieved. He says there have been three Tory leaders since he became Labour leader. And the government has been defeated in parliament 48 times. He is prepared for this campaign. Q: In 2017 you defied your critics. But now you have the lowest polling ratings of any opposition leader since 1977. How will you get the public to feel the same way about you as people in this room do? And if you lose, will you stand aside? Corbyn says it is not about him, or any individual on this platform. \u201cIt is not a presidential election.\u201d He says it is about Labour candidates, \u201cwith all the diversity we\u2019ve got and all the life experiences we bring to this country\u201d. He says he asks the media to just report what he says. Corbyn counters concerns about his leadership by saying election is not about him. Q: How will you vote in the next Brexit referendum? Corbyn says Brexit has divided people, communities and families. He says there are people who voted leave and remain who experience the same problems. He says Labour wants to take no deal off the table. That is why he refused to support any move that might allow Boris Johnson do to this. He says a Labour government would open negotiations with the EU about a sensible relationship with the EU, that would not destroy jobs. There would be a customs union, which would keep the border in Ireland as it is now. And the Good Friday agreement would be intake. And a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump would not be an option. Q: The private sector provides services for thousands of people already under the NHS. Would you end these arrangements? Corbyn says private companies that do not get NHS contracts sue the NHS. He says he asked Richard Branson to give the money Virgin Health got form this to the NHS. He says he wants everyone delivering NHS services to be NHS employees. Corbyn says everyone delivering NHS services should be an NHS employee. From the Scotsman\u2019s Paris Gourtsoyannis Corbyn is now on his peroration. Boris Johnson thought he was being smart holding this election in a dark and cold December. He thinks you won\u2019t go out to vote. He thinks you won\u2019t go out to campaign. Well I say this: Labour will be out there in every city, town and village with the biggest and most confident campaign that our country has ever seen, bringing a message of hope and change to every community. Even if the rivers freeze over, we\u2019re going out to bring about real change for the many, not the few. All we need to keep us warm is the thought of removing Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives from government \u2013 and the chance to rebuild and transform our country. Back in Battersea Arts Centre Corbyn says: when Labour wins, everyone wins. Hundreds of thousands of people in every part of our country who will make this the biggest people-powered campaign in history. We\u2019re young, we\u2019re old, we\u2019re black, we\u2019re white, we\u2019re straight, we\u2019re gay, we\u2019re women, we\u2019re men, we\u2019re people of all faiths and none, from the north and from the south. And when Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins. We all win. The Conservative party press office is posting tweets rebutting Corbyn\u2019s speech as he delivers it. Here are some examples. Corbyn says Boris Johnson wants people to think that Brexit is being blocked by an establishment elite. But people know that the Conservatives are the establishment elite, he says. Corbyn is now using the \u201cwhose side are you on\u201d passage I quoted earlier. (See 9.24am.) Corbyn says a decade of Conservative cuts has done huge damage to the country. After a decade when real wages have fallen, for too many people, what they see is the community they love being run down through years of deliberate neglect. The evidence of a decade of economic vandalism is all around them. It\u2019s there in the boarded up shops. In the closed library and swimming pool. In youth centres that have closed their doors. The high street like a ghost town. The elderly couple who are scared to walk down their road because violent crime has doubled. The army veteran sleeping under blankets in a doorway. People struggling to make ends meet. The mother and her children eating from a food bank because they\u2019ve been forced onto universal credit. That\u2019s the evidence of Conservative cuts. Well I say, no more. Labour would end austerity and scrap universal credit, he says. Corbyn turns to the claim that Brexit could open up the NHS to American corporations. Despite his denials, the NHS is up for grabs by US corporations in a one-sided Trump trade sell-out. Channel 4 Dispatches revealed this week that the cost of drugs and medicines has repeatedly been discussed between US and UK trade officials. Remember Johnson\u2019s famous promise of \u00a3350m a week for the NHS? Well his toxic Brexit trade deal with Trump could hand over \u00a3500m a week of NHS money to big drugs corporations. We will stop them. Labour won\u2019t let Donald Trump get his hands on our National Health Service. It\u2019s not for sale, to him or anyone. (I am using the quotes from the text sent out by Labour. Corbyn is making some minor changes to the text, but the quotes I am using represent what he is saying.) At this point activists in the hall break into a change of \u201cnot for sale\u201d for 10 seconds or so. Corbyn turns to Brexit. Friends, today is the 31st of October, the day Boris Johnson promised we would leave the EU. He said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay beyond today. But he has failed. And that failure is his alone. You can\u2019t trust Boris Johnson. Corbyn confirms Labour\u2019s plan to hold a referendum, with voters being given a choice between a \u201csensible deal\u201d and remain. It is not complicated, he says (trying to counter claims that Labour\u2019s Brexit policy is not straightforward.) Corbyn says this election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform the country, and to ensure that no community in any part of the country is ever left behind again. Some people say real change is not possible, he says. Really? A health service where people do not have to wait, and prescriptions are free? Is that asking too much? Is it asking to much to have a care system where people are treated with dignity, with free personal care? It is asking to much to have a real living wage for everyone, including young workers from the age of 16? Is it asking too much to have homes that people can afford, rents that don\u2019t break the bank, and an end to the disgrace of rough sleeping? 30 hours free childcare for all children. A good education from cradle to grave. Is that too much to ask? Corbyn says he would put rail, mail and water into public ownership, ending the Tory rip-off. What about real action on the climate crisis by creating hundreds of thousands of new, green energy jobs in communities where they\u2019re most desperately needed? No, that\u2019s not asking too much. Because we have to radically change course now to avoid living on a hostile and dying planet. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says he is launching the most ambitious and radical campaign the country has ever seen. If you want to live in a society that works for everyone, not just billionaires, if you want to stop the cuts and save the environment, then this is your chance to vote for it. He says the choice could not be clearer. Labour stands with you, he says. It will put wealth and power in the hands of the many. Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, who think they are born to rule, will only ever look after the few, he says. De Cordova is talking about her constituents who have been affected by government spending cuts. And, on Brexit, she says regardless of how people voted, no one voted for their living standards to go down. Battersea voted overwhelmingly to remain, as she did, she says. And she says only Labour will sort Brexit out, by giving the British people a final say. Labour will end the privatisation of the NHS, she says. It will build more home, and tackle the climate crisis through Labour\u2019s green new deal. Marsha de Cordova, the Labour MP for Battersea, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn. The event is in Battersea Arts Centre. She won the seat from the Tories in 2017 with a majority of 2,416. She says Battersea has a radical history. London\u2019s first black mayor, John Archer, was elected in this very building, she says. The event is starting now. Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow cabinet are coming in. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg The Labour campaign launch is due to start at 11am. These are from the BBC\u2019s Peter Saull, who is there. Last night Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, announced that she would be standing down from parliament. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Radio Leicester this morning, she insisted that she was leaving not \u201cfor any reasons of disagreement with the prime minister or the direction of the government at all\u201d. She said the abuse she had received as an MP had contributed to the decision, adding: I think the role of being an MP has changed. I think the abuse, because of the platforms, because of how strongly people feel about the current political situation, that has changed enormously in the almost 10 years since I started. Here is an updated list of the MPs standing down from the Institute for Government\u2019s Gavin Freeguard. And here is some Twitter comment on Morgan\u2019s resignation. From the Economist\u2019s John Peet From the author and political commentator Robert Harris From Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis Even if women are standing down in the same proportion as men, it does look as if the average age of the women who are standing down is lower than the average age of the departing men. Many of the men going are at the end of their careers. I have not had time to do the maths, but that seems to be less true of the women. More than 300,000 people have applied to register to vote in 48 hours, according to government figures. As the Press Association reports, a total of 139,162 applications were submitted on Tuesday, followed by 177,105 on Wednesday. This is well above the typical number for weekday applications, which has been averaging around 37,000 for the past month. There is no sign of Boris Johnson this morning yet, but here, for the record, is the statement he released overnight ahead of the visits he is doing today to a school, a hospital and a police station. He said: Today should have been the day that Brexit was delivered and we finally left the EU. But, despite the great new deal I agreed with the EU, Jeremy Corbyn refused to allow that to happen \u2013 insisting upon more dither, more delay and more uncertainty for families and business. We cannot continue along this path. I didn\u2019t want an election \u2013 like the country I wanted to get Brexit done, but it is the only way forward. The public wants and expects the government to give them hope and to improve their opportunities. This is exactly what my government has been doing for the past 99 days and exactly what my government will continue to do if the public choose the Conservatives in this election. I want next year to be a great year for our country \u2013 with more investment in frontline NHS services, the recruitment of thousands more police officers to reduce violent crime and investment in every one of our primary and secondary schools across the country. The alternative is for the people of this country to spend the next year, which should be a glorious year, going through the toxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums \u2013 on EU membership and Scottish independence \u2013 thanks to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s incessant indecision. Now is the time to break the deadlock so we can move on as a country. The Conservatives will campaign for a parliament that gets Brexit done and delivers on the people\u2019s priorities, including the NHS, education and crime. And here are the two main points Johnson is making. As is almost routine with Johnson statements, neither of them is properly true. Johnson claims that Labour is to blame for parliament not being able to pass his Bexit deal. It is true that Labour voted against the programme motion, setting aside just three days for MPs to debate the bill. But the programme motion was defeated because the DUP (supposedly Johnson\u2019s allies) and former Tories who had had the whip removed voted against it, and Labour offered to strike a deal with the government on a programme motion giving MPs more time to debate the bill, which may well have passed. But Johnson did not try this, and instead shelved the bill and went for an election. Johnson claims there would be two referendums in 2020 under Labour. It is true that Labour wants to hold a second Brexit referendum next year, but the party says it would not allow a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020. Johnson is making this claim because Corbyn has not ruled out allowing a second Scottish independence referendum at some point, and its exact timing would be a matter of negotiation between London and Edinburgh. Yesterday the Liberal Democrats sent out a note inviting journalists to a slogan launch this morning. That could be a first. Having covered general elections since the 1990s, I\u2019ve seen poster launches, campaign launches and manifesto launches, but never something billed as an event to announce just a slogan. My colleague Peter Walker was there. And it turns out the slogan is: Stop Brexit, Build a Brighter Future. Peter is not over-impressed. While we are on the subject of the Commons standards committee, MPs will later debate a motion saying they should suspend the Labour MP Keith Vaz, as recommended by the committee, for offering to buy drugs for sex workers. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said Vaz should stand down instead of standing for election again. She said: I think he should consider his position. I think he himself should agree not to be a candidate. It has been a very sad issue, not just for him but for his family and his children. When it was put to her that the Labour party has not removed the whip from Vaz, a move that would prevent him from standing again as a Labour candidate, she replied: \u201cNot yet.\u201d The Conservative MP Sir Henry Bellingham has been ordered to apologise to the Commons for the late declaration of a financial interest, the Press Association reports. The Commons standards committee found he did not declare his non-executive chairmanship of Clifton Africa Ltd, an African mining and development company, within the 28 days required. In a report the committee said such cases were normally dealt with through a \u201crectification\u201d procedure, but, despite \u201cextensive\u201d correspondence with the parliamentary commissioner for standards, it said Bellingham had taken \u201cfar too long\u201d to correct the record. As a result, the committee said it was recommending that he should issue a written apology to the house. The Conservatives argue that Labour\u2019s claim to be offering change (see 9.02am) is bogus because the party is offering another referendum on Brexit. This is what James Cleverly, the Tory chairman, said in a statement last night, responding to the advance extracts from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech released in advance. Cleverly said: A vote for Labour is not a vote for change. It is precisely the opposite - a vote for more delay and uncertainty on Brexit, meaning the government can\u2019t focus on people\u2019s priorities, like the NHS, schools and crime. (But Cleverly also said in his statement that Labour\u2019s \u201cextreme economic ideas would wreck the economy\u201d - which I suppose would be change of a sort.) As Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason write in their overnight story, Jeremy Corbyn will use his speech this morning at the Labour campaign launch to assert that his party is on the side of the people. This is another standard piece of election rhetoric. You never hear candidates saying that they are on the side of vested interests or the elite (even though some of them are). Boris Johnson has been trying his own version of this positioning, with No 10 advisers saying that, because he is campaigning on a pledge to deliver Brexit, he is standing up for the people against parliament. Corbyn will say he is standing up for the people against the elite, or the \u201cprivileged few\u2019. And in his speech he will name examples of what he means by the elite. It is worth quoting the passage at lengthy so here it is. You know what really scares the elite? What they\u2019re actually afraid of is paying their taxes. So in this election they\u2019ll fight harder and dirtier than ever before. They\u2019ll throw everything at us because they know we\u2019re not afraid to take them on. So we\u2019re going after the tax dodgers. We\u2019re going after the dodgy landlords. We\u2019re going after the bad bosses. We\u2019re going after the big polluters. Because we know whose side we\u2019re on. So are you on the side of the tax dodgers, who are taking us all for a ride? People who think it\u2019s ok to rip people off, hide their money in tax havens so they can have a new super yacht. Or the children with special educational needs who aren\u2019t getting the support they deserve because of Tory and Lib Dem government cuts? Whose side are you on? The dodgy landlords, like the Duke of Westminster, Britain\u2019s youngest billionaire, who tried to evict whole blocks of families, to make way for luxury apartments? Or the millions of tenants in Britain who struggle to pay their rent each month? Whose side are you on? The bad bosses like Mike Ashley, the billionaire who won\u2019t pay his staff properly and is running Newcastle United into the ground? Or his exploited workforce, like the woman who was reportedly forced to give birth in a warehouse toilet because she was terrified of missing her shift? Whose side are you on? The big polluters like Jim Ratcliffe, Britain\u2019s richest man who makes his money by polluting the environment? Or the children growing up in our cities with reduced lung capacity because of choking pollution? \u201cWhose side are you on? The greedy bankers like Crispin Odey, who makes millions betting against our country and on other people\u2019s misery and donated huge sums to Johnson and the Conservative Party? Or are you on the side of working people, the people who create the wealth that\u2019s then squirreled away in tax havens? And whose side are you on? The billionaire media barons like Rupert Murdoch, whose empire pumps out propaganda to support a rigged system. Or the overwhelming majority who want to live in a decent, fair, diverse and prosperous society? You know whose side Labour\u2019s on. And we have something that the Rupert Murdochs, the Mike Ashleys, and the Boris Johnsons don\u2019t have. We have people. Hundreds of thousands of people in every part of our country, who will make this the biggest people-powered campaign in history. Essentially there are only three sorts of election campaign: \u2018it\u2019s time for a change\u2019; \u2018give us more time to finish the job\u2019; or (when all else fails) \u2018don\u2019t let the other lot ruin it\u2019. The easiest and most effective message is normally the first one (which is why sometimes incumbents even try and run on a \u2018change\u2019 platform) and today this is what Jeremy Corbyn will offer the electorate when he launches Labour\u2019s election campaign at an event with the shadow cabinet. According to extracts released in advance, Corbyn will say: We stand for the many. Boris Johnson\u2019s born-to-rule Conservatives protect the privileged few. They\u2019ve slashed taxes for the richest and vital services and support for everyone else. But real change is coming. We will end the Conservatives\u2019 great rip-off by putting rail, mail and water into public ownership so they work for everyone, not just Tory donors and shareholders in tax havens. We will invest in every nation and region, rebuild our public services and give our NHS, schools and police the money they need by taxing those at the top to properly fund services for everyone. This election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind. I will quote more from the speech soon. And here is our overnight election story, also covering what Corbyn will say. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Lib Dems launch their election slogan, which will be on a poster on a van that will later drive around Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Islington North constituency. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a business statement in the Commons. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow cabinet launch Labour\u2019s general election campaign at an event at Battersea Arts centre in south London. After 11am: MPs debate the standards committee recommendation for Labour\u2019s Keith Vaz to be suspended for six months. Boris Johnson is also doing election visits today, going to a hospital, a school and a police station in different parts of the country to highlight what he calls \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d. It is John Bercow\u2019s last day in office as Commons Speaker. And at some point today the culture department is expected to publish its report into how Johnson\u2019s close friend, the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, secured a \u00a3100,000 grant from the department. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on general election developments. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

I think a lot of women were led to believe that private health will cover everything.\u201d But she said people were increasingly dropping out of private health cover or never taking it up in the first place, particularly young women. \u201cA lot of women who give birth in the public system can\u2019t believe the continuity of midwifery care they get. They get this amazing gold standard of care they don\u2019t have to pay as much for as they would privately,\u201d Dahlen said. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019re doing their research and marching with their feet away from the private system. This research helps to show us why.\u201d",

Apicha, a New York health center that caters to LGBTQ patients, said last week the tech giant initially blocked ads it tried to run on Instagram that aimed to raise awareness of PrEP, an FDA-approved anti-HIV medication sold under the brand name Truvada.

We have ads running on Facebook that promote PrEP use for women, and we didn\u2019t have any issue with those,\u201d said Phillip Miner, Apicha\u2019s director of grants and communication. Over the last year, Facebook, which purchased Instagram in 2012, has adopted a verification process for political advertisers on its platforms and a broader definition of what is and isn\u2019t political. The changes come as Facebook works to prevent a repeat of the Russian influence campaign that used its platforms to interfere in the 2016 US elections. However, the new rules have led to seemingly apolitical ads being classified as political. Gilead, the maker of Truvada, said efforts to promote sexual health and reduce new sexual infections require \u201ccreative and innovative solutions\u201d. The company voiced disapproval of Facebook\u2019s actions. \u201cEfforts to heighten awareness of PrEP are undermined by limiting the reach of community-based education and outreach campaigns,\u201d Gilead wrote in a statement to the Guardian. Facebook counts any ad that advocates for or against a social issue as a political ad. The company\u2019s list of \u201csocial issues\u201d includes topics like education, crime, and health. After speaking with Facebook employees, Miner believes Apicha\u2019s ads were considered political because they touch on health. \u201cSo anytime someone posts an ad that is health related, it should trigger this process,\u201d he said. But the situation may be even more complicated. Facebook\u2019s rules state that political health ads include \u201cdiscussion, debate, and/or advocacy for or against topics including but not limited to healthcare reform and access to healthcare\u201d. According to the company\u2019s guide, an ad that says \u201cWe fight for everyone in our community to have access to the quality healthcare that all families deserve\u201d is political. Under these rules, Facebook may be deem statements like \u201cAll gay men deserve access to PrEP\u201d political. On Thursday, Miner informed the Guardian, after undergoing Facebook\u2019s verification process, Apicha\u2019s ads were now running on Instagram. A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe allow ads that promote health care services on Facebook. We require extra steps before ads can run if they also advocate for or against certain social issues, like equal access to health care. We saw bad actors abuse these kinds of topics in 2016 so, while we don\u2019t want to create unnecessary obstacles for people, we think it\u2019s important to increase transparency to better protect elections on Facebook.\u201d The tension between Apicha and Facebook highlights how the company\u2019s new approach towards political advertising inadvertently politicizes key aspects of LGBTQ people\u2019s day-to-day lives. Last year, the Washington Post examined how advertisements by LGBTQ groups \u2013 including announcements for LGBTQ youth proms, the Long Island Pride parade, and a baseball game \u2013 were being blocked. \u201cWe do not consider all ads that relate to LGBT under this policy, but rather only those that advocate for various policies or political positions, which several of these ads do,\u201d the company said at the time. The renewed examinations of how Facebook\u2019s policies can negatively affect marginalized groups comes as Democratic candidates call on Facebook to change its policies on political ads. On Wednesday afternoon, the Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, announced the company would ban all political advertising.",

But when you do have to fly, you may as well try and wring the most out of it personally too. It might not be enough to get you into the free-spread bonanza of a premium lounge, but you can score a fair few points in a single afternoon.

On Virgin\u2019s Velocity program, you\u2019ll lose your miles after 24 months, while Qantas miles expire after 18 months of no earning or spending. If you\u2019re already a member of a mileage program, check your balance and see if your account might be nearing expiration. If it is, arrange some kind of activity. That doesn\u2019t have to mean booking a flight. You could connect your account to a partner service or redeem some miles for vouchers or products, \u201cbut those are generally bad value\u201d, warns Genter.</p> <p>Next, take a look at your credit cards and see if any of them entitle you to travel status you\u2019re not using. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t realise he had lounge access until I told him,\u201d says Genter. Your employer might give perks you\u2019re not aware of too. \u201cIf you work for a large company, see if their travel department has any special offers. IHG has deals with a lot of accounting firms, where all employees instantly get top-tier offers.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2pm: Define your travel goals for the year<br></strong>Once you\u2019ve figured out what you already have, it\u2019s time to decide where you\u2019re going \u201cand see how far away you are from achieving at least part of it with points and miles.\u201d</p> <p>Look into the costs for the trips you have planned, and figure out if it makes sense to fly using points. While you\u2019re at it, figure out if there\u2019s a way you can get there without flying at all \u2013 the planet will thank you.</p> <p>For the travel you have to do, Genter says expensive short-haul flights are an ideal candidate for spending points, while popular routes with cheap fares such as Sydney to Melbourne are not likely to deliver good value. Upgrades are often better value than redeeming points for the full cost of an economy ticket, but it\u2019s not always the case, so do your research. When you want to cash in your points, it\u2019s better to plan ahead, since they can be complicated, or date-dependant, to redeem.</p> <p>Finally, it\u2019s better to spend points quickly. \u201cWe definitely preach miles are a bad long-term investment and they\u2019re going to go down ... It\u2019s a balancing act. You don\u2019t want to spend them frivolously ... If there\u2019s a flight to the United States that\u2019s only $1,000, and it would cost you $700 for a redemption, plus the points, then maybe not.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2.30pm: Sign up for additional schemes <br></strong>\u201cThere\u2019s a debate about whether you should be a \u2018free agent\u2019 or loyal,\u201d Genter says. \u201cIf you know you\u2019re going to travel enough to get elite status on one airline, and you\u2019re willing to take particular connections or pay a little bit more to be loyal, it could make sense.\u201d For the sake of your wallet, this approach should only be taken if you\u2019re travelling on your company\u2019s bill. Consumer advocacy group Choice suggest paying more to earn points is <a href=\"https://www.choice.com.au/travel/on-holidays/airlines/articles/frequent-flyer-points-are-they-worth-it\">almost never worth it</a>. And, for the sake of the planet, you should avoid unnecessarily long or complex routes for the sake of scoring milage.</p> <p>That means \u201cfor most people, free agency works best. You can fly with whoever works best for your situation.\u201d In Australia, Genter suggests you should be signed up for both Qantas and Virgin\u2019s frequent flyer programs. Virgin\u2019s program is free, while Qantas charges a joining fee of $99.50 \u2013 but you can sneak through the back door and get away with not paying it by going through one of their partners<a href=\"https://www.finder.com.au/free-qantas-frequent-flyer-membership\"> like Woolworths or Deliveroo</a>.</p> <p>If you travel internationally, signing up for a Star Alliance (one of the largest global airline alliances) program is a good idea too \u2013 Singapore Airlines Krisflyer is a good, free option, as it also has a partnership with Virgin\u2019s Velocity, so you\u2019ll have more flexibility when it comes to transferring and spending your points.</p> <p>This suggestion comes with a caveat. \u201cThere certainly is data sharing ... behind the scenes,\u201d says Genter. \u201cWith all the data breaches that have happened, especially in the US, I pretty much just assume everyone has everything about me. If you\u2019re worried you might want to limit your number of programs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/20/qantas-overhauls-frequent-flyer-program-making-economy-seats-cheaper\">Qantas overhauls frequent flyer program, making economy cheaper</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3.15pm: Figure out how to earn points for spending you\u2019re already doing<br></strong>Once again, if you\u2019re privacy conscious, this might not be the right choice for you, but if, like Genter, you \u201cthink if they make my life easy, they can know everything about me\u201d, then it\u2019ll help you reach your mile goals faster.</p> <p>\u201cThe traditional way of earning points was just from flying. Now you can earn them through shopping.\u201d Genter suggests Qantas\u2019s Points Prompter browser extension might be a good place to start. \u201cThat way, when you\u2019re online shopping, the merchant will pay Qantas a little bit for referring them, and you\u2019ll get the points.\u201d</p> <p>The major Australian carriers also have partnerships with hotels and big grocery chains, so you can connect your frequent flyer account to a Flybuys loyalty scheme (Coles and Virgin) or Woolworths Rewards (Woolworths and Qantas). Ride sharing apps Uber and Ola also have frequent flyer partnerships, with Qantas and Virgin respectively. You can get a full list of partners from your frequent flyer programs\u2019 websites. As a bonus, this kind of activity means your points are less likely to expire.</p> <p><strong>3.50pm: Cancel your credit card and sign up for a new one<br></strong>Provided you pay your credit card bill off monthly, using a points-earning card is one of the best ways to accumulate points. And the offers are sweeter for new customers.</p> <p>\u201cChanging credit card providers regularly is how I\u2019ve earned millions and millions of miles,\u201d says Genter. \u201cI\u2019ve signed up for around 60 credit cards. We have 37 that we have open now \u2013 the US is crazy. It\u2019s not nearly as lucrative down here, but there are definitely still great sign-up bonuses.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Genter notes that credit cards in Australia tend to have higher annual fees than their US counterparts, so if you are considering switching to a points-earning card on a great sign-up offer, do some mathematics to figure out if it\u2019s worth your while. He suggests valuing a frequent flyer mile at about 1.5 Australian cents, while consumer affairs group Choice put the value at <a href=\"https://www.choice.com.au/travel/on-holidays/airlines/articles/frequent-flyer-points-are-they-worth-it\">around one cent</a>. So if a card is offering a sign-up bonus of 70,000 points, you should think of it as having around $700 to $1,050 of value. If the card\u2019s annual fee is higher than that, it might not make sense. There are several comparison sites that give regular rundowns of sign-up bonus offers \u2013 do your research.</p> <p>If you do switch, be sure to read the fine print to see if you\u2019ll qualify for all the bonus points too. Many sign-up offers come with minimum monthly spends in order to qualify.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm: Think about your status<br></strong>Frequent flyer programs tend to be made up of two components. There are points \u2013 the things you earn and spend \u2013 and then there\u2019s status. Status is harder to earn, but it comes with the best perks. Genter says on a recent, short-haul flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, for instance \u201cbecause I flew with an airline I had status with, I got to go to American Airlines\u2019 best lounge, where they have buffets of sushi, make-your-own-omelettes and free booze. It\u2019s ridiculous to do what I did, which was to hang out in the lounge for four hours before a 30-minute flight, but those are the sort of perks that you can get.\u201d Genter has also received plenty of free upgrades due to his status, been bumped up to the penthouse suite in hotels, and was once even flown to the Bahamas. \u201cIt was a huge hassle to redeem, but it\u2019s a fun story,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Beyond clocking thousands of kilometres of airline travel, the only way to accumulate status is by signing up for expensive credit cards, and additional loyalty schemes. However, if you\u2019ve had to travel for work a lot, gained status, and now it looks like you\u2019ll lose it, one semi-professional tip Genter offers is transferring your loyalty to a program that will status-match. You might have to complete a long-haul \u201cchallenge\u201d in order to qualify for \u201c<a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/airline-status-matches-challenges/\">status matching</a>\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s a way to wring an extra year out of your high-life lounge access. Just make sure that challenge flight is an essential one.</p> <p><strong>5.30pm: Treat yourself to a glass of complimentary </strong><strong>bubbly \u2013 you\u2019ve earned all your points for the day.</strong></p>",

Next, take a look at your credit cards and see if any of them entitle you to travel status you\u2019re not using. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t realise he had lounge access until I told him,\u201d says Genter. Your employer might give perks you\u2019re not aware of too. \u201cIf you work for a large company, see if their travel department has any special offers. IHG has deals with a lot of accounting firms, where all employees instantly get top-tier offers.\u201d 2pm: Define your travel goals for the year Once you\u2019ve figured out what you already have, it\u2019s time to decide where you\u2019re going \u201cand see how far away you are from achieving at least part of it with points and miles.\u201d Look into the costs for the trips you have planned, and figure out if it makes sense to fly using points. While you\u2019re at it, figure out if there\u2019s a way you can get there without flying at all \u2013 the planet will thank you. For the travel you have to do, Genter says expensive short-haul flights are an ideal candidate for spending points, while popular routes with cheap fares such as Sydney to Melbourne are not likely to deliver good value. Upgrades are often better value than redeeming points for the full cost of an economy ticket, but it\u2019s not always the case, so do your research. When you want to cash in your points, it\u2019s better to plan ahead, since they can be complicated, or date-dependant, to redeem. Finally, it\u2019s better to spend points quickly. \u201cWe definitely preach miles are a bad long-term investment and they\u2019re going to go down ... It\u2019s a balancing act. You don\u2019t want to spend them frivolously ... If there\u2019s a flight to the United States that\u2019s only $1,000, and it would cost you $700 for a redemption, plus the points, then maybe not.\u201d 2.30pm: Sign up for additional schemes \u201cThere\u2019s a debate about whether you should be a \u2018free agent\u2019 or loyal,\u201d Genter says. \u201cIf you know you\u2019re going to travel enough to get elite status on one airline, and you\u2019re willing to take particular connections or pay a little bit more to be loyal, it could make sense.\u201d For the sake of your wallet, this approach should only be taken if you\u2019re travelling on your company\u2019s bill. Consumer advocacy group Choice suggest paying more to earn points is almost never worth it. And, for the sake of the planet, you should avoid unnecessarily long or complex routes for the sake of scoring milage. That means \u201cfor most people, free agency works best. You can fly with whoever works best for your situation.\u201d In Australia, Genter suggests you should be signed up for both Qantas and Virgin\u2019s frequent flyer programs. Virgin\u2019s program is free, while Qantas charges a joining fee of $99.50 \u2013 but you can sneak through the back door and get away with not paying it by going through one of their partners like Woolworths or Deliveroo. If you travel internationally, signing up for a Star Alliance (one of the largest global airline alliances) program is a good idea too \u2013 Singapore Airlines Krisflyer is a good, free option, as it also has a partnership with Virgin\u2019s Velocity, so you\u2019ll have more flexibility when it comes to transferring and spending your points. This suggestion comes with a caveat. \u201cThere certainly is data sharing ... behind the scenes,\u201d says Genter. \u201cWith all the data breaches that have happened, especially in the US, I pretty much just assume everyone has everything about me. If you\u2019re worried you might want to limit your number of programs.\u201d 3.15pm: Figure out how to earn points for spending you\u2019re already doing Once again, if you\u2019re privacy conscious, this might not be the right choice for you, but if, like Genter, you \u201cthink if they make my life easy, they can know everything about me\u201d, then it\u2019ll help you reach your mile goals faster. \u201cThe traditional way of earning points was just from flying. Now you can earn them through shopping.\u201d Genter suggests Qantas\u2019s Points Prompter browser extension might be a good place to start. \u201cThat way, when you\u2019re online shopping, the merchant will pay Qantas a little bit for referring them, and you\u2019ll get the points.\u201d The major Australian carriers also have partnerships with hotels and big grocery chains, so you can connect your frequent flyer account to a Flybuys loyalty scheme (Coles and Virgin) or Woolworths Rewards (Woolworths and Qantas). Ride sharing apps Uber and Ola also have frequent flyer partnerships, with Qantas and Virgin respectively. You can get a full list of partners from your frequent flyer programs\u2019 websites. As a bonus, this kind of activity means your points are less likely to expire. 3.50pm: Cancel your credit card and sign up for a new one Provided you pay your credit card bill off monthly, using a points-earning card is one of the best ways to accumulate points. And the offers are sweeter for new customers. \u201cChanging credit card providers regularly is how I\u2019ve earned millions and millions of miles,\u201d says Genter. \u201cI\u2019ve signed up for around 60 credit cards. We have 37 that we have open now \u2013 the US is crazy. It\u2019s not nearly as lucrative down here, but there are definitely still great sign-up bonuses.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Genter notes that credit cards in Australia tend to have higher annual fees than their US counterparts, so if you are considering switching to a points-earning card on a great sign-up offer, do some mathematics to figure out if it\u2019s worth your while. He suggests valuing a frequent flyer mile at about 1.5 Australian cents, while consumer affairs group Choice put the value at around one cent. So if a card is offering a sign-up bonus of 70,000 points, you should think of it as having around $700 to $1,050 of value. If the card\u2019s annual fee is higher than that, it might not make sense. There are several comparison sites that give regular rundowns of sign-up bonus offers \u2013 do your research. If you do switch, be sure to read the fine print to see if you\u2019ll qualify for all the bonus points too. Many sign-up offers come with minimum monthly spends in order to qualify. 4.30pm: Think about your status Frequent flyer programs tend to be made up of two components. There are points \u2013 the things you earn and spend \u2013 and then there\u2019s status. Status is harder to earn, but it comes with the best perks. Genter says on a recent, short-haul flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, for instance \u201cbecause I flew with an airline I had status with, I got to go to American Airlines\u2019 best lounge, where they have buffets of sushi, make-your-own-omelettes and free booze. It\u2019s ridiculous to do what I did, which was to hang out in the lounge for four hours before a 30-minute flight, but those are the sort of perks that you can get.\u201d Genter has also received plenty of free upgrades due to his status, been bumped up to the penthouse suite in hotels, and was once even flown to the Bahamas. \u201cIt was a huge hassle to redeem, but it\u2019s a fun story,\u201d he says. Beyond clocking thousands of kilometres of airline travel, the only way to accumulate status is by signing up for expensive credit cards, and additional loyalty schemes. However, if you\u2019ve had to travel for work a lot, gained status, and now it looks like you\u2019ll lose it, one semi-professional tip Genter offers is transferring your loyalty to a program that will status-match. You might have to complete a long-haul \u201cchallenge\u201d in order to qualify for \u201cstatus matching\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s a way to wring an extra year out of your high-life lounge access. Just make sure that challenge flight is an essential one. 5.30pm: Treat yourself to a glass of complimentary bubbly \u2013 you\u2019ve earned all your points for the day.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson was booed by an angry medical student as he left a Cambridge hospital while on a visit, where he set himself a new Brexit deadline of leaving the EU by January \u201cat the absolute latest\u201d. The prime minister appeared to get a frosty reception at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital, where staff were not given advance warning of his visit and national media were not invited to attend. He was confronted by Julia Simons, a 23-year-old medical student, who later criticised him for using the hospital for a \u201cPR stunt\u201d. \u201cStaff were not informed even when he was in the hospital. He was too cowardly to face the uncensored opinions of staff because we know the reality the effects of his government\u2019s and party\u2019s policies on patients,\u201d she said afterwards. Johnson also went to a primary school in Bury St Edmunds and a police training college in Hendon as he attempted to shift the focus to his domestic agenda. In a broadcast interview, though, he was forced to address criticism for failing to meet his deadline of taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October. \u201cThere are just too many people who are basically opposed to Brexit, who want to frustrate it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the mandate of the people. They voted by a pretty substantial majority to do this and parliament has simply stood in their way.\u201d He also recorded a shaky handheld video of himself travelling in a car, released on social media, accusing Labour of blocking Brexit and while \u201cthey couldn\u2019t block parliament actually voting for the deal, they did vote for a delay\u201d. The claim that parliament voted for his Brexit deal was highlighted by Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, as one of 12 key lies that Johnson was already propagating in the election campaign. On Thursday night, the senior Labour MP wrote to broadcasters asking them not to repeat Johnson\u2019s untruths during the election campaign, branding him a peddler of \u201cfake news, lies and distortions\u201d. He said as part of the \u201cserious matter of honesty in public life and trust in politics\u201d, broadcasters need to take into account Johnson\u2019s long history of lying and misleading people. Sent to the director general of the BBC and chief executives of the other major broadcasters, the letter said Johnson\u2019s \u201cwilful disregard for basic standards of decency are a threat to democracy\u201d. Among the untruths, top of the list was the false claim that Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has \u201cpassed\u201d parliament when MPs simply voted at second reading to allow it to proceed for further scrutiny. Other claims include the idea that there will be \u201cno checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain\u201d, when the government has admitted that businesses will have to fill in forms. He said another lie was the claim that an extension to article 50 would cost a \u00a31bn a month, when money has to be paid to the EU anyway during the transition period and the costs of no-deal Brexit would be higher. Watson also challenged Johnson\u2019s claims to be embarking on the biggest hospital-building programme in a generation, when only six new hospitals are earmarked for reconfiguration and 34 will not get funding until after 2025. A senior Conservative source said in response: \u201cTom Watson\u2019s accusations led to a bungled probe into the claims of the fantasist Carl Beech, and went far beyond the reach of an MP. He should do the decent thing and put his days of letter-writing and smears behind him.\u201d Johnson will resume visits on Friday but is not expected to formally launch his campaign this week, while government business is still going on and parliament still sitting. While ministers rush through legislation before parliament is dissolved, Labour criticised the government for failing to bring urgent plans to tackle the climate and environment emergency in time to meet the six-month deadline set by MPs earlier this year. The climate and emergency motion, passed by parliament on the 1 May 2019, \u201ccalls on the Government to lay before the House within the next six months urgent proposals to restore the UK\u2019s natural environment and to deliver a circular, zero-waste economy\u201d.",

Rather, it is a sad and shocking system that diminishes Australia as a nation,\u201d a statement from the commissioners says. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/14/chairman-of-aged-care-royal-commission-richard-tracey-dies-aged-71\">Tracey died earlier this month.</a></p> <p>The report says that urgent action is needed in three areas and calls for: more home care packages to reduce the waiting list of 120,000, a response to the significant over-reliance on chemical restraints in the sector and removal of young people with disabilities from aged care.</p> <p>On Thursday the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, fronted the media with no additional commitments to improve the system, but on Friday Morrison told 3AW Radio the government will address those three urgent priorities by year\u2019s end.</p> <p>Morrison said he had waited for the report to inform \u201cfinal decisions we were going to make around in-home aged care funding before we finalise the mid-year [economic] update\u201d.</p> <p>Morrison said he had already consulted Colbeck, the treasurer and finance minister and committed that money will be available by Christmas.</p> <p>The prime minister said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d about the need to keep people out of aged care and cited the work of Youngcare, which builds homes for young people with serious disability, suggesting \u201cwe need more of that\u201d.</p> <p>On the need for home care packages, the commission report says the system is \u201cunfair\u201d, with funding needed to allow people to live safely at home.</p> <p>\u201cBy any measure, this is a cruel and discriminatory system, which places great strain on older Australians and their relatives,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>\u201cIt is shocking that the express wishes of older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, with the supports they need, is downplayed with an expectation that they will manage. It is unsafe practice. It is neglect.\u201d</p> <p>The report also highlights concerns about the country\u2019s \u201cageist\u201d mindset, saying this culture had led to an indifference to how older people were treated, with the conversation about aged care too often about burden, encumbrance and obligation.</p> <p>\u201cAs a nation, Australia has drifted into an ageist mindset that undervalues older people and limits their possibilities,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, this failure to properly value and engage with older people as equal partners in our future has extended to our apparent indifference towards aged care services.</p> <p>\u201cLeft out of sight and out of mind, these important services are floundering.\u201d</p> <p>Slamming the system as fragmented, unsupported and underfunded, and usually poorly managed, the report says that many residential aged care homes are also unsafe and \u201cseemingly uncaring\u201d.</p> <p>Describing evidence that the commission has heard since February as \u201cdifficult to tell and difficult to hear\u201d, the commission\u2019s report says it has heard stories of \u201cunkindness and neglect\u201d but the extent of substandard care is difficult to quantify.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the combined impact of the evidence, submissions and stories provided to the Royal Commission leads us to conclude that substandard care is much more widespread and more serious than we had anticipated,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>More than half of the online submissions to the commission raised issues about substandard care, mostly relating to neglect, dignity, personal care, clinical care and medication management. Concerns were also raised about nutrition, malnourishment, emotional abuse, physical abuse or assault, discrimination and restrictive practices.</p> <p>A little over 1000 providers responded to the commission\u2019s survey on substandard care, self-reporting 274,409 instances of substandard care over the five year period to June 2018, including almost 112,000 occasions of substandard clinical care.</p> <p>Pointing to \u201cshocking evidence\u201d of unacceptable practices in the sector, the commission says the major issues brought to the inquiry\u2019s attention include inadequate wound management, poor continence management, \u201cdreadful\u201d food, high incidence of assault, the use of physical restraints and sedatives, and patchy and fragmented palliative care.</p> <p>\u201cIt is shameful that such a list can be produced in 21st century Australia,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>The commission also raises concerns about the poor regulation of the sector and the lack of transparency on behalf of industry.</p> <p>Providers come under fire for not responding adequately to complaints, with evidence suggesting the complaints process was \u201chard to access, slow to act and often effectively unresponsive\u201d.</p> <p>Some providers have proven to be defensive and \u201coccasionally belligerent in their ignorance\u201d of what is happening in their aged care homes.</p> <p>Compounding the problem of poor care is a system lacking \u201cfundamental transparency\u201d, the report says, with very little information about complaints or performance made available to the public.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of complaints against them are not published. The number of assaults in their services are not published. The number of staff they employ to provide care are not published.\u201d</p> <p>The report says the regulatory system in place to ensure safety and quality in the sector is also inadequate, with little to encourage practice beyond a minimum standard.</p> <p>\u201cWe have heard evidence which suggests that the regulatory regime that is intended to ensure safety and quality of services is unfit for purpose and does not adequately deter poor practices. Indeed, it often fails to detect them.\u201d</p> <p>Staffing problems are also severe, with difficulties finding people who want to work in a sector marked by heavy workloads, and poor pay and conditions. The report also notes a lack of leadership, patchy education and training and a system that signals working in aged care \u201cis not a valued occupation\u201d. Cases where staff and providers are providing \u201cexemplary care\u201d are happening \u201cdespite the aged care system in which they operate, rather than because of it\u201d.</p> <p>According to the commission, the way the system has been framed as a \u201cmarket\u201d where old people are treated as customers who can shop around for a service is a fundamental failing.</p> <p>It says that many older people are not in a position to negotiate prices, services or care standards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/19/scratching-the-surface-the-aged-care-stories-that-go-untold-may-be-the-worst\">'Scratching the surface': the aged care stories that go untold may be the worst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe notion that most care is \u2018consumer-directed\u2019 is just not true.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has promised extra aged care funding to flow before Christmas after the system was branded \u201ccruel and harmful\u201d by the aged care royal commission\u2019s interim report, with services that are fragmented, unsupported, underfunded and often unsafe. In a report titled Neglect released on Thursday, the commission has called for an urgent overhaul of the sector, saying it is neglecting the needs of Australia\u2019s older, vulnerable citizens and is \u201cunkind and uncaring\u201d. Outlining a litany of problems in the sector fuelled by a culture of ageism, commissioners Richard Tracey and Lynelle Briggs have described the aged care system in Australia as \u201ca shocking tale of neglect\u201d. \u201cThe neglect that we have found in this Royal Commission, to date, is far from the best that can be done. Rather, it is a sad and shocking system that diminishes Australia as a nation,\u201d a statement from the commissioners says. Tracey died earlier this month. The report says that urgent action is needed in three areas and calls for: more home care packages to reduce the waiting list of 120,000, a response to the significant over-reliance on chemical restraints in the sector and removal of young people with disabilities from aged care. On Thursday the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, fronted the media with no additional commitments to improve the system, but on Friday Morrison told 3AW Radio the government will address those three urgent priorities by year\u2019s end. Morrison said he had waited for the report to inform \u201cfinal decisions we were going to make around in-home aged care funding before we finalise the mid-year [economic] update\u201d. Morrison said he had already consulted Colbeck, the treasurer and finance minister and committed that money will be available by Christmas. The prime minister said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d about the need to keep people out of aged care and cited the work of Youngcare, which builds homes for young people with serious disability, suggesting \u201cwe need more of that\u201d. On the need for home care packages, the commission report says the system is \u201cunfair\u201d, with funding needed to allow people to live safely at home. \u201cBy any measure, this is a cruel and discriminatory system, which places great strain on older Australians and their relatives,\u201d the report says. \u201cIt is shocking that the express wishes of older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, with the supports they need, is downplayed with an expectation that they will manage. It is unsafe practice. It is neglect.\u201d The report also highlights concerns about the country\u2019s \u201cageist\u201d mindset, saying this culture had led to an indifference to how older people were treated, with the conversation about aged care too often about burden, encumbrance and obligation. \u201cAs a nation, Australia has drifted into an ageist mindset that undervalues older people and limits their possibilities,\u201d the report says. \u201cSadly, this failure to properly value and engage with older people as equal partners in our future has extended to our apparent indifference towards aged care services. \u201cLeft out of sight and out of mind, these important services are floundering.\u201d Slamming the system as fragmented, unsupported and underfunded, and usually poorly managed, the report says that many residential aged care homes are also unsafe and \u201cseemingly uncaring\u201d. Describing evidence that the commission has heard since February as \u201cdifficult to tell and difficult to hear\u201d, the commission\u2019s report says it has heard stories of \u201cunkindness and neglect\u201d but the extent of substandard care is difficult to quantify. \u201cHowever, the combined impact of the evidence, submissions and stories provided to the Royal Commission leads us to conclude that substandard care is much more widespread and more serious than we had anticipated,\u201d the report says. More than half of the online submissions to the commission raised issues about substandard care, mostly relating to neglect, dignity, personal care, clinical care and medication management. Concerns were also raised about nutrition, malnourishment, emotional abuse, physical abuse or assault, discrimination and restrictive practices. A little over 1000 providers responded to the commission\u2019s survey on substandard care, self-reporting 274,409 instances of substandard care over the five year period to June 2018, including almost 112,000 occasions of substandard clinical care. Pointing to \u201cshocking evidence\u201d of unacceptable practices in the sector, the commission says the major issues brought to the inquiry\u2019s attention include inadequate wound management, poor continence management, \u201cdreadful\u201d food, high incidence of assault, the use of physical restraints and sedatives, and patchy and fragmented palliative care. \u201cIt is shameful that such a list can be produced in 21st century Australia,\u201d the report says. The commission also raises concerns about the poor regulation of the sector and the lack of transparency on behalf of industry. Providers come under fire for not responding adequately to complaints, with evidence suggesting the complaints process was \u201chard to access, slow to act and often effectively unresponsive\u201d. Some providers have proven to be defensive and \u201coccasionally belligerent in their ignorance\u201d of what is happening in their aged care homes. Compounding the problem of poor care is a system lacking \u201cfundamental transparency\u201d, the report says, with very little information about complaints or performance made available to the public. \u201cThe number of complaints against them are not published. The number of assaults in their services are not published. The number of staff they employ to provide care are not published.\u201d The report says the regulatory system in place to ensure safety and quality in the sector is also inadequate, with little to encourage practice beyond a minimum standard. \u201cWe have heard evidence which suggests that the regulatory regime that is intended to ensure safety and quality of services is unfit for purpose and does not adequately deter poor practices. Indeed, it often fails to detect them.\u201d Staffing problems are also severe, with difficulties finding people who want to work in a sector marked by heavy workloads, and poor pay and conditions. The report also notes a lack of leadership, patchy education and training and a system that signals working in aged care \u201cis not a valued occupation\u201d. Cases where staff and providers are providing \u201cexemplary care\u201d are happening \u201cdespite the aged care system in which they operate, rather than because of it\u201d. According to the commission, the way the system has been framed as a \u201cmarket\u201d where old people are treated as customers who can shop around for a service is a fundamental failing. It says that many older people are not in a position to negotiate prices, services or care standards. \u201cThe notion that most care is \u2018consumer-directed\u2019 is just not true. Despite appearances, despite rhetoric, there is little choice with aged care. It is a myth that aged care is an effective consumer-driven market.\u201d Despite the call for urgent action and funding, aged care minister Richard Colbeck would not guarantee any additional funding saying only that the findings had given him the \u201cimprimatur\u201d as minister to push the case internally. \u201cThe commission makes \u2026 some comment about what\u2019s required in that space. I will use the imprimatur of the royal commission to carry all of those things forward with my colleagues,\u201d he said. Aged care spending totalled $18.1 billion in 2017\u201318, with spending estimated to grow by $5 billion to $23.6 billion over the next five years. While the government had been bracing for \u201cdifficult\u201d evidence, he said he had been shocked at the commissioners\u2019 findings. Labor\u2019s shadow ageing minister Julie Collins said the report was a \u201cheartbreaking and shocking\u201d reminder of the unacceptable state of Australia\u2019s aged care system. \u201cIt is shameful that in a wealthy country like Australia older people can\u2019t get the care they need,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Morrison Liberal government must immediately act on the royal commission\u2019s urgent advice. Older Australians and their loved ones cannot wait one more day for action.\u201d",

It takes its cue from online snark Sanders received after appearing on the TV show Taskmaster, trolling her for \u2013 among other things \u2013 talking too much about her labia. This prompts \u2013 well, more labia material, of course, but also reflections on women\u2019s rights to their own bodies, and the tensions between being feminist and being desirable. There are occasional insights and illuminating anecdotes \u2013 particularly the one about the school \u201cwhose mum is hottest?\u201d contest. But Sanders\u2019 argument doesn\u2019t develop, occasionally states the obvious (\u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s anti-feminist to want to love someone\u201d) \u2013 and can feel at odds with her standard-issue saucy material. Some of which is amusing \u2013 if not always as much (\u201cstrap in!\u201d) as Sanders seems to think. A midway detour into family reminiscence, taking in a song she used to sing on car journeys, feels extraneous. The strongest material concerns her year-long \u201cman ban\u201d, as recommended by long-distance healer \u201cJill in the Pyrenees\u201d; Sanders brings their eccentric therapist/patient relationship to vivid life. Her way of dressing up self-mockery as dorky self-love, meanwhile, is as winning as ever. It\u2019s a genial show, but not a big-hitting one. \u2022 At Soho theatre, London, until 9 November.",

Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely.

      "bodyText": "In a deposition before the congressional impeachment committees Thursday, a national security council (NSC) official corroborated prior testimony describing efforts by the Trump administration to strike a suspicious deal with Ukrainians. But the official, Tim Morrison, seemed to lay groundwork in his testimony for an exculpation of Donald Trump and suggested that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, was unilaterally conducting a rogue foreign policy in Ukraine. Deposed on Thursday in a closed-door session, Morrison, who is leaving his post as a top White House adviser on Russia and Europe, said that the ambassador Bill Taylor had accurately described an early September conversation between Sondland and Andriy Yermak, an assistant to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cAmbassador Sondland told Mr Yermak that security assistance money would not come until President Zelenskiy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,\u201d Taylor testified, referring to $391m in US military aid for Ukraine suspended on Trump\u2019s orders in mid-July, and to the Ukrainian gas company that once employed Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice-president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The \u201csubstance\u201d of Taylor\u2019s statement was \u201caccurate\u201d, Morrison testified \u2013 with a quibble. \u201cMy recollection is that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s proposal to Mr Yermak was that it could be sufficient if the new Ukrainian prosecutor general \u2013 not President Zelenskiy \u2013 would commit to pursue the Burisma investigation,\u201d Morrison said, according to a copy of his opening statement first published by CBS News. That basic demand by Sondland \u2013 that Ukraine announce investigations or face the loss of US military aid \u2013 is at the core of allegations that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 US election. The House of Representatives voted Thursday, almost precisely along party lines, to advance an impeachment inquiry based on those allegations. But in his testimony Thursday, Morrison, a former senior congressional aide, seemed to seek to exculpate Trump by suggesting the quid pro quo was all Sondland\u2019s idea. \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security,\u201d Morrison said. A lawyer for Sondland did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Sondland have said that he never mentioned the Bidens to the Ukrainians and suggested he was unaware of the Burisma-Biden tie. Sondland is a hotelier with no diplomatic \u2013 or Washington bureaucratic \u2013 experience who was appointed ambassador after he gave $1m to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Last week Sondland and his lawyer visited Capitol Hill to \u201creview\u201d a deposition Sondland gave on 17 October in which he said he took Trump at his word that there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine. In addition to raising concerns about Sondland, Morrison defended Trump. He repeated explanations Trump has previously given for the suspension of the military aid, saying that Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine and concerned that Europe was not doing enough. Morrison also echoed the Trump argument that there could not have been a quid pro quo involving military aid with Ukraine because the Ukrainians were not aware the aid had been suspended at the time of a 25 July phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for a political \u201cfavor\u201d. While it is unclear exactly when the Ukrainians realized the aid had been suspended, they knew by early August, according to a New York Times report. The issue surfaces in text messages among diplomats in late August. Sondland\u2019s dangling of that aid to extract the Biden investigation continued, meanwhile, into early September, when he joined the vice-president, Mike Pence, for bilateral meetings with Ukrainians in Warsaw, Poland. \u201cI have no reason to believe the Ukrainians had any knowledge of the review [of US military aid for Ukraine] until 28 August 2019,\u201d the date Politico first reported on it, Morrison said. Morrison additionally substantiated the accuracy of public summaries of the 25 July call, which he listened to at the time. Afterward, Morrison reported on the call to the top lawyer on the NSC, he testified. Morrison said he approached the lawyer, who promptly moved the record of the call into a highly restricted archive, because Morrison was worried that the call would leak, resulting in partisan angst, confusion in Congress, and mistaken \u201cUkrainian perceptions of the US-Ukraine relationship\u201d. \u201cI want to be clear,\u201d Morrison testified, \u201cI was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.\u201d",

Less than 20 miles away in Riverside county, evacuations were issued after a fire in the city of Jurupa Valley started shortly after midnight, spreading to 300 acres. That fires come after a fast-moving blaze on Wednesday swept worryingly close to the Roland Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, north of LA. The fire at one point threatened 6,500 homes before firefighters were able to control it. Crews remained at the scene through the night to make sure embers would not rekindle more fires after an army of firefighters helped protect the hilltop Reagan museum, which sat like an island in a soot-black sea.

The National Weather Service warned that southern California is still at an extreme risk of fires starting and spreading on Thursday and into the evening. But some respite may be coming for those in the north, as firefighters gained ground against the largest fire burning in the state \u2013 the Kincade fire in Sonoma county. The fire, now burning for more than a week, is 60% contained and has not increased in size since yesterday, officials said. The fire has destroyed 189 houses and 76,000 acres.

We are not expecting any Santa Anas next week,\u201d the weather service meteorologist Kristen Stewart said. But she noted the forecast only extends out seven days. \u201cOnce we get past that, all bets are off,\u201d she said. Power outages continue More than 350,000 Californians statewide remain without power, after utility companies deliberately cut electricity this week to prevent high winds from damaging power lines and sparking more fires. Northern California has seen a series of unprecedented power shutoffs this month. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E), the state\u2019s largest utility, says 42,000 customers, or more than 100,000 people, remain without power in 10 counties. PG&amp;E, which has staged three sweeping blackouts this week, restored power to hundreds of thousands of people Wednesday and expected to have it back for the others sometime Thursday. Southern California Edison, another utility company, has said its safety power cuts still affected about 215,000 people by late Wednesday night and warned that outages were under consideration for about 800,000 people. The waves of outages have been condemned by state officials and frustrated consumers, especially as it appeared that power equipment may have been responsible for sparking some of the fires this week, despite the shutoffs. The PG&amp;E CEO, Bill Johnson, acknowledged hardships but said outages will be necessary in the future as seasonal fire threats increase. \u201cAs long as they remain the best tool that we have to keep people safe, and our communities safe, they\u2019re the tool we will use,\u201d he said.",

The lawsuit, filed by Medina Bardhi with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in New York, claims WeWork\u2019s management \u201ctransparently and systematically marginalized and discriminated against her by drastically and materially reducing her role and/or demoting her outright\u201d when she returned after her maternity leaves. Each time she disclosed her pregnancy to Neumann, Bardhi claims, WeWork began to search for a permanent replacement while Neumann repeatedly characterized her leave as \u201cretirement\u201d and \u201cvacation\u201d. Bardhi, who worked for the company for five years, alleges that during one pregnancy she was replaced by a male employee who received a salary nearly three times greater than hers and she was ultimately replaced by less-experienced and under-qualified male employee. In a statement WeWork disputed Bardhi\u2019s claim, saying it plans to \u201cvigorously defend itself\u201d. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to moving the company forward and building a company and culture that our employees can be proud of.\u201d The suit comes less than two weeks since Neumann controversially left the company he cofounded with a $1.7bn exit package after plans to take the office-share company public collapsed last month, taking with it investor confidence in unprofitable \u201cunicorn\u201d companies. WeWork, which saw its expected public valuation drop from $47bn to $8bn as complaints over Neumann\u2019s management and autocratic style mounted, has since been taken over with a $9.5bn rescue package by the Japanese tech investment firm Softbank, its largest investor. On Wednesday, the leading activist investor Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager, told a conference in New York that the company could turn out to be worthless. \u201cAs someone who has put good money after bad, I think this looks like putting good money after bad, and SoftBank should have walked away,\u201d Ackman said. Anger over Neumann\u2019s exit package has increased as expectation mount that as many as 4,000 of WeWork\u2019s 12,000 staff members could lose their jobs as soon as tomorrow as the company looks to cut costs. But the lawsuit can only add to the impression, that WeWork, along with other so-called tech \u201cunicorns\u201d, including the rideshare firm Uber, were not only financially mismanaged as private companies but tolerated sexist, discriminatory workplace environments. Bardhi\u2019s attorneys said in a statement that the suit against WeWork, which could become a class action complaint if other employees join the action, \u201cwill send a loud and clear message to WeWork and other startups that pregnant women cannot be forced out of their jobs, that women must be paid fairly and afforded equal opportunities, and that you cannot retaliate against any person who voices a complaint of discrimination.\u201d The attorney Doug Wigdor added: \u201cIt is astonishing that WeWork could reward Adam Neumann\u2019s blatant sexist behavior with a staggering and unprecedented golden parachute worth over a reported $1bn, while the company has subjected Ms Bardhi and other women to repeated and systematic marginalization.\u201d",

Though he has technical limitations, he is clearly a player who cares, who tries and who has a strong character and the respect of his peers.

He\u2019s coming off the pitch, he wants to stay on the pitch, and he hears boos from his own fans. He is entitled as a human being to be absolutely devastated, but somehow the fans want him to clap and smile and say thank you. Footballers are humans before they are players. They work hard on controlling their emotions, but still they exist and sometimes, like all of us, they come out. Having watched that moment on television I think there are plenty of people who should be feeling remorse and issuing apologies \u2013 but Xhaka is not one of them.</p> \n<p>I remember the 2010 World Cup, when after a draw against Algeria the England fans booed the team and Wayne Rooney criticised them on television. It was a terrible performance, and the players knew it, but the abuse achieved nothing. A few months later, and with the relationship between the team and the fans still poor, Fabio Capello, the England manager, said the team were \u201cplaying with fear inside, fear of playing at Wembley\u201d. That is the atmosphere that Arsenal fans are creating for Xhaka, an atmosphere in which instead of instilling extra confidence the prospect of playing at home will create fear and tension. That, in turn, will lead to poor performances, which will create a worse atmosphere, which will create more fear and tension. It is a vicious circle which will only lead to disappointment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/oct/29/david-squires-on-wheres-mesut-ozil-arsenal\">David Squires on \u2026 where's Mesut?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The message H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, who captained Arsenal at Liverpool on Wednesday, posted on Twitter was perfect. \u201cWe are all humans, we all have emotions, and sometimes it\u2019s not easy dealing with them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time to lift each other up, not to push each other away.\u201d My concern is that some Arsenal supporters have become famous for their negativity about their team and may not take that message on.</p> \n<p>Over the past few years Wenger, Mesut \u00d6zil and now Xhaka have endured extended periods when Arsenal\u2019s fans have turned against them. These are not minor characters at the club \u2013 it\u2019s a great manager, a big signing, a club captain. All have certainly fallen below expected standards, and the fans have a right to express disappointment, but it has created the impression of a group of supporters who can be fickle. That isn\u2019t helped by Arsenal Fan TV, the popularity of which is based on raw and direct views about the team that are most interesting when negative.</p> \n<p>My opinion is that fans should not be booing their captain. Not under any circumstances. It\u2019s that simple. Fans will have their opinions, but there are right and wrong ways to express them and they should learn from this. Nobody will ever do their job better while thousands of people are telling them they\u2019re useless at it. Last Sunday his teammate Lucas Torreira was moved to tears; Xhaka has been offered counselling by the club. These are real people, and what the fans say and do has an impact on them.</p> \n<p>In women\u2019s football obviously there are fewer fans, and often players will have conversations with them after the game. I\u2019ve always found that the women have a more personal relationship with their team\u2019s fans, and that\u2019s something that could come into the men\u2019s game. There is so much media attention, so many TV shows that involve fans talking to journalists, or journalists talking to other journalists. When we hear from current managers and players it is usually in formal situations \u2013 press conferences or set-piece interviews. There\u2019s a gap in men\u2019s football that needs to be filled. Players could go on these fans\u2019 shows, and just talk. If supporters have a perception of Xhaka that\u2019s different from the reality their teammates see and know, there should be an opportunity for the likes of Beller\u00edn to change it by explaining, in an unforced setting, why he has so much respect in the dressing room. Fifty thousand people booing, provoking someone else to swear and take off their shirt, is not exactly a grown-up conversation. Fans can do better.</p>",

I remember the 2010 World Cup, when after a draw against Algeria the England fans booed the team and Wayne Rooney criticised them on television. It was a terrible performance, and the players knew it, but the abuse achieved nothing. A few months later, and with the relationship between the team and the fans still poor, Fabio Capello, the England manager, said the team were \u201cplaying with fear inside, fear of playing at Wembley\u201d. That is the atmosphere that Arsenal fans are creating for Xhaka, an atmosphere in which instead of instilling extra confidence the prospect of playing at home will create fear and tension. That, in turn, will lead to poor performances, which will create a worse atmosphere, which will create more fear and tension. It is a vicious circle which will only lead to disappointment. The message H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, who captained Arsenal at Liverpool on Wednesday, posted on Twitter was perfect. \u201cWe are all humans, we all have emotions, and sometimes it\u2019s not easy dealing with them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time to lift each other up, not to push each other away.\u201d My concern is that some Arsenal supporters have become famous for their negativity about their team and may not take that message on. Over the past few years Wenger, Mesut \u00d6zil and now Xhaka have endured extended periods when Arsenal\u2019s fans have turned against them. These are not minor characters at the club \u2013 it\u2019s a great manager, a big signing, a club captain. All have certainly fallen below expected standards, and the fans have a right to express disappointment, but it has created the impression of a group of supporters who can be fickle. That isn\u2019t helped by Arsenal Fan TV, the popularity of which is based on raw and direct views about the team that are most interesting when negative. My opinion is that fans should not be booing their captain. Not under any circumstances. It\u2019s that simple. Fans will have their opinions, but there are right and wrong ways to express them and they should learn from this. Nobody will ever do their job better while thousands of people are telling them they\u2019re useless at it. Last Sunday his teammate Lucas Torreira was moved to tears; Xhaka has been offered counselling by the club. These are real people, and what the fans say and do has an impact on them. In women\u2019s football obviously there are fewer fans, and often players will have conversations with them after the game. I\u2019ve always found that the women have a more personal relationship with their team\u2019s fans, and that\u2019s something that could come into the men\u2019s game. There is so much media attention, so many TV shows that involve fans talking to journalists, or journalists talking to other journalists. When we hear from current managers and players it is usually in formal situations \u2013 press conferences or set-piece interviews. There\u2019s a gap in men\u2019s football that needs to be filled. Players could go on these fans\u2019 shows, and just talk. If supporters have a perception of Xhaka that\u2019s different from the reality their teammates see and know, there should be an opportunity for the likes of Beller\u00edn to change it by explaining, in an unforced setting, why he has so much respect in the dressing room. Fifty thousand people booing, provoking someone else to swear and take off their shirt, is not exactly a grown-up conversation. Fans can do better.",

      "body": "<p>In the many risk assessments of the possible consequences of Brexit happening on Halloween \u2013 lorry queues, drug shortages, street violence \u2013 scant attention was paid to a significant victim of its not happening: broadcasting specials timed to coincide with departure from the EU being forced to go out, even though the UK actually hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/27/little-britain-little-brexit-bbc-radio-4-special\">special Brexit edition</a> of Little Britain<em>,</em> bringing David Walliams and Matt Lucas\u2019s sketch show back to Radio 4, where it started in 2000, was at a double disadvantage. Having been denied its calendar reason for being, it also now found itself broadcast in the run-up to a general election, when the BBC\u2019s already contorted attempts at political impartiality become even stricter.</p> <p>So perhaps there were tougher sketches or punchlines that might have been included either if Brexit had happened or the election hadn\u2019t. But, in the version transmitted, there was often a sense of EU references being shoehorned into scenes that could have been written when the show was on Radio 4 and then BBC TV, back in the early Blair years, and before Donald Tusk even became Polish prime minister. One joke required English universities to be teeming with leavers, the exact opposite of reality.</p> <p>Admittedly, \u201cYeah but no but yeah but\u201d, the mantra of Vicky Pollard, the show\u2019s notoriously opinionated but clueless schoolgirl, could serve as a description of the progress of the various Brexit bills through the House of Commons.

      "bodyText": "In the many risk assessments of the possible consequences of Brexit happening on Halloween \u2013 lorry queues, drug shortages, street violence \u2013 scant attention was paid to a significant victim of its not happening: broadcasting specials timed to coincide with departure from the EU being forced to go out, even though the UK actually hadn\u2019t. The special Brexit edition of Little Britain, bringing David Walliams and Matt Lucas\u2019s sketch show back to Radio 4, where it started in 2000, was at a double disadvantage. Having been denied its calendar reason for being, it also now found itself broadcast in the run-up to a general election, when the BBC\u2019s already contorted attempts at political impartiality become even stricter. So perhaps there were tougher sketches or punchlines that might have been included either if Brexit had happened or the election hadn\u2019t. But, in the version transmitted, there was often a sense of EU references being shoehorned into scenes that could have been written when the show was on Radio 4 and then BBC TV, back in the early Blair years, and before Donald Tusk even became Polish prime minister. One joke required English universities to be teeming with leavers, the exact opposite of reality. Admittedly, \u201cYeah but no but yeah but\u201d, the mantra of Vicky Pollard, the show\u2019s notoriously opinionated but clueless schoolgirl, could serve as a description of the progress of the various Brexit bills through the House of Commons. However, an opening sketch in which Pollard, addressing speech day at her old school, got politicians\u2019 names childishly wrong (\u201cJoris Bonson, Nigel Frog\u201d) felt inadequate to the magnitude of the matter. There, and elsewhere, the show ducked the possibility of exploring a \u201cLittle British\u201d attitude among some leave voters. Marjorie Dawes, the racist runner of a slimming club, who is prone to finding the accents of foreigners incomprehensible, was omitted from the cast list for this special, which felt like playing safe. We did learn that lonely homosexual Daffyd Thomas voted leave, though not for any of the reasons that led so many real Welsh people to do so, but because he feared that free movement of European homosexuals would remove his status as \u201cthe only gay in the village\u201d.

The most original sketch, in which a devout Brexiter was appalled to find herself owing her life to a transplanted organ from a remainiac, will be useful to historians of this period, in the way that newspaper cartoons are, as a reflection of the bitterness of the British culture wars at this time.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is set to reject Labour\u2019s complaint about a Panorama documentary which alleged widespread antisemitism in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party, according to individuals with knowledge of the case. The decision is likely to set up a clash between the public broadcaster and the opposition that will run during the forthcoming general election campaign. The episode of Panorama entitled \u201cIs Labour Anti-Semitic?\u201d was broadcast this summer and made a number of claims about Labour\u2019s attitude towards the issue in recent years. It interviewed party activists and officials who said they were undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism. Labour strongly rejected the programme\u2019s conclusions, which included suggestions from a group of whistleblowers including the former general secretary Iain McNicol that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s director of strategy and communications, Seumas Milne, and the current general secretary, Jennie Formby, interfered with investigations into antisemitism. However, the Guardian has learned that the BBC\u2019s Executive Complaints Unit, the top level of the broadcaster\u2019s internal complaints process, has finished investigating the concerns raised by Labour and decided to back the programme-makers. A BBC spokesperson declined to comment. Labour now has the option to take the complaint to the media regulator Ofcom, which could take even longer to make a final ruling on the programme\u2019s accuracy and other potential breaches of the broadcasting code. This means the fallout from the programme is likely to continue throughout the general election campaign, with political parties already increasingly willing to publicly criticise broadcasters for alleged bias. Labour\u2019s 28-page complaint to the BBC said the episode of Panorama did not meet the broadcaster\u2019s standards because of \u201cthe tendentious and politically slanted script; the bias in the selection of interviewees; and the failure to identify the political affiliations or records of interviewees in a highly controversial, sensitive and contested subject produced a programme that was a one-sided authored polemic\u201d. The party particularly criticised the decision to allow the veteran documentary maker John Ware to make the programme, on the basis that he has a \u201crecord of public political hostility to Jeremy Corbyn, his politics and leadership of the Labour party\u201d. The BBC has always stood behind the show, saying it dealt with a topic of \u201cundoubted public interest\u201d and featured \u201cpowerful and disturbing testimonies from party members who\u2019d suffered antisemitic abuse\u201d. Labour\u2019s complaint accepted that the issue of antisemitism in the party and wider society is a subject of legitimate inquiry but reaction to the programme broadly divided along political lines. At the time of the broadcast, Jon Lansman, the co-founder of the Momentum campaign group and a Jewish supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, called the Panorama programme a \u201cpolitically motivated documentary into a subject that demands serious and fair discussion\u201d. The issue of antisemitism continues to affect the party. On Wednesday the Jewish Labour Movement, a socialist society affiliated to Labour, said it will not be campaigning for most of the party\u2019s candidates in the general election, citing a culture of antisemitism under the current party leadership. The BBC\u2019s decision to reject Labour\u2019s complaint was made by the same internal unit that came under criticism for its handling of the investigation into comments made by the BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty. In a separate development, Ware recently began libel proceedings against the Labour party over its public criticism of his reputation in public statements issued in advance of the broadcast of the Panorama episode.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 1 November. Top stories The US House of Representatives has voted to formalise impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, just the third time since 1868 the chamber has done so, with the vote being upheld largely along party lines, 232-196. The move could prompt televised hearings within two weeks and a potential impeachment vote before the year\u2019s end. Until now, congressional investigators have conducted interviews behind closed doors, but these could be thrust into the spotlight. The president continues to deny any wrongdoing, calling the vote \u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!\u201d on Twitter. If impeached, a two-thirds majority vote within the Senate will be required to remove him from office. Australia\u2019s six biggest coal producers cause greater greenhouse gas emissions than the entire domestic economy. That\u2019s the startling finding from researchers at the University of NSW, with BHP Billiton, Glencore, Yancoal, Peabody, Anglo American and Whitehaven linked to 551m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2018. Australia\u2019s 10 biggest carbon producers have also been linked to emissions equivalent to those from 75% of global air traffic. The study\u2019s lead author said fossil fuel companies had a moral responsibility to rapidly phase out their operations if global emissions are to meet IPCC targets of 45% below 2010 levels by 2030. Adani has asked to delay an outstanding payment of $18.5m to the Queensland government by two years, raising concerns about the Indian company\u2019s available finances. Guardian Australia can reveal Adani was granted a reissued water licence to take up to 12.5bn litres a year from the Suttor River by the Queensland government on 29 May. The deadline for the $18.5m payment has now been pushed back until mid-2021. Adani remains adamant that it\u2019s on track to deliver its first coal that year but satellite images suggest little physical progress has occurred since June. Australia An Australian writer incarcerated in Beijing since January on charges of espionage is suffering deteriorating health, with no court date set for accusations that could potentially include the death penalty. Dr Yang Hengjun, a former diplomat, has not had access to a lawyer or his family, and is allowed only one shower a week and two hours of natural light and fresh air a day. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has criticised an Institute for Public Affairs campaign video, saying: \u201cBigotry has no place in Australia.\u201d The IPA video attacks any proposal for an Indigenous voice to parliament, but Wyatt condemned what he called a \u201cselective\u201d use of race. Two NSW police officers have been found to have racially abused two Afghan women in Sydney\u2019s west, with video footage showing the interaction. The complainants allege that further offensive comments were made by the officers after body-worn cameras were switched off. Two new Labor MPs have proposed a ban on mobile phones during question time and an end to \u201cDorothy Dixers\u201d, after finding themselves \u201cdisheartened\u201d by \u201ca display of behaviour that would not be tolerated in any other workplace\u201d. The world A quarter of the world\u2019s pig population is expected to die from an epidemic of African swine fever that disease control experts fear has taken policymakers by surprise. As many as 100 million pigs have been killed by the disease in China. Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage could form an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d if they teamed up, according to Donald Trump, but the US president ruled out any possible US-UK trade deals. Five men accused of raping a 14-year-old girl in north-east Spain have escaped the most serious charges after the court found the girl\u2019s drunken state mitigated the need for \u201cviolence or intimidation\u201d. The men nevertheless received 10- to 12-year terms. A high school principal in Florida has been fired after telling a parent in an email that he \u201ccan\u2019t say the Holocaust is a factual event\u201d. A local county school board voted 5-2 to dismiss William Latson on grounds of \u201cethical misconduct\u201d. Recommended reads For the award-winning novelist Richard Flanagan, birds are a source of inspiration as well as profound sadness. \u201cI adore birds. Their freedom and joy move me. Something in their play and way suggest minds far different than ours,\u201d he writes for Guardian Australia.

But year on year fewer birds return to Flanagan\u2019s home in south-eastern Tasmania. \u201cWhat do you call a boy who doesn\u2019t play sport?,\u201d Catch Tilly would ask schoolchildren. The answer was always the same: \u201closer\u201d or \u201chopeless\u201d.

Listen Bicarbonate soda as a cure for cancer and advising sick mothers not to take antibiotics \u2013 this is the advice given by Barbara O\u2019Neill, a banned health practitioner who once described herself as a qualified naturopath and nutritionist. On this episode of Full Story, host Laura Murphy-Oates and reporter Melissa Davey explore an extraordinary case and discuss the dangerous lack of regulation of the booming wellness industry. Sport One of the most gifted athletes to appear as an All Black, or injury-prone and entitled? Sonny Bill Williams\u2019 legacy is far from secure, writes Matt McILwraith. Ash Barty appears set to continue her astonishing 2019 after securing a semi-final berth at the WTA finals. Bouncing back from a shock loss to Kiki Bertens, the World No 1 beat a flat-looking Petra Kvitova to book a showdown with either Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova.

Queensland\u2019s opposition leader has promised to \u201cdrought-proof\u201d the state, increasing dam capacity and creating a new food bowl, writes the Courier-Mail. And bookies are claiming they will lose money during next week\u2019s Melbourne Cup owing to an increase in government regulations and taxes, says the Australian. Coming up Scott Morrison is travelling to Thailand for the East Asia summit, where he hopes to progress talks for a 15-nation regional trade pact. New Zealand and Wales are set to face off in the Rugby World Cup bronze medal match in Tokyo.

No wonder lecturers are balloting to strike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The union urged universities to address members\u2019 concerns and warned that if they failed to do so strike action was \u201cinevitable\u201d, potentially disrupting the studies of about one million students. The UCU\u2019s higher education committee will meet on Friday to consider its next steps, including what form of industrial action it will take and when.</p> <p>Universities will be keen to avoid a repeat of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions\">last year\u2019s industrial action</a> over pension changes which saw 40,000 lecturers, librarians, researchers and other academic staff walk out, bringing campuses to a halt in an unprecedented wave of strikes.</p> <p>UCU\u2019s general secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/30/jo-grady-miners-daughter-preparing-for-university-picket-lines\">Jo Grady</a>, who took up the post earlier this year after playing a key role in last year\u2019s strike, said: \u201cThe results can only be interpreted as clear support for strike action over pensions, pay and working conditions. The ballots reflect just how unhappy and angry staff are at the state of higher education in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>According to the UCU, 43 branches beat the 50% turnout threshold for strike action over the universities superannuation scheme (USS), leaving open the option of strike action, while 56 exceeded the threshold on pay and conditions. Overall, 79% of voting members backed a strike in the pensions ballot, while 74% backed strike action over pay, casualisation, equality and workload.</p> <p>\u201cIt is incredibly frustrating that we had to ballot members again,\u201d said Grady, \u201cbut universities only have themselves to blame after failing to address falling real-terms pay and for refusing to deal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/29/temporary-work-lecturers-balloting-strike-uk-academics-short-term-contracts\">casualisation</a>, workloads and the rising cost of USS pensions.\u201d</p> <p>Last year the union succeeded in forcing employers to drop plans to change pensions at universities established before 1992 from defined benefit schemes to the less favourable defined contribution schemes. It is now challenging the size of staff contributions, which it thinks should be capped at 8% of a lecturer\u2019s salary, rather than the 9.6% proposed by employers.</p> <p>Responding to the outcome of the USS ballot, Universities UK (UUK), which represents 136 universities, said employers were open to further talks in the hope of resolving the dispute without industrial action, which would be damaging for staff and students.</p> <p>\u201cRecent negotiations between UCU and Universities UK concluded with no cuts to USS pension benefits, and employers paying the majority of the extra contributions required under pensions law,\u201d a UUK spokesman said. \u201cIn a challenging economic environment, this outcome is the best that could be achieved. Crucially, it is acceptable to both the USS trustees and the pensions regulator.\u201d</p> <p>The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents employers in pay talks, said \u201clow turnouts\u201d and \u201cpatchy ballot results\u201d suggested limited support for a pay dispute, indicating an understanding of the \u201cfinancial realities\u201d for universities.</p> <p>\u201cFor the handful of institutions where UCU members have voted in sufficient numbers to support industrial action, it is unclear how they can possibly pursue UCU\u2019s national pay dispute,\u201d a UCEA spokesman said.</p> <p>Grady added: \u201cUniversities now have to come back to us prepared to work seriously to address these problems. If they choose to ignore this message from their staff then strike action looks inevitable.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Disillusioned university workers have voted in support of strike action on campuses across the UK following separate ballots over pensions, pay and working conditions. The University and College Union (UCU) said the result was a serious indictment of the state of higher education, and demonstrated the depth of anger and frustration among those working in the sector, many of whom are on low-paid temporary contracts. The union urged universities to address members\u2019 concerns and warned that if they failed to do so strike action was \u201cinevitable\u201d, potentially disrupting the studies of about one million students. The UCU\u2019s higher education committee will meet on Friday to consider its next steps, including what form of industrial action it will take and when. Universities will be keen to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s industrial action over pension changes which saw 40,000 lecturers, librarians, researchers and other academic staff walk out, bringing campuses to a halt in an unprecedented wave of strikes. UCU\u2019s general secretary, Jo Grady, who took up the post earlier this year after playing a key role in last year\u2019s strike, said: \u201cThe results can only be interpreted as clear support for strike action over pensions, pay and working conditions. The ballots reflect just how unhappy and angry staff are at the state of higher education in the UK.\u201d According to the UCU, 43 branches beat the 50% turnout threshold for strike action over the universities superannuation scheme (USS), leaving open the option of strike action, while 56 exceeded the threshold on pay and conditions. Overall, 79% of voting members backed a strike in the pensions ballot, while 74% backed strike action over pay, casualisation, equality and workload. \u201cIt is incredibly frustrating that we had to ballot members again,\u201d said Grady, \u201cbut universities only have themselves to blame after failing to address falling real-terms pay and for refusing to deal with casualisation, workloads and the rising cost of USS pensions.\u201d Last year the union succeeded in forcing employers to drop plans to change pensions at universities established before 1992 from defined benefit schemes to the less favourable defined contribution schemes. It is now challenging the size of staff contributions, which it thinks should be capped at 8% of a lecturer\u2019s salary, rather than the 9.6% proposed by employers. Responding to the outcome of the USS ballot, Universities UK (UUK), which represents 136 universities, said employers were open to further talks in the hope of resolving the dispute without industrial action, which would be damaging for staff and students. \u201cRecent negotiations between UCU and Universities UK concluded with no cuts to USS pension benefits, and employers paying the majority of the extra contributions required under pensions law,\u201d a UUK spokesman said. \u201cIn a challenging economic environment, this outcome is the best that could be achieved. Crucially, it is acceptable to both the USS trustees and the pensions regulator.\u201d The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents employers in pay talks, said \u201clow turnouts\u201d and \u201cpatchy ballot results\u201d suggested limited support for a pay dispute, indicating an understanding of the \u201cfinancial realities\u201d for universities. \u201cFor the handful of institutions where UCU members have voted in sufficient numbers to support industrial action, it is unclear how they can possibly pursue UCU\u2019s national pay dispute,\u201d a UCEA spokesman said. Grady added: \u201cUniversities now have to come back to us prepared to work seriously to address these problems. If they choose to ignore this message from their staff then strike action looks inevitable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Women\u2019s organisations have expressed alarm at the number of female MPs standing down at the upcoming general election who have cited the abuse they face in public office. Figures suggest female MPs are retiring from parliament prematurely. Of the 58 politicians who have announced they will not stand again, 18 are women and 41 are men, which is roughly proportional to the current makeup of parliament. However, since cohorts of retiring MPs usually reflect historical intakes, the expectation would be that the number of outgoing female parliamentarians would be lower. Among Tory ranks, the female MPs stepping down are on average 10 years younger and have spent a decade less in parliament than retiring male MPs. The cabinet minister Nicky Morgan has said she will not be standing as a candidate, with one of her reasons being the abuse she has received. The former home secretary Amber Rudd is also among the moderate Tory MPs who have said they will not fight the election on 12 December. Heidi Allen, the former Conservative MP who defected to the Liberal Democrats via Change UK, also said she would not stand, highlighting \u201cthe nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace\u201d. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said it was extremely worrying that so many women were leaving parliament at the election and had cited \u201ceither the abuse they have received or the pressure it has put on their family life\u201d. \u201cWe have to confront the fact that our toxic politics is driving good women MPs away. In 2019 it is still a hostile environment for women,\u201d she said, adding that the figures should particularly worry the Conservative party, where only one in five MPs are women. \u201cI fear that we will see the number of women MPs fall after this election. We are going backwards,\u201d said Smethers. Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, said the abuse and intimidation female MPs were subjected to was one of \u201cthe most insidious effects of the toxic Brexit debate\u201d. \u201cPolitics has become a hostile environment for women \u2013 in which we are harassed, demeaned, and threatened as a matter of course,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only does this affect the individual women targeted, it also contributes to a culture in which women\u2019s voices are not welcomed or respected.\u201d In a letter to her South Cambridgeshire constituents explaining her decision to stand down, Allen said she was exhausted by the invasion of her privacy and intimidation. \u201cNobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home,\u201d she said.

But, said Wollaston, the experience seemed to be universal among her female colleagues. Louise Ellman, the MP for Liverpool Riverside who quit the Labour party last month over what she said was its failure to tackle growing antisemitism in its ranks, said she was not surprised that her female colleagues were deciding to stand down. \u201cPolitics has become increasingly personalised and abusive and I\u2019m not surprised that many women MPs have decided they don\u2019t want to be part of it,\u201d said Ellman, who will also not stand in the upcoming election.",

      "bodyText": "The announcement of a successor for Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England has been postponed until after the general election. With only days to go until parliament is dissolved, the chancellor Sajid Javid has abandoned plans to announce his choice for Threadneedle Street\u2019s top job during the autumn. The chancellor is believed to have made the decision to delay because he felt that making a choice at a politically sensitive time might damage the independence of the Bank. The Treasury believes there will still be time for the newly appointed governor to be fully prepared to take over at the Bank by the time Carney is due to end his six-and-a-half stint at the end of January next year. At this stage, there are no plans to ask Carney \u2013 who has twice extended his term \u2013 to stay on, with the Treasury confident that the new government will be in a position to make an appointment from a slate of candidates soon after the election on 12 December. A panel of senior officials and the former monetary policy committee member Kate Barker sent a shortlist of candidates to the Treasury after holding interviews with applicants over the summer. The shortlist is thought to include Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority; Minouche Shafik, head of the London School of Economics; Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK; and Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe, both deputy governors at the Bank. Several candidates cited as likely to be popular with the Treasury were not interviewed, including the former head of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan. The shortlist is understood to have excluded Gerard Lyons, a Eurosceptic economist and former adviser to Boris Johnson when he was London mayor, who applied for the role.

Sometimes called the Football Factory (or a \u201cconcrete Catalonia\u201d), south London produced more than 14% of the English footballers in the Premier League last season. Others from the area \u2013 such as Jadon Sancho and Ademola Lookman \u2013 are forging impressive careers abroad. Palace consider themselves the \u201cPride of south London\u201d but have yet to make the most of the diverse and hungry talent on their doorstep. This new facility is an attempt to change that. The club are awaiting planning permission but revealed plans to local residents on Thursday. They involve developing playing fields in the suburb of Beckenham that have long belonged to London\u2019s biggest banks. Where HSBC once played Lloyds, Palace will coach eight- to 18-year-olds, introduce Desso pitches (synthetic pitches with natural grass aesthetics), classrooms, lecture halls and a medical centre. With these changes, the club hope they will move their academy from category two to the coveted category one status, becoming part of an elite English system that the chairman, Steve Parish, believes is \u201cthe best in the world\u201d.

Let\u2019s make this the last time we see a manic registration rush \u2013 putting strain on local electoral offices. \u201cWe cannot be complacent \u2013 this election must see the biggest registration drive this country has seen to ensure it genuinely represents all of us.\u201d The final date for registering to vote is 26 November.",

      "bodyText": "Your editorial (A less confrontational and better funded system for vulnerable pupils is needed, 28 October) was admirably understated. Its arrival on our breakfast table coincided with our grocery delivery, brought in by a cheerful young man whose job as a teacher and specialist in behavioural problems at a school in Cardiff had just been cut \u2013 along with the jobs of five others in his field. The reason given was that there was no longer any need for teachers specialising in behavioural problems. At a time when young people are reported as feeling more anxious and stressed than ever, cutting jobs like these seems to be bordering on the negligent. Now that \u201cministers have belatedly realised that cash is the issue\u201d, can it be hoped that some of these dedicated, skilled professionals will be re-employed as teachers, before they are lured away by the better pay and opportunities in other sectors? In the meantime, how many more children\u2019s lives will be blighted by the lack of support available to them? And how many teachers will leave the profession as they crumble under the weight of the additional responsibilities of trying to address their pupils\u2019 special needs? It seems that the damaging effects of austerity rumble on, despite the fine words of our former prime minister. Dr Stephanie Williams Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan \u2022 Your editorial implies that the education committee\u2019s report on children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) doesn\u2019t come up with a solution for vulnerable children. However, there does not need to be a magic solution or rewriting of the rules, as the solution lies in the system that currently exists. What we want is the system to work for all children with Send. Our proposals \u2013 including to increase powers for the ombudsman, introduce a more rigorous inspections regime from Ofsted, establish a neutral individual to help guide parents through the bureaucratic treacle, enable local authorities to build new specialist provision, and develop a strategy for employment opportunities for young people \u2013 will have a significant impact and increase the focus on the education and life outcomes for pupils with Send. Ringfencing the additional \u00a3700m would be entirely consistent with our criticism of the way in which the implementation grant was used; it was distributed to local authorities with the following guidance: \u201cLocal authorities can spend this grant to help with the additional costs associated with the implementation of the Send reforms. They may, however, choose how to spend the money in order to best meet local need.\u201d We expect the Department for Education to have learned from the debacle of the implementation grant, and set firm parameters for spending, under our watchful oversight as a committee. Robert Halfon MP Chair of the House of Commons education committee and Conservative MP for Harlow \u2022 Your editorial makes cogent points about the failure of central and local government to respond to the needs of children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities. As the chair of a specialist college which transforms the lives of young people via their interest and involvement in the performing arts every year, I know the torment visited on their parents as they attempt to obtain funding is appalling. We also find that on appeal most of the students obtain funding which indicates that the applications are well founded but what hurdles the parents are made to jump. Three particular issues illustrate this injustice. First, the lack of empathy in the system denies what grief and stress has been visited on the parents often since the birth of their child. How can a caring state treat them with such disdain? Second, the parents who stay the course are those with money and the skills to fight the system. The poor and inarticulate often give up and keep their adult child at home until they die. Third, as your editorial says, there are \u201cByzantine procedures to suppress demand\u201d. One of the cruellest of these is to defer funding decisions until the summer or even autumn of the young person\u2019s final year in school. Imagine the stress and uncertainty for the young person and their parent(s) not knowing all summer where they are going in September. Years ago social service departments and local educational authorities were required to agree a jointly funded care plan at 15 for the rest of the young person\u2019s state-supported learning and care needs. Central governments in their wisdom changed all these structures and, as ever, disabled people dropped through the net. There is a simple solution: require local authorities to decide by the end of the penultimate year in school where that young person could be funded to go when they are 18 and for central government to provide ringfenced funds for this.

Just as we did not leave the EU on 29 March, or on the second deadline of 12 April, we will not leave on 31 October. Incredibly, staying in the EU beyond an entirely arbitrary deadline did not prove especially frightening after all. The Tory Nostradamuses\u2019 fears (or secret hopes) of social and political chaos came to nothing. Life after the latest missed deadline will continue exactly as before.</p> <p>It is, of course, amusing that Johnson\u2019s hyperbolic threats have been so definitively exposed. But there is a serious point. Imagine any other prime minister making one single, existential pledge in order to reach office, and then again upon entering it. Imagine that prime minister repeating the sole pledge each day for three months. Imagine him saying he\u2019d die for it. And then imagine him breaking that pledge, openly and unambiguously, and moving on as though nothing had happened. A leader with honour or integrity would resign. </p> <p>It is worth recalling the genesis of the 31 October Brexit deadline. Theresa May\u2019s similarly arbitrary date of 29 March, to which she too clung, was at least decided in Downing Street. The 31 October cut-off was a compromise devised by the 27 other EU member states while May waited outside the room.</p> <p>It was a symbol not of taking back control but giving it away. And yet the Brexiters endowed it with more national mythology than the ravens at the Tower of London. The date\u2019s rapid fetishisation embodied how Brexit had been permanently transported from the prosaic realm of jobs and trade figures to an epochal quest of romantic nationalism.</p> <p>Nobody was more instrumental in formalising this association than Johnson. It was the only issue that distinguished him from Jeremy Hunt during the Conservative leadership contest. Hunt said he would be prepared to extend for a few weeks beyond October if it meant signing a deal. Johnson declared that he would rather undergo the chaos of no deal at all. The future of an apparently serious country was to rest on the immutability of a single date. The date won.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-accused-report-russia-dominic-grieve\">Johnson accused of withholding key report on Russia from voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But of course Johnson underestimated parliament from the start. It would not allow him to take us out of the EU with no deal. The prime minister in turn became so transfixed by no deal that by the time he caved in to the EU on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/15/boris-johnson-close-to-brexit-deal-after-border-concessions\" title=\"\">customs border</a> in the Irish Sea, it was too late to meet his deadline. He secured his deal, but attempted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/mps-reject-boris-johnsons-attempt-to-fast-track-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">ram it through parliament</a> in just three days \u2013 less than was allocated to the Wild Animals in Circuses Act. The only reason to fast-track the most significant legislation of modern times was to spare Johnson the embarrassment of extending Brexit by even a couple of days.</p> <p>The Tories will now spend the next six weeks alternatively ignoring the broken deadline and blaming parliament for forcing an extension. We must challenge that narrative. The 31 October deadline is not a sideshow. It goes to the crux of who our leader is and what he represents.</p> <p>First, a government entrusted to look after our welfare was more interested in one man\u2019s rhetorical ditch than millions of people\u2019s actual livelihoods. Ministers attempted to deny a vital bill scrutiny in order to protect the prime minister\u2019s ego. Their contempt is so normalised that we no longer even notice it.</p> <p>Second, Johnson is incapable of taking responsibility for his own actions. He did not say \u201cwe will leave the EU on 31 October if parliament or Jeremy Corbyn permits it\u201d. He guaranteed that date, \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d, do or die. Further, he knew from the beginning that the parliamentary arithmetic would stop a no deal departure on 31 October, but he repeated his grand promise over and over.</p> <p>Third, and most important, the missed deadline illuminates our new political culture. Johnson made a pledge he knew he could not keep. He continued to make it long after it became obvious he would not keep it. He was still promising to honour it late last week. By any normal standards that revealed his profound delusion, dishonesty and weakness.</p> <p>Yet his party and the rightwing media offered him no serious challenge or rebuke. It is not just that he can lie with impunity. It is not even that his dishonesty is \u201cpriced in\u201d and we expect him to lie. It is in fact much worse: we want him to lie to us. It is central to his appeal.</p> <p>Here, then, is the truth. Halloween will not scare us this year, because we never need to be afraid of staying in the EU. Life will stay the same on 1 November and continue on even if we never leave. But everyone should now see that our prime minister governs not in the interests of the nation, or even his party, but himself alone \u2013 and that truly is frightening.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence</p>",

The future of an apparently serious country was to rest on the immutability of a single date. The date won. But of course Johnson underestimated parliament from the start. It would not allow him to take us out of the EU with no deal. The prime minister in turn became so transfixed by no deal that by the time he caved in to the EU on the customs border in the Irish Sea, it was too late to meet his deadline. He secured his deal, but attempted to ram it through parliament in just three days \u2013 less than was allocated to the Wild Animals in Circuses Act. The only reason to fast-track the most significant legislation of modern times was to spare Johnson the embarrassment of extending Brexit by even a couple of days. The Tories will now spend the next six weeks alternatively ignoring the broken deadline and blaming parliament for forcing an extension. We must challenge that narrative. The 31 October deadline is not a sideshow. It goes to the crux of who our leader is and what he represents. First, a government entrusted to look after our welfare was more interested in one man\u2019s rhetorical ditch than millions of people\u2019s actual livelihoods. Ministers attempted to deny a vital bill scrutiny in order to protect the prime minister\u2019s ego. Their contempt is so normalised that we no longer even notice it. Second, Johnson is incapable of taking responsibility for his own actions. He did not say \u201cwe will leave the EU on 31 October if parliament or Jeremy Corbyn permits it\u201d. He guaranteed that date, \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d, do or die. Further, he knew from the beginning that the parliamentary arithmetic would stop a no deal departure on 31 October, but he repeated his grand promise over and over. Third, and most important, the missed deadline illuminates our new political culture. Johnson made a pledge he knew he could not keep. He continued to make it long after it became obvious he would not keep it. He was still promising to honour it late last week. By any normal standards that revealed his profound delusion, dishonesty and weakness. Yet his party and the rightwing media offered him no serious challenge or rebuke. It is not just that he can lie with impunity. It is not even that his dishonesty is \u201cpriced in\u201d and we expect him to lie. It is in fact much worse: we want him to lie to us. It is central to his appeal. Here, then, is the truth. Halloween will not scare us this year, because we never need to be afraid of staying in the EU. Life will stay the same on 1 November and continue on even if we never leave. But everyone should now see that our prime minister governs not in the interests of the nation, or even his party, but himself alone \u2013 and that truly is frightening. \u2022 Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence",

Elton John biopic Rocketman made \u00a3148m ($195m) for Paramount earlier this year; Baz Lurhmann is preparing an Elvis Presley movie, and films about the lives of Aretha Franklin, Bob Marley and Carole King are all in development. The Bee Gees story has the requisite ups and downs: the three eldest Gibb brothers hustled up a career first in Australia, and then in the UK via Beatles manager Brian Epstein, before breaking through in the US in the late 1960s. They split up in 1970 amid fraternal spats, compounded by misuse of alcohol and drugs. Barry Gibb told the Guardian in 2013: \u201cThere was this deep, emotional competition between three brothers that had found themselves to be famous and didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d But the Gibbs buried the hatchet, reformed, and ended up bigger than ever before. Songs including Stayin\u2019 Alive, Night Fever, More Than a Woman and How Deep Is Your Love \u2013 which soundtracked the smash-hit 1977 film Saturday Night Fever \u2013 defined and indeed prolonged the disco era, and they had six successive No 1 singles in the US in less than two years. Later there would be further discord: acrimonious divorces, more drug addiction, and the death of their younger brother Andy aged just 30. Maurice Gibb died in 2003, followed by his twin, Robin, in 2012. Barry Gibb, whose falsetto helped define the band, was knighted in 2018. His most recent live performance was a rapturously received set at the 2017 Glastonbury festival.",

After almost two years of wrangling over US import tariffs on Chinese goods, which sparked a tit-for-tat row between the world\u2019s largest trading nations, the two sides were close to a comprehensive long-term trade agreement, the president said. But shares in New York nosedived after Chinese officials appeared to cast doubt on the prospects for an agreement, when the sides were still discussing plans for an interim, \u201cphase one\u201d settlement. Earlier this month Trump delayed plans to raise the tariffs on $250bn worth of goods to 30%, saying he would wait until mid-December when a further 15% tariff on almost all remaining Chinese imports including laptops, smartphones, footwear and clothing is due to be imposed unless a deal can be reached with Beijing. Bloomberg News reported that private conversations with trade advisers in Beijing had revealed they remain concerned about Trump\u2019s impulsive nature and the risk that he may back out of even a limited deal at the last minute. Trump disputed this version of events, tweeting: \u201cChina and the USA are working on selecting a new site for signing of Phase One of Trade Agreement, about 60% of total deal, after APEC in Chile was canceled do to unrelated circumstances. The new location will be announced soon. President Xi and President Trump will do signing!\u201d The two sides were due to sign off the first phase of a deal at the Apec trade summit later in November until the host nation Chile was forced to cancel it following weeks of violent protests. David Cheetham at the currency trader XTB said: \u201cThe latest comments from Beijing suggested that investors may be getting a little bit ahead of themselves in assuming a smooth de-escalation in trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\u201d The Dow Jones in New York slumped more than 200 points to below 27,000 and gold \u2013 considered a safe haven in periods of uncertainty \u2013 rose back above $1,500 (\u00a31,145) an ounce to trade near its weekly highs. Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at the spread betting firm IG, said: \u201cChina appears not to trust Donald Trump over the putative trade deal.\u201d He said markets remained \u201cacutely sensitive to any trade war headlines\u201d. Trump also depressed shares after he attacked the Federal Reserve for limiting its interest rates cuts to three-quarters of a percentage point this year, down to a range of 1.5%-1.75%. The Federal Reserve completed the third of its rate cuts on Wednesday, initially cheering investors who, like the president, have called for lower interest rates as a bulwark against a slowing economy. The president harangued the central bank\u2019s chair Jerome (Jay) Powell for not following Europe and Japan\u2019s central banks in cutting interest rates to below zero. Trump wrote: \u201cPeople are VERY disappointed in Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow. They even tightened in the beginning. Others are running circles around them and laughing all the way to the bank. Dollar &amp; Rates are hurting \u2026 our manufacturers. We should have lower interest rates than Germany, Japan and all others. We are now, by far, the biggest and strongest Country, but the Fed puts us at a competitive disadvantage. China is not our problem, the Federal Reserve is! We will win anyway,\u201d he tweeted. Analysts have blamed the bulk of the decline in global trade and the slowdown in US GDP growth on Trump\u2019s import tariffs, which have increased the price of Chinese imports and sparked a row that has hit US exports to China.",

The Roundhouse was listed as having received the grant last year in company accounts filed early in October by the trust, but has now revealed that it decided not to take the money because it would distract from its work with young people. Another institution, the Donmar Warehouse, told the Guardian on Thursday that it had decided to terminate a funding agreement to receive the rest of a \u00a3180,000 grant after an initial \u00a360,000 instalment was received last December. The developments came after the National Portrait Gallery earlier this year become the first major art institution to give up a grant from the Sackler family, in a move that campaigners hailed as a landmark victory in the battle over the ethics of arts funding. Dame Theresa Sackler, the chair of the trust, subsequently announced that it would be temporarily suspending all new philanthropic giving, while continuing to honour existing commitments.

      "body": "<p>My father, Michael Mott, who has died aged 88, was a poet, novelist and biographer who published widely on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>He upheld a daily practice of letter-writing. He corresponded with family, friends and deep thinkers \u2013 most recently the former archbishop of Canterbury <a href=\"https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/user/williams\" title=\"\">Rowan Williams</a>, the poet Tony Roberts, and the religion and humanities scholar John Alden Williams. His correspondence, as part of <a href=\"https://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/repositories/7/resources/1225\" title=\"\">The Michael Mott Collection</a>, is kept at <a href=\"https://www.northwestern.edu/\" title=\"\">Northwestern University, Chicago</a>.</p> <p>Michael was born in Hampstead, north London, to Eric, a solicitor, and Margaret \u201cTotts\u201d (nee Berger), an American sculptor. Friends of the family included the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/07/barbara-hepworth-exhibition-female-sculpture\" title=\"\">Barbara Hepworth</a> and the writer <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/geoffrey-grigson\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Grigson</a>. Following Michael\u2019s dismissal from two nursery schools, his anxious parents sought a diagnosis from another Hampstead neighbour, <a href=\"https://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/anna-freud\" title=\"\">Anna Freud</a>. Her prescient analysis was that he was suffering merely from a vivid imagination.</p> <p>During the second world war, he and his younger brothers, John and Tony, were evacuated to Totts\u2019s family in Colorado. He boarded at Riverdale Country school in New York. Following his return to Britain in 1944 aboard a destroyer, Michael attended Stowe school in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>After studying history at Oriel College, Oxford, and art history at the Courtauld Institute, in 1961 he became an art editor at Thames &amp; Hudson in London before working at the Geographical magazine. During this time he continued to volunteer as an assistant editor of the literary magazine ADAM International Review.</p> <p>An invitation in 1966 to be poetry editor of the Kenyon Review \u2013 a literary magazine based at Kenyon College, Ohio \u2013 launched Michael\u2019s academic career in the US, teaching creative writing, that would last for more than three decades.</p> <p>In 1957, the first of is 11 collections of poetry, The Cost of Living, was published.

      "bodyText": "My father, Michael Mott, who has died aged 88, was a poet, novelist and biographer who published widely on both sides of the Atlantic. He upheld a daily practice of letter-writing. He corresponded with family, friends and deep thinkers \u2013 most recently the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the poet Tony Roberts, and the religion and humanities scholar John Alden Williams. His correspondence, as part of The Michael Mott Collection, is kept at Northwestern University, Chicago. Michael was born in Hampstead, north London, to Eric, a solicitor, and Margaret \u201cTotts\u201d (nee Berger), an American sculptor. Friends of the family included the artist Barbara Hepworth and the writer Geoffrey Grigson. Following Michael\u2019s dismissal from two nursery schools, his anxious parents sought a diagnosis from another Hampstead neighbour, Anna Freud. Her prescient analysis was that he was suffering merely from a vivid imagination. During the second world war, he and his younger brothers, John and Tony, were evacuated to Totts\u2019s family in Colorado. He boarded at Riverdale Country school in New York. Following his return to Britain in 1944 aboard a destroyer, Michael attended Stowe school in Buckinghamshire. After studying history at Oriel College, Oxford, and art history at the Courtauld Institute, in 1961 he became an art editor at Thames &amp; Hudson in London before working at the Geographical magazine. During this time he continued to volunteer as an assistant editor of the literary magazine ADAM International Review. An invitation in 1966 to be poetry editor of the Kenyon Review \u2013 a literary magazine based at Kenyon College, Ohio \u2013 launched Michael\u2019s academic career in the US, teaching creative writing, that would last for more than three decades. In 1957, the first of is 11 collections of poetry, The Cost of Living, was published. Four novels followed, including The Notebooks of Susan Berry (1962) and The Blind Cross (1969). He married Margaret (nee Watt), a fashion designer, in 1961, and the following year they had twin daughters, Sophie and me, and settled in Muswell Hill, north London. In the 1970s, while teaching at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, Michael was involved in the civil rights movement and was instrumental in the city\u2019s budding arts scene, receiving the governor\u2019s award in fine arts in 1974 from Jimmy Carter. In 1985, Michael\u2019s bestselling biography, The Seven Mountains of Thomas Merton, was runner-up for a Pulitzer prize. Following Margaret\u2019s death in 1990, Michael became active in pastoral care in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he married Emma Lou Powers in 1992. His last months were spent being cared for by Sophie and her wife, Roz, surrounded by the things he loved most: family, friends, art and books. He is survived by Emma Lou, Sophie and me, his granddaughter, Shakiera Sarai, and his brother, John.",

      "body": "<p>Norman Myers, who has died of dementia aged 85, was the scientist who first calculated that every year, worldwide, an area of tropical rainforest the size of England and Wales was burned, bulldozed or felled to ranch beef for US hamburgers.</p> <p>That, more than 40 years ago, was not orthodoxy. Satellite imagery over the next decade proved him right. He also predicted \u2013 and explained his reasoning, in his second book, The Sinking Ark (1979) \u2013 that species were being extinguished at the rate of one a day, rather than the accepted figure of one a year. This too was challenged, and later Myers conceded he had been wrong; he should have said 50 species a day.</p> <p>By then he had launched a career as an environmental consultant, ultimately to advise the White House, United Nations agencies, the World Bank, the European commission, governments, charitable foundations and the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change.</p> <p>He was one of a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/longterm-biological-consequences-of-nuclear-war/71C67233C6366D1537E624109E92B31D\" title=\"\">group of scientists</a> that endorsed the argument, first made in 1983, that in any cold war nuclear exchange, there could be neither winners nor even many survivors: the soot and debris from incinerated cities would stay in the stratosphere, screen out sunlight and plunge the planet into a nuclear winter, reducing humankind by starvation.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1312319.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" title=\"\">predicted</a> the explosion of environmental refugees, driven from their homes by the million by climate crisis, natural disaster, erosion, drought and other human changes to the planet. Myers was one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\" title=\"\">prophets</a> of the Anthropocene \u2013 the epoch of human domination of the entire planet \u2013 long before anyone had coined the term.</p> <p>His early predictions often initially provoked bitter argument, but would soon be backed by other outspoken greats of conservation biology, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/01/usa.science\" title=\"\">Edward O Wilson</a> and Paul Ehrlich in the US, and finally be embraced as orthodoxy. Another pioneer environmental scientist, Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, once told me: \u201cI don\u2019t think Norman\u2019s been seriously wrong on anything.\u201d</p> <p>By the close of his career, Time magazine had <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1663317_1663323_1669905,00.html\" title=\"\">named Myers</a> one of its Heroes of the Environment, the UN Environment Programme had listed him in its Global 500 Roll of Honour, and the British government in 1998 had made him a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). He had been lauded with distinguished or visiting professorships at \u2013 among other universities \u2013 Oxford, Cornell, Vermont, Cape Town and Utrecht, and fellowships in Washington, Tokyo, Canada, India and Japan.</p> <p>He had by then delivered 300 professional or scientific research papers and almost 20 books, which sold more than a million copies in a dozen languages. For many years he contributed to the Guardian\u2019s science pages. He was introduced worldwide as Professor Norman Myers of Oxford, although paradoxically, for much of his life, his connection with Oxford was that he had studied French and German poets at Keble College, and lived in Headington, just outside the city.</p> <p>He was born at Higher Lees farm at Whitewell, near Clitheroe, in Lancashire to John Myers, a farmer, and Gladys (nee Haworth), a teacher, in a house, Norman would <a href=\"http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Myers/myers-con1.html\" title=\"\">remember</a> \u201cwith no electricity or gas\u201d and water from a stream shared with the cows. He went to Clitheroe grammar school, began national service as a gunner in the Royal Artillery before being discharged after an injury, and took a degree in modern languages at Oxford.</p> <p>In 1958 he joined the Colonial Service and was posted to Kenya, and ultimately to the Masai tribal region, as a district officer. He learned both Swahili and Masai, fell in love with Africa, and stayed on after independence to become a Kenyan citizen, a schoolteacher and then a professional photographer, especially of wildlife.</p> <p>\u201cIt would mean days of sitting in my Land Rover by a waterhole waiting for the damned lion to jump on board a zebra and this would give me lots of time to read books and scientific papers about what makes a lioness tick,\u201d he told me. \u201cThen I began to get interested in species generally.\u201d</p> <p>His track record was unusual: the spoor of a trailblazer rather than a career scientist. He completed a doctorate in conservation and development at the University of California at Berkeley in 1973, and returned to Kenya to begin surveys of cheetah and leopard numbers. He had already heard that conservationists calculated extinction rates at one species a year, but these were always well-observed birds or mammals.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I thought what about all the creepy-crawlies? And came up with a figure of one a day. And then I got interested in the tropical forests because they contain more species and are being depleted faster,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>He returned to Britain, and to British citizenship, in the early 1980s, settled in Headington and continued to introduce \u2013 increasingly with colleagues \u2013 new thinking about conservation and development. He identified, for instance, the conservation opportunity of the \u201cbiodiversity hotspot\u201d <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02240252\" title=\"\">arguing</a> that perhaps one third of all the planet\u2019s living things were to be found in 25 \u201chotspots\u201d that added up to just 1.4% of the Earth\u2019s land surface.</p> <p>He pushed for clearer understanding of the economic value of wild things and their genetic value as sources of new pharmaceuticals, natural pesticides and foods, and he challenged the perverse role of government subsidies that damaged both the environment and the economy.</p> <p>He was an enthusiastic marathon runner, and once held \u2013 briefly \u2013 the <a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/34/5/404.1\" title=\"\">record</a> for running to the summit of Kilimanjaro and down again, a distance of 36 miles and a climb of more than 13,000ft, in 13 hours and 20 minutes. He liked to take Cicero and Virgil in Latin on safari, and enjoyed Racine, Balzac, Proust and Goethe in French and German.</p> <p>In 1965 he married Dorothy Halliman. They separated in 1993 and divorced in 2012.</p> <p>He is survived by their two daughters, Malindi and Mara, and two grandchildren, Juliette and Alexander.</p> <p>\u2022 Norman Myers, environmentalist, born 24 August 1934; died 20 October 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "Norman Myers, who has died of dementia aged 85, was the scientist who first calculated that every year, worldwide, an area of tropical rainforest the size of England and Wales was burned, bulldozed or felled to ranch beef for US hamburgers. That, more than 40 years ago, was not orthodoxy. Satellite imagery over the next decade proved him right. He also predicted \u2013 and explained his reasoning, in his second book, The Sinking Ark (1979) \u2013 that species were being extinguished at the rate of one a day, rather than the accepted figure of one a year. This too was challenged, and later Myers conceded he had been wrong; he should have said 50 species a day. By then he had launched a career as an environmental consultant, ultimately to advise the White House, United Nations agencies, the World Bank, the European commission, governments, charitable foundations and the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change. He was one of a group of scientists that endorsed the argument, first made in 1983, that in any cold war nuclear exchange, there could be neither winners nor even many survivors: the soot and debris from incinerated cities would stay in the stratosphere, screen out sunlight and plunge the planet into a nuclear winter, reducing humankind by starvation. He predicted the explosion of environmental refugees, driven from their homes by the million by climate crisis, natural disaster, erosion, drought and other human changes to the planet. Myers was one of the prophets of the Anthropocene \u2013 the epoch of human domination of the entire planet \u2013 long before anyone had coined the term. His early predictions often initially provoked bitter argument, but would soon be backed by other outspoken greats of conservation biology, among them Edward O Wilson and Paul Ehrlich in the US, and finally be embraced as orthodoxy. Another pioneer environmental scientist, Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, once told me: \u201cI don\u2019t think Norman\u2019s been seriously wrong on anything.\u201d By the close of his career, Time magazine had named Myers one of its Heroes of the Environment, the UN Environment Programme had listed him in its Global 500 Roll of Honour, and the British government in 1998 had made him a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). He had been lauded with distinguished or visiting professorships at \u2013 among other universities \u2013 Oxford, Cornell, Vermont, Cape Town and Utrecht, and fellowships in Washington, Tokyo, Canada, India and Japan. He had by then delivered 300 professional or scientific research papers and almost 20 books, which sold more than a million copies in a dozen languages. For many years he contributed to the Guardian\u2019s science pages. He was introduced worldwide as Professor Norman Myers of Oxford, although paradoxically, for much of his life, his connection with Oxford was that he had studied French and German poets at Keble College, and lived in Headington, just outside the city. He was born at Higher Lees farm at Whitewell, near Clitheroe, in Lancashire to John Myers, a farmer, and Gladys (nee Haworth), a teacher, in a house, Norman would remember \u201cwith no electricity or gas\u201d and water from a stream shared with the cows. He went to Clitheroe grammar school, began national service as a gunner in the Royal Artillery before being discharged after an injury, and took a degree in modern languages at Oxford. In 1958 he joined the Colonial Service and was posted to Kenya, and ultimately to the Masai tribal region, as a district officer. He learned both Swahili and Masai, fell in love with Africa, and stayed on after independence to become a Kenyan citizen, a schoolteacher and then a professional photographer, especially of wildlife. \u201cIt would mean days of sitting in my Land Rover by a waterhole waiting for the damned lion to jump on board a zebra and this would give me lots of time to read books and scientific papers about what makes a lioness tick,\u201d he told me. \u201cThen I began to get interested in species generally.\u201d His track record was unusual: the spoor of a trailblazer rather than a career scientist. He completed a doctorate in conservation and development at the University of California at Berkeley in 1973, and returned to Kenya to begin surveys of cheetah and leopard numbers. He had already heard that conservationists calculated extinction rates at one species a year, but these were always well-observed birds or mammals. \u201cAnd I thought what about all the creepy-crawlies? And came up with a figure of one a day. And then I got interested in the tropical forests because they contain more species and are being depleted faster,\u201d he told me. He returned to Britain, and to British citizenship, in the early 1980s, settled in Headington and continued to introduce \u2013 increasingly with colleagues \u2013 new thinking about conservation and development. He identified, for instance, the conservation opportunity of the \u201cbiodiversity hotspot\u201d arguing that perhaps one third of all the planet\u2019s living things were to be found in 25 \u201chotspots\u201d that added up to just 1.4% of the Earth\u2019s land surface. He pushed for clearer understanding of the economic value of wild things and their genetic value as sources of new pharmaceuticals, natural pesticides and foods, and he challenged the perverse role of government subsidies that damaged both the environment and the economy. He was an enthusiastic marathon runner, and once held \u2013 briefly \u2013 the record for running to the summit of Kilimanjaro and down again, a distance of 36 miles and a climb of more than 13,000ft, in 13 hours and 20 minutes. He liked to take Cicero and Virgil in Latin on safari, and enjoyed Racine, Balzac, Proust and Goethe in French and German. In 1965 he married Dorothy Halliman. They separated in 1993 and divorced in 2012. He is survived by their two daughters, Malindi and Mara, and two grandchildren, Juliette and Alexander. \u2022 Norman Myers, environmentalist, born 24 August 1934; died 20 October 2019",

I\u2019d be a really rich guy.\u201d</p> <p>Preach. Thing about Don Jr, though, is he\u2019s got way too much integrity to do that. He\u2019s not about taking leg-ups, selling out, sucking globalist dick and playing to stadium crowds \u2013 he\u2019s about the small venues. He\u2019s about what got him into this gig in the first place. Which is to say: he\u2019s about the music.</p> <p>And so to the US president\u2019s son\u2019s review and promotion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/25/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-new-album\" title=\"K\">Kanye West\u2019s new album</a> \u2013 one of those sentences that would have been inconceivable to type four years ago, but which now is one of the more normal occurrences in any given news cycle. And yes, this column will feature a separate item about Lindsay Lohan\u2019s \u201cplatonic and respectful\u201d friendship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p> <p>But for now, we hold our focus on Don Jr, who has a huge amount of time for Kanye. And why wouldn\u2019t he, given Kanye is a dedicated supporter of his father\u2019s presidency? Last year, Kanye used an entertainment show appearance to wear a Maga hat and suggest that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/kanye-west-on-slavery-for-400-years-that-sounds-like-a-choice\" title=\"s\">slavery was \u201ca choice\u201d</a>. He has since rowed a little way back on that one, apologising for the way some people felt about it, although not for the comments themselves. But as he said of President Trump: \u201cI feel that he cares about the way black people feel about him, and he would like for black people to like him like they did when he was cool in the rap songs and all this.\u201d You know, THAT time.</p> <p>But Kanye\u2019s still wearing the Maga hats and vocally supporting Trump. And he has a new album out, entitled Jesus Is King, which has a pronounced Christian bent. Unfortunately, this latest creative offering has received something of a tepid response from the critics.</p> <p>Or, I should say, from most critics. Because it takes a strong guy of true integrity to stand alone, and that guy is Don Trump Jr. As the president\u2019s son wrote of the opus: \u201cKanye West is cracking the cultural code.\u201d Wow. I don\u2019t know what it means, but it genuinely sounds exactly like a lot of music criticism. Maybe we\u2019ve found the one thing Don Jr can do? I don\u2019t know a whole lot about the industry standard, but I do know he already reads like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/13/the-awfully-big-adventure-michael-jackson-paul-morley-review\" title=\"P\">Paul Morley</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, Don, go on. \u201cKanye West\u2019s new album, Jesus is King, is the epitome of fearless creativity,\u201d Little Trump continued, \u201cand \u2018dangerous, unapproved\u2019 ideas.\u201d Crikey. Are those quotation marks around \u201cdangerous, unapproved\u201d intended to denote a certain irony? I certainly took them as heavily sarcastic, to the point of having to make the airquote gesture while I was reading.</p> <p>But closer analysis of Don\u2019s writing style suggests he reaches for random quotation marks like his daddy reaches for random capital letters, or random pussies. So we\u2019ll have to take Don at his word: namely, that an embrace of Christianity is \u201cdangerous, unapproved\u201d in America \u2013 even if it is a country the rest of the world mostly views as comically, auto-parodically God-bothering. So much so that Donald Trump \u2013 DONALD TRUMP \u2013 has to pretend to be religious to be president of it.</p> <p>\u201cLeftists always try to silence those who are speaking truth,\u201d Don Jr continues about Kanye West, a man famously stifled by the oxygen of publicity. Languishing in the obscurity of multiple media platform appearances and marriage to cultural unknown Kim Kardashian, West must somehow fight the system that battles daily \u2013 hourly \u2013 to censor and withhold recognition from him. Anyway, back to these leftists. \u201cThey\u2019re waging a war on our family and our culture,\u201d Don concludes. \u201cKanye is a pioneer.\u201d</p> <p>So there you go. Not only is Don Jr the most groundbreaking and important music critic since Lester Bangs, he is the very best son since Jesus \u2013 who did, let\u2019s face it, kind of benefit from nepotism himself.</p> <h2>Lohan invades the Middle East again <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"163961ab8e363a248c04553759b802eb53cde203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/163961ab8e363a248c04553759b802eb53cde203/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Respectful friendship \u2026 Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Lindsay Lohan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Respectful friendship \u2026 Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Lindsay Lohan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Mandel Ngan/Pool via REUTERS; Stephen Lovekin/WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The number of nations to which Lindsay Lohan has added to the gaiety thereof continues to grow.

Inaccurately. Still, maybe we seek out qualities in our friends that we ourselves lack. For instance, Lindsay Lohan has done community service in a morgue. And Prince Mohammed definitely should have. Meanwhile, he has imprisoned members of his own family. And Lohan must have wished she could have. Looked at that way, it makes total sense \u2013 so what\u2019s not to adore about this unlikely buddydom?",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhat do you call a boy who doesn\u2019t play sport?\u201d</p> <p>I asked this question of Australian public and private school students during a series of anti-bullying workshops I ran in 2007. The answer was always the same: \u201closer\u201d or \u201chopeless\u201d. The teachers who sat in on the workshops were routinely shocked. After a while, I wasn\u2019t. Though sport was considered optional for Australian girls, boys who opted out were considered suspect. The next 15 minutes of the workshop were planned around that response. If I didn\u2019t get it, I\u2019d be stuck for what to do. That never happened.</p> <p>Approximately one-third of Australian students experience bullying in schools. It\u2019s an experience often shrugged off by teachers, and even parents, as an unpleasant rite of passage: kids being kids. The bestselling YA author and school principal John Marsden <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/religion/john-marsden-on-bullying-is-infuriating-and-dangerous/11346770\">made headlines earlier this year</a> when he wrote, in his book The Art of Growing Up, that most \u201cchildren who are allegedly being bullied are children with poor behaviours who are being offered feedback by the other kids\u201d. In interviews about the book, he characterised that feedback as a response to \u201cunlikeable\u201d behaviours.</p> <p>But think about the kind of \u201cfeedback\u201d provided by the students in my workshops. Is it fair to call a boy a loser because he doesn\u2019t play sport? Is that a statement we should be encouraging kids to listen to \u2013 or enable them to act on? Based on my experience running these discussions, what students call \u201cunlikeable\u201d is often simply what\u2019s different to them, or considered weaker, or somehow outside the rules of the teenage tribe. Oft-cited reasons for being bullied include coming from a different country, culture or religion, or being \u201cvery intelligent\u201d. Other triggers for bullying include having a disability, being conventionally unattractive, or even being conventionally <em>very</em> attractive. All things that the bullied student has little to no control over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/23/john-marsden-on-the-toxic-parenting-pandemic-ive-never-seen-this-level-of-anxiety\">John Marsden on the 'toxic' parenting pandemic: 'I\u2019ve never seen this level of anxiety'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because bullying isn\u2019t about providing \u201cfeedback\u201d. It\u2019s about power.</p> <p>When I wrote The Devil Made Me Do It, a play performed in high schools as an integral part of my workshops, I deliberately chose the most extreme bullying for dramatic effect. This included one student being punched, choked and routinely terrorised, and a young girl driven to suicide by the words bullies had put in her head. I thought I was exaggerating the scenarios, but the kids I was performing for told me how \u201creal\u201d it was; that it was \u201cjust like the playground\u201d. It was then that I decided to develop the play into a novel for teenagers like the ones I was talking to.</p> <p>In Otherwise Known as Pig, protagonist Morgan \u2013 used as the \u201cpunching bag\u201d for school bullies \u2013 is hospitalised more than once. Sociopath Chris, one of those bullies, terrorises students with a knife and a cigarette lighter. School staff are either ready to assume Morgan\u2019s injuries are his own fault, or are unable to help, as no student will support Morgan\u2019s version of events and others collude to frame him. While the combination of these events was fictional, each individual case of bullying in the book has a real-life counterpart.</p> <p>As I wrote the novel, I researched bullying in Australian schools in earnest, looking for examples of how it happens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4b4e7aa62f9932259f7a4ee48f5e41802950ba3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b4e7aa62f9932259f7a4ee48f5e41802950ba3c/0_0_198_298/198.jpg\" alt=\"Otherwise Known as Pig; a YA book about school bullying by Australian author Catch Tilly\" width=\"198\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Otherwise Known as Pig; a YA book about school bullying by Australian author Catch Tilly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wakefield Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I read about a boy who was held down and punched 17 times in the head. About a girl who was brutally attacked while onlookers laughed and filmed her pain. About a school that had set up a fight club. Stories I was personally told included a broken arm, an attempted sodomy with an umbrella, and watching the schoolyard alpha male trip a girl and send her crashing into a plate-glass window, with no ramifications.</p> <p>When you tell a child that they are being repeatedly attacked (for that\u2019s what bullying is: systematic, repeated targeting by someone with more power than their victim) because of their \u201cpoor behaviours\u201d, your voice has joined the voice of the bullies. Bullying is abuse, as clearly as domestic violence or rape. And to blame the victim is to support the abuse.</p> <p>And like these other forms of abuse, bullying is often linked to shame. Not always, but often, bullies are acting out of their own pain: warding off their own feelings of inadequacy or vulnerability by pre-emptively lashing out at someone who\u2019s weaker than they are. Of course, that doesn\u2019t excuse it. A bully needs to be told, \u201cI understand that you\u2019re feeling terrible. But this is not an okay way to deal with it.\u201d When someone believes they have the right to take out what they\u2019re feeling on someone else, they\u2019re likely to become a bully when anything goes wrong for them. We have to address that mindset.</p> <p>So how do we support the victims of bullying? Schools can actively work to create an anti-bullying culture. This should start with information about bullying presented to staff and students, and includes zero tolerance (from the top down), well-trained counsellors, supported peer mediation and safe places where students can seek refuge from the playground (for example, keeping the school library open during breaks). Parents can make space for kids to talk to them, and be ready to get involved. And we all need to acknowledge that bullying <em>happens</em>: that it\u2019s not a figment of these kids\u2019 imaginations.</p> <p>In fact, the first and most important thing we can do is to listen. We need to tell the victims of bullying: it\u2019s not your fault. You are not the only one. You will find your people. And while you look for your tribe, there are people out there who will listen and can help.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Otherwise Known as Pig by Catch Tilly is out now through Wakefield Press</em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: <a href=\"http://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> 13 11 14; <a href=\"http://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/\">Suicide Call Back Service</a> 1300 659 467; <a href=\"http://www.kidshelp.com.au/\">Kids Helpline</a> 1800 55 1800; <a href=\"http://www.mensline.org.au/\">MensLine Australia</a> 1300 78 99 78; <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\">Beyond Blue</a> 1300 22 4636</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat do you call a boy who doesn\u2019t play sport?\u201d I asked this question of Australian public and private school students during a series of anti-bullying workshops I ran in 2007. The answer was always the same: \u201closer\u201d or \u201chopeless\u201d. The teachers who sat in on the workshops were routinely shocked. After a while, I wasn\u2019t. Though sport was considered optional for Australian girls, boys who opted out were considered suspect. The next 15 minutes of the workshop were planned around that response. If I didn\u2019t get it, I\u2019d be stuck for what to do. That never happened. Approximately one-third of Australian students experience bullying in schools. It\u2019s an experience often shrugged off by teachers, and even parents, as an unpleasant rite of passage: kids being kids. The bestselling YA author and school principal John Marsden made headlines earlier this year when he wrote, in his book The Art of Growing Up, that most \u201cchildren who are allegedly being bullied are children with poor behaviours who are being offered feedback by the other kids\u201d. In interviews about the book, he characterised that feedback as a response to \u201cunlikeable\u201d behaviours. But think about the kind of \u201cfeedback\u201d provided by the students in my workshops. Is it fair to call a boy a loser because he doesn\u2019t play sport? Is that a statement we should be encouraging kids to listen to \u2013 or enable them to act on? Based on my experience running these discussions, what students call \u201cunlikeable\u201d is often simply what\u2019s different to them, or considered weaker, or somehow outside the rules of the teenage tribe. Oft-cited reasons for being bullied include coming from a different country, culture or religion, or being \u201cvery intelligent\u201d. Other triggers for bullying include having a disability, being conventionally unattractive, or even being conventionally very attractive. All things that the bullied student has little to no control over. Because bullying isn\u2019t about providing \u201cfeedback\u201d. It\u2019s about power. When I wrote The Devil Made Me Do It, a play performed in high schools as an integral part of my workshops, I deliberately chose the most extreme bullying for dramatic effect. This included one student being punched, choked and routinely terrorised, and a young girl driven to suicide by the words bullies had put in her head. I thought I was exaggerating the scenarios, but the kids I was performing for told me how \u201creal\u201d it was; that it was \u201cjust like the playground\u201d. It was then that I decided to develop the play into a novel for teenagers like the ones I was talking to. In Otherwise Known as Pig, protagonist Morgan \u2013 used as the \u201cpunching bag\u201d for school bullies \u2013 is hospitalised more than once. Sociopath Chris, one of those bullies, terrorises students with a knife and a cigarette lighter. School staff are either ready to assume Morgan\u2019s injuries are his own fault, or are unable to help, as no student will support Morgan\u2019s version of events and others collude to frame him. While the combination of these events was fictional, each individual case of bullying in the book has a real-life counterpart. As I wrote the novel, I researched bullying in Australian schools in earnest, looking for examples of how it happens. I read about a boy who was held down and punched 17 times in the head. About a girl who was brutally attacked while onlookers laughed and filmed her pain. About a school that had set up a fight club. Stories I was personally told included a broken arm, an attempted sodomy with an umbrella, and watching the schoolyard alpha male trip a girl and send her crashing into a plate-glass window, with no ramifications. When you tell a child that they are being repeatedly attacked (for that\u2019s what bullying is: systematic, repeated targeting by someone with more power than their victim) because of their \u201cpoor behaviours\u201d, your voice has joined the voice of the bullies. Bullying is abuse, as clearly as domestic violence or rape. And to blame the victim is to support the abuse. And like these other forms of abuse, bullying is often linked to shame. Not always, but often, bullies are acting out of their own pain: warding off their own feelings of inadequacy or vulnerability by pre-emptively lashing out at someone who\u2019s weaker than they are. Of course, that doesn\u2019t excuse it. A bully needs to be told, \u201cI understand that you\u2019re feeling terrible. But this is not an okay way to deal with it.\u201d When someone believes they have the right to take out what they\u2019re feeling on someone else, they\u2019re likely to become a bully when anything goes wrong for them. We have to address that mindset. So how do we support the victims of bullying? Schools can actively work to create an anti-bullying culture. This should start with information about bullying presented to staff and students, and includes zero tolerance (from the top down), well-trained counsellors, supported peer mediation and safe places where students can seek refuge from the playground (for example, keeping the school library open during breaks). Parents can make space for kids to talk to them, and be ready to get involved. And we all need to acknowledge that bullying happens: that it\u2019s not a figment of these kids\u2019 imaginations. In fact, the first and most important thing we can do is to listen. We need to tell the victims of bullying: it\u2019s not your fault. You are not the only one. You will find your people. And while you look for your tribe, there are people out there who will listen and can help. \u2022 Otherwise Known as Pig by Catch Tilly is out now through Wakefield Press \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

      "bodyText": "Detained Australian writer Dr Yang Hengjun has insisted he is innocent of the espionage allegations made against him and told Chinese authorities he has never been a spy for any government. But his isolated incarceration in Beijing \u2013 potentially facing the death penalty \u2013 remains indeterminate. Yang, a former diplomat turned globally influential blogger and advocate for democracy, was arrested when he arrived in China on 18 January this year. He is being detained by the Ministry of State Security, charged with one count of espionage. There is no indication when, if at all, he will face court. An Australian citizen, he has not been allowed access to his lawyers or to see family members. Yang has not been given any letters written to him by family, nor allowed to write to them. He has been shown photographs of his family, but was not allowed to keep them. However, his interrogations have been reduced to once a month, and he no longer has his hands and feet shackled in irons during questioning. Sources have confirmed to the Guardian that Yang\u2019s only interrogation this month began at midnight, and lasted for two-and-a-half hours. Yang was not restrained for this interrogation but reported the lines of questioning were often unrelated to the allegations against him, and, in some cases, \u201cabsurd\u201d. Sources have also confirmed Yang\u2019s health has deteriorated over the past month. He suffers from high blood pressure and several other serious health conditions which are being monitored and medicated but have worsened significantly in detention. He is allowed to shower once a week, and has access to a small enclosure outside his cell \u2013 with access to fresh air and natural light \u2013 for one hour, twice a day. In detention, Yang has continued to maintain his innocence but has said he suspects someone in the investigation team is trying to frame him for espionage and is seeking to incriminate him. He has told interrogators he has never been a spy for any government or any organisation. Chinese-born Yang has said he was an \u201cordinary public servant\u201d for the Chinese government, serving in the ministry of foreign affairs for a decade until 1997, when he moved to the US to work as an independent researcher. Since then, he has not been involved with any government anywhere in the world. Yang said he believed in the rule of law in China, although he was losing confidence in this. He said he has felt threatened at times, but did not elaborate on the nature of these threats. The Guardian understands none of Yang, his legal team, or the Australian embassy have been told the specific charges against him, or presented with any evidence of his alleged offending. The Criminal Law of the PRC details punishment for espionage and endangering national security. Collusion with foreign states to harm China\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty or security attracts a prison term of at least 10 years. \u201cState organ personnel\u201d, such as diplomats, who defect and endanger national security can be jailed for between five and 10 years. But crimes that endanger national security, that have caused \u201cparticularly serious harm to the country and the people\u201d, and where \u201cthe circumstances are particularly vile\u201d, can attract the death penalty. Yang was formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, before working in the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to Australia, then to the USA. A writer of spy novels, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in China for more than a decade. He was known online as a \u201cdemocracy-peddler\u201d, and regarded around the world as an authoritative and influential political commentator on China. Yang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, had been living in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University, before flying to Guangzhou with his family in January. His wife and child were able to enter China, but authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention. He was initially held under a system known as \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, a type of secret detention of up to six months in which authorities can deny a suspect access to lawyers and to family, and restrict external communication. In July, Yang was moved to a Beijing detention centre in the lead-up to being charged. He is allowed one half-hour consular visit a month. The Guardian understands Yang\u2019s case remains in the investigation period, which could last until March of next year. The Australian government has repeatedly pressed China that Yang be treated in accordance with international human rights law, \u201cwith special attention to those provisions that prohibit torture and inhumane treatment, guard against arbitrary detention and that protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\u201d. In a speech this week, the Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said: \u201cI will continue to advocate strongly for fair and transparent treatment\u201d for Yang. Yang\u2019s former doctoral supervisor in Australia, Dr Feng Chongyi, said there appeared to be no evidence Yang has ever been engaged in espionage, and that the charges against him were politically motivated. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the speech by the foreign minister. I still hope that the Chinese authorities make the commonsense decision and release Yang because there is no evidence to support any sensible charge against him.\u201d Feng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology, Sydney, told the Guardian: \u201cHe\u2019s no longer shackled, and the number of interrogations has reduced, I would say this is due to international attention, including pressure from the Australian government\u201d. In August, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, said Yang\u2019s arrest had been handled in accordance with Chinese law and that the Australian citizen was in good health. Geng also warned Australia against \u201cinterference\u201d in the case. \u201cChina deplores the Australian statement on this case \u2026 the Australian side should earnestly respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty and must not ... interfere with a Chinese case,\u201d he said.",

In the latest report to estimate the role fossil fuel businesses play in driving the climate crisis, researchers from the University of New South Wales calculated the total emissions from the coal and gas produced by Australia\u2019s top carbon companies, from extraction to the resources being burned for energy, mostly overseas. They found the top six coal producers \u2013 BHP Billiton, Glencore, Yancoal, Peabody, Anglo American and Whitehaven \u2013 were in 2018 linked to 551m tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.

The UNSW report follows the Guardian\u2019s global series The Polluters, which revealed 20 fossil fuel companies including BHP could be directly linked to more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era. In Australia, it found a wave of planned developments by major fossil fuel companies across the north would significantly increase the amount of coal and gas the country planned to sell into Asia and could push the Paris climate agreement goals further beyond reach. The report\u2019s lead author, Jeremy Moss from the UNSW Practical Justice Initiative and a professor of political philosophy, said there was a clear case that big emitting companies, which the report calls \u201ccarbon majors\u201d, should be held responsible for the consequences of their products. Global greenhouse accounting emphasises national emissions, rather than those connected to companies. There are no plans for that to change. But there is an increasing focus within companies in reporting and considering how to deal with \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions, including those that are released by a company\u2019s customers when using their products.

This being the Phoenix family, her concept of disappearing didn\u2019t involve just hiding out in her bedroom for the next few years. Instead Rain, then barely in her 20s, went on tour as a backing singer with some of River\u2019s musical friends. These friends happened to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/09/red-hot-chili-peppers-review-hydro-glasgow\">Red Hot Chil</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/09/red-hot-chili-peppers-review-hydro-glasgow\">i Peppers </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/03/rem-rout-of-time-at-25-voice-of-generation-michael-stipe\">REM</a>. The latter were touring their album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/04/popandrock.shopping24\">Monster</a>, which they dedicated to River.</p> <p>She also, tentatively, began to go through the archive of Aleka\u2019s Attic, her brother\u2019s band, which she had joined at 16. When she got back to Los Angeles after touring, she moved into the guesthouse of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/25/the-untold-story-of-lost-star-river-phoenix-25-years-after-his-death\">some other friends of River\u2019s</a>, actors Catherine Keener and Dermot Mulroney, and spent 1996 and 97 mixing all of her brother\u2019s unmixed songs. \u201cAnd that,\u201d she says, \u201cwas hugely healing \u2013 just spending that time listening to my brother.

Or, to put it another way, why now? She is speaking by phone from LA and there is silence at the end of the line.

I respect how I processed it, and I believe that grief, being its own wild animal, does not choose a finite amount of time for us to process it.

Specific questions about her childhood are met with a short: \u201cI don\u2019t see what that has to do with the album.\u201d When I ask about her father, who died recently, she interrupts, saying she will respect his lifelong wish for privacy and not discuss him. Queries about how her family coped after the death of River are met with similarly short shrift: \u201cI will not answer for them.\u201d She doesn\u2019t come across as rude; instead, there is a pleasingly no-nonsense attitude to her that is both charmingly naive and impressively self-assured. When I ask if she has children, Rain simply says: \u201cI\u2019m a very devoted aunt, but I feel like I was put on this Earth for things other than motherhood.\u201d</p> <p>With deep-set eyes and dark colouring, Rain looks strikingly like her youngest brother, Joaquin, as opposed to the blond, angelic River. But as the two eldest of the five siblings, she and River were in many ways closest to one another. As soon as she says this, she adds: \u201cWe were all close. There was a lot of laughter in our group. Laughing. That\u2019s what I think of when I think of us as children.\u201d</p> <p>The Phoenix kids had a notoriously unconventional childhood. In 1972, their parents, John and Heart, joined the Children of God, which they believed was a Christian missionary group, and the family travelled around South America spreading its word. By 1976, however, she says they had realised the Children of God was actually a cult. \u201cMy parents stole away into the night with $100 and found a cargo ship that would take us to Florida,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was decades later that we learned just how disturbing the organisation had progressively grown to be.

Whatever has been said about their unorthodox background, the family remain extremely close: all her siblings and her mother came to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/rain-phoenix-solo-album-songs-river-phoenix-1203357546/\">the small concert</a> she recently gave to launch her album, with Joaquin, fresh from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/joker\">Joker</a> premiere, loudly cheering her from the audience. Singing River\u2019s lyrics in front of her family was, she says, \u201cwonderful\u201d.</p> <p>River became extraordinarily famous extraordinarily young, but the entertainment business, with its interest in commerce over creativity, was completely at odds with the free-spirited world he grew up in. \u201cThere is a part of River that I carry in me, this extreme left-of-centre rebelliousness, thinking outside the box, doing whatever you have to do to let your soul speak.\u201d When the media snarked about Aleka\u2019s Attic back in the 1990s, Rain was aware of the \u201cpoo-pooing\u201d but says River was \u201cunapologetic, and that has been the guiding light of my career\u201d.</p> <p>As well as his talent and beauty, River was famous for seizing any opportunity to discuss vegetarianism and the environment with often bemused entertainment reporters. It is not hard to draw a line from the evangelising he did as a child on behalf of his parents and the cult, and the activism he took on as an adult. Last year, I interviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/25/the-untold-story-of-lost-star-river-phoenix-25-years-after-his-death\">Samantha Mathis</a>, River\u2019s girlfriend at the time of his death, who was also with him when he died.

      "bodyText": "After Rain Phoenix\u2019s brother River died in front of her in 1993, having overdosed on Sunset Boulevard as she and their younger brother Joaquin looked on helplessly, she disappeared into the shadows. This being the Phoenix family, her concept of disappearing didn\u2019t involve just hiding out in her bedroom for the next few years. Instead Rain, then barely in her 20s, went on tour as a backing singer with some of River\u2019s musical friends. These friends happened to be the Red Hot Chili Peppers and REM. The latter were touring their album Monster, which they dedicated to River. She also, tentatively, began to go through the archive of Aleka\u2019s Attic, her brother\u2019s band, which she had joined at 16. When she got back to Los Angeles after touring, she moved into the guesthouse of some other friends of River\u2019s, actors Catherine Keener and Dermot Mulroney, and spent 1996 and 97 mixing all of her brother\u2019s unmixed songs. \u201cAnd that,\u201d she says, \u201cwas hugely healing \u2013 just spending that time listening to my brother. After I finished, I didn\u2019t feel the need to release the music. It was enough.\u201d That was two decades ago and things have changed. \u201cI\u2019m an adult now.

      "body": "<p>Even Dickens did not describe harder toil. Life for the child of a tenant farmer who works the tobacco fields of Malawi is unimaginably arduous: up at 4am for several hours of labour with no breakfast, cutting into the earth with a heavy hoe.</p> <p>School \u2013 if they go to school \u2013 is a brief respite. The first and often only meal of the day, maize porridge, is eaten when they get home, before more digging. Sleep is on the bare earth under a straw roof.</p> <p>Now, however, British American Tobacco is facing a watershed legal action on behalf of potentially hundreds of these children and their families. Human rights lawyers Leigh Day argue that the company is getting rich while the children and their parents who do this backbreaking work are trapped in grinding poverty, which they say amounts to \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d.</p> <p>BAT says it tells farmers not to make their children work. The lawyers say they have no choice. Most children are deprived of an education, which should be a path out, because their families struggle to afford even the small fees, exercise books and uniforms required.</p> <p>\u201cTobacco growing, manufacture and distribution is simply incompatible with the wellbeing of a child,\u201d said Dr Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the secretariat of the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a key body tackling an industry that kills more than 7 million people a year.</p> <p>\u201cUsing children as workforce in any industry defeats the global fight against child labour. In the case of tobacco, children have a particularly heavy burden to carry.</p> <p>\u201cNot only do such practices hinder their ability to access education and develop in dignity, but they also expose them to what are known to be hazardous substances, such as pesticides used in tobacco crops and nicotine from tobacco leaves.\u201d</p> <p>And the gruelling life in Malawi is not what these parents hope for their children.</p> <p>Junio, 36, knows that his family deserves better. </p> <p>He explains he doesn\u2019t want his children to work, but that they cannot manage without them. Three acres requires the labour of four adults. He and his wife Agnes, 30, are two. The maths isn\u2019t hard: four of their five children are expected to help in the ways they can \u2013 Chisomo, 14, Malita, 11, Jonasi, nine, and Alinafe, seven. Only baby Gloria escapes \u2013 for now.</p> <p>Many of these tenant farming families are from Phalombe, the poorest region in the south, and travel north hoping to earn a lump sum that will allow them to set themselves up back home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"116e580652ab3fbc8948e9d0c6353719b9887f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/116e580652ab3fbc8948e9d0c6353719b9887f23/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tenant farmer's hut\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl beside her straw home, which offers little protection during the rains</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI intend to go back if I can get enough money and build a good house and sell second-hand clothes,\u201d says Junio. \u201cAnd not suffer in life.\u201d This is their third year. The dream is receding.</p> <p>\u201cWe are failing to support our children in terms of school because of money,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Inside the hut is an empty space of bare earth, around two metres square, with a straw roof that will not even begin to keep out the torrential rains when they come. Over a piece of cord dangle a few old clothes. </p> <p>Junio unfolds the monthly 50kg bag of maize (40kg after milling) that families are given.</p> <p>It is more than half empty with more than two weeks to go. That is all the families have to eat \u2013 maize porridge, called <em>nsima</em>, cooked once in the middle of the day with leftovers for supper. They pick a green herb that grows wild to make a scant \u201crelish\u201d for it. In the corner of the hut is a hen. Any eggs will be sold. </p> <p>The primary schools depend on what they call the development fee of 500 kwacha (50p) per term per pupil to pay for local \u201cvolunteer\u201d teachers.</p> <p>On this day, however, all the children are at home as volunteers are not working because they haven\u2019t been paid. </p> <p>Usually there are 150 pupils in a class. On the blackboard in an empty classroom are formal phrases in English. \u201cWriting sentences in the simple future tense,\u201d runs an instruction in chalk.

      "bodyText": "Even Dickens did not describe harder toil. Life for the child of a tenant farmer who works the tobacco fields of Malawi is unimaginably arduous: up at 4am for several hours of labour with no breakfast, cutting into the earth with a heavy hoe. School \u2013 if they go to school \u2013 is a brief respite. The first and often only meal of the day, maize porridge, is eaten when they get home, before more digging. Sleep is on the bare earth under a straw roof. Now, however, British American Tobacco is facing a watershed legal action on behalf of potentially hundreds of these children and their families. Human rights lawyers Leigh Day argue that the company is getting rich while the children and their parents who do this backbreaking work are trapped in grinding poverty, which they say amounts to \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d. BAT says it tells farmers not to make their children work. The lawyers say they have no choice. Most children are deprived of an education, which should be a path out, because their families struggle to afford even the small fees, exercise books and uniforms required. \u201cTobacco growing, manufacture and distribution is simply incompatible with the wellbeing of a child,\u201d said Dr Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the secretariat of the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a key body tackling an industry that kills more than 7 million people a year. \u201cUsing children as workforce in any industry defeats the global fight against child labour. In the case of tobacco, children have a particularly heavy burden to carry. \u201cNot only do such practices hinder their ability to access education and develop in dignity, but they also expose them to what are known to be hazardous substances, such as pesticides used in tobacco crops and nicotine from tobacco leaves.\u201d And the gruelling life in Malawi is not what these parents hope for their children. Junio, 36, knows that his family deserves better. He explains he doesn\u2019t want his children to work, but that they cannot manage without them. Three acres requires the labour of four adults. He and his wife Agnes, 30, are two. The maths isn\u2019t hard: four of their five children are expected to help in the ways they can \u2013 Chisomo, 14, Malita, 11, Jonasi, nine, and Alinafe, seven. Only baby Gloria escapes \u2013 for now. Many of these tenant farming families are from Phalombe, the poorest region in the south, and travel north hoping to earn a lump sum that will allow them to set themselves up back home. \u201cI intend to go back if I can get enough money and build a good house and sell second-hand clothes,\u201d says Junio. \u201cAnd not suffer in life.\u201d This is their third year. The dream is receding. \u201cWe are failing to support our children in terms of school because of money,\u201d he says. Inside the hut is an empty space of bare earth, around two metres square, with a straw roof that will not even begin to keep out the torrential rains when they come. Over a piece of cord dangle a few old clothes. Junio unfolds the monthly 50kg bag of maize (40kg after milling) that families are given. It is more than half empty with more than two weeks to go. That is all the families have to eat \u2013 maize porridge, called nsima, cooked once in the middle of the day with leftovers for supper. They pick a green herb that grows wild to make a scant \u201crelish\u201d for it. In the corner of the hut is a hen. Any eggs will be sold. The primary schools depend on what they call the development fee of 500 kwacha (50p) per term per pupil to pay for local \u201cvolunteer\u201d teachers. On this day, however, all the children are at home as volunteers are not working because they haven\u2019t been paid. Usually there are 150 pupils in a class. On the blackboard in an empty classroom are formal phrases in English. \u201cWriting sentences in the simple future tense,\u201d runs an instruction in chalk. None of the tenant farmer children understands a word. Children must supply their own exercise books and pens. Uniform is compulsory, costing 2,500 kwacha for girls (\u00a32.50) and 1,500 kwacha for boys. At the start of the academic year, schools are being lenient. Later, children will be turned away. Then there are termly fees of 300 kwacha (30p) for exams and 200 (20p) for report cards. They sound like tiny sums but have to be borrowed, and repaid out of an income of maybe \u00a3200 for the entire year. Junio\u2019s eldest boy, Chisomo, was sick last Friday, he said. Illness can rack up crippling loans. But they didn\u2019t borrow money for transport. Instead they walked to the health centre, leaving at 4am and arriving at 6.45am. Chisomo was refusing to eat and vomiting. When they finally saw a nurse, they were told he had a cough and given an antibiotic and a painkiller. And then they walked home again. Malita, his 11-year-old sister, says English is her favourite subject at school, and that she would like to be a teacher. But she doesn\u2019t say it with conviction. Some of her friends also say they\u2019d like to be a teacher or a nurse, adding, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it is possible.\u201d Silika, 41, from the eastern region of Malawi, with the help of his wife and four children, made 180,000 kwacha (\u00a3180) last season. But it is not enough to go home. After deductions, he received 140,000 (\u00a3140). At this time of year, they need to build or replace tobacco drying stands, made of large branches.

Leigh Day says it anticipates the number of child labourer claimants to rise as high as 15,000. While BAT claims it has told farmers not to use their children as unpaid labour, the lawyers say the families cannot afford to work their fields otherwise, because they receive so little money for their crop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/31/the-children-labouring-in-malawi-fields-for-british-american-tobacco\">The children labouring in Malawi's fields for British American Tobacco</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The case, potentially one of the biggest that human rights lawyers have ever brought, could transform the lives of children in poor countries who are forced to work to survive not only in tobacco but also in other industries such as the garment trade.</p> <p>It follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/revealed-child-labor-rampant-in-tobacco-industry\">exposure of the scale and brutal reality</a> of child labour in the tobacco fields by the Guardian last year, which Martyn Day, a founding partner and head of the firm, said had provoked them to act. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the Guardian, this case would not be happening,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Day added: \u201cIt is totally depressing that one of the largest companies in the world, and certainly one of the largest British companies, is involved in an area where the employment of children is such a fundamental part of what happens. It has been going on for decades, and as a result of all of that the farmers of Malawi are caught in a groundhog day, where one generation after another is having to farm tobacco and is caught in a poverty trap.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the families are from Phalombe, one of the poorest regions in the south of the country. They are recruited to tobacco farms in the north with the promise of food, accommodation and a lump sum in cash for their crop. Their accommodation is a straw hut they must build themselves; the food is a monthly sack of maize, which is insufficient to feed the family and which is stopped before their tenancy ends. The lump sum they are paid at the end of the season dwindles often to less than half what is offered after deductions for tools and loans that the families have to take out to pay for essentials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50565d11716ab03b154de7b8f3c7db8f6f171f34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50565d11716ab03b154de7b8f3c7db8f6f171f34/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in a tobacco farming region\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to the letter of claim, last season most of the claimants earned no more than \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 for 10 months\u2019 work for a family of five.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the letter of claim, seen by the Guardian, last season most claimants earned no more than \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 for 10 months\u2019 work for a family of five. Their lawyers say the work amounts to forced or bonded labour because they are misled when recruited, are afraid to leave and quickly get into debt. </p> <p>Children as young as three are involved in tobacco farming, the letter of claim says, often during harvest when the work can be especially hazardous. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic pesticides, fertiliser and green tobacco sickness, from nicotine absorption while handling the leaves. Symptoms include breathing difficulties, cramps and vomiting.</p> <p>Some children go to school, as the law requires, but often only sporadically. Almost all work from sunrise in the fields before school and then when they get home, as well as through the weekend. At harvest time, classrooms empty.</p> <p>BAT is one of the most profitable companies in the world, making an operating profit last year of \u00a39.3bn on sales of \u00a324.5bn. Like other big tobacco companies, it has distanced itself from the farmers by commissioning a separate company to buy a stipulated amount of tobacco leaf each year. Alliance One signs contracts with land-owning farmers in Malawi, who then recruit tenant farmer families to work the fields.</p> <p>The lawyers, who have sent BAT the letter of claim and say they expect to issue proceedings this year, argue that responsibility for the conditions of the tenant families rests ultimately with BAT, which decides the price it will pay for tobacco leaf. In April, Leigh Day won a watershed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/apr/10/zambians-can-pursue-mining-pollution-claim-in-english-courts\">case against Vedanta</a>, a British mining company, which the supreme court ruled could be held responsible for the actions of its subsidiary in allegedly polluting farmland in Zambia. That case opened the way to hold other British companies responsible for harm caused by the actions of those who work for them overseas.</p> <p>A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million children under the age of 14 working in tobacco around the world.

      "bodyText": "Human rights lawyers are preparing to bring a landmark case against British American Tobacco on behalf of hundreds of children and their families forced by poverty wages to work in conditions of gruelling hard labour in the fields of Malawi. Leigh Day\u2019s lawyers are seeking compensation for more than 350 child labourers and their parents in the high court in London, arguing that the British company is guilty of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d. Leigh Day says it anticipates the number of child labourer claimants to rise as high as 15,000. While BAT claims it has told farmers not to use their children as unpaid labour, the lawyers say the families cannot afford to work their fields otherwise, because they receive so little money for their crop. The case, potentially one of the biggest that human rights lawyers have ever brought, could transform the lives of children in poor countries who are forced to work to survive not only in tobacco but also in other industries such as the garment trade. It follows exposure of the scale and brutal reality of child labour in the tobacco fields by the Guardian last year, which Martyn Day, a founding partner and head of the firm, said had provoked them to act. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the Guardian, this case would not be happening,\u201d he said. Day added: \u201cIt is totally depressing that one of the largest companies in the world, and certainly one of the largest British companies, is involved in an area where the employment of children is such a fundamental part of what happens. It has been going on for decades, and as a result of all of that the farmers of Malawi are caught in a groundhog day, where one generation after another is having to farm tobacco and is caught in a poverty trap.\u201d Many of the families are from Phalombe, one of the poorest regions in the south of the country. They are recruited to tobacco farms in the north with the promise of food, accommodation and a lump sum in cash for their crop. Their accommodation is a straw hut they must build themselves; the food is a monthly sack of maize, which is insufficient to feed the family and which is stopped before their tenancy ends. The lump sum they are paid at the end of the season dwindles often to less than half what is offered after deductions for tools and loans that the families have to take out to pay for essentials. According to the letter of claim, seen by the Guardian, last season most claimants earned no more than \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 for 10 months\u2019 work for a family of five. Their lawyers say the work amounts to forced or bonded labour because they are misled when recruited, are afraid to leave and quickly get into debt. Children as young as three are involved in tobacco farming, the letter of claim says, often during harvest when the work can be especially hazardous. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic pesticides, fertiliser and green tobacco sickness, from nicotine absorption while handling the leaves. Symptoms include breathing difficulties, cramps and vomiting. Some children go to school, as the law requires, but often only sporadically. Almost all work from sunrise in the fields before school and then when they get home, as well as through the weekend. At harvest time, classrooms empty. BAT is one of the most profitable companies in the world, making an operating profit last year of \u00a39.3bn on sales of \u00a324.5bn. Like other big tobacco companies, it has distanced itself from the farmers by commissioning a separate company to buy a stipulated amount of tobacco leaf each year. Alliance One signs contracts with land-owning farmers in Malawi, who then recruit tenant farmer families to work the fields. The lawyers, who have sent BAT the letter of claim and say they expect to issue proceedings this year, argue that responsibility for the conditions of the tenant families rests ultimately with BAT, which decides the price it will pay for tobacco leaf. In April, Leigh Day won a watershed case against Vedanta, a British mining company, which the supreme court ruled could be held responsible for the actions of its subsidiary in allegedly polluting farmland in Zambia. That case opened the way to hold other British companies responsible for harm caused by the actions of those who work for them overseas. A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million children under the age of 14 working in tobacco around the world. In 2017, an International Labour Organisation report said child labour in tobacco was on the increase and \u201crampant\u201d. Day said: \u201cIf we are successful in Malawi, I would very much hope it would persuade BAT and the other tobacco companies that use very similar models to change those models and make sure people are properly compensated for the work and totally discourage children from working so they can go to school.\u201d BAT said in a statement that it took the issue of child labour very seriously and \u201cstrongly agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education\u201d. Simon Cleverly, the group head of corporate affairs, said BAT\u2019s core policies \u201cspecifically state that we do not condone forced, bonded or involuntary labour; and that we do not condone or employ child labour, and seek to ensure that the welfare, health and safety of children are paramount at all times\u201d. He said BAT made it clear to contract farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour and forced and bonded labour would not be tolerated. BAT leaf operations and contracted suppliers were required to participate in the industry-wide sustainable tobacco programme, he said, which was aligned with United Nations standards, including on child labour and income for farm workers. \u201cAs we have received a letter of claim relating to these allegations, it would be inappropriate for us to provide further comment at this time,\u201d Cleverly said. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2019 because an earlier version gave incorrect details of case concerning Vedanta and said it was in the high court. That ruling was in the supreme court.",

      "body": "<p>British politicians are not the only people preparing for the campaign trail; Hollywood\u2019s awards-season schmooze offensive has also begun. Gala ball dates are being added to diaries, academy voters are being targeted and a clutch of frontrunners is emerging. Trends \u2013 most of them worrying \u2013 are also appearing.</p> <p>In summary, this year it is \u201cboy films\u201d v \u201cgirl films\u201d. A gaping gender divide seems to have split the field. On the girls\u2019 side, we have two well-received titles: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/21/bombshell-trailer-fox-news-roger-ailes-drama\" title=\"\">Bombshell</a>, dramatising the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/13/little-women-trailer-first-look-at-greta-gerwigs-starry-adaptation\" title=\"\">Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Little Women</a>. Both are stories of female defiance at the male-dominated status quo, and are cast with an embarrassment of awards-bait: Little Women features Meryl Streep, Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Laura Dern; Bombshell has Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie and Allison Janney.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea9d7f452c27642504c3e23825e1381a96672308\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9d7f452c27642504c3e23825e1381a96672308/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Dern in Little Women.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Dern in Little Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilson Webb/Sony Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lining up against them, we have the \u201cboy films\u201d: Martin Scorsese\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\" title=\"\">The Irishman</a> and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in \u2026 Hollywood are somewhat nostalgic studies of that very same male-dominated status quo, focusing on platonic male relationships at the expense of all others. Despite a combined runtime of more than six hours, neither find much space for female characters. Snapping at their heels are other testosterone-heavy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test\" title=\"\">Bechdel test</a>-failing films, including Sam Mendes\u2019s first world war drama 1917, motor-racing yarn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/10/ford-v-ferrari-review-james-mangold-matt-damon-christian-bale\" title=\"\">Le Mans \u201966</a> (AKA Ford v Ferrari), father-son space odyssey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/22/ad-astra-review-brad-pitt-james-gray\" title=\"\">Ad Astra</a> and Vatican drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/the-two-popes-anthony-hopkins-and-jonathan-pryce-divine-in-papal-faceoff\" title=\"\">The Two Popes</a>.</p> <p>A few individual performances are likely to figure in the acting nominations: Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s Judy, Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers and Tom Hanks in It\u2019s a Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, for example. Otherwise, we could find ourselves in a situation where Little Women and Bombshell dominate the women\u2019s shortlists while The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in \u2026 Hollywood do the same for the men\u2019s, with almost zero crossover. Virtually the only contender to straddle the gender chasm is Noah Baumbach\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/29/marriage-story-review-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson-divorce-comedy-drama-noah-baumbach\" title=\"\">Marriage Story</a> \u2013 which is really a divorce story. In keeping with this year\u2019s theme, it pits the sexes against each other. On one side of the courtroom is Charlie (Adam Driver) and his lawyer (Alan Alda); on the other is Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and hers (Laura Dern). Informed by Baumbach\u2019s own separation from Jennifer Jason Leigh, it arguably favours the husband\u2019s perspective, but Johansson\u2019s performance has also turned heads.</p> <p>Could this bizarre divide be an unintended side-effect of the #MeToo movement? In the past few years, the film industry has, at least superficially, addressed gender inequalities on and off screen. This year, we have seen more stories with overtly female perspectives across the board: comedies (Booksmart, Late Night, The Hustle, Little, What Men Want), crime stories (Hustlers, The Kitchen, Miss Bala), horrors (Midsommar, Ma, Crawl), even superhero movies (Captain Marvel). This femme-friendly realignment could well have provoked some dad-centric counter-programming: tales of gangsters, warfare, cars and spacemen. Or does the gender gap suggest there are a lot of male auteurs out there who can\u2019t or won\u2019t tell women\u2019s stories?</p> <p>Viewed from a different angle, another worrying aspect of this year\u2019s frontrunners becomes evident: the lack of people of colour. Remember #OscarsSoWhite, and how appalled we were by the lack of diversity in the 2016 Oscar nominations? Again, the situation has improved dramatically since. Last year Hollywood was patting itself on the back for recognising films such as BlacKkKlansman, Roma, Black Panther, If Beale Street Could Talk, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and, er, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/25/green-book-oscar-hollywood-race-best-picture-academy-racism\" title=\"\">Green Book</a>. But we are unlikely to see #OscarsSoWoke trending this year. In fact, we are virtually back to square one. All the aforementioned boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 films are overwhelmingly stories about white people. Nor has it been a vintage year for LGBT-themed movies \u2013 Rocketman, anyone? Furthermore, with the exception of Little Women and a co-writer credit on 1917 for Krysty Wilson-Cairns, all these 2019 frontrunners were written and directed by straight, white men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"403af1f0b924d5d40aa7f216f4b4eb7bb6dfa603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/403af1f0b924d5d40aa7f216f4b4eb7bb6dfa603/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in \u2026Hollywood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in \u2026Hollywood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there is another #OscarsSoWhitewash, it will be especially embarrassing for the Academy, which could be good news for more diverse outsiders. Lulu Wang\u2019s Chinese-American family drama The Farewell, for example, benefited from a fresh cultural perspective. Taika Waititi\u2019s anti-Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit won the coveted People\u2019s Choice award at the Toronto film festival, following in the footsteps of Green Book, La La Land and The King\u2019s Speech. It could be this year\u2019s Life Is Beautiful. Similarly, up-to-date teen drama Waves could be this year\u2019s Moonlight, with its lyrical focus on African American family angst (although it was directed by a white guy, Trey Edward Shults), or momentum could gather for performances such as Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Harriet (as in Tubman), Lupita Nyong\u2019o in Us, or Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name.</p> <p>Awards ceremonies used to be glitzy showbiz love-ins, but after the public reckonings of recent years they have become more like anxious end-of-year assessments. Voters and academies are no longer concerned solely with how good the movies are, but also how good their nominations make them look. This year, more than ever, it could be a question of keeping up appearances.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British politicians are not the only people preparing for the campaign trail; Hollywood\u2019s awards-season schmooze offensive has also begun. Gala ball dates are being added to diaries, academy voters are being targeted and a clutch of frontrunners is emerging. Trends \u2013 most of them worrying \u2013 are also appearing. In summary, this year it is \u201cboy films\u201d v \u201cgirl films\u201d. A gaping gender divide seems to have split the field. On the girls\u2019 side, we have two well-received titles: Bombshell, dramatising the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, and Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Little Women. Both are stories of female defiance at the male-dominated status quo, and are cast with an embarrassment of awards-bait: Little Women features Meryl Streep, Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Laura Dern; Bombshell has Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. Lining up against them, we have the \u201cboy films\u201d: Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in \u2026 Hollywood are somewhat nostalgic studies of that very same male-dominated status quo, focusing on platonic male relationships at the expense of all others. Despite a combined runtime of more than six hours, neither find much space for female characters. Snapping at their heels are other testosterone-heavy, Bechdel test-failing films, including Sam Mendes\u2019s first world war drama 1917, motor-racing yarn Le Mans \u201966 (AKA Ford v Ferrari), father-son space odyssey Ad Astra and Vatican drama The Two Popes. A few individual performances are likely to figure in the acting nominations: Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s Judy, Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers and Tom Hanks in It\u2019s a Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, for example. Otherwise, we could find ourselves in a situation where Little Women and Bombshell dominate the women\u2019s shortlists while The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in \u2026 Hollywood do the same for the men\u2019s, with almost zero crossover. Virtually the only contender to straddle the gender chasm is Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story \u2013 which is really a divorce story. In keeping with this year\u2019s theme, it pits the sexes against each other. On one side of the courtroom is Charlie (Adam Driver) and his lawyer (Alan Alda); on the other is Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and hers (Laura Dern). Informed by Baumbach\u2019s own separation from Jennifer Jason Leigh, it arguably favours the husband\u2019s perspective, but Johansson\u2019s performance has also turned heads. Could this bizarre divide be an unintended side-effect of the #MeToo movement? In the past few years, the film industry has, at least superficially, addressed gender inequalities on and off screen. This year, we have seen more stories with overtly female perspectives across the board: comedies (Booksmart, Late Night, The Hustle, Little, What Men Want), crime stories (Hustlers, The Kitchen, Miss Bala), horrors (Midsommar, Ma, Crawl), even superhero movies (Captain Marvel). This femme-friendly realignment could well have provoked some dad-centric counter-programming: tales of gangsters, warfare, cars and spacemen. Or does the gender gap suggest there are a lot of male auteurs out there who can\u2019t or won\u2019t tell women\u2019s stories? Viewed from a different angle, another worrying aspect of this year\u2019s frontrunners becomes evident: the lack of people of colour. Remember #OscarsSoWhite, and how appalled we were by the lack of diversity in the 2016 Oscar nominations? Again, the situation has improved dramatically since. Last year Hollywood was patting itself on the back for recognising films such as BlacKkKlansman, Roma, Black Panther, If Beale Street Could Talk, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and, er, Green Book. But we are unlikely to see #OscarsSoWoke trending this year. In fact, we are virtually back to square one. All the aforementioned boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 films are overwhelmingly stories about white people. Nor has it been a vintage year for LGBT-themed movies \u2013 Rocketman, anyone? Furthermore, with the exception of Little Women and a co-writer credit on 1917 for Krysty Wilson-Cairns, all these 2019 frontrunners were written and directed by straight, white men. If there is another #OscarsSoWhitewash, it will be especially embarrassing for the Academy, which could be good news for more diverse outsiders. Lulu Wang\u2019s Chinese-American family drama The Farewell, for example, benefited from a fresh cultural perspective. Taika Waititi\u2019s anti-Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit won the coveted People\u2019s Choice award at the Toronto film festival, following in the footsteps of Green Book, La La Land and The King\u2019s Speech. It could be this year\u2019s Life Is Beautiful. Similarly, up-to-date teen drama Waves could be this year\u2019s Moonlight, with its lyrical focus on African American family angst (although it was directed by a white guy, Trey Edward Shults), or momentum could gather for performances such as Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Harriet (as in Tubman), Lupita Nyong\u2019o in Us, or Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name. Awards ceremonies used to be glitzy showbiz love-ins, but after the public reckonings of recent years they have become more like anxious end-of-year assessments. Voters and academies are no longer concerned solely with how good the movies are, but also how good their nominations make them look. This year, more than ever, it could be a question of keeping up appearances.",

Latson was on a previously scheduled vacation in Jamaica when the media learned of his comments in July, <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/education/fl-ne-latson-vote-20191030-r6zaus3uxrefvm2qwngb4lzjhq-story.html\">reported</a> the South Florida Sun Sentinel.</p> <p>The controversy stemmed from an email exchange with a parent in 2018. A parent sent Latson an email asking how students are taught about the Holocaust, and asking if Holocaust education will be made a priority.</p> <p>\u201cNot everyone believes the Holocaust happened,\u201d Latson wrote, <a href=\"https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20190705/spanish-river-highs-principal-refused-to-call-holocaust-fact\">according to email records obtained by the Palm Beach Post</a>. \u201cAnd you have your thoughts, but we are a public school and not all of our parents have the same beliefs.\u201d</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t say the Holocaust is a factual, historical event because I am not in a position to do so as a district employee.\u201d</p> <p>Latson said he had to maintain a \u201cpolitically neutral\u201d position on the genocide, during which Nazis killed 6 million Jews, so he would be sensitive to Holocaust education proponents and Holocaust deniers.</p> <p>Latson explained his efforts to implement lessons on the Holocaust, but said some families opposed it.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cI work to expose students to certain things but not all parents want their students exposed so they will not be, and I can\u2019t force that issue.\u201d</p> <p>More than 10,000 Holocaust survivors are estimated to live in three area counties, the second largest cluster after New York, the newspaper said.</p> <p>In 1994, <a href=\"https://libguides.fau.edu/c.php?g=325732&amp;p=2455427\">Florida lawmakers voted for the Holocaust Education Bill</a>, which requires that all state school school districts teach students about the Holocaust as part of their public school education. The law applies to primary, intermediate and high schools.</p> <p>Latson\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Elfers, told the school board: \u201cThese are the facts. He is not antisemitic. He believes the Holocaust is factual.\u201d</p> <p>Elfers also said Latson was being punished for a \u201cpoorly worded email\u201d.</p> <p>A handful of school staffers and parents supported Latson at the vote, with one teacher saying there\u2019s \u201czero evidence showing wrongdoing\u201d and that \u201cthis is a textbook example of a witch-hunt\u201d.</p> <p>Some of his supporters reportedly offered hugs.</p> <p>Latson reportedly declined to comment following the school board\u2019s vote. Latson\u2019s attorney has vowed to appeal the decision in state administrative court, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A high school principal in Florida has been fired after telling a student\u2019s parent \u201cnot everyone believes the Holocaust happened\u201d. The Palm Beach county school board voted 5-2 to fire William Latson on the grounds of \u201cethical misconduct\u201d and \u201cfailure to carry out job responsibilities\u201d. Latson, former principal of Spanish River high school in Boca Raton, was fired because he could not be contacted when \u201call hell broke loose\u201d after his statement went public, sparking national outrage. Latson was on a previously scheduled vacation in Jamaica when the media learned of his comments in July, reported the South Florida Sun Sentinel. The controversy stemmed from an email exchange with a parent in 2018. A parent sent Latson an email asking how students are taught about the Holocaust, and asking if Holocaust education will be made a priority. \u201cNot everyone believes the Holocaust happened,\u201d Latson wrote, according to email records obtained by the Palm Beach Post. \u201cAnd you have your thoughts, but we are a public school and not all of our parents have the same beliefs.\u201d He wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t say the Holocaust is a factual, historical event because I am not in a position to do so as a district employee.\u201d Latson said he had to maintain a \u201cpolitically neutral\u201d position on the genocide, during which Nazis killed 6 million Jews, so he would be sensitive to Holocaust education proponents and Holocaust deniers. Latson explained his efforts to implement lessons on the Holocaust, but said some families opposed it. He wrote: \u201cI work to expose students to certain things but not all parents want their students exposed so they will not be, and I can\u2019t force that issue.\u201d More than 10,000 Holocaust survivors are estimated to live in three area counties, the second largest cluster after New York, the newspaper said. In 1994, Florida lawmakers voted for the Holocaust Education Bill, which requires that all state school school districts teach students about the Holocaust as part of their public school education. The law applies to primary, intermediate and high schools. Latson\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Elfers, told the school board: \u201cThese are the facts. He is not antisemitic. He believes the Holocaust is factual.\u201d Elfers also said Latson was being punished for a \u201cpoorly worded email\u201d. A handful of school staffers and parents supported Latson at the vote, with one teacher saying there\u2019s \u201czero evidence showing wrongdoing\u201d and that \u201cthis is a textbook example of a witch-hunt\u201d. Some of his supporters reportedly offered hugs. Latson reportedly declined to comment following the school board\u2019s vote. Latson\u2019s attorney has vowed to appeal the decision in state administrative court, according to the Associated Press. Associated Press contributed to this report",

The girl also told the court that as he stabbed her he told her he would \u201cget\u201d their child. \u201cMy baby was something he knew he had power over, because he\u2019s the father. If I didn\u2019t listen to him, my son is gone,\u201d she said. She agreed when Wright said the boy was \u201cmanipulative\u201d, \u201cunreliable\u201d, \u201cdeceitful\u201d and \u201ccoercive: he would put pressure on you to do what he wanted you to do\u201d. The court heard how she even agreed to fake her own death so that he could take a picture of her shortly before the attack. Questioned by the boy\u2019s barrister, Simon Csoka QC, the girl said that the boy changed when he started seeing his new partner, around the time she found out she was pregnant. \u201cBefore she was in the picture, [he] was a normal kid,\u201d she said. The case continues.",

The five men were jailed for between 10 and 12 years on the charge of continuous sexual abuse. A sixth man was acquitted on the grounds that he had not actively participated in the incident, in the town of Manresa, in north-east Spain. The prosecution had asked for the men to be convicted of sexual aggression, which carries a 15 to 20-year sentence, stating that the victim had been unable to defend herself. However, the court ruled the men \u201cwere able to carry out these sexual acts without resorting to violence or intimidation\u201d because the victim was \u201cin an unconscious state\u201d from drugs and alcohol \u201cand didn\u2019t know what she was or wasn\u2019t doing\u201d. The victim was awarded \u20ac12,000 (\u00a310,300) compensation for an attack the court described as \u201cextremely intense and particularly degrading\u201d. The judges rejected a claim by the accused that they were unaware the girl was under 16 and so below the age of consent. The attack took place at a party in an abandoned factory in October 2016. The case has been dubbed the Manresa manada, after the notorious case of the five men calling themselves La Manada, or the \u201cwolf pack\u201d, who were jailed for 15 years earlier this year for the rape of an 18-year-old woman during the running of the bulls in Pamplona in 2016. The Pamplona case led to an outcry and triggered protests across Spain after the five were initially cleared of gang rape but convicted of the lesser charge of sexual abuse. In June, the supreme court in Madrid overturned the lower court\u2019s verdict, ruling that the victim had been subjected to \u201ca genuinely intimidating scenario in which she never consented to the sexual acts perpetrated by the accused\u201d. The case also prompted the then government to announce a review of Spain\u2019s sexual offences legislation. Altamira Gonzalo, of the women jurists\u2019 group Themis, condemned Thursday\u2019s verdict. \u201cThe Barcelona court continues to believe that women must put up a heroic resistance,\u201d Gonzalo said. \u201cThey have taken a benevolent view of men who, with their trousers round their ankles, took turns at raping a 14-year-old girl who, as well as being under the effects of alcohol, was in a situation where she couldn\u2019t defend herself.\u201d She added: \u201cThe judges have had no difficulty seeing this from the point of view of the aggressors but that not of the victim.\u201d Viviana Waisman, president of the human rights group Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, also expressed concerns over the verdict. \u201cFrom the media reports we\u2019ve seen of the Maresa case, we believe that [the court] could have viewed the situation as intimidating for the victim, given she was a minor in an abandoned space with several attackers who were older than her,\u201d said Waisman. \u201cThe supreme court\u2019s ruling in the Pamplona wolf pack case clarified the concept of \u2018environmental intimidation\u2019 and looked at things from a gender perspective.\u201d Given that, she added, the judges could have come to the conclusion that sexual aggression had been committed and ruled accordingly. Giving evidence in July, the Manresa victim said one of the accused was a friend with whom she had had sexual relations a week earlier and whom she trusted. She said he was the one who led her to the shack where he raped her and then invited his friends to do likewise, telling them they each had 15 minutes.

      "body": "<p>When Representative Katie Hill\u2019s nude photos were leaked online, I watched with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I saw them posted across every social media platform. I saw her naked body, saw it commented upon and reviewed, criticized.</p> <p>I was sitting on my couch and wrote a quick tweet:</p> <p>\u201cAlmost every woman I know has taken nudes at sometime in her life. As more women under 40 run for office, we are going to have to figure out how to stand together and say it\u2019s the leaking of them, not the taking of them, that is shameful.\u201d</p> <p>The tweet got 1,000 likes quickly. The next day it had 34,000. I watched people in the comments tell the stories about how nude photos had been used against them. I watched many people, mostly men, repeatedly blame women for sharing nudes, instead of blaming the people who leaked them.</p> <p>By the time I woke up on Wednesday morning, the tweet had almost 100,000 likes. I felt something in me burst like a bubble. I drafted a post on Facebook to share something I had only ever told my closest friends \u2013 I cared so deeply about this issue because it was my story, too.</p> <p>I was only 19, and desperate for a roommate when I met the man who would go on to get me very drunk, film me without consent and release the evidence.</p> <p>I am 32 now and I can still feel the sensation of how it felt to have my world crumble around me. My boyfriend left me. I was forced out of the online community where I\u2019d found a home. I was utterly, hopelessly alone. I even contemplated killing myself, especially as this man threatened to show my parents the video.</p> <p>He made DVDs and sent me a copy.</p> <p>When I saw it, I threw up.</p> <p>I\u2019ve built a life for myself in politics. I\u2019ve moved on. I have a partner I love and an adorable house. Two cats and a dog. A great job.</p> <p>I\u2019ve run dozens of people for office. But I never let myself consider running for a seat of my own. All I could imagine was the humiliation I would feel if this man used that opportunity to finally release my secret to the world.</p> <p>As the jobs I\u2019ve gotten have become higher profile, I had near-constant anxiety that today, tomorrow, next Tuesday might be the day I lost everything again.</p> <p>The day I wrote my Facebook post, texts, DMs and calls kept coming in with wave after wave of support. It felt good to hear some things: this was assault. I didn\u2019t deserve the shame I was carrying. He was in the wrong.</p> <p>But what felt even better, almost magical, to hear, was comment after comment that said something familiar: me too.</p> <p>Woman after woman who were holding themselves back, who were not running for office, not going to school, not starting a business because someone \u2013 in some dark corner of the internet, or an abusive ex, or a high school fling \u2013 had taken away their choice. Released their nude photos. Put videos on revenge porn sites.</p> <p>This really isn\u2019t about Katie Hill. It\u2019s about the long fight women have had to have agency over our own bodies.</p> <p>It\u2019s about how we are asked to be both the virgin and the whore. It\u2019s about how women still aren\u2019t allowed to own our sexuality.</p> <p>And it\u2019s really, really about the fact that nudes are an expected part of 21st century romance. In the dark teenage drama Euphoria on HBO, the main character explains this beautifully. Exchanging naked photos and snaps is just how many young people build intimacy in a digital world that increasingly lacks it.</p> <p>It is not enough to tell women in their 20s and 30s that they just shouldn\u2019t send nudes.

      "bodyText": "When Representative Katie Hill\u2019s nude photos were leaked online, I watched with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I saw them posted across every social media platform. I saw her naked body, saw it commented upon and reviewed, criticized. I was sitting on my couch and wrote a quick tweet: \u201cAlmost every woman I know has taken nudes at sometime in her life. As more women under 40 run for office, we are going to have to figure out how to stand together and say it\u2019s the leaking of them, not the taking of them, that is shameful.\u201d The tweet got 1,000 likes quickly. The next day it had 34,000. I watched people in the comments tell the stories about how nude photos had been used against them. I watched many people, mostly men, repeatedly blame women for sharing nudes, instead of blaming the people who leaked them. By the time I woke up on Wednesday morning, the tweet had almost 100,000 likes. I felt something in me burst like a bubble. I drafted a post on Facebook to share something I had only ever told my closest friends \u2013 I cared so deeply about this issue because it was my story, too. I was only 19, and desperate for a roommate when I met the man who would go on to get me very drunk, film me without consent and release the evidence. I am 32 now and I can still feel the sensation of how it felt to have my world crumble around me. My boyfriend left me. I was forced out of the online community where I\u2019d found a home. I was utterly, hopelessly alone. I even contemplated killing myself, especially as this man threatened to show my parents the video. He made DVDs and sent me a copy. When I saw it, I threw up. I\u2019ve built a life for myself in politics. I\u2019ve moved on. I have a partner I love and an adorable house. Two cats and a dog. A great job. I\u2019ve run dozens of people for office. But I never let myself consider running for a seat of my own. All I could imagine was the humiliation I would feel if this man used that opportunity to finally release my secret to the world. As the jobs I\u2019ve gotten have become higher profile, I had near-constant anxiety that today, tomorrow, next Tuesday might be the day I lost everything again. The day I wrote my Facebook post, texts, DMs and calls kept coming in with wave after wave of support. It felt good to hear some things: this was assault. I didn\u2019t deserve the shame I was carrying. He was in the wrong. But what felt even better, almost magical, to hear, was comment after comment that said something familiar: me too. Woman after woman who were holding themselves back, who were not running for office, not going to school, not starting a business because someone \u2013 in some dark corner of the internet, or an abusive ex, or a high school fling \u2013 had taken away their choice. Released their nude photos. Put videos on revenge porn sites. This really isn\u2019t about Katie Hill. It\u2019s about the long fight women have had to have agency over our own bodies. It\u2019s about how we are asked to be both the virgin and the whore. It\u2019s about how women still aren\u2019t allowed to own our sexuality. And it\u2019s really, really about the fact that nudes are an expected part of 21st century romance. In the dark teenage drama Euphoria on HBO, the main character explains this beautifully. Exchanging naked photos and snaps is just how many young people build intimacy in a digital world that increasingly lacks it. It is not enough to tell women in their 20s and 30s that they just shouldn\u2019t send nudes. A great number of us already have. We shouldn\u2019t have to feel shame that we trusted someone, that we wanted to feel closer to them. Or that we weren\u2019t given a choice. Sharing someone\u2019s private photos without their consent is a violation of their privacy and their trust. It\u2019s wrong, and the people who do it should be held accountable for their actions. The United States should follow in the footsteps of the many countries that have made the sharing of revenge porn a federal crime. But in the nation of Brock Turner and Brett Kavanaugh, substantial reform doesn\u2019t seem likely soon. What we can do now is tell our stories. Of how we\u2019ve been hurt, our trust violated. We can keep talking about it. We can leak our own nudes. We can sue. We can fight. We can\u2019t be afraid. I know I\u2019m not, anymore.

There are many attempts to deny that the war took place, and also an attempt to deny the existence of the victims.

      "bodyText": "The Colombian artist Doris Salcedo, best known in the UK for her 167 metre (548ft) floor crack installation at the Tate Modern, has won the most lucrative contemporary art prize in the world, the Nomura Art Award, worth $1m (\u00a3770,000). The inaugural prize was awarded to Salcedo for her body of work produced over the last 25 years, which has focused on the human cost of the conflict between successive governments and rebel groups in Colombia. Salcedo is one of the country\u2019s most prominent artists, whose work often confronts some of its most controversial issues. Her work Fragmentos resulted in her being directly involved in the demobilisation process of the Farc, a leftist rebel group that disarmed following a 2016 peace deal, formally ending five decades of civil war which killed 260,000 people and displaced over 7 million. The weapons turned over by 7,000 former fighters were melted down into tiles that now form an exhibition space in Bogot\u00e1. Salcedo has also been assisted by survivors of sexual violence during the conflict. \u201cI believe works of art made with the collaboration of victims of political violence have the possibility to connect art and reality,\u201d Salcedo told the Guardian. \u201cIn Colombia, a country trying to implement a peace agreement, certainly the pieces made now are an attempt to reconcile a society divided for more than 50 years.\u201d She continued: \u201cIn Colombia, like in any polarised society, there are different versions of our recent history. There are many attempts to deny that the war took place, and also an attempt to deny the existence of the victims. That\u2019s why addressing war crimes in a work of art is at the centre of my practice as an artist.\u201d Salcedo said winning the award, which is funded by the Japanese financial services group Nomura, was \u201centirely unexpected\u201d, and that she felt \u201coverwhelming humility and gratitude\u201d. The award is aimed at providing artists with the means to produce ambitious work that they would struggle to complete without financial assistance. Once the project is finished, the artist can use the rest of the prize as they wish. Salcedo has said she will use the award to work on a piece about C\u00facuta, a region where atrocities were carried out by right-wing paramilitaries during the conflict. The Nomura Art Award dwarfs other contemporary prizes such as the Hugo Boss Prize ($100,000), the Don Tyson Prize ($200,000), the ArtPrize ($500,000) and the Plastov Award (\u00a3500,000). Like the MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Fellowship ($625,000), artists are not able to apply to be considered, with a jury, including the chair of the Arts Council England, Nicholas Serota, selecting the winner. Serota said Salcedo\u2019s work over the last three decades had \u201ccaptured the anguish associated with the loss of loved ones and preserved the memory of traumatic events\u201d in the Colombian civil war. He added that \u201cher language has an empathy and her materials an everyday character that give her work a universal meaning that speaks to people across the world\u201d. Susan May, artistic director of White Cube, which represents Salcedo in the UK, said that the Colombian is \u201cone of the most significant artists of our time\u201d and the \u201cunprecedented\u201d award means she will be able to continue her \u201cuncompromising and vital practice\u201d for many years to come. May said: \u201cSalcedo\u2019s sculptures and installations are the result of rigorous research with individuals who have gone through unspeakable trauma or suffering, and these investigations can take many years before they can be articulated into elegiac and politically charged works of art.\u201d The Bogot\u00e1-based artist took over the Turbine Hall at the Tate Modern in London in 2007 with her work Shibboleth, a crack that ran the full 167 metres (548ft) of the space, and was a comment on the deepening divide between Europeans and the rest of the world. \u201cIt represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThe space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.\u201d Nomura acquired the Asian operations of Lehman Brothers a week after the US investment bank collapsed in 2008. Japan\u2019s biggest brokerage reported its first losses in a decade earlier this year as it struggled to adjust to what its chief executive, Koji Nagai, described as a \u201cchallenging environment\u201d. The company wants the art award to be seen in the same light as the Nobel Prize, and says it is a continuation of the support it has given the arts. Earlier this year the inaugural Nomura Emerging Artist Awards resulted in $100,000 given to two emerging artists, with US artist Cameron Rowland and the Chinese artist Cheng Ran winning the prizes.",

Perhaps we could even start moving some of those London-based thinktanks whose reports are so influential during election campaigns. Then we might move beyond caricature and establish a relationship based on respect, that essential ingredient whose absence voters can sense a million miles away, and which is worth so much more than the carving up of the electorate for electoral gain. It\u2019s worth remembering that the seven northern towns who founded the rugby league broke away from the Rugby Football Union after being dictated to, patronised and ignored by public school men in the south who didn\u2019t care and had little understanding about the northern working-class players who could not afford to play without payment for time off work. They thought they could continue to ignore the real concerns that the northern clubs raised and still hang on to power, and it caused a divide in the game that lasts to this day. That is the lesson for the Tories, for whom this could be their last chance with our northern towns, or for anyone who is worried about the growing divisions in Britain and sees the potential for history to repeat itself. \u2022 Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan",

The case of the Leicester East MP was rushed through the Commons before the dissolution of parliament next week so as to assist the Labour party if it decides to prevent him from standing again in the 12 December election. Following a brief Commons debate on the report by the standards committee, published on Monday, it was endorsed without a vote. If Vaz is re-elected he could face further action from the committee over comments posted to his personal website following the report, the Commons was told. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, who also represents a Leicester seat, told the debate that the statement on Vaz\u2019s website dismissed the inquiry\u2019s finding, calling some of the evidence \u201ccompleted discredited\u201d, and denied he had been uncooperative.

If Vaz was re-elected, she added, his six-month suspension would be held over to the next parliament.

Not because the physical and emotional investment put into their World Cup campaigns by New Zealand and Wales culminates in the anti-climax of a contest where the winner will still be seen as a loser, but because the two respective head coaches, Steve Hansen and Warren Gatland, are taking their final bows after a combined 20 years in charge.</p> <p>Hansen, an impassive former policeman who is generally unruffled by the vicissitudes of sport, looked close to tears this week, but for all his disappointment at losing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">England in the semi-final</a> he took what was a chastening defeat with dignity, enhancing his reputation as the senior statesman here, keeping his cool when the temperature rises.</p> <p>He has been involved with the All Blacks for 16 years having served his international apprenticeship with Wales, first as one of Graham Henry\u2019s assistants and since late 2011 as head coach. He has a win record of more than 90%, but the defeat against England has turned what had been expected to be a coronation for his attack coach, Ian Foster, into an election, with other candidates, including Japan\u2019s Jamie Joseph, reportedly being considered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/30/all-blacks-veterans-to-take-final-bow-in-world-cup-third-place-playoff\">Wales make nine changes for game of farewells against New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The New Zealand union learned in 2007 not to panic. Had it carried on sacking coaches after World Cup failure \u2013 the current England defence coach, John Mitchell, was a casualty in 2003 \u2013 it would have been very different for Henry and Hansen, and any inquest into the All Blacks\u2019 failure to hold on to the trophy should reflect on wider issues, rather than whether Scott Barrett should have started in the back row against England or the wisdom of shaking up the back division and omitting experience.</p> <p>The growing financial divide between north and south has meant the Rugby Championship nations lose numerous players to Europe. The All Blacks have kept their first-choice players but their undercard has been depleted, restricting their options. When Hansen lamented the selfishness of the Six Nations in turning down World Rugby\u2019s plan for a nations league, which would have led to a more even distribution of income, he attracted predictable howls of indignation. Scotland were the main culprits and what did they supply this tournament with other than insensitive remarks before the worst typhoon here for 60 years?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04cec7b89e560fa4549da4edd070c38a97f5bafd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04cec7b89e560fa4549da4edd070c38a97f5bafd/0_44_5003_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Hansen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand\u2019s Steve Hansen has enhanced his statesmanlike reputation in Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been times when the All Blacks reacted badly to their elimination, not least in 1991 when they turned up to the play-off against Scotland at their sourest in a 13\u20116 victory. They are embracing this week as an opportunity to give Hansen a fitting send-off and even the hardened front-rower Dane Coles could not hold back the tears when he reflected on the Hansen years and how he had struggled to come to terms with the defeat to England.</p> <p>Like Hansen, Gatland is not given to outbursts of emotion but he spoke movingly this week about his 12 years in charge of Wales. Both men deserve to depart on a winning note, but only one will. It will be Gatland\u2019s 12th tilt at the All Blacks and he has yet to put one over on the side whose bench he warmed 19 times in the 1980s and 90s. A first victory for Wales in the fixture for 66 years would not be the triumphal exit winning the World Cup would have been, but it would be some finale.</p> <p>Gatland said on his first day with Wales that he wanted to leave the national side in a better state than when he took over and not even his sternest critic could deny him that. Moreover, he is the first Wales coach to have done so since the 1970s. Small wonder the Wales skills\u2019 coach, Neil Jenkins, the only one of Gatland\u2019s management team who will be part of Wayne Pivac\u2019s new regime, said on Thursday: \u201cFor me, he is a god of the game. I have been very, very lucky to be involved with him. He has done an incredible job, taking the boys to new levels and giving them the belief that they can beat anyone, but life goes on. Nothing ever stays the same.\u201d</p> <p>With Hansen and Gatland regarding the play-off as an opportunity rather than a curse, it should be a celebration of rugby. The safety valve will be off and both sets of players will be given licence to thrill. The future can wait. The two coaches are moving on, but it will not be so easy for their respective teams to do so, such is the impact they have made. As Gatland said, success is measured not in achievement but over-achievement. Both pass that test and that they are going out on a low-key occasion is a crying shame.</p>",

Hansen, an impassive former policeman who is generally unruffled by the vicissitudes of sport, looked close to tears this week, but for all his disappointment at losing to England in the semi-final he took what was a chastening defeat with dignity, enhancing his reputation as the senior statesman here, keeping his cool when the temperature rises. He has been involved with the All Blacks for 16 years having served his international apprenticeship with Wales, first as one of Graham Henry\u2019s assistants and since late 2011 as head coach. He has a win record of more than 90%, but the defeat against England has turned what had been expected to be a coronation for his attack coach, Ian Foster, into an election, with other candidates, including Japan\u2019s Jamie Joseph, reportedly being considered. The New Zealand union learned in 2007 not to panic. Had it carried on sacking coaches after World Cup failure \u2013 the current England defence coach, John Mitchell, was a casualty in 2003 \u2013 it would have been very different for Henry and Hansen, and any inquest into the All Blacks\u2019 failure to hold on to the trophy should reflect on wider issues, rather than whether Scott Barrett should have started in the back row against England or the wisdom of shaking up the back division and omitting experience. The growing financial divide between north and south has meant the Rugby Championship nations lose numerous players to Europe. The All Blacks have kept their first-choice players but their undercard has been depleted, restricting their options. When Hansen lamented the selfishness of the Six Nations in turning down World Rugby\u2019s plan for a nations league, which would have led to a more even distribution of income, he attracted predictable howls of indignation. Scotland were the main culprits and what did they supply this tournament with other than insensitive remarks before the worst typhoon here for 60 years? There have been times when the All Blacks reacted badly to their elimination, not least in 1991 when they turned up to the play-off against Scotland at their sourest in a 13\u20116 victory. They are embracing this week as an opportunity to give Hansen a fitting send-off and even the hardened front-rower Dane Coles could not hold back the tears when he reflected on the Hansen years and how he had struggled to come to terms with the defeat to England. Like Hansen, Gatland is not given to outbursts of emotion but he spoke movingly this week about his 12 years in charge of Wales. Both men deserve to depart on a winning note, but only one will. It will be Gatland\u2019s 12th tilt at the All Blacks and he has yet to put one over on the side whose bench he warmed 19 times in the 1980s and 90s. A first victory for Wales in the fixture for 66 years would not be the triumphal exit winning the World Cup would have been, but it would be some finale. Gatland said on his first day with Wales that he wanted to leave the national side in a better state than when he took over and not even his sternest critic could deny him that. Moreover, he is the first Wales coach to have done so since the 1970s. Small wonder the Wales skills\u2019 coach, Neil Jenkins, the only one of Gatland\u2019s management team who will be part of Wayne Pivac\u2019s new regime, said on Thursday: \u201cFor me, he is a god of the game. I have been very, very lucky to be involved with him. He has done an incredible job, taking the boys to new levels and giving them the belief that they can beat anyone, but life goes on. Nothing ever stays the same.\u201d With Hansen and Gatland regarding the play-off as an opportunity rather than a curse, it should be a celebration of rugby. The safety valve will be off and both sets of players will be given licence to thrill. The future can wait. The two coaches are moving on, but it will not be so easy for their respective teams to do so, such is the impact they have made. As Gatland said, success is measured not in achievement but over-achievement. Both pass that test and that they are going out on a low-key occasion is a crying shame.",

This anomaly must end.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Huq said: \u201cIt is fantastic to be in Downing Street to fight to remove the unfair tax on those who need to read digitally.

      "bodyText": "Children\u2019s laureate Cressida Cowell and former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq have joined 90 MPs calling on the government to scrap the \u201creading tax\u201d on ebooks and audiobooks. Huq, who is now a children\u2019s author, led a delegation to the chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid at his Downing Street residence on Thursday to deliver a letter signed by the MPs. In it, they demand the government \u201cend the unfair tax on learning by zero-rating VAT on e-publications\u201d. Readers currently pay 20% VAT on all digital books, including ebooks and audiobooks. Print books have been zero-rated since VAT was introduced in 1973, \u201con the general principle of avoiding a tax on knowledge\u201d. Campaigners against the digital book tax argue that it unfairly affects readers living with sight loss and disabilities, who may rely on the technology. \u201cThe government rightly does not apply VAT to printed books, newspapers and magazines, acknowledging the intrinsic value of reading and knowledge and the importance of the accessibility of these materials,\u201d write the MPs, who include former cabinet ministers Penny Mordaunt, David Mundell and Stephen Crabb, and former leader of the House of Commons, Mel Stride. \u201cHowever, as consumers embrace the benefits of digital technology, more readers are unfairly penalised for the format they favour. This anomaly must end.\u201d On Thursday, Huq said: \u201cIt is fantastic to be in Downing Street to fight to remove the unfair tax on those who need to read digitally. As both an author and a mum I know how important it is for children to grow up reading, regardless of whether this is on paper or screen.\u201d Cowell, author of the How to Train Your Dragon books, added that \u201ctaxing reading makes no sense, especially when it is being felt by those with disabilities and children just starting to understand the joy of reading\u201d. \u201cI hope the government sees sense and gets rid of the tax as soon as it can,\u201d said Cowell. Last year, new European legislation cleared the way for the 20% tax on ebooks to be lifted, with France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Malta and Iceland already announcing plans to lower taxes on digital publications. The UK has yet to announce similar intentions. The RNIB\u2019s Eleanor Thompson, who joined the Downing Street delegation, said that only around 10% of books were currently available to blind and partially sighted people in a format they could read. \u201cE-readers and audiobooks allow people with sight loss to enjoy their favourite books just like everybody else and they should not be charged 20% more for this,\u201d she said.",

We\u2019d missed a number of tackles on David Campese and he\u2019d scored three tries, but without those tries the scoreline would have been a lot closer. So we thought we needed to play a more fluid game against them. It wasn\u2019t something we were talked into \u2013 we spent the whole week working out how we were going to win the game.

      "bodyText": "Queens Park Rangers have accused Fifa and Uefa of \u201cbrushing racism under the carpet\u201d as they wait to hear whether action will be taken over an incident that prompted their under\u201118 team to abandon a match in Spain. QPR walked off the pitch during a tour game against the Andalusian side AD Nervi\u00f3n in August. The club said it followed a number of racist incidents, which were reported to the referee only for no action to be taken. QPR said on Wednesday that Fifa took seven weeks to acknowledge their complaint and then told them it was a matter for Uefa. According to the club, Uefa had by then told them it fell in Fifa\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cFifa and Uefa seem to treat complaints about racism like a complaint about a broken seat in a stadium,\u201d the QPR chief executive, Lee Hoos, said. \u201cI am left confused, frustrated and incredibly angry that more than 10 weeks after we lodged our complaint of racism, we are still awaiting a decision. \u201cIncredibly, despite the seriousness of this issue, it took seven weeks and the personal intervention of Greg Clarke \u2013 the chairman of the FA and vice-chairman of Fifa \u2013 to get a response from Fifa. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, the level of racism was so severe it led to an under-18s game being abandoned. Our players deserve better than that. People deserve to be treated better than that. \u201cThere were a substantial number of people within the game who warned me at the time that this issue would be swept under the carpet and I am appalled to see this appears to be the case. I am disgusted, embarrassed and dismayed to call them our governing bodies when they are incapable of governing. \u201cFootball is a powerful medium for positive change and education. Its reputation needs to be safeguarded. Unfortunately, the people in Fifa and Uefa are just not up to that important task.\u201d QPR\u2019s intervention comes in the week that Uefa responded to persistent racial abuse by Bulgaria fans during England\u2019s recent Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia by forcing the hosts to play their next competitive fixture behind closed doors, a punishment deemed overly lenient by anti-racist campaigners. The AD Nervi\u00f3n chairman, Manolo Fern\u00e1ndez, has acknowledged one of the team\u2019s players said something unacceptable but claimed it was in response to being spat at, an allegation denied by QPR. \u201cOne of their players, much taller than our player, spat down into his face,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cIn that moment our player said something to him. I don\u2019t know what but from what they have said it would seem to be something inappropriate. It is not at all acceptable what he said. What the other boy did isn\u2019t acceptable either.\u201d Uefa said it had been in regular contact with the Spanish FA on the matter and added: \u201cThe case is still being investigated by the Andalusian Football Association \u2013 the competent body to deal with the case in the first place. Uefa would have the right to investigate the matter if the Spanish/Andalusian football associations closed the case without action.\u201d Fifa said it had \u201ccarefully reviewed the file\u201d and referred it to Uefa because \u201cconfederations have jurisdiction on disciplinary matters related to friendly matches and competitions between representative teams or clubs belonging to the same confederation\u201d. It emphasised that \u201cdiscrimination of any kind has no place in football\u201d and said it endorsed \u201ca zero-tolerance approach\u201d and \u201charsh sanctions for any such kind of behaviour\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The release of the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being held back by a UK government agency engaging in \u201cevery legal roadblock to delay and minimise the payment\u201d to Iran of an acknowledged \u00a3400m debt, lawyers for her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, have claimed. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was accused of espionage, has been held in a Tehran jail, sometimes in isolation or on hunger strike, since 2016. The claim about the agency \u2013 International Military Services \u2013 was made in a letter sent to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, who in his ministerial role has 99% control of IMS. The highly secretive IMS now exists solely as a vehicle to manage a \u00a3400m debt that an international court has forced the government to accept it owes to Iran. The debt arose as a result of Britain reneging in 1979 on a contract to provide Iran with an order for 1,000 Chieftain tanks and armoured vehicles. As a backbencher, Wallace called on the government to speed up the payment of the debt to Iran, but since becoming defence secretary he has failed to reply to or acknowledge the letter sent by Ratcliffe on 6 September setting out how the government has been \u201cplaying legal and political games that has been a major cause of Iran\u2019s retaliatory tactics against innocent individuals like Nazanin\u201d. The letter says the Ratcliffe family find it extremely frustrating that the government claims to be leaving no stone unturned to secure her release but in reality has failed to \u201cexplore obvious possible solutions\u201d. Since a ruling by the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague in 2001, which was re-examined in 2009, the UK has paid money into court but insists it cannot transfer the sum to the Iranian ministry of defence subsidiary Modsaf as the subsidiary became subject to EU sanctions in 2008. The letter from Ratcliffe\u2019s lawyers claims: IMS has since 1979 gathered inflation-adjusted interest of \u00a3350m to \u00a3400m from investments made with the cash owed to Iran. The Treasury office of financial sanctions implementation has delayed making any decision on an outstanding Iranian government application, first made in 14 March 2017, to pay the \u00a3400m debt to the Iran\u2019s central bank, a non-sanctioned body. The Iranian judiciary in the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case, including in hearings appealing for her release, have at least three times explicitly linked her fate to the debt payment. Arrests or charges of other UK-linked individuals by the Iranian regime can be directly traced back to UK legal developments in the payment of the debts. Payment of the debt could be made in kind through humanitarian aid or by a permissible exemption from the EU\u2019s sanctions regime. After successfully resisting an Iranian legal claim that the UK must also pay interest on the sums it owes to Iran, IMS is now threatening to withhold the payment of the money altogether, even if sanctions against Modsaf are lifted. The lawyers write: \u201cIt is alarming to see the UK government channel money and resources into making technical legal arguments in court to avoid making a payment of a sum which they fully acknowledge is due, instead of putting its effort into finding a way of discharging the debt. \u201cIt is striking, and will not be lost on Iran, that IMS has seemingly profited from non-payment of the IMS debt in an amount equivalent to the IMS debt. It is little wonder that Iran views the entire case as the UK government playing legal and political games, which is a major cause of Iran\u2019s retaliatory tactics against innocent individuals like Nazanin.\u201d Describing the Treasury failure to make a decision on a permit to pay the debt as unfathomable, they argue: \u201cIt is plainly within the government\u2019s powers to make an exception for such a payment and it is hard to imagine circumstances of a more compelling need.\u201d The lawyers add: \u201cThe government\u2019s inconsistent back and forth on payment of the outstanding IMS debt has had demonstrably disastrous consequences, not only for Nazanin but for other British citizens. Such political manoeuvring is both reckless and redolent of the government action towards Iran back in the 80s.\u201d In the letter, Ratcliffe asked for meetings with the defence secretary and the government\u2019s legal advisers, a Commons statement setting out the government position on the IMS debt and an assurance that the defence secretary had been fully briefed by his officials on the issue. The Ministry of Defence said: \u201cThis is a longstanding case and relates to contracts signed over 40 years ago with the pre-revolution Iranian regime.

The number of children at risk of abuse linked to faith or belief is also up 20%. </p> <p>Though the figures are stark, the DfE said the numbers of children referred and seen by social workers for these reasons remain small and only makes up 1% of the total figure, while domestic violence remains the most common factor of concern.</p> <p>\u201cThese percentage increases are relatively large,\u201d the DfE research acknowledges, \u201cbut it should be noted that they are from a low base compared to some other factors, and they remain uncommon overall.</p> <p>\u201cDomestic violence (including that directed at children, the parent/carer or other adults in the household) remains the most common factor identified at end of assessment, followed by mental health (including that of the child, the parent/carer or other adults in the household). Together these two factors account for over a third of all factors identified.\u201d</p> <p>The Children\u2019s Society called for additional government funding to address the \u00a33bn funding shortfall facing children\u2019s social care by 2025. Sam Royston, director of policy and research, said: \u201cThe significant increase in children at risk of gang involvement and trafficking \u2013 and the numbers of all children subject to child protection investigations \u2013 are of real concern.</p> <p>\u201cWe see through our frontline work the devastating impact upon children who are groomed and exploited to traffic drugs in county lines operations and the violence that goes with that.</p> <p>\u201cYet years of funding cuts have left councils struggling to provide vital early support to at-risk children and their families, including those at risk of exploitation \u2013 meaning the challenges they are facing are more likely to escalate and put them in danger.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/characteristics-of-children-in-need-2018-to-2019?utm_source=1cd89314-78ba-4cd1-8df5-b0197f4bb65d&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate\">government\u2019s latest children in need statistics,</a> there has been a slight decrease in the number of children referred to social services and seen by a social worker, down from 404,700 in the year leading up to March 2018 to 399,500 this year. The proportion of children being referred also decreased slightly, down to 334.2 per 10,000 children in 2019, down from 341.0 last year.</p> <p>There are also slightly fewer children on child protection plans this year, down 3% to 52,300 from 2018 figures. Boys (53%) are slightly more likely to be in need than girls (45%).</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to strengthen families and tackle the causes of need \u2013 from mental health and addiction to domestic abuse. We are also providing an extra \u00a31bn for local councils to deliver social care.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also cracking down on exploitation of young people by criminal gangs and supporting councils in their duty to care for unaccompanied asylum seeking children, alongside providing more investment in mental health support.\u201d</p> <p>Headteachers, who play a central role in safeguarding and supporting vulnerable children, called for additional funding to invest in early intervention.</p> <p>Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there had been an unprecedented surge in demand for children\u2019s social care support in recent years, which meant limited resources were taken up by urgent intervention for children already at crisis point.</p> <p>\u201cA school is most successful as a place of learning when it works within the context of high-quality social care, health and many other services who work together across boundaries to meet pupils\u2019 needs.

      "bodyText": "There has been a sharp increase in the number of children referred to social services who are at risk of gang involvement and trafficking, according to government statistics. Data published by the Department for Education showed a 27% rise in referrals for children affected by gangs compared with last year, and figures up 20% for those affected by trafficking. The data also revealed a jump in the number of asylum-seeking children referred to social services and seen by a social worker, up 30% on last year\u2019s figures. The number of children at risk of abuse linked to faith or belief is also up 20%. Though the figures are stark, the DfE said the numbers of children referred and seen by social workers for these reasons remain small and only makes up 1% of the total figure, while domestic violence remains the most common factor of concern. \u201cThese percentage increases are relatively large,\u201d the DfE research acknowledges, \u201cbut it should be noted that they are from a low base compared to some other factors, and they remain uncommon overall. \u201cDomestic violence (including that directed at children, the parent/carer or other adults in the household) remains the most common factor identified at end of assessment, followed by mental health (including that of the child, the parent/carer or other adults in the household). Together these two factors account for over a third of all factors identified.\u201d The Children\u2019s Society called for additional government funding to address the \u00a33bn funding shortfall facing children\u2019s social care by 2025. Sam Royston, director of policy and research, said: \u201cThe significant increase in children at risk of gang involvement and trafficking \u2013 and the numbers of all children subject to child protection investigations \u2013 are of real concern. \u201cWe see through our frontline work the devastating impact upon children who are groomed and exploited to traffic drugs in county lines operations and the violence that goes with that. \u201cYet years of funding cuts have left councils struggling to provide vital early support to at-risk children and their families, including those at risk of exploitation \u2013 meaning the challenges they are facing are more likely to escalate and put them in danger.\u201d According to the government\u2019s latest children in need statistics, there has been a slight decrease in the number of children referred to social services and seen by a social worker, down from 404,700 in the year leading up to March 2018 to 399,500 this year. The proportion of children being referred also decreased slightly, down to 334.2 per 10,000 children in 2019, down from 341.0 last year. There are also slightly fewer children on child protection plans this year, down 3% to 52,300 from 2018 figures. Boys (53%) are slightly more likely to be in need than girls (45%). A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to strengthen families and tackle the causes of need \u2013 from mental health and addiction to domestic abuse. We are also providing an extra \u00a31bn for local councils to deliver social care. \u201cWe are also cracking down on exploitation of young people by criminal gangs and supporting councils in their duty to care for unaccompanied asylum seeking children, alongside providing more investment in mental health support.\u201d Headteachers, who play a central role in safeguarding and supporting vulnerable children, called for additional funding to invest in early intervention. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said there had been an unprecedented surge in demand for children\u2019s social care support in recent years, which meant limited resources were taken up by urgent intervention for children already at crisis point. \u201cA school is most successful as a place of learning when it works within the context of high-quality social care, health and many other services who work together across boundaries to meet pupils\u2019 needs. The government cannot ignore the funding and capacity pressures on all of those services,\u201d he said.",

Luk\u00e1\u0161 Wagenknecht, a Czech senator, said he had launched legal action at the European court of justice after the European council \u2013 the body representing EU leaders \u2013 failed to respond to his concerns about the alleged conflict of interest. The senator said Babi\u0161 was able to \u201cpersonally enrich\u201d himself through his vote at the European council, because he owns a company that receives EU subsidies.

      "body": "<p>\u2018It feels like acting,\u201d says Florence Shaw, frontwoman \u2013 not singer \u2013 of the London indie band <a href=\"https://drycleaning.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Dry Cleaning</a>. \u201cSpeaking your lyrics is acting, more than singing is. Everyone knows what it sounds like in a person\u2019s voice when they are irritated, or when they are in love. The voice changes, and it doesn\u2019t whack you in the face \u2013 it can be quite subtle and creep up on you more.\u201d</p> <p>If you spend any time in small British venues, it is likely you have noticed there are quite a few bands like Dry Cleaning around at the moment \u2013 bands that don\u2019t employ a singer so much as someone who declaims their words, and that are getting noticed. <a href=\"https://thebanddonothing.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Do Nothing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAZhzi9cpkc\" title=\"\">Black Country, New Road</a> have been winning admirers; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpU_L2Ru_3Y\" title=\"\">Talk Show</a> have been signed by Felix White, late of the Maccabees, to his Yala!

The late 70s and early 80s were when <em>sprechgesang</em> \u2013 literally, \u201cspoken singing\u201d \u2013 flourished as a means of expression, in part because of the embrace of musical limitations, in part because it was a clear point of difference from traditional rock music, and in part because it was ideal for conveying the scorn, sarcasm and disgust that performers such as John Lydon and Mark E Smith dealt in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f481d6d5e428e2e241e670721c00f95288438c6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f481d6d5e428e2e241e670721c00f95288438c6e/404_1446_3046_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sinead O\u2019Brien\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sinead O\u2019Brien: \u2018Mark E Smith showed it\u2019s not about perfection.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zac Mahrouche</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Smith, especially, is an inspiration for O\u2019Brien, even if her style \u2013 poetic and allusive, with an often flowing and melodic backing \u2013 is more akin to early Patti Smith (she even started in the same way as the latter, reciting poetry to the accompaniment of a guitar). \u201cMark E Smith showed it\u2019s not about perfection,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cEvery piece I ever listen to by the Fall can sound like a whole different mood board on another day. It completely transforms, and I\u2019m stopped in my tracks.\u201d</p> <p>That sense of confrontation Lydon and Smith brought remains important to many of these new groups. They are all still playing small rooms, where eye contact is unavoidable, and there is something uniquely discomfiting about being singled out from a crowd to be spoken at by someone on a stage.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people, understandably, who are cringed out by spoken-word stuff,\u201d says Isaac Wood of Black Country, New Road. \u201cIt\u2019s too direct. They think it\u2019s like an open mic slam poetry night or something. But if you are in any way inclined towards it, it is less easy to ignore, because there are conversational elements to it. It\u2019s more direct.\u201d Like Dry Cleaning, whose breakthrough track was about Meghan Markle, Wood\u2019s lyrical references to Kendall Jenner and Kanye West make him feel all the more immediate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRbpWEXkBic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FRbpWEXkBic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Magic of Meghan by Dry Cleaning</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThey hate it,\u201d says Do Nothing\u2019s Chris Bailey of his own audiences. \u201cThey feel super-weird and wrong. A lot of the time I\u2019ll stare one person down, and usually they just look away. If I\u2019m playing a character, it makes it feel like theatre. Breaking the fourth wall always makes people uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love being able to stand a metre away from someone and just stare at them,\u201d says Talk Show\u2019s Harrison Swann. \u201cIt\u2019s really visceral and the most real thing you can get. You can\u2019t shy away or hide behind a melody. It\u2019s great as a performer; it\u2019s really immediate.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, <em>sprechgesang</em> did not come about as a means to enable scratchy indie bands to make their audiences feel uncomfortable. It was first used by Arnold Schoenberg in 1912, when he set 21 poems by Albert Giraud to music as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd2cBUJmDr8\" title=\"\">Pierrot Lunaire</a>. (Strictly, what he was doing, and what these bands are doing, was <em>sprechstimme</em> \u2013 which emphasises speech above melody \u2013 but outside classical music, the two terms are all but interchangeable, and <em>sprechgesang</em> is the one that has stuck.) Brecht and Weill developed it further, but it was never more than a novelty in rock until the post-punk years (you might make an argument that Bob Dylan deals in it, or you might say he isn\u2019t a very good singer). </p> <p>But what about hip-hop? Surely the fact that the most popular music in the world features talking over music must be an influence on these artists? Perhaps not. Swann claims it has nothing to do with what he does, while O\u2019Brien says: \u201cI can\u2019t like it very much; that\u2019s just in my gut.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aed97942a51de499582b0b3aca24a68f42aac203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aed97942a51de499582b0b3aca24a68f42aac203/138_297_1729_1038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Country, New Road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Country, New Road, with Isaac Wood, second right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mathew Parri Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this baffles Shaw. \u201cWhen people talk to us about the vocals, they are inevitably mentioning bands that stopped putting out records before I was born,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I was listening to when I was a kid was P Diddy. It\u2019s possible the delivery owes more to So Solid Crew than the Fall. I was 12 when 21 Seconds came out and that was so exciting \u2013 all those amazing characters with such distinctive styles. It was talking in a way that was so exciting. I love all the post-punk music and that kind of delivery, but it\u2019s absolutely bonkers to ignore the fact that the dominant pop music since I was six has been rap. It\u2019s really strange that people don\u2019t acknowledge it.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the directness of talking to your audience, are there any other benefits?

      "bodyText": "\u2018It feels like acting,\u201d says Florence Shaw, frontwoman \u2013 not singer \u2013 of the London indie band Dry Cleaning. \u201cSpeaking your lyrics is acting, more than singing is. Everyone knows what it sounds like in a person\u2019s voice when they are irritated, or when they are in love. The voice changes, and it doesn\u2019t whack you in the face \u2013 it can be quite subtle and creep up on you more.\u201d If you spend any time in small British venues, it is likely you have noticed there are quite a few bands like Dry Cleaning around at the moment \u2013 bands that don\u2019t employ a singer so much as someone who declaims their words, and that are getting noticed. Do Nothing and Black Country, New Road have been winning admirers; Talk Show have been signed by Felix White, late of the Maccabees, to his Yala! Records label; Sinead O\u2019Brien\u2019s new single is on Chess Club, the label that brought the world Mumford &amp; Sons, M\u00d8, Wolf Alice, Sundara Karma and more. It is not a complete surprise that all these artists are operating in that part of the musical spectrum marked, broadly, as post-punk. The late 70s and early 80s were when sprechgesang \u2013 literally, \u201cspoken singing\u201d \u2013 flourished as a means of expression, in part because of the embrace of musical limitations, in part because it was a clear point of difference from traditional rock music, and in part because it was ideal for conveying the scorn, sarcasm and disgust that performers such as John Lydon and Mark E Smith dealt in. Smith, especially, is an inspiration for O\u2019Brien, even if her style \u2013 poetic and allusive, with an often flowing and melodic backing \u2013 is more akin to early Patti Smith (she even started in the same way as the latter, reciting poetry to the accompaniment of a guitar). \u201cMark E Smith showed it\u2019s not about perfection,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cEvery piece I ever listen to by the Fall can sound like a whole different mood board on another day. It completely transforms, and I\u2019m stopped in my tracks.\u201d That sense of confrontation Lydon and Smith brought remains important to many of these new groups. They are all still playing small rooms, where eye contact is unavoidable, and there is something uniquely discomfiting about being singled out from a crowd to be spoken at by someone on a stage. \u201cThere are people, understandably, who are cringed out by spoken-word stuff,\u201d says Isaac Wood of Black Country, New Road. \u201cIt\u2019s too direct. They think it\u2019s like an open mic slam poetry night or something. But if you are in any way inclined towards it, it is less easy to ignore, because there are conversational elements to it. It\u2019s more direct.\u201d Like Dry Cleaning, whose breakthrough track was about Meghan Markle, Wood\u2019s lyrical references to Kendall Jenner and Kanye West make him feel all the more immediate. \u201cThey hate it,\u201d says Do Nothing\u2019s Chris Bailey of his own audiences. \u201cThey feel super-weird and wrong. A lot of the time I\u2019ll stare one person down, and usually they just look away. If I\u2019m playing a character, it makes it feel like theatre. Breaking the fourth wall always makes people uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cI love being able to stand a metre away from someone and just stare at them,\u201d says Talk Show\u2019s Harrison Swann. \u201cIt\u2019s really visceral and the most real thing you can get. You can\u2019t shy away or hide behind a melody. It\u2019s great as a performer; it\u2019s really immediate.\u201d Unsurprisingly, sprechgesang did not come about as a means to enable scratchy indie bands to make their audiences feel uncomfortable. It was first used by Arnold Schoenberg in 1912, when he set 21 poems by Albert Giraud to music as Pierrot Lunaire. (Strictly, what he was doing, and what these bands are doing, was sprechstimme \u2013 which emphasises speech above melody \u2013 but outside classical music, the two terms are all but interchangeable, and sprechgesang is the one that has stuck.) Brecht and Weill developed it further, but it was never more than a novelty in rock until the post-punk years (you might make an argument that Bob Dylan deals in it, or you might say he isn\u2019t a very good singer). But what about hip-hop? Surely the fact that the most popular music in the world features talking over music must be an influence on these artists? Perhaps not. Swann claims it has nothing to do with what he does, while O\u2019Brien says: \u201cI can\u2019t like it very much; that\u2019s just in my gut.\u201d But this baffles Shaw. \u201cWhen people talk to us about the vocals, they are inevitably mentioning bands that stopped putting out records before I was born,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I was listening to when I was a kid was P Diddy. It\u2019s possible the delivery owes more to So Solid Crew than the Fall. I was 12 when 21 Seconds came out and that was so exciting \u2013 all those amazing characters with such distinctive styles. It was talking in a way that was so exciting. I love all the post-punk music and that kind of delivery, but it\u2019s absolutely bonkers to ignore the fact that the dominant pop music since I was six has been rap. It\u2019s really strange that people don\u2019t acknowledge it.\u201d Beyond the directness of talking to your audience, are there any other benefits? Bailey thinks it\u2019s a great way to get across sarcasm (\u201cyou can\u2019t sing sarcastically\u201d). \u201cI\u2019m trying to develop a weird character on stage,\u201d he says, \u201can exaggerated version of myself, like Stewart Lee does. But who also says things that aren\u2019t a million miles from what he really probably thinks.\u201d One choice lyric of his, from the song Gangs, runs: \u201cLeave people in the dark long enough and they\u2019re bound to start fucking each other.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s probably more emotional versatility in speaking,\u201d Swann says. \u201cJacques Brel is a perfect example of how that\u2019s possible: he\u2019s so varied in what he expresses, from tiny gestures to huge swells of emotion.\u201d For O\u2019Brien, it all began with putting words on paper: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a band.

Apstein reported that Houston assistant general manager Brandon Taubman shouted \u201cI\u2019m so fucking glad we got Osuna!\u201d at three female reporters, one of whom was wearing a purple domestic violence awareness bracelet. That was in reference to pitcher Roberto Osuna, a player who served a 75-game suspension while a member of the Toronto Blue Jays after violating the league policy for domestic assault.

They became only the sixth team in major league history to finish with more than 100 wins a third consecutive seasons. They also feature some of the brightest talents in the sport.

Through five games, the series was on track to be the lowest-rated in history (11.59m average viewers compared to the 12.34m in 2012, the current low). Viewership increased in each game and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/10/world-series-game-6-ratings-the-voice-this-is-us-1202772567/\">peaked at 15.31m</a> in Game 6 and likely increased for Wednesday night\u2019s Game 7. The gains were encouraging, but \u2013 as is par for the course \u2013 Sunday night\u2019s NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs still dwarfed Game 5, the highest viewed game at that point in the series, by roughly six million viewers according to Nielsen.</p> \n<p>Game 5 also featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/30/trump-booed-world-series-fan-reaction\">Donald Trump being aggressively booed</a> by the home crowd in DC, launching a discussion about public civility instead of Houston\u2019s comeback from 2-0 down to lead the series 3-2. Surprisingly, Trump did not tweet about the poor welcome in the nation\u2019s capital, but the moment spilled from sports channels into the cable news airwaves. Again, the action on the field was forgotten by a sideshow. Perhaps it was the running time of every game \u2013 six of the seven ran over three-and-a-half hours after starting at 8.08pm on the east coast \u2013 that invited the distraction.</p> \n<p>To echo Smoltz, maybe it was the unlikely path of the final two games that helped save the series. At the very least, it may have distracted from the drama that surrounded it. An umpiring controversy in Game 6 thankfully didn\u2019t swing the outcome (though it did lead to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/27961961/nats-dave-martinez-ejected-arguing-controversial-call-7th\">the rare ejection of a manager, Washington\u2019s Dave Martinez</a>), but showed that even baseball\u2019s highly structured and exacting rule book is subject to the replay review and technical interpretations that infuriate viewers in football, soccer and basketball.</p> \n<p>The gaudy home run celebrations of Houston\u2019s Alex Bregman and Washington\u2019s Juan Soto invited mindless, overwrought conversations about baseball\u2019s unwritten rules of professionalism while the lead swings in both Games 6 and 7 provided the kind of entertainment that MLB hoped for from the outset. By the series\u2019 conclusion, fans will likely remember the vigor of the 21-year-old Soto, the unflappable pitching of World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg and the joy of a Nationals team that couldn\u2019t win a playoff series until this year despite four postseason appearances from 2012 through 2018.</p> \n<p>With a wealth of marketable young talent \u2013 Soto, Bregman and Carlos Correa are all 25 or younger \u2013 and a game increasingly driven by power and athleticism, baseball still remains behind football and basketball in its American and worldwide appeal. Some of the drama that surrounded the series was avoidable (Taubman), some of it will require structural fixes (pace of play).</p> \n<p>The series ended in a way for so many to enjoy, but the issues harming the sport\u2019s popularity were evident. Games 6 and 7 were the kinds of viewing experiences that may turn casual fans into devoted ones, but they may think twice if they stomached the first five.</p>",

Game 5 also featured Donald Trump being aggressively booed by the home crowd in DC, launching a discussion about public civility instead of Houston\u2019s comeback from 2-0 down to lead the series 3-2. Surprisingly, Trump did not tweet about the poor welcome in the nation\u2019s capital, but the moment spilled from sports channels into the cable news airwaves. Again, the action on the field was forgotten by a sideshow. Perhaps it was the running time of every game \u2013 six of the seven ran over three-and-a-half hours after starting at 8.08pm on the east coast \u2013 that invited the distraction. To echo Smoltz, maybe it was the unlikely path of the final two games that helped save the series. At the very least, it may have distracted from the drama that surrounded it. An umpiring controversy in Game 6 thankfully didn\u2019t swing the outcome (though it did lead to the rare ejection of a manager, Washington\u2019s Dave Martinez), but showed that even baseball\u2019s highly structured and exacting rule book is subject to the replay review and technical interpretations that infuriate viewers in football, soccer and basketball. The gaudy home run celebrations of Houston\u2019s Alex Bregman and Washington\u2019s Juan Soto invited mindless, overwrought conversations about baseball\u2019s unwritten rules of professionalism while the lead swings in both Games 6 and 7 provided the kind of entertainment that MLB hoped for from the outset. By the series\u2019 conclusion, fans will likely remember the vigor of the 21-year-old Soto, the unflappable pitching of World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg and the joy of a Nationals team that couldn\u2019t win a playoff series until this year despite four postseason appearances from 2012 through 2018. With a wealth of marketable young talent \u2013 Soto, Bregman and Carlos Correa are all 25 or younger \u2013 and a game increasingly driven by power and athleticism, baseball still remains behind football and basketball in its American and worldwide appeal. Some of the drama that surrounded the series was avoidable (Taubman), some of it will require structural fixes (pace of play). The series ended in a way for so many to enjoy, but the issues harming the sport\u2019s popularity were evident. Games 6 and 7 were the kinds of viewing experiences that may turn casual fans into devoted ones, but they may think twice if they stomached the first five.",

      "bodyText": "Delhi has formally revoked the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s constitutional autonomy and split it into two federal territories in an attempt to integrate it fully into India. The decision of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to change Kashmir\u2019s status and tighten the government\u2019s grip over the region in August has stoked anger and resentment while a three-decade armed revolt rages. At midnight on Wednesday the state was formally taken under direct federal control and split into the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, bringing an end to decades of semi-autonomous rule. The state\u2019s constitution, as well as its penal code and state flag, was nullified, and the region is now subject to the same central laws as all other Indian territories. Jammu and Kashmir will have its own state legislature, while Ladakh will be controlled from the capital. Girish Chandra Murmu, a former bureaucrat who served Modi when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, administered the oath of Kashmir\u2019s first lieutenant governor in a ceremony held under tight security. Hasnain Masoodi, an Indian parliamentarian from south Kashmir and a former judge, said Delhi\u2019s decision to revoke the status was unilateral and a \u201cmassive assault on the identity and autonomy of the state\u201d. \u201cWe were an independent country 70 years ago, we have a history of 5,000 years and suddenly we have been reduced to a municipality,\u201d said Masoodi. \u201cEveryone has a sense of bitterness. There is a sense of injustice, disillusionment and humiliation.\u201d It was the implementation of a decision first made by Modi\u2019s government 86 days ago, when legislation was rushed through the Indian parliament to approve the end of article 370 of the constitution, which for over 70 years has guaranteed special privileges to the predominately Muslim region. It had been drawn up in 1947 as the foundation of Kashmir\u2019s agreement to be part of India. A swift annexation of Kashmir followed in August, with tens of thousands of Indian troops deployed into the region, phones and internet shut down, and politicians and public figures placed under arrest. For the past three months, the several million citizens of Kashmir have lived under severe lockdown, with their freedom to work and go to school restricted. Syed Babar, a lawyer based in Kashmir\u2019s main city Srinagar, said Kashmir\u2019s transformation into a union territory reflected \u201ca political holocaust inflicted on the people\u201d. \u201cIt is the day of political betrayal and beginning of an era where violence as an argument will have justification and takers, which is very unfortunate,\u201d he said. The Indian government justified its decision to revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status by repeatedly saying it would end militancy in the region, which had continued with varying intensity for the past three decades. In recent weeks, however, there have been several incidents of violence targeting non-local truck drivers and labourers. In the most deadly incident earlier this week, five labourers from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal were shot dead in the southern Kashmiri district of Kulgam. One of Kashmir\u2019s militant groups, the al-Qaida-inspired Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, announced a new leadership on Wednesday, less than a week after the police said they had wiped out the group after its chief was killed in a gunfight. Babar said he feared Delhi\u2019s decision would lead to a rise in radicalisation and would serve as an \u201cinvitation to foreign militants\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is no room for dialogue now. The space for politics has been bulldozed and there is nothing to negotiate about between people of Kashmir and government of India.\u201d In a speech on Thursday, hours after the state\u2019s transition into a union territory, Modi said the removal of article 370 heralded a \u201cnew age of political stability\u201d in India.",

Content Memory and imagination - Saturday 11 January 2020 (This class has passed) Bringing together discussion and practical exercises, you will examine the nature of memory and imagination, and the creative chemistry of their interaction. Character and plot - Saturday 8 February 2020 (This class has passed) Discover how characters reveal themselves through speech and action, how plot may determine character, and how character may influence plot. Point of view and narrative voice - Saturday 7 March 2020 When you have your story and your characters, how do you decide the point of entry for your reader? First person or third person? Reliable or unreliable narrator? One point of view or several? Whose voice do you want the reader to \u201chear\u201d? All stories pivot on the question of which character knows what and \u2013 crucially \u2013 what your reader knows and when you let them know it. Time and place - Saturday 18 April 2020 How do you create atmosphere and make your readers feel as though they are \u201creally there\u201d? How do you inspire a strong sense of time and place without holding up the narrative? This session will explore the ways in which you can evoke environment, from the intimate and domestic to the epic landscape, and make context work for your story.

      "bodyText": "Switzerland\u2019s Belinda Bencic sealed a semi-final against Elena Svitolina after her opponent, Kiki Bertens, became the latest player forced out of the WTA Finals by injury. With the first set heading for a tie-break, an emotional Bertens took an unexpected coaching break, telling her coach she was finding it difficult to bend down for shots. Bencic broke in the next game to win the first set 7-5, but her opponent withdrew one game into the second. The official reason for Bertens\u2019 withdrawal was given as a viral illness. Bertens becomes the third player to withdraw from the year-ending tournament in Shenzhen, shortly after Bianca Andreescu announced she will not play her final group game against Svitolina. The US Open champion had retired from her match against Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday with a knee problem, and confirmed that following a scan, she will withdraw from the tournament. The second reserve, Sofia Kenin, will now face Svitolina. Bertens had entered the draw as a replacement for Naomi Osaka, who was forced to withdraw with a shoulder injury. The Dutch player beat Ashleigh Barty in her first match, but her tournament has ended amid tears of frustration. While Bencic will take on the defending champion Svitolina in the semi-finals, Ashleigh Barty will face either Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova in the last four after overcoming a jaded-looking Petra Kvitova 6-4, 6-2. Ashleigh Barty bounced back from her surprise defeat to Kiki Bertens, comfortably beating Petra Kvitova 6-4, 6-2 to seal top spot in the Red Group and a semi-final place at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen. After an even start, Barty broke in the fifth game of the first set with a forehand winner, and held in the next as Kvitova missed three break-point opportunities. With humid, slippery conditions affecting both players, Barty defended another break point in the eighth game before serving out the set. At deuce in the opening game of the second set, Barty produced a clinical lob before winning a net battle to break Kvitova. The Czech had shown glimpses of quality in an inconsistent display but began to tire, and Barty claimed a double break after two unforced errors from her opponent. Kvitova regrouped but was unable to make inroads on the Barty serve, and the world No 1 sealed victory on her third match point with an unstoppable first serve. Barty will face Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova in the semi-finals, while Kvitova heads home after three defeats in China this week. So, that win means Barty tops the Red Group, and will play either Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova in the semi-finals. Those two will meet on Friday in a straight shootout for second place in the Purple Group. The defending champion, Elena Svitolina, has already won that round-robin, and will face Kiki Bertens or Belinda Bencic in the last four. They will be on court next, both chasing an unexpected semi-final place in a straight shootout. \u201cI feel like I executed really well out there tonight,\u201d says Barty. \u201cI had a few early break points against me, but I played those really well. I was happy with how I played, and how I pushed Petra back.\u201d And with that, she\u2019s off to fire some balls into the crowd. That\u2019s the first time she\u2019s ever beaten Kvitova in straight sets; the head-to-head record is now 4-3 in favour of the Czech. I\u2019ll level with you \u2013 I don\u2019t fancy Kvitova\u2019s chances of a break here. Barty has been rock-solid on serve in this set, and quickly moves 30-0 up. When a half-chance comes the Czech\u2019s way, she sends a tired forehand wide. Three match points for Barty: the first saved with a cracking return, and the second denied with a drilled winner down the line! Maybe it\u2019s not all over? Barty has other ideas, an unstoppable first serve sealing her semi-final place. Second set: Barty 6-4, 5-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Kvitova comes in behind her serve to good effect here \u2013 where has that tactic been since the opening game? When Barty tries a chip-and-charge of her own, Kvitova lobs clinically. Barty stays in the game with a terrific bending backhand, but Kvitova holds. Glimpses of what both players can really do in that game. Second set: *Barty 6-4, 5-1 Kvitova (*denotes server) Kvitova looks ready for some welcome down time after a long old season. Barty isn\u2019t giving her even a glimpse of a way back into this match, powering to a comfortable hold. One game away now. Second set: Barty 6-4, 4-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Barty leaves her opponent exasperated with a clinical lob \u2013 she\u2019s cut loose in the second set and looks much the better player. Kvitova at least gets on the board here, helped by some welcome power and accuracy on her first serve. Second set: *Barty 6-4, 4-0 Kvitova (*denotes server) Kvitova isn\u2019t throwing in the towel, going 0-30 up on Barty\u2019s serve, but two powerful forehand winners get the Aussie back on terms. An ace down the middle, another out wide, and the chance has disappeared for Kvitova. Second set: Barty 6-4, 3-0 Kvitova* (*denotes server) A weary shrug of the shoulders from Kvitova as she misses the chance to hold a scrappy service game. Barty floats her next return down the middle, correctly predicting that her opponent will miss again. Break point, Kvitova nets tamely, and Barty is closing in on the semi-finals. Second set: *Barty 6-4, 2-0 Kvitova (*denotes server) Kvitova has played a handful of excellent shots out here today, but the first-set stats make grim reading. 43% first serves in, one ace, three double faults and 20 unforced errors. Barty battles to 40-30, but Kvitova zings a cross-court winner to grab deuce. The No 1 gets in behind a net-cord bounce, then powers down a first serve to back up her break. Second set: Barty 6-4, 1-0 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Kvitova, WTA finals champ in 2011 and finalist in 2015, goes 30-0 up but then starts overplaying, surrendering the next two points with awkward shot selections. A double fault gives Barty break point, but an inviting second serve goes unpunished as Barty fires her cross-court return wide. She gets another chance, settling a fluid rally with a well-timed lob \u2013 and wins a quickfire battle at the net to break! Barty in total control now. It\u2019s been an even contest, both players serving up sharp winners and sloppy unforced errors. Barty has been more reliable on the big points, with Kvitova letting four break points slip in a frustrating first set. Qualification is now out of her hands; even a three-set win will leave her waiting on the outcome of Bertens v Bencic later on. Has she got any fight left? We\u2019ll find out. No sign of nerves from Barty, her first serve firing as she races to 40-0 and three set points. Kvitova saves the first with a brilliant drop-shot, scooped up from under her feet \u2013 then sends her next return long. That rather sums up her performance so far. First set: Barty 5-4 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Those missed chances are playing on Kvitova\u2019s mind as she serves to stay in the set. Two unforced errors take her first-set total to 20 (Barty has 12), but a perfect one-handed drop shot keeps her in the game. The Czech finds some first-serve rhythm to hold, a fizzing cross-court winner sealing it and forcing Barty to serve the first set out. First set: *Barty 5-3 Kvitova (*denotes server) At 30-all we\u2019re treated to the standout rally of the match, Kvitova doing well to hook Barty\u2019s cross-court effort back into play, but left stranded as the Australian clips it into the open court. Barty then coughs up a double-fault at deuce, and it\u2019s a fourth Kvitova break point \u2013 but she can\u2019t keep her return inside the baseline. Barty digs out the hold with a couple of big serves, Kvitova missing her best chance with a wild volley. First set: Barty 4-3 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Both players having some issues with the on-court conditions; Kvitova is struggling with her grip in the humidity, while Barty cast a couple of glances at the surface after low bounces threw her off. Kvitova holds well here, hitting three clean winners to keep the set alive. First set: *Barty 4-2 Kvitova (*denotes server) At 30-15 down, Kvitova is outfoxed by a superb Barty slice that clips the last millimetre of the line. A cross-drop-shot keeps Kvitova in the game, before a low return skips awkwardly off the court. Barty nets, and suddenly it\u2019s deuce, then a first break point for Kvitova via a net cord. Barty saves, but two more chances come and go for Kvitova, both players struggling to time their shots. The Czech goes long with a forehand, and a big serve secures what could be a crucial hold. First set: Barty 3-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Barty is finding her groove here, reading a Kvitova slice and lifting her volley plumb onto the line. 0-30 down, Kvitova targets the Barty backhand and forces a couple of errors, but is dominated in the next rally. Another Barty break point, and she gets the break with a snapping forehand that her opponent can\u2019t quite reach. First set: *Barty 2-2 Kvitova (*denotes server) That last game was a real slog after some sharp early points, but this is more like it. Barty starts on the front foot, before Kvitova responds with a fierce, curling backhand winner. The Czech goes for broke on her next return at 30-30 but finds the net, and Barty seals the hold with an overhead smash. First set: Barty 1-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Both players make unforced errors on the way to our first deuce, before a break point as Kvitova gets her footwork all wrong. An ace saves it, but a mishit forehand hands Barty another. On second serve, she fires her return wide. Kvitova responds with a nicely constructed point \u2013 then double faults! Back on deuce, Barty mishits her return, and Kvitova finds a big second serve to dig out the hold. First set: *Barty 1-1 Kvitova (*denotes server) Barty needs to find some early rhythm, with Kvitova looking sharp from the get-go. She digs in here to hold as the Czech goes for a couple of big shots that drift wide. First set: Barty 0-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server) Kvitova kicks off in style, moving into the net aggressively to take control of the opening game and sealing it with an angled drop-shot. \u201cPetra brings out the best in me, every time we play\u201d says Barty of today\u2019s opponent. Kvitova expects a \u201cchallenging game, as always against Ash\u201d. The two players have met four times this season, with Barty getting her first career wins over the Czech in Miami and Beijing. Barty could have sealed her semi-final place in Shenzhen already; having beaten Bencic in her first match, she led Kiki Bertens by a set and a break, but slumped to a surprise defeat. Should the world No 1 win today and top the group, she\u2019ll play Karolina Pliskova or Simona Halep in the last four. Ashleigh Barty has already secured the year-end world No 1 ranking after a breakthrough year that brought her the French Open title and a shedload of prize money. Barty is still aiming to finish on a high with the WTA Finals title in China, and can secure top spot in her group with victory over Petra Kvitova. Barty could still sneak through with a three-set defeat, with wildcard Kiki Bertens playing Belinda Bencic later today to complete the Red Group. All four players have a chance of going through: Kvitova will progress with a straight-sets win, and holds a 4-2 overall record against the Australian.

When Shakespeare created compelling characters, such as Othello and Shylock, he didn\u2019t know what it was to be black or Jewish \u2013 but he did know what it was to be an outsider, and he found in his own remembered experience the basis for an understanding of his characters\u2019 imagined lives.</p> <p>Empathy is an act both of memory and of imagination, and our writing will be enriched if we learn how to harness the two.

When Shakespeare created compelling characters, such as Othello and Shylock, he didn\u2019t know what it was to be black or Jewish \u2013 but he did know what it was to be an outsider, and he found in his own remembered experience the basis for an understanding of his characters\u2019 imagined lives.

      "body": "<p>The shock resignation of the cabinet member Nicky Morgan last night speaks volumes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/amber-rudd-to-step-down-as-mp\" title=\"\">about the nature</a> of this Conservative government \u2013 present or prospective \u2013 that she no longer wishes to be a part of. The rightward march of a Boris Johnson-led party is something a surprising number of Tory MPs have decided they can no longer stomach, as they jump ship with unconvincing mumblings about spending more time with their families.</p> <p>Standing down suddenly, not just from the cabinet but from her seat and from politics altogether at age 46 in the prime of her career, is a drastic act that has taken her colleagues by complete surprise. Politics is not a job, but a way of life: a mode of thinking and being, a social world, a friendship group, almost a cult. It\u2019s an addictive activity that can take years to get over in the rehab of normal life. The yearnings of MPs ejected or retired can last a lifetime \u2013 especially those not lucky enough to slip into the rest and recovery zone of the House of Lords.</p> <p>Morgan cited the abuse politicians \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/diane-abbott-speaks-out-on-online-abuse-as-female-mps-step-down\" title=\"\">particularly women</a> \u2013 receive as one of the reasons for her departure. But in leaving ahead of an election , she is also something of a bellwether for the Tories, given that she is essentially a moderate who has tried to navigate the rollercoaster of the great Brexit and Johnson schism in her party.</p> <p>She was a remainer, but a compromiser as she searched for the unicorns of \u201calternative Brexit arrangements\u201d. Finally she seemed to succumb to Brextremism when she accepted a cabinet post and took the Johnson loyalty pledge, to the distaste of some erstwhile allies. What\u2019s more, she seemed set to promote a Johnson wrecking agenda when as culture secretary she toyed with the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/16/nicky-morgan-open-minded-about-bbc-licence-fee-future\" title=\"\">abolishing the BBC licence fee</a> for a Netflix-style subscription service. Along with the NHS, the BBC is a Tory totem of loathing for national treasures beloved by the people. The very success and popularity of these institutions is an affront to the beliefs of ardent free-marketeers. But plainly, something snapped. She is off, before her hands are sullied by what\u2019s to come if her party wins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/amber-rudd-to-step-down-as-mp\">Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd among MPs stepping down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The disgraceful treatment of Amber Rudd stunned many, says Dominic Grieve, the whipless ex-attorney general, himself setting off on the lonely path of running as an independent in his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000550\" title=\"\">65%-Tory seat</a>. \u201cIt was vindictive and vengeful after she asked for the whip back. Of course it came straight from Boris himself,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The rollcall of departing moderates amounts to a cull of Ken Clarke-admiring Tories, many of whom attended the last One Nation dining club on Monday night; Morgan, who didn\u2019t reveal her plans, was among those. As parliament dissolves, that largely remainer dinner may be looked back on as the last gasp of a dying epoch. Away go David Lidington, Alan Duncan, Justine Greening, Oliver Letwin, Alistair Burt, Philip Hammond, Rory Stewart, Seema Kennedy and a score more, along with the prime minister\u2019s own escaping brother, Jo Johnson \u2013 following those who have already fled the party: Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry, Sam Gyimah and more. \u201cWe are seeing the complete collapse of moderate Conservatism,\u201d says Grieve, in sorrow and alarm. The Times <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/general-election-2019-morgan-in-exodus-of-moderate-tory-mps-zx7wdxknn\" title=\"\">estimates</a> that of 43 members of the One Nation group, only 26 are standing again for the Tories \u2013 it adds that Steve Baker, chairman of the hard-right European Research Group, expects its numbers to swell after the election.</p> <p>Outsiders may fail to see much change in the party that has headed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/brexiteers-theresa-may-boris-johnson-jacob-rees-mogg\" title=\"\">Hayekian free marketeering</a>, privatising and bonfires of red tape ever since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s day. The party that chose Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard as leaders, followed by David Cameron, whose deceptively modern facade hid a small-state ideology that shrank back public services beyond anything Thatcher dared. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the warnings of these Tory moderates packing their bags, disgusted by what they fear is to come next.</p> <p>The term one nation has been rendered virtually meaningless from overuse by every Tory of every hue, to well-deserved mockery from opposition parties. One of the One Nation group\u2019s founders was Enoch Powell, when they saw it as signifying a modernising willingness to accept the 1945 settlement and embrace the welfare state instead of fighting it.</p> <p>Now Boris Johnson claims it for himself: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a chameleon,\u201d says Grieve. \u201cHe adopts whatever persona will please.\u201d What do Grieve and the dining club mean by the term? \u201cI\u2019ve always understood it to mean quiet, moderate government,\u201d he says. And he expects anything but that from a Johnson/Dominic Cummings regime.</p> <p>What would signal that rightward move? \u201cDeregulation will be the key issue, and an aggressive neoliberal economic policy,\u201d Grieve says. At the dinner, he found many were \u201creally gloomy\u201d as they mulled over a Johnson victory. It would mean departure from the EU on 31 January and an abysmal negotiation of the future EU relationship, where refusal to accept <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/michel-barnier-tells-uk-ignore-eu-regulatory-standards-at-your-peril\" title=\"\">European regulatory standards</a> would be the blocking point.</p> <p>The sea change will come not just through the lost moderates, but the selection of new Tory MPs by the same old Europe-hating, backward-looking local parties that chose Johnson as their leader. Professor Tim Bale, analyst of political parties, points out that since the late 1990s it has been very difficult for anyone but firm Eurosceptics to be selected in any seat.</p> <p>The party, he says, has a history of oscillating. On social issues such LGBT and women\u2019s rights, it\u2019s unlikely to retreat from what he calls the \u201csilent revolution\u201d of social liberalism. But Johnson is taking hard lines on punishment, law and order and immigration. Hanging in the balance is environmental concern: the odds are, he will follow Cameron and \u201cdrop the green crap\u201d, satisfied with kindness to animals and abolishing plastic straws.</p> <p>If socially liberal issues of personal freedom are safe, there is, says Bale, the \u201csilent counter-revolution\u201d moving the other way, embracing nationalism, distrust of others and an anti-immigration, hostile environment.</p> <p>Heading into the election, Johnson is already turning the Tories into an ersatz Brexit party. That is the party from which these Amber Rudd, Nicky Morgan, Alistair Burt escapees are fleeing.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shock resignation of the cabinet member Nicky Morgan last night speaks volumes about the nature of this Conservative government \u2013 present or prospective \u2013 that she no longer wishes to be a part of. The rightward march of a Boris Johnson-led party is something a surprising number of Tory MPs have decided they can no longer stomach, as they jump ship with unconvincing mumblings about spending more time with their families. Standing down suddenly, not just from the cabinet but from her seat and from politics altogether at age 46 in the prime of her career, is a drastic act that has taken her colleagues by complete surprise. Politics is not a job, but a way of life: a mode of thinking and being, a social world, a friendship group, almost a cult. It\u2019s an addictive activity that can take years to get over in the rehab of normal life. The yearnings of MPs ejected or retired can last a lifetime \u2013 especially those not lucky enough to slip into the rest and recovery zone of the House of Lords. Morgan cited the abuse politicians \u2013 particularly women \u2013 receive as one of the reasons for her departure. But in leaving ahead of an election , she is also something of a bellwether for the Tories, given that she is essentially a moderate who has tried to navigate the rollercoaster of the great Brexit and Johnson schism in her party. She was a remainer, but a compromiser as she searched for the unicorns of \u201calternative Brexit arrangements\u201d. Finally she seemed to succumb to Brextremism when she accepted a cabinet post and took the Johnson loyalty pledge, to the distaste of some erstwhile allies. What\u2019s more, she seemed set to promote a Johnson wrecking agenda when as culture secretary she toyed with the possibility of abolishing the BBC licence fee for a Netflix-style subscription service. Along with the NHS, the BBC is a Tory totem of loathing for national treasures beloved by the people. The very success and popularity of these institutions is an affront to the beliefs of ardent free-marketeers. But plainly, something snapped. She is off, before her hands are sullied by what\u2019s to come if her party wins. The disgraceful treatment of Amber Rudd stunned many, says Dominic Grieve, the whipless ex-attorney general, himself setting off on the lonely path of running as an independent in his 65%-Tory seat. \u201cIt was vindictive and vengeful after she asked for the whip back. Of course it came straight from Boris himself,\u201d he says. The rollcall of departing moderates amounts to a cull of Ken Clarke-admiring Tories, many of whom attended the last One Nation dining club on Monday night; Morgan, who didn\u2019t reveal her plans, was among those. As parliament dissolves, that largely remainer dinner may be looked back on as the last gasp of a dying epoch. Away go David Lidington, Alan Duncan, Justine Greening, Oliver Letwin, Alistair Burt, Philip Hammond, Rory Stewart, Seema Kennedy and a score more, along with the prime minister\u2019s own escaping brother, Jo Johnson \u2013 following those who have already fled the party: Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry, Sam Gyimah and more. \u201cWe are seeing the complete collapse of moderate Conservatism,\u201d says Grieve, in sorrow and alarm. The Times estimates that of 43 members of the One Nation group, only 26 are standing again for the Tories \u2013 it adds that Steve Baker, chairman of the hard-right European Research Group, expects its numbers to swell after the election. Outsiders may fail to see much change in the party that has headed for Hayekian free marketeering, privatising and bonfires of red tape ever since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s day. The party that chose Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard as leaders, followed by David Cameron, whose deceptively modern facade hid a small-state ideology that shrank back public services beyond anything Thatcher dared. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the warnings of these Tory moderates packing their bags, disgusted by what they fear is to come next. The term one nation has been rendered virtually meaningless from overuse by every Tory of every hue, to well-deserved mockery from opposition parties. One of the One Nation group\u2019s founders was Enoch Powell, when they saw it as signifying a modernising willingness to accept the 1945 settlement and embrace the welfare state instead of fighting it. Now Boris Johnson claims it for himself: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a chameleon,\u201d says Grieve. \u201cHe adopts whatever persona will please.\u201d What do Grieve and the dining club mean by the term? \u201cI\u2019ve always understood it to mean quiet, moderate government,\u201d he says. And he expects anything but that from a Johnson/Dominic Cummings regime. What would signal that rightward move? \u201cDeregulation will be the key issue, and an aggressive neoliberal economic policy,\u201d Grieve says. At the dinner, he found many were \u201creally gloomy\u201d as they mulled over a Johnson victory. It would mean departure from the EU on 31 January and an abysmal negotiation of the future EU relationship, where refusal to accept European regulatory standards would be the blocking point. The sea change will come not just through the lost moderates, but the selection of new Tory MPs by the same old Europe-hating, backward-looking local parties that chose Johnson as their leader. Professor Tim Bale, analyst of political parties, points out that since the late 1990s it has been very difficult for anyone but firm Eurosceptics to be selected in any seat. The party, he says, has a history of oscillating. On social issues such LGBT and women\u2019s rights, it\u2019s unlikely to retreat from what he calls the \u201csilent revolution\u201d of social liberalism. But Johnson is taking hard lines on punishment, law and order and immigration. Hanging in the balance is environmental concern: the odds are, he will follow Cameron and \u201cdrop the green crap\u201d, satisfied with kindness to animals and abolishing plastic straws. If socially liberal issues of personal freedom are safe, there is, says Bale, the \u201csilent counter-revolution\u201d moving the other way, embracing nationalism, distrust of others and an anti-immigration, hostile environment. Heading into the election, Johnson is already turning the Tories into an ersatz Brexit party. That is the party from which these Amber Rudd, Nicky Morgan, Alistair Burt escapees are fleeing. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

She is a whizz at the whiteboard, scribbling out theorems as he watches in wonder. She later reveals herself to be another, more baroque, stereotype of a cartoonish evil baddie in a cassock. A particularly discomfiting cliche comes in the form of Henry\u2019s fellow lecturer and arch lothario, Tim (Nitin Ganatra), who harks back to the days when he could consort with first-year students. If the laddish humour between the men is supposed to be satirical, it ends up sounding antiquated and sleazy. And just because the nickname of \u201cChristian tits\u201d is given to Edie by Virginia does not make it any less sexist and unsavoury. The humour, more generally, is of the grumpy old man variety with pot-shots at Generation Z. Henry\u2019s character seems half-developed and we are left wondering whether he is as besotted by Edie as Virginia suggests. An attraction is hinted at but under-explored. More problematic is the mystery of Edie\u2019s motivation. She is a bizarre character who might have been more probable were we given even a glimmer of her inner life and intentions. As a play of ideas, God\u2019s Dice explores the dangers of conflating truth with probability as well as the scary zealotry of online hate and trolling but it also gestures towards being a play about midlife male crisis and marriage meltdown, all of which rumble under its debates on spirituality and science. And so it ends up being about too much and not enough. \u2022 At Soho theatre, London, until 30 November.",

The 16-team domestic Top League features Japanese internationals and well-known foreign imports but last season\u2019s matches attracted a modest average attendance of just under 6,000.</p> <p>There are signs, though, of an awakening at the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU) as it attempts to avoid a repeat of the lost opportunities of 2015. With the help of a tournament sponsor, it will hold a second round of rugby introduction days as soon as the World Cup has ended, with plans to hold open sessions for children and distribute rugby balls to more than 400 schools. In the first sessions earlier this year, an estimated 8,000 children picked up a rugby ball for the first time, according to the JRFU chairman, Shigetaka Mori.</p> <p>World Rugby, the sport\u2019s governing body, says its Impact Beyond 2019 legacy programme has added 1.8 million players across Asia, including more than a million in Japan, where almost 800,000 children have been introduced to tag rugby.</p> <p>\u201cJapanese rugby was built on a narrow base made up mainly of university and company teams,\u201d says Yuichi Kurosaki, the founder of the Minato Rugby School in Tokyo. \u201cBut Japan\u2019s performance at this World Cup could change that. We have kids coming to training for the first time saying they want to emulate the Japanese team\u2019s players.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other rugby schools are reporting a surge in interest in the wake of Japan\u2019s unprecedented run. Morihiro Saito, of the Bunkyo Rugby School in Tokyo, says the 150 children who turned up at last Sunday\u2019s training session included 40 who were there for the first time. \u201cWe were really surprised,\u201d says Saito. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t done anything special to publicise the session \u2013 it just happened.</p> <p>\u201cWe need more spaces and leaders, but the volunteer spirit is particularly strong in rugby, so the solution isn\u2019t necessarily just having more money. And kids are finding out that rugby is about so much more than passing and tackling, that it\u2019s also about togetherness and helping each other out.\u201d</p> <p>That ethos has impressed parents who once viewed rugby as a dangerous sport for hefty schoolboys put off by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/16/sumo-scandal-japan-harumafuji-admits-assault\" title=\"\">rigours of life as a trainee in a sumo stable</a>. \u201cThere is more awareness not just of rugby, but what makes it special,\u201d says Matsuse, a former prop for Waseda University, a student rugby institution.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have seen how players literally push their teammates on, how they never give up and how small players crash into much bigger opponents. Parents have been watching that and are beginning to see rugby\u2019s values as something they would like to instil in their children.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2019 to remove incorrect figures about attendance at Top League rugby matches last year.</p>",

Japan\u2019s heroics at the Rugby World Cup \u2013 where they reached the quarter-finals before being beaten by South Africa \u2013 have helped to cultivate a new breed of rugby devotees, including this writer\u2019s normally taciturn barber, who unbidden, brandished his clippers and offered an analysis of the Brave Blossoms\u2019 decisive pool victory over Scotland \u2013 only the third rugby match he had ever watched. More than 54 million people in Japan followed that game on TV \u2013 almost half the population and a record for a rugby match. And so the superlatives go on: more than a million people crammed into fanzones and a quarter of a million Japan replica jerseys have been sold. All this in the first Rugby World Cup in Asia. Rugby has arrived in Japan but, as England and South Africa prepare to play out its finale, some wonder if the fever will subside as soon as the last 30 men left standing walk off the pitch at the International Stadium Yokohama on SaturdayThat would be a frustrating rerun of the reaction four years ago after Japan\u2019s shock win over South Africa in the Brighton Miracle, now eclipsed by victories in this tournament over Ireland and Scotland. \u201cVery little was done by the Japanese rugby authorities to encourage kids to take up rugby after the 2015 tournament,\u201d says Manabu Matsuse, a sports journalist who has covered all nine World Cups. \u201cInevitably, the boom was short-lived.\u201d The sport will presumably be on the curriculum when Rugby School opens a sister institution in the Tokyo area in 2022. But what of Japan\u2019s rugby-curious hoi polloi? Space is limited, especially in big cities, while many school grounds are surfaced with dirt or concrete and there is a shortage of teachers qualified to coach. Critics of Japanese sports education have called for schools to do away with the bukatsu system \u2013 club activities that require children to choose one sport and stick with it for the entire academic year. The country of 126 million people has 92,000 registered rugby players \u2014 there are 10 times as many footballers \u2013 and only 1.5% of teenagers play the sport, according to a 2017 white paper by the Sasakawa Sports Foundation. The 16-team domestic Top League features Japanese internationals and well-known foreign imports but last season\u2019s matches attracted a modest average attendance of just under 6,000. There are signs, though, of an awakening at the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU) as it attempts to avoid a repeat of the lost opportunities of 2015. With the help of a tournament sponsor, it will hold a second round of rugby introduction days as soon as the World Cup has ended, with plans to hold open sessions for children and distribute rugby balls to more than 400 schools. In the first sessions earlier this year, an estimated 8,000 children picked up a rugby ball for the first time, according to the JRFU chairman, Shigetaka Mori. World Rugby, the sport\u2019s governing body, says its Impact Beyond 2019 legacy programme has added 1.8 million players across Asia, including more than a million in Japan, where almost 800,000 children have been introduced to tag rugby. \u201cJapanese rugby was built on a narrow base made up mainly of university and company teams,\u201d says Yuichi Kurosaki, the founder of the Minato Rugby School in Tokyo. \u201cBut Japan\u2019s performance at this World Cup could change that. We have kids coming to training for the first time saying they want to emulate the Japanese team\u2019s players.\u201d Other rugby schools are reporting a surge in interest in the wake of Japan\u2019s unprecedented run. Morihiro Saito, of the Bunkyo Rugby School in Tokyo, says the 150 children who turned up at last Sunday\u2019s training session included 40 who were there for the first time. \u201cWe were really surprised,\u201d says Saito. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t done anything special to publicise the session \u2013 it just happened. \u201cWe need more spaces and leaders, but the volunteer spirit is particularly strong in rugby, so the solution isn\u2019t necessarily just having more money. And kids are finding out that rugby is about so much more than passing and tackling, that it\u2019s also about togetherness and helping each other out.\u201d That ethos has impressed parents who once viewed rugby as a dangerous sport for hefty schoolboys put off by the rigours of life as a trainee in a sumo stable. \u201cThere is more awareness not just of rugby, but what makes it special,\u201d says Matsuse, a former prop for Waseda University, a student rugby institution. \u201cPeople have seen how players literally push their teammates on, how they never give up and how small players crash into much bigger opponents. Parents have been watching that and are beginning to see rugby\u2019s values as something they would like to instil in their children.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2019 to remove incorrect figures about attendance at Top League rugby matches last year.",

Boris Johnson is expected to rule out any new fracking in the UK as part of his election campaign following rising opposition among voters and within his own party. The effective ban is widely expected to emerge within days, and green groups believe the \u201cvictory for common sense\u201d could help kill off the industry after years of public protest over the environmental risks. Johnson said on Wednesday that the government would make an announcement on the UK\u2019s fracking industry following a review into a series of recent earthquakes at a shale site in Lancashire. Fracking at Cuadrilla\u2019s site near Blackpool was brought to an immediate halt after an earth tremor that breached the government\u2019s earthquake limits. Johnson said the announcement would be made in view of the \u201cvery considerable anxieties that are legitimately being raised about the earthquakes that have followed various fracking attempts in the UK\u201d. Prior to becoming prime minister, Johnson referred to fracking as \u201cglorious news for humanity\u201d and urged the UK to \u201cleave no stone unturned, or unfracked\u201d in pursuit of shale gas.

      "bodyText": "A Holyrood committee has cast fresh doubt over Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s plan to hold a second independence referendum based on a simple yes/no question late next year . The finance and constitution committee said it supported requests from the Electoral Commission for up to 12 weeks to test the proposed question and for at least six months to pass between the referendum being agreed and the vote being held. The committee said any referendum intended to change the constitution must require special primary legislation at Holyrood, suggesting it could take up to a year for an independence vote to be held, taking all these stages into account. Sturgeon plans to make an independence referendum the centrepiece of the Scottish National party\u2019s election campaign, with the party enjoying a significant lead in the polls in Scotland. She told the SNP\u2019s annual conference this month that she wanted the referendum to be staged in late 2020 and would ask the UK government to grant the powers to hold one as soon as possible after the election. She argues that the prospects of a Boris Johnson-led Tory administration forcing through a hard Brexit makes the case for Scotland leaving the UK \u2013 and, in time, rejoining the EU \u2013 unanswerable. Her government insists a second independence vote should be based on the same question asked in the 2014 referendum: \u201cShould Scotland be an independent country?\u201d Derek Mackay, the Scottish government\u2019s finance secretary, told the committee that this question was simple and understood by voters and had been used more than 200 times in opinion polling. The Electoral Commission has said it needs to evaluate the question against other options, likely to include the leave/remain option used in the 2016 EU referendum, and it wants up to 12 weeks to test the wording with voters. The rough timetable sketched out by the committee begins with tabling and passing an act of parliament to stage the referendum, then up to three months to test the question, 28 days for the main yes/no campaigns to register with the Electoral Commission, 16 days for the commission to register those campaigns and at least 10 weeks for the campaign. The committee said calls from the commission and other experts for at least six months to elapse between the act being passed and the referendum taking place also had to be taken into account. The referendum bill is expected to be put to its first-stage vote at Holyrood next Thursday before going back to the finance and constitution committee for line-by-line scrutiny and amendments under stage two of Holyrood\u2019s legislative process. The committee hinted strongly in its interim report on the bill, published on Thursday morning, that it expected the government to accept the Electoral Commission\u2019s recommendations during the stage-two process. It unanimously endorsed the bill\u2019s primary purpose \u2013 to establish a clear framework for all future referendums in Scotland \u2013 but Bruce Crawford, the committee\u2019s convenor and a veteran SNP MSP, said it also wanted the government to live up to Mackay\u2019s promise to be open-minded about calls to revise the bill. Crawford said: \u201cOur committee supports the policy objective of the bill \u2013 to put in place a generic framework for referendums \u2013 on the basis that the bill is amended to reflect the weight of evidence we received and have set out in our report.\u201d Mike Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s constitutional relations secretary, welcomed the committee\u2019s unanimous support for the bill\u2019s core purpose, and he repeated that the SNP still believed in replicating the wording of the 2014 referendum. \u201cI will seriously consider the report\u2019s findings,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThere is still a strong case, in my view, for not changing a question which has been previously proposed and tested by the Electoral Commission, remains in use and has the confidence of the public.

England chased down New Zealand last weekend, herding the holders into an enclosure, but they know South Africa are coming to round them up on Saturday. The Springboks\u2019 head coach, Rassie Erasmus, was happy on Tuesday to more than hint at his line-up for the final and point out that England could expect more of the same remorselessly physical, attritional rugby that had taken them to the final day.

      "bodyText": "When Cyprus\u2019s former president George Vassiliou made the official gift of an ancient vase to Margaret Thatcher in 1988, he assumed it would remain at 10 Downing Street. Instead, more than three decades later, the sale at auction of the 2,700-year-old pottery has provoked diplomatic discomfort in London and disquiet in Nicosia. Cypriot authorities want to know how an artefact bequeathed not as a personal gift but political gesture could ultimately go under the hammer for private gain. \u201cWe\u2019re seeking an explanation as to how protocol could have slipped like this,\u201d said a government source on the island, confirming that the foreign minister, Nikos Christodoulides, had instructed Cyprus\u2019s high commissioner in the UK to raise the issue. The 12.6cm-tall vessel, described by Christie\u2019s as \u201cthe property of a private individual\u201d, fetched \u00a36,000 when it was auctioned in May. A note penned by Thatcher on a Downing Street envelope detailing the antiquity\u2019s provenance is believed to have played a role in significantly raising its pre-sale estimate. Vassiliou, who held office between 1988 and 1993 as Cyprus\u2019s third president, said his government gave the gift in recognition of Thatcher\u2019s unstinting support in reuniting the island. A former British colony, the Mediterranean country has been split between Greek and Turkish Cypriots since 1974. \u201cIt was a symbolic gesture,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cMargaret wanted so much to see a solution to the Cyprus problem and she spoke to everyone to try to promote our positions. \u201cShe was more than helpful, she was genuine. We had very warm relations, but in truth I felt obliged to give her this gift not as an individual but as head of state to a prime minister. In reality it should have remained in Downing Street. How it ended up at her home and then Christie\u2019s, I simply don\u2019t know.\u201d Although the vase, which dates to the Cypro-Archaic period, is neither unique nor of immense art-historical value, it is, like most antiquities from Cyprus, a token of national pride. The then president was required to seek approval from the antiquities department before removing it from the island. The sale came to light when Maria Paphitis, an art historian researching Cypriot pottery, happened to notice the vessel in an auction of nearly 200 personal items that had belonged to Thatcher. \u201cIt was totally spontaneous that I came across it, but once discovered, questions began to be asked,\u201d said Paphitis, a former Christie\u2019s employee before she returned to Nicosia. She believes the sale should now be revoked. \u201cPeople want an explanation. Some see it as a little bit of an insult that an antiquity given to a country as a gift should then be sold as a private item. As a matter of respect to the people of Cyprus, it should have remained in the prime minister\u2019s collection.\u201d The auction was held to mark the 40th anniversary of Thatcher\u2019s election as PM. Christie\u2019s said all the artefacts \u2013 which also included an ostrich leather handbag and the hardstone \u201cpebble\u201d bracelet that she wore when she met Nelson Mandela in 1990 \u2013 were being sold \u201con behalf of the beneficiaries of Baroness Thatcher\u2019s estate\u201d. The May sale attracted buyers from 36 countries and was part of a series of auctions that have raised more than \u00a34.5m since Thatcher\u2019s death in 2013. Androulla Vassiliou, the ex-president\u2019s wife and a former EU commissioner for health and education, has to date been the most unsparing on the issue, holding Thatcher\u2019s children, Mark and Carol, to blame for the diplomatic faux pas. \u201cI am assuming that her children wanted to sell her possessions after her death and the vase was believed to be part of them,\u201d she told the Cyprus Mail. \u201cHowever, the ancient pottery was not given to her as an individual but should have remained at 10 Downing Street.\u201d Under current regulations, all ministers, including the prime minister, can retain gifts only if they are worth less than \u00a3140.

      "body": "<p>There is a song on Van Morrison\u2019s 1991 album Hymns to the Silence called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVsUpjjOeo\" title=\"\">Why Must I Always Explain?</a> in which the Northern Irish singer-songwriter appears to rail against the endlessly tiresome process of giving interviews. \u201cAnd I never turned out to be the person that you wanted me to be,\u201d he sings. \u201cAnd I tell you who I am, time and time and time again / Tell me why must I always explain?\u201d</p> <p>The song is in my mind when I meet Morrison on a midweek morning in Cardiff. The singer sits by the window in a fourth-floor hotel room; a pale white knuckle of a man in a blue patterned shirt, his hair a sweep of bracken red. Beyond him, the view over the bay has been obscured by heavy autumn mist.</p> <p>In an unorthodox move, two members of his management team remain in the room, sitting awkwardly on the bed and making occasional interjections. It is a peculiar setting for a conversation. \u201cLet\u2019s see if I need to make some notes here,\u201d Morrison says, picking up the pad and pencil that lie on the table between us. And so I sit, trapped between the mist and the managers. Before me, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/31/hail-hail-rock-n-roll\">my favourite songwriter in the world</a>, a man I have wanted to interview for two decades, holding a notepad. A sour air settles over the room.</p> <p>We are here to discuss his new album, Three Chords and the Truth. It is the sixth record Morrison, 74, has released in just over three years, and his best since 1997\u2019s The Healing Game. While its five predecessors were largely interpretations of others\u2019 songs \u2013 the work of Cole Porter, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Titus Turner and others mingling with his own compositions \u2013 the new album is all his own. It includes March Winds in February \u2013 a sublime example of Morrison songwriting \u2013 plus a duet with the Righteous Brothers\u2019 Bill Medley and contributions from Jay Berliner, the guitarist who appeared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/03/van-morrison-astral-weeks-review\">on 1968\u2019s beloved Astral Weeks</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTo8sxJeNTI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jTo8sxJeNTI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It would apparently be wrong to read too much into Berliner\u2019s return, or to delve too deeply into Morrison\u2019s affection for his playing. \u201cWell, he\u2019s just a genius. You know?\u201d he says. \u201cI mean what else, what other reason?\u201d But where and how does that genius show itself? Where does it hit him? Morrison stares at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just what he does,\u201d he says bluntly.</p> <p>He is a touch more forthcoming about Medley. \u201cI\u2019d been listening to one of his albums, last year sometime,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a solo album [Bill Medley 100%] after he left the Righteous Brothers.\u201d Morrison was recording in Las Vegas when he heard Medley was performing there and sought him out. \u201cI went to see his show and talked to him and then when I was doing the track I just got him on,\u201d he says. He has nothing specific to add about the joys of Medley\u2019s voice itself. \u201cI\u2019ve just always liked him as a singer,\u201d he says. \u201cI like singers.\u201d</p> <p>His own voice is an extraordinary thing \u2013 one minute it is hard rain on granite, the next it is possessed by soulful, gut-stirring beauty. Over the course of his career, he has often set it against other voices; in 1966, leading the garage band Them, he closed a residency at the Whiskey A-Go-Go in Los Angeles duetting his own song Gloria with the lead singer of the support act, Jim Morrison of the Doors. In more recent times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/21/old-music-van-morrison-cliff-richard\">he has recorded with Cliff Richard</a>, Gregory Porter and John Lee Hooker, and released an album, Duets, in which he revisited some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/18/van-morrison-teams-up-with-bobby-womack-and-michael-buble-for-duets-album\">his own songs in the company of others </a>\u2013 Georgie Fame, Mavis Staples and his daughter Shana among them. Soon, he tells me, he will be collaborating with the jazz singer Kurt Elling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f57529938bd4b193682e55839a87869a4fe14e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f57529938bd4b193682e55839a87869a4fe14e14/0_0_2381_3010/791.jpg\" alt=\"Van Morrison circa 1970.\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Van Morrison circa 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What does he seek in a duet partner? \u201cWell, it\u2019s not just how it fits, it\u2019s how it feels,\u201d he replies. \u201cWhat is it that you like about it \u2013 I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d He says this last sentence quickly, crossly. \u201cSee, I don\u2019t need to explain what I do or how I do it, I don\u2019t need to. Other people might do, but I don\u2019t. To me, it\u2019s OK if it\u2019s a mystery.\u201d</p> <p>Would he, in fact, rather it remained a mystery? \u201cNo, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s OK if it is. I don\u2019t need to probe what I do. You know?\u201d His voice is flinty. \u201cIt comes naturally. It is what it is, as they say. There\u2019s not a lot of intellectual pondering about what I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s very kind of instinctive and intuitive, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>This would be quite reasonable were Morrison not such a questing writer, his songs an inquiry into spirituality, language, love. His lyrics have frequently referenced other artists, from Huddie Ledbetter to Edith Piaf via Hank Williams, and poets such as John Donne, William Blake and WB Yeats; the track Summertime in England is in part a discourse on TS Eliot, Wordsworth, Coleridge and how \u201cJames Joyce wrote streams of consciousness books\u201d. Does he himself intellectually ponder other artists or writers? Morrison contemplates the idea for a moment. \u201cUhhhh, maybe,\u201d he says. Might he care to name them? \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>I have the feeling that Morrison is curling up into a ball before me and closing his eyes so that I might not see him. His answers take on a hulking and impenetrable flatness, with a determined absence of detail. Yet the glory of his music has always lain in its details: in the \u201cclicking-clacking of the high-heeled shoe\u201d in Madame George, the yarragh in \u201cwhiskey\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in Linden Arden Stole the Highlights, in his tendency to repetition, his ability to dismantle a single word. He is an intensely sensuous songwriter and singer, his voice finding new crevices, sweetness and joy in language.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t need to explain what I do or how I do it.

And how does that stretch feel? \u201cWell, you stretch at different points depending on the song, different points in the song, what the chords are, what the arrangements are,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no set answer to that question. Because if I don\u2019t know it, it could change in take two.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly it could change live; many of Morrison\u2019s songs have taken on new life and shape over years of performance.

The previous evening in Bournemouth, Morrison and his band had tried out a couple of the new songs \u2013 the album\u2019s title track and the rock\u2019n\u2019roll number Early Days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/01/van-morrison-10-of-the-best\">Van Morrison \u2013 10 of the best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cCos those are the ones the band learned,\u201d he says, when asked why he chose to unveil those two. \u201cI don\u2019t know, is this a psychiatric examination?\u201d It is not. \u201cIt sounds like one,\u201d he says. \u201cThe band learned those two songs, so those are the ones they knew. There\u2019s not really any great intellectual Bernard Levin debate, you know. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s just \u2026 it\u2019s just music, that\u2019s all it is.\u201d</p> <p>I do not for one moment believe him. I\u2019m not really sure there is \u201cjust music\u201d for anyone, least of all Morrison. He is under no obligation to share any of that with journalists, of course \u2013 his music undoubtedly speaks for itself. But I\u2019m sure there is a kinder and more graceful way of declining. \u201cYou\u2019re making a big thing about it and it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do. I don\u2019t know what you do, you\u2019re probably a journalist, that\u2019s what you do.\u201d This is not about me, I tell him. \u201cWell, what are ya? Are you a journalist, what are ya?\u201d He looks at me with a kind of disdain. I dutifully reel off the various components of my career. \u201cOK, well, I do music,\u201d he says. \u201cI sing and I write songs and I do gigs. So to me that\u2019s not interesting. You\u2019re trying to make it very, very interesting and something it\u2019s not. Playing gigs is very practical. It\u2019s very repetitive. And it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ve been doing it all my life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1592ab70fbf277b48d5ab576ee7e092700dad8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1592ab70fbf277b48d5ab576ee7e092700dad8e/0_0_3504_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playing in The Last Waltz with the Band, with guests Dr John, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Bob Dylan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing in The Last Waltz with the Band, with guests Dr John, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Bob Dylan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a moment I consider telling him to grow up. But I am chastened by the presence of his managers. Instead I look him in the eye and tell him that I am not trying to psychoanalyse him, that his music has simply meant more to me than any other throughout my life. There is something that moves across his face but I could not name it. \u201cAehhh,\u201d he breathes.</p> <p>\u201cWell, shall we end it there?\u201d I say, and stand and shake his hand. As I do I look at the notepad. In the top left hand corner he has drawn an angry rectangle.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s work has always in part been about words failing, about inarticulacy and the gulf between the emotion and the tongue. Many of his songs seem to sit at the precise point where language falls apart. The track that closed his 1979 album, Into the Music, was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8-taUiSxag\">You Know What They\u2019re Writing About</a> \u2013 a sublime six-minute rumination on love, creativity, electricity, devotion, desire and the sheer weltering force that carries us forward. It is perhaps my favourite of all his songs. Two minutes in comes one of his most extraordinary lines: \u201cWhen there\u2019s no more words left to say about love I go \u2026\u201d and then he unleashes a sound that is guttural and rousing and raw, and that we might transcribe something like so: \u201cneeeeeeheeeheeeaaaghhhhheheh.\u201d It is a sound that says more about his music, his life, his psychology than he did in the entire 16 minutes and 28 seconds I spent in his company; a sound he does not have to explain.</p> <p><em>Three Chords and the Truth is out now on Exile.</em></p>",

It\u2019s just, it\u2019s just \u2026 it\u2019s just music, that\u2019s all it is.\u201d I do not for one moment believe him. I\u2019m not really sure there is \u201cjust music\u201d for anyone, least of all Morrison. He is under no obligation to share any of that with journalists, of course \u2013 his music undoubtedly speaks for itself. But I\u2019m sure there is a kinder and more graceful way of declining. \u201cYou\u2019re making a big thing about it and it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do. I don\u2019t know what you do, you\u2019re probably a journalist, that\u2019s what you do.\u201d This is not about me, I tell him. \u201cWell, what are ya? Are you a journalist, what are ya?\u201d He looks at me with a kind of disdain. I dutifully reel off the various components of my career. \u201cOK, well, I do music,\u201d he says. \u201cI sing and I write songs and I do gigs. So to me that\u2019s not interesting. You\u2019re trying to make it very, very interesting and something it\u2019s not. Playing gigs is very practical. It\u2019s very repetitive. And it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ve been doing it all my life.\u201d For a moment I consider telling him to grow up. But I am chastened by the presence of his managers. Instead I look him in the eye and tell him that I am not trying to psychoanalyse him, that his music has simply meant more to me than any other throughout my life. There is something that moves across his face but I could not name it. \u201cAehhh,\u201d he breathes. \u201cWell, shall we end it there?\u201d I say, and stand and shake his hand. As I do I look at the notepad. In the top left hand corner he has drawn an angry rectangle. Morrison\u2019s work has always in part been about words failing, about inarticulacy and the gulf between the emotion and the tongue. Many of his songs seem to sit at the precise point where language falls apart. The track that closed his 1979 album, Into the Music, was You Know What They\u2019re Writing About \u2013 a sublime six-minute rumination on love, creativity, electricity, devotion, desire and the sheer weltering force that carries us forward. It is perhaps my favourite of all his songs. Two minutes in comes one of his most extraordinary lines: \u201cWhen there\u2019s no more words left to say about love I go \u2026\u201d and then he unleashes a sound that is guttural and rousing and raw, and that we might transcribe something like so: \u201cneeeeeeheeeheeeaaaghhhhheheh.\u201d It is a sound that says more about his music, his life, his psychology than he did in the entire 16 minutes and 28 seconds I spent in his company; a sound he does not have to explain. Three Chords and the Truth is out now on Exile.",

The All Black was on holiday whitebait fishing in 2011 when he got the call to join the All Blacks, who were favourites to win the final on home soil, amid an injury crisis. He ended up on the bench in the final, just as Spencer will be, and when fly-half Aaron Cruden was struck down in the first half he came on to kick the decisive penalty that defeated France to win a nail-biting World Cup final by a solitary point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/31/england-team-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-final\">England's team-sheet tells South Africa: we're not scared of you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spencer is a proficient goalkicker but while that role is unlikely to come his way with Owen Farrell, George Ford and Elliot Daly all ahead of him in the pecking order, he is set for a fourth cap and World Cup debut from the bench in the most demanding of circumstances against the Springboks at the Yokohama International Stadium on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite have a Stephen Donald story on a boat, fishing,\u201d said Spencer, 27. \u201cI was just at home, feeding the kids, then got the phone call. They are a bit too young to understand but my partner was thrilled. I don\u2019t think [it has sunk in yet]. I\u2019ve not really had the chance to process the whole situation yet. It\u2019s been a crazy few days and a brilliant few days.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer did however, have an inkling that the phone call might come.

      "bodyText": "By his own admission it has been a crazy few days for the England rugby player Ben Spencer. He seems almost sheepish when he says that his is not quite the Cinderella story famously told by the former New Zealand World Cup winner Stephen Donald \u2013 \u201cI was just at home, feeding the kids\u201d \u2013 but Spencer is nonetheless on the brink of his own fairytale ahead of Saturday\u2019s final against South Africa. When Spencer arrived in Japan on Monday the 27-year-old scrum-half was greeted by England\u2019s head coach, Eddie Jones, who straight away reminded him of Donald\u2019s story. The All Black was on holiday whitebait fishing in 2011 when he got the call to join the All Blacks, who were favourites to win the final on home soil, amid an injury crisis. He ended up on the bench in the final, just as Spencer will be, and when fly-half Aaron Cruden was struck down in the first half he came on to kick the decisive penalty that defeated France to win a nail-biting World Cup final by a solitary point. Spencer is a proficient goalkicker but while that role is unlikely to come his way with Owen Farrell, George Ford and Elliot Daly all ahead of him in the pecking order, he is set for a fourth cap and World Cup debut from the bench in the most demanding of circumstances against the Springboks at the Yokohama International Stadium on Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t quite have a Stephen Donald story on a boat, fishing,\u201d said Spencer, 27. \u201cI was just at home, feeding the kids, then got the phone call. They are a bit too young to understand but my partner was thrilled. I don\u2019t think [it has sunk in yet]. I\u2019ve not really had the chance to process the whole situation yet. It\u2019s been a crazy few days and a brilliant few days.\u201d Spencer did however, have an inkling that the phone call might come. In the closing stages of England\u2019s semi-final victory over the back-to-back world champion\u2019s New Zealand, Willi Heinz, picked ahead of Spencer as the second scrum-half by Jones, sustained a hamstring injury.

J\u00fcrgen Klopp is not thought to favour a suggestion that Liverpool could use two entirely separate teams playing on the same night if necessary to get the Villa game out of the way while the senior side are in Qatar for the Club World Cup. The Liverpool manager suggested after the dramatic win against Arsenal that his side might pull out of the Carabao Cup if a suitable date could not be arranged, because the original scheduling for the quarter-final clashed with commitments between 18-21 December. Both sides accept the Villa game cannot be played on the original date but, with the midweek calendar full until the end of the year, the first viable opportunity is the January slot earmarked for the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-finals. There are two midweek dates set aside for Carabao Cup games in January, and with some reshuffling it ought to be possible to use those, with a date in February likely to be found for the second leg of the semi involving Villa or Liverpool. The EFL is understood to have been in discussions with Liverpool about the various possibilities before the game against Arsenal, and was a little surprised when Klopp made his off-the-cuff comments afterwards.

One is the winter break or free weekend in February, the other is the recent Premier League decision to bring a round of midweek matches forward to leave more space for clubs with European commitments, which has had the effect of pushing the Carabao Cup quarter-finals further back in the calendar. The Club World Cup is not the problem; Chelsea and Manchester United competed in the Fifa event in 2012 and 2008 respectively while still involved in the League Cup and Champions League without running into the sort of fixture pile-up Liverpool are encountering. What is different this season is the Carabao Cup quarters are closer to Christmas, as they have been for several years, and a Premier League club are involved in the Club World Cup for the first time since 2012. Liverpool and the EFL are confident the Carabao Cup final can go ahead on 1 March as originally planned, though a complex situation will become even more tangled should Liverpool or Villa end up with an FA Cup replay to fit in after the third-round games over the first weekend in January. Although delaying the Villa tie until 8 January is Liverpool\u2019s preferred option, they feel a quarter-final then may overshadow the FA Cup third-round match and influence team selection for the older competition, although that would have been the case anyway for the four teams through to the semi-finals under the original schedule.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell has reported a 15% slump in profits for the last quarter at a time of lower oil prices and a weaker global economy. The company made $4.8bn (\u00a33.7bn) in the past three months, compared with $5.6bn in the same period last year, and warned it may miss targets to reduce debt and pay back shareholders. Earlier this week, BP reported a sharp fall in profits for the same period, from $3.8bn a year earlier to $2.3bn. Oil analysts expect company profits to be weaker across the industry after global prices fell to an average of $62 a barrel in the last quarter, from more than $75 a barrel a year ago, due to worries over the sluggish global economy. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said weak macroeconomic conditions and a challenging outlook for the global economy and oil market prices would \u201cinevitably create uncertainty\u201d about the pace of Shell\u2019s financial goals. Shares in Shell fell 3% in early trading in London. The company had planned to cut its debt to a quarter of earnings and spend $25bn buying back the shares it offered shareholders in lieu of dividends over recent years by the end of 2020. Jessica Uhl, the chief financial officer of Shell, said she had \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d that Shell would meet its ambitious financial targets, but that they were always contingent on oil market conditions. If oil and gas market prices remain sluggish this could set Shell\u2019s plans back by between $8bn to $9bn and delay the 2020 timeline, Uhl said. Shell had expected oil prices to average $65 a barrel this year, but prices have remained below this level for much of the year due to uncertainty over the world\u2019s future demand for energy. Oil market traders fear a global economic slowdown, triggered by the US-China trade war, will dent demand for oil. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d Uhl added. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the last year, we\u2019ve seen oil prices start at $55, reach $85 and then trend lower again.\u201d The uncertainty is a blow to his ambitions to create a \u201cworld-class investment case\u201d for the company while strengthening Shell\u2019s \u201csocietal licence to operate\u201d by helping tackle climate change. Shell has made bold promises to become the world\u2019s biggest electricity company in a radical move towards clean energy. But a Guardian investigation this month revealed Shell also plans to increase its fossil fuel output by 38% by 2030, by raising crude oil production by more than half and gas production by more than a quarter. The fossil fuel binge is forecast to take place despite efforts to limit global heating to 1.5C by the end of the next decade to prevent runaway climate chaos. The company has produced on average 3.6m barrels of oil equivalent a day this year, in line with oil and gas production last year.",

      "bodyText": "Selfridges has opened its first permanent space dedicated to secondhand clothing, reflecting a significant shift in the fashion industry\u2019s approach to \u201cpre-loved\u201d goods. The glossy boutique \u2013 which is run by the resale site Vestiaire Collective and housed at Selfridges\u2019 flagship store on Oxford Street in central London \u2013 feels as aspirational as any of the traditional designer concessions around it. Pearl-studded Nicholas Kirkwood shoes (\u00a3200) and round, oxblood Mulberry bags (\u00a3465) are displayed in an uncluttered, brightly lit space that also features a rack beneath a backlit sign inviting customers to deposit items to sell. Among a handful of expensive, rare pieces \u2013 such as a red-velvet Gucci suit designed during Tom Ford\u2019s time as creative director, on sale for an eye-watering \u00a34,275 \u2013 there are high-end items available at Zara-level prices, including a pair of Acne jeans for \u00a345. The secondhand luxury shopping market is predicted to grow 12% year on year, compared with 3% growth for the luxury market overall. \u201cThe customer mindset has changed,\u201d said Fanny Moizant, the co-founder and president of Vestiaire Collective. \u201cIn the car industry, it is perfectly normal for customers to ask themselves \u2013 do I buy new or secondhand? I think in a few years we will have the same mindset around fashion. \u201cFashion is so polarised. The \u00a31 T-shirt shouldn\u2019t exist. At the same time, luxury pieces are so expensive. Resale makes luxury fashion accessible to the middle classes. \u201cOur affordable luxury brands such as Maje and Sandro are at fast-fashion prices when they are resold secondhand.\u201d Selfridges is one of several traditional luxury brands that has moved beyond viewing resale as a threat. Ralph Lauren, for example, has launched \u201cRe/Sourced\u201d, a collection of vintage products sourced by sellers on the resale app Depop. The items are available in the brand\u2019s main store, on New Bond Street in central London. At odds with received wisdom about \u201cretail therapy\u201d and the thrill of the purchase, Vestiaire Collective\u2019s members suggests that the resale trend speaks to a different set of modern aspirations. In a survey, 54% of its customers said they bought and sold on Vestiaire Collective because they wanted to shop more sustainably, while 66% said they were drawn by \u201cthe thrill of selling pieces they no longer wear\u201d. But while secondhand fashion generally makes designer brands accessible to more shoppers, in the world of limited-edition trainers the opposite is true. One pair of Nike shoes on sale at the concession originally retailed at about \u00a3120, but are now being sold for \u00a3910.",

      "body": "<p>Romelu Lukaku\u2019s best goal yet for Internazionale. Cristiano Ronaldo bagging a 95th-minute winner to put Juventus back on top of the table. Six players sent off in an evening, and Carlo Ancelotti seeing red, too, after his Napoli team blew their second lead of the night against Atalanta. Serie A\u2019s midweek round was certainly eventful.</p> \n<p>We will get to all the stories mentioned above, but this also feels like a moment when we need to talk about Chris Smalling. He scored his first Serie A goal on Wednesday, the second of four in Roma\u2019s romp past Udinese. The strike itself was nothing special \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAZoAQENd3I&amp;t=1m6s\">not even the best of the night</a> by a centre-back playing for a club from Italy\u2019s capital \u2013 but it was a moment to cherish for a player who has relaunched his career superbly in Italy over the past couple of months.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAZoAQENd3I\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MAZoAQENd3I?start=66&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=66\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Smalling\u2019s arrival in late August felt like an afterthought. Roma had been working throughout the transfer window to reinforce a defence that conceded 48 goals last season, and which lost its one reliable performer when Napoli triggered Kostas Manolas\u2019s release clause.</p> \n<p>Gianluca Mancini was signed from Atalanta \u2013 a richly-talented 23-year-old who had won his first senior Italy caps earlier in the year \u2013 but attempts to bring in an experienced partner to play alongside him were less successful. Roma landed on Smalling only after having bids for Toby Alderweireld and Dejan Lovren turned down. Fiorentina\u2019s German Pezzella and Juventus\u2019s Daniele Rugani were also considered, but in both cases the asking price was too high.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/31/nabil-fekir-rubi-and-a-picture-that-sums-up-sport-real-betis-celta-vigo-la-liga-sid-lowe\">Nabil Fekir, Rub\u00ed and a picture that sums up sport | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Perhaps it was all for the best. Smalling came cheap \u2013 the fee has been reported at \u20ac3m for a one-year loan \u2013 and has quickly become a fixture of Roma\u2019s starting XI. More than that, he is playing well. Through six Serie A appearances, no opponent has dribbled past him, and he has succeeded with 100% of his attempted tackles.</p> \n<p>He is well-suited to the style of football preferred by Paulo Fonseca. The Roma manager, hired from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer, prefers a high defensive line, making pace an essential trait for his centre-backs. Smalling told Roma\u2019s club website this month that he has enjoyed being placed in individual duels.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn England quite often you have to deal with just one striker, so you\u2019ve got your other central defender covering you \u2013 whereas often here you can be left two-on-two a lot of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more runs in behind being made too \u2026 I\u2019m enjoying it \u2013 because I quite like a tussle and a sprint against the striker. It definitely suits my game.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fonseca\u2019s Roma are a team in evolution, still adapting to the coach\u2019s ideas. Early in the season, the commitment to pressing opponents inside their own half bordered on the reckless, leading to chaotic end-to-end matches against Genoa and Sassuolo. More recently, there has been greater balance, though that is aided too by Smalling\u2019s recovery speed \u2013 a sharp contrast with the week-one starter, Juan Jesus.</p> \n<p>That the Englishman is taking on his coaches\u2019 instructions is evident in other areas, too. When Edin Dzeko scored Roma\u2019s opener against Milan at the weekend, it was with the assistance of a well-choreographed crossing run from Smalling, to take out his marker at a corner.</p> \n<p>Conversely, his most frustrating moment to date only won him more sympathy from Roma\u2019s supporters. Smalling was adjudged to have given away a penalty in the 90th minute of his team\u2019s Europa League game against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, allowing the Germans to equalise. In reality, the ball hit him in the face. Social media was awash <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roma_barilla/status/1187459707264483331\">with surrealist memes</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/roma_barilla/status/1187459707264483331\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"it\" dir=\"ltr\">Ciao sono Smalling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UEFAcom_it?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UEFAcom_it</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DZ8HkEdzlk\">pic.twitter.com/DZ8HkEdzlk</a></p>\u2014 Roma Barilla (@roma_barilla) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roma_barilla/status/1187459707264483331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Even putting his goal to one side, Smalling played well again on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "Romelu Lukaku\u2019s best goal yet for Internazionale. Cristiano Ronaldo bagging a 95th-minute winner to put Juventus back on top of the table. Six players sent off in an evening, and Carlo Ancelotti seeing red, too, after his Napoli team blew their second lead of the night against Atalanta. Serie A\u2019s midweek round was certainly eventful. We will get to all the stories mentioned above, but this also feels like a moment when we need to talk about Chris Smalling. He scored his first Serie A goal on Wednesday, the second of four in Roma\u2019s romp past Udinese. The strike itself was nothing special \u2013 not even the best of the night by a centre-back playing for a club from Italy\u2019s capital \u2013 but it was a moment to cherish for a player who has relaunched his career superbly in Italy over the past couple of months. Smalling\u2019s arrival in late August felt like an afterthought. Roma had been working throughout the transfer window to reinforce a defence that conceded 48 goals last season, and which lost its one reliable performer when Napoli triggered Kostas Manolas\u2019s release clause. Gianluca Mancini was signed from Atalanta \u2013 a richly-talented 23-year-old who had won his first senior Italy caps earlier in the year \u2013 but attempts to bring in an experienced partner to play alongside him were less successful. Roma landed on Smalling only after having bids for Toby Alderweireld and Dejan Lovren turned down. Fiorentina\u2019s German Pezzella and Juventus\u2019s Daniele Rugani were also considered, but in both cases the asking price was too high. Perhaps it was all for the best. Smalling came cheap \u2013 the fee has been reported at \u20ac3m for a one-year loan \u2013 and has quickly become a fixture of Roma\u2019s starting XI. More than that, he is playing well. Through six Serie A appearances, no opponent has dribbled past him, and he has succeeded with 100% of his attempted tackles. He is well-suited to the style of football preferred by Paulo Fonseca. The Roma manager, hired from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer, prefers a high defensive line, making pace an essential trait for his centre-backs. Smalling told Roma\u2019s club website this month that he has enjoyed being placed in individual duels. \u201cIn England quite often you have to deal with just one striker, so you\u2019ve got your other central defender covering you \u2013 whereas often here you can be left two-on-two a lot of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more runs in behind being made too \u2026 I\u2019m enjoying it \u2013 because I quite like a tussle and a sprint against the striker. It definitely suits my game.\u201d Fonseca\u2019s Roma are a team in evolution, still adapting to the coach\u2019s ideas. Early in the season, the commitment to pressing opponents inside their own half bordered on the reckless, leading to chaotic end-to-end matches against Genoa and Sassuolo. More recently, there has been greater balance, though that is aided too by Smalling\u2019s recovery speed \u2013 a sharp contrast with the week-one starter, Juan Jesus. That the Englishman is taking on his coaches\u2019 instructions is evident in other areas, too. When Edin Dzeko scored Roma\u2019s opener against Milan at the weekend, it was with the assistance of a well-choreographed crossing run from Smalling, to take out his marker at a corner. Conversely, his most frustrating moment to date only won him more sympathy from Roma\u2019s supporters. Smalling was adjudged to have given away a penalty in the 90th minute of his team\u2019s Europa League game against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, allowing the Germans to equalise. In reality, the ball hit him in the face. Social media was awash with surrealist memes. Even putting his goal to one side, Smalling played well again on Wednesday. His centre-back partner Federico Fazio was harshly sent off after half an hour following a coming-together with Stefano Okaka, but Roma, already a goal up by that stage, rarely looked in danger of conceding after they were reduced to 10 men. Mancini, who started in midfield, dropped back into defence in what became a 4-4-1, but the Giallorossi continued to dictate the play. Smalling made the score 2-0 when he pounced on Kevin Lasagna\u2019s uncertain touch at a corner, jabbing the ball home at the back post. Justin Kluivert and Aleksandar Kolarov completed the rout. Asked afterwards whether his loan move to Roma could become permanent, Smalling deferred, saying that: \u201cAnything could happen.\u201d The club, at least, are keen, with the sporting director, Gianluca Petrachi, suggesting that he would open discussions with United if the player wanted to stay. Victory moved Roma up to fourth, an impressive position when set against their lengthy injury list. Bryan Cristante, Lorenzo Pellegrini, Amadou Diawara, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Davide Zappacosta and Nikola Kalinic are all presently sidelined. Edin Dzeko has been playing in a protective face mask after fracturing his cheekbone. Despite it all, they are now ahead of Napoli \u2013 whose draw against Atalanta arrived in controversial circumstances. The Partenopei were leading 2-1 in the 85th minute when Simon Kjaer rugby-tackled Fernando Llorente in the penalty area. Play continued, and Atalanta scored at the far end. It was precisely the sort of refereeing error that VAR was designed to correct. Yet the officials in the replay booth never recommended that Piero Giacomelli conduct a pitch-side review. Some commentators have since suggested that Llorente initiated the contact with Kjaer, making it impossible to call this a \u201cclear and obvious\u201d penalty decision. This column respectfully disagrees. Asked about his red card, Ancelotti claimed the referee had asked him to help restore order among furious players. \u201cI said: \u2018Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s even a chance it could have been a penalty?\u2019 In response, he threw me out. I feel as though my professionalism has been attacked.\u201d Further contentious decisions would follow in Turin, where Juventus\u2019s winning goal came from a Ronaldo penalty which he earned for himself in second-half injury time. Antonio Sanabria\u2019s challenge was clumsy and perhaps made enough contact with the forward\u2019s shin to justify a spot-kick. But Ronaldo\u2019s delayed reaction and exaggerated fall, deliberately kicking out his back leg, looked more ridiculous with each repeat viewing. The second booking collected by Genoa\u2019s Francesco Cassata earlier in the match, furthermore, was hard to justify. It all added up to a bullet dodged by Juventus \u2013 wearing a bizarre fourth-kit with fluorescent green sponsor\u2019s logo \u2013 who did not play at all well. Nor, truthfully, did Inter in their victory over Brescia on Tuesday. The goals of Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, who opened the scoring with a heavily deflected shot, are covering a lot of ills for Antonio Conte\u2019s team. Yet the Belgian\u2019s run to celebrate with his manager, after bending his shot into the far corner from 20 yards, felt like the key visual from this game. Conte, just like Fonseca with Smalling at Roma, is getting the most out of a player who Manchester United were only too happy to discard.",

      "bodyText": "The number of suicides among offenders who were being managed in the community has risen by a fifth in the past year against a backdrop of criticism of the probation service. Figures released by the Ministry of Justice show the number of self-inflicted deaths increased by 19% from 283 in 2017-18 to 337 in 2018-19, and made up 31% of all deaths of offenders in the community. In 2018-19, there were 1,093 deaths of offenders in the community, up 13% from 964 in the previous year. The number of deaths from natural causes rose by 7% from 308 in 2017-18 to 331 in 2018-19, and made up 30% of all deaths. The probation sector in England and Wales was overhauled in 2014 by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling. Ignoring significant warnings from within the MoJ, he broke up probation trusts and replaced them with a public sector service to deal with high-risk offenders and community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) that manage low- to medium-risk offenders. In May, the then justice secretary, David Gauke, announced the supervision of all offenders in the community would be renationalised. Deborah Coles, the executive director of Inquest, a charity that provides expertise on state-related deaths, said: \u201cThese figures are deeply disturbing and require urgent scrutiny due to the current lack of independent investigation. What is known is that people are being released into failing support systems, poverty and an absence of services for mental health and addictions. This is state abandonment. This is the violence of austerity.\u201d In a separate dataset, the MoJ revealed the number of self-harm incidents in prisons was at a record high. There were 60,594 in the 12 months to June 2019, up 22% from the same period in the previous year. In the past quarter, the number of incidents increased by 13% to a record high of 16,342. There were 34,112 incidents of assault in the year ending in June, up 5% on the previous year. But there was a slight drop of 1% in the latest quarter to 8,360 incidents. Attacks on staff rose by 10% from the previous 12 months, with 10,424 assaults recorded. The number of deaths in custody fell by 5% in the 12 months to September, from 325 to 308. Of these, 90 were thought to be self-inflicted. The government is planning to keep some offenders in prison for longer, increasing the automatic release point for some violent and sexual offences from halfway to two-thirds through their sentences. Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \u201cHow can any government contemplate sending more people to prison on ever longer sentences when it is failing so completely to meet its duty of care to the individuals involved? \u201cThese terrible figures show that the prison system is not in recovery. Politically motivated announcements over the summer can only make the situation even worse, and the justice committee\u2019s scathing report today correctly shows that the government has no plan to deal with the consequences. In prison, those consequences can be a matter of life and death.\u201d Boris Johnson made a number of announcements on prisons investment shortly after taking office as prime minister, but these were criticised on Thursday by MPs on the justice committee as \u201cpolicy by press notice\u201d with no clear vision for the future of the prison system. An MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cWe know that levels of violence and self-harm in prisons are unacceptably high, but we remain determined to make progress so that our jails reform offenders, reduce reoffending and keep the public safe. \u201cOur \u00a32.75bn investment will modernise jails and step up security to stop the flow of drugs and weapons which fuel these issues.

Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are considered to be a recession.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. Several key activities are not counted, such as unpaid work in the home.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The ONS uses three measures that should, in theory, add up to the same number.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 The value of all goods and services produced \u2013 known as the output or production measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of the income generated from company profits and wages \u2013 known as the income measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas \u2013 known as the expenditure measure.</p>\n    <p>Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which accounts for how the economy is performing after inflation.</p>\n    <p>Britain's government statistics body, the&nbsp;Office for National Statistics, produces GDP figures on a monthly basis about six weeks after the end of the month. It compares the change in GDP month on month, as well as over a three-month period.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The ONS warns that changes on the month can prove volatile, preferring to assess economic performance over a three-month period as the wider period can smooth over irregularities.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The most closely watched GDP figures are for the four quarters of the year; for the three months to March, June, September and December.</p>\n    <p>The figures are usually revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and the government becomes available.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>The ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here.

      "body": "<p>Maybe the best way to grasp what happened on Wednesday night and what it meant is to pause it and watch it back again frame by frame, a thousand things <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189690522870460416?s=20\">in a single shot</a>, a thousand more in the next. Look at Celta de Vigo: you can actually pinpoint the second where their hearts rip in half. It\u2019s the same second when life floods back into Betis. The clock shows 89.47 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189693429099438082?s=20\">and the ball drops to Nabil Fekir</a>, near the penalty spot. Stop it there: everyone\u2019s looking at him, close. Only Iago Aspas isn\u2019t in the area. Of those that are, only Stanislav Lobotka isn\u2019t on him. Just to his right is Sergio Bermejo. The rest stand before him and salvation: Hugo Mallo, N\u00e9stor Araujo, Joseph Aidoo, David Junc\u00e0, Gabriel Fern\u00e1ndez, Fran Beltr\u00e1n, Brais Mendez and Rub\u00e9n Blanco. In front of him, a line of five men. Behind them, two more. And behind <em>them</em>, another.</p> \n<p>Press play and somehow Fekir\u2019s shot finds a way through them all and into the net.</p> \n<p>Pause it again. Aspas, in shot now, pulls his shirt to his face. Junc\u00e0 slips to his knees, arms out. Blanco turns to the sky. Lobotka is bent over, staring at the ground, beaten. They all are. Now let it run. Let Fekir run, faster than he thought possible in those final desperate, exhausting minutes. Teammates chase. Turn the volume up, the noise. Pointing, Fekir sprints towards the touchline. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189692025203052544?s=20\">He slides to his knees</a> and into the wide, welcoming arms of the Betis manager Joan Francesc Ferrer \u2018Rub\u00ed\u2019 and four of his staff, led by the goalkeeper coach Diego Tuero. Emerson bundles in, E Royal on his shirt, and then Joaqu\u00edn. The physio is there, in blue rubber gloves. Rub\u00ed\u2019s face looks like it might crack open, holding Fekir. In a green tracksuit behind, the assistant Jaume Torras looks like he\u2019s seen something. Maybe it\u2019s Fran Escrib\u00e1, the Celta coach, a little further down the line.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189692703400960001\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What a photo <a href=\"https://t.co/Wdd0piKknI\">https://t.co/Wdd0piKknI</a></p>\u2014 Sid Lowe (@sidlowe) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189692703400960001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s all there in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189692703400960001?s=20\">an extraordinary photo</a>, which is soon shared on the Betis coaching staff\u2019s mobile group: a portrait of what football is and what they had been through together, a picture of suffering but also hope. Relief, maybe revival. Something to hold on to the way they hold on to each other. A similar shot is being prepared for <a href=\"https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/fichajes/2019/10/30/portada-estadio/249858.html\">the cover of Estadio Deportivo</a> and every one of the sports dailies do the same, the pictures in Marca, AS, Mundo Deportivo and Sport <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189797386471772160?s=20\">all variations on the same theme</a>. \u201cThis one is for you,\u201d the headline on the front of Estadio Deportivo says. For Rub\u00ed.</p> \n<p>Betis v Celta was supposed to be the end, one way or other. Escrib\u00e1 and Rub\u00ed were under pressure, on the verge of the sack 11 weeks into the season, parallel lives that finally met. When the managers spoke about each other in the build-up, they were speaking about themselves, too. \u201cThese are two squads who aren\u2019t where they could be. I\u2019m convinced that both will end up more or less where they should be,\u201d Rub\u00ed said. \u201cIn terms of potential, strength, both Betis and us are going to get out of it,\u201d Escrib\u00e1 agreed. But as Diario de Sevilla put it: \u201cWinning is the only way out\u201d \u2013 and for the managers, especially.</p> \n<p>Most media were drawing on the Highlander legend: by the end, there could only be one. Celta and Betis weren\u2019t supposed to be in this position: they were built for better things, European ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re suffering a scenario we didn\u2019t expect,\u201d the Betis striker Borja Iglesias said. \u201cBoth us and Celta are big teams with lots of potential and if we can get it right, we won\u2019t have problems [with relegation].\u201d But they weren\u2019t getting it right. Celta couldn\u2019t score and Betis couldn\u2019t stop opponents scoring. At kick-off, they were 17th and 18th, level on nine points. Whoever won would pull clear of the relegation zone; whoever lost would be dragged in properly, a fight for survival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92673b0274292ae9dda5192baae322bd58c7c8cf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92673b0274292ae9dda5192baae322bd58c7c8cf/0_0_5000_2524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rub\u00ed and Fran Escrib\u00e1 before kick-off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"505\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rub\u00ed and Fran Escrib\u00e1 before kick-off.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Vidal/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The pressure built, as much in the boardrooms as on the benches, which only ever makes it worse down on the touchline. Both clubs had already started to sound out replacements, and while nothing was done or decided, while there had been no real time to change things, both had gone back to what they knew: Celta had spoken to their former coach Eduardo Berizzo, Betis were even contemplating a return for Quique Seti\u00e9n \u2013 a baffling idea, given how bitter the end had been. This was an ultimatum, or so it goes. That is how it was set up, certainly. El Faro de Vigo summed it up: \u201cMission: save Escrib\u00e1.\u201d</p> \n<p>Only one man would be left standing, they said, but as the final minutes slipped away, you wondered if both would live to die another day. Or maybe that would be it for the pair of them. Betis scored first but Celta equalised. Celta were the better team too, dominant, yet Joel Robles stood before them. Time ticked away, heading towards a 1-1 draw that was damning but might delay the inevitable. Celta sought victory more; Betis, in the words of the commentator were a <em>flan</em> \u2013 wobbly, soft, \u201changing on any way they can\u201d. Rub\u00ed waved them forward but without much conviction. Then into the 90th minute, Aidoo \u2013 you don\u2019t \u2013 made an unnecessary tackle on Diego La\u00ednez, deep in the corner, and was punished. They all were, especially Escrib\u00e1.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"837cb319c1573292c47e7bbb811527efa226ad4d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/837cb319c1573292c47e7bbb811527efa226ad4d/0_0_5000_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zou Fedal, left, and Iago Aspas battle for the ball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zou Fedal, left, and Iago Aspas battle for the ball.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Vidal/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The free-kick was taken, the ball crossed in and headed away but poorly, straight to Fekir \u2013 ready to deliver Rub\u00ed\u2019s salvation and Escrib\u00e1\u2019s sentence. Left footed, he finished it, through that burgundy barrier. \u201cThe miracle of the Villamar\u00edn,\u201d Marca called it. \u201cRub\u00ed\u2019s Betis were sunk at the bottom of the swimming pool, chained to a chair and showing signs of drowning, their attempts to break free in vain,\u201d Estadio Deportivo said, \u201cbut that was when, in a Hollywood ending, the French Houdini appeared. We\u2019d hardly seen Fekir in the second half: he must have been preparing his new trick.\u201d From somewhere, Fekir found enough energy to race to the touchline, everyone piling on, a picture that sums up sport. When finally the bodies broke, he kneeled, kissed the floor and prayed. Then he stood up, nodded and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1189692145692749824?s=20\">raised his thumbs</a>. The verdict was in.</p> \n<p>There was no time for more. At the whistle, Rub\u00ed shook Escrib\u00e1\u2019s hand, a little apologetically. Aidoo stood, a lost look on his face. Hugo Mallo crouched, just staring into space. On the touchline, the reporter was waiting. \u201cWhat a blow, right?\u201d he asked when Mallo finally reached him. There was a prolonged, uncomfortably telling silence, Mallo\u2019s eyes and mind somewhere else. \u201cYes, a big blow,\u201d he mumbled eventually. Another question, another lost response. \u201cI can\u2019t find an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cFootball is cruel. It\u2019s a pity.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1189685942472314886\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fekir's last-gasp winner sent the Benito Villamarin wild! \ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf89<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RealBetisCelta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RealBetisCelta</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uhMiWWSEqj\">pic.twitter.com/uhMiWWSEqj</a></p>\u2014 LaLiga (@LaLigaEN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1189685942472314886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Betis\u2019s fans were not fooled \u2013 there were whistles still, and chants for the board to resign \u2013 but their team had escaped and so had their manager. In celebration, they had expressed something at least, signs of life and community. \u201cWe embraced like that because we\u2019re all together, players and coaching staff,\u201d Emerson said. Feddal insisted: \u201cWe\u2019re with the manager and the manager is with us. We\u2019re doing good work, even if things aren\u2019t coming off as we would like.\u201d Now perhaps that work can continue, or perhaps not? Asked if this was a \u201cmatch ball\u201d saved, Rub\u00ed said he didn\u2019t know; it wasn\u2019t a question for him.</p> \n<p>He should at least make it to the Bernab\u00e9u on Saturday, maybe beyond. There is some willingness to believe in a coach who has done impressive things in his career, who might yet make this work, however bad it looks now, if only he can hold on. And this goal means there is a chance. Marca said Rub\u00ed had been \u201cgiven an extra life, like in a video game\u201d. \u201cFekir is Rub\u00ed\u2019s lifesaver,\u201d El Pa\u00eds said.</p> \n<p>And it is his life, too. Rub\u00ed admits that football has cost him a lot, including his marriage. \u201cYou have a passion that can break families,\u201d he has said. When he was at Benidorm, he left his three kids behind and didn\u2019t get paid. After that, he went two years without coaching, unable to find a job, but then Girona turned up just when he had been ready to give it all up and go to work in the family travel agency. He had even bought himself a suit and tie but at the last minute, he was rescued. He didn\u2019t need the suit then and he doesn\u2019t need it now either. Not yet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Once upon a time, Atl\u00e9tico 1-0 up meant game over. Not any more. And not when Lucas P\u00e9rez is around. \u00c1lvaro Morata opened the scoring and might have got a second, only to be denied by the first of two one-on-one saves from Fernando Pachecho, the goalkeeper who really should get talked about more. But Lucas scored an absolutely belting goal, turning away from one man, escaping another and bending a rocket of a shot into the far corner to secure a draw at Mendizorroza. That\u2019s his fifth in as many games, the first Alav\u00e9s player to do that since the magnificently named Wilson Alfredo Jones Rodr\u00edguez in 1953. As for Simeone he says he sees things \u201cever more clearly\u201d.

In truth, it\u2019s hard to think of many good ones. This one was, though: 22 shots, five goals by five different players, including Rodrygo and Jovic, and a very comfortable night. </p> \n<p>\u2022 Eh? That\u2019s not supposed to happen, but it did.

      "bodyText": "Maybe the best way to grasp what happened on Wednesday night and what it meant is to pause it and watch it back again frame by frame, a thousand things in a single shot, a thousand more in the next. Look at Celta de Vigo: you can actually pinpoint the second where their hearts rip in half. It\u2019s the same second when life floods back into Betis. The clock shows 89.47 and the ball drops to Nabil Fekir, near the penalty spot. Stop it there: everyone\u2019s looking at him, close. Only Iago Aspas isn\u2019t in the area. Of those that are, only Stanislav Lobotka isn\u2019t on him. Just to his right is Sergio Bermejo. The rest stand before him and salvation: Hugo Mallo, N\u00e9stor Araujo, Joseph Aidoo, David Junc\u00e0, Gabriel Fern\u00e1ndez, Fran Beltr\u00e1n, Brais Mendez and Rub\u00e9n Blanco. In front of him, a line of five men. Behind them, two more. And behind them, another. Press play and somehow Fekir\u2019s shot finds a way through them all and into the net. Pause it again. Aspas, in shot now, pulls his shirt to his face. Junc\u00e0 slips to his knees, arms out. Blanco turns to the sky. Lobotka is bent over, staring at the ground, beaten. They all are. Now let it run. Let Fekir run, faster than he thought possible in those final desperate, exhausting minutes. Teammates chase. Turn the volume up, the noise. Pointing, Fekir sprints towards the touchline. He slides to his knees and into the wide, welcoming arms of the Betis manager Joan Francesc Ferrer \u2018Rub\u00ed\u2019 and four of his staff, led by the goalkeeper coach Diego Tuero. Emerson bundles in, E Royal on his shirt, and then Joaqu\u00edn. The physio is there, in blue rubber gloves. Rub\u00ed\u2019s face looks like it might crack open, holding Fekir. In a green tracksuit behind, the assistant Jaume Torras looks like he\u2019s seen something. Maybe it\u2019s Fran Escrib\u00e1, the Celta coach, a little further down the line. It\u2019s all there in an extraordinary photo, which is soon shared on the Betis coaching staff\u2019s mobile group: a portrait of what football is and what they had been through together, a picture of suffering but also hope. Relief, maybe revival. Something to hold on to the way they hold on to each other. A similar shot is being prepared for the cover of Estadio Deportivo and every one of the sports dailies do the same, the pictures in Marca, AS, Mundo Deportivo and Sport all variations on the same theme. \u201cThis one is for you,\u201d the headline on the front of Estadio Deportivo says. For Rub\u00ed. Betis v Celta was supposed to be the end, one way or other. Escrib\u00e1 and Rub\u00ed were under pressure, on the verge of the sack 11 weeks into the season, parallel lives that finally met. When the managers spoke about each other in the build-up, they were speaking about themselves, too. \u201cThese are two squads who aren\u2019t where they could be. I\u2019m convinced that both will end up more or less where they should be,\u201d Rub\u00ed said. \u201cIn terms of potential, strength, both Betis and us are going to get out of it,\u201d Escrib\u00e1 agreed. But as Diario de Sevilla put it: \u201cWinning is the only way out\u201d \u2013 and for the managers, especially. Most media were drawing on the Highlander legend: by the end, there could only be one. Celta and Betis weren\u2019t supposed to be in this position: they were built for better things, European ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re suffering a scenario we didn\u2019t expect,\u201d the Betis striker Borja Iglesias said. \u201cBoth us and Celta are big teams with lots of potential and if we can get it right, we won\u2019t have problems [with relegation].\u201d But they weren\u2019t getting it right. Celta couldn\u2019t score and Betis couldn\u2019t stop opponents scoring. At kick-off, they were 17th and 18th, level on nine points. Whoever won would pull clear of the relegation zone; whoever lost would be dragged in properly, a fight for survival. The pressure built, as much in the boardrooms as on the benches, which only ever makes it worse down on the touchline. Both clubs had already started to sound out replacements, and while nothing was done or decided, while there had been no real time to change things, both had gone back to what they knew: Celta had spoken to their former coach Eduardo Berizzo, Betis were even contemplating a return for Quique Seti\u00e9n \u2013 a baffling idea, given how bitter the end had been. This was an ultimatum, or so it goes. That is how it was set up, certainly. El Faro de Vigo summed it up: \u201cMission: save Escrib\u00e1.\u201d Only one man would be left standing, they said, but as the final minutes slipped away, you wondered if both would live to die another day. Or maybe that would be it for the pair of them. Betis scored first but Celta equalised. Celta were the better team too, dominant, yet Joel Robles stood before them. Time ticked away, heading towards a 1-1 draw that was damning but might delay the inevitable. Celta sought victory more; Betis, in the words of the commentator were a flan \u2013 wobbly, soft, \u201changing on any way they can\u201d. Rub\u00ed waved them forward but without much conviction. Then into the 90th minute, Aidoo \u2013 you don\u2019t \u2013 made an unnecessary tackle on Diego La\u00ednez, deep in the corner, and was punished. They all were, especially Escrib\u00e1. The free-kick was taken, the ball crossed in and headed away but poorly, straight to Fekir \u2013 ready to deliver Rub\u00ed\u2019s salvation and Escrib\u00e1\u2019s sentence. Left footed, he finished it, through that burgundy barrier. \u201cThe miracle of the Villamar\u00edn,\u201d Marca called it. \u201cRub\u00ed\u2019s Betis were sunk at the bottom of the swimming pool, chained to a chair and showing signs of drowning, their attempts to break free in vain,\u201d Estadio Deportivo said, \u201cbut that was when, in a Hollywood ending, the French Houdini appeared. We\u2019d hardly seen Fekir in the second half: he must have been preparing his new trick.\u201d From somewhere, Fekir found enough energy to race to the touchline, everyone piling on, a picture that sums up sport. When finally the bodies broke, he kneeled, kissed the floor and prayed. Then he stood up, nodded and raised his thumbs. The verdict was in. There was no time for more. At the whistle, Rub\u00ed shook Escrib\u00e1\u2019s hand, a little apologetically. Aidoo stood, a lost look on his face. Hugo Mallo crouched, just staring into space. On the touchline, the reporter was waiting. \u201cWhat a blow, right?\u201d he asked when Mallo finally reached him. There was a prolonged, uncomfortably telling silence, Mallo\u2019s eyes and mind somewhere else. \u201cYes, a big blow,\u201d he mumbled eventually. Another question, another lost response. \u201cI can\u2019t find an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cFootball is cruel. It\u2019s a pity.\u201d Betis\u2019s fans were not fooled \u2013 there were whistles still, and chants for the board to resign \u2013 but their team had escaped and so had their manager. In celebration, they had expressed something at least, signs of life and community. \u201cWe embraced like that because we\u2019re all together, players and coaching staff,\u201d Emerson said. Feddal insisted: \u201cWe\u2019re with the manager and the manager is with us. We\u2019re doing good work, even if things aren\u2019t coming off as we would like.\u201d Now perhaps that work can continue, or perhaps not? Asked if this was a \u201cmatch ball\u201d saved, Rub\u00ed said he didn\u2019t know; it wasn\u2019t a question for him. He should at least make it to the Bernab\u00e9u on Saturday, maybe beyond. There is some willingness to believe in a coach who has done impressive things in his career, who might yet make this work, however bad it looks now, if only he can hold on. And this goal means there is a chance. Marca said Rub\u00ed had been \u201cgiven an extra life, like in a video game\u201d. \u201cFekir is Rub\u00ed\u2019s lifesaver,\u201d El Pa\u00eds said. And it is his life, too. Rub\u00ed admits that football has cost him a lot, including his marriage. \u201cYou have a passion that can break families,\u201d he has said. When he was at Benidorm, he left his three kids behind and didn\u2019t get paid. After that, he went two years without coaching, unable to find a job, but then Girona turned up just when he had been ready to give it all up and go to work in the family travel agency. He had even bought himself a suit and tie but at the last minute, he was rescued. He didn\u2019t need the suit then and he doesn\u2019t need it now either. Not yet. Talking points \u2022 Once upon a time, Atl\u00e9tico 1-0 up meant game over. Not any more. And not when Lucas P\u00e9rez is around. \u00c1lvaro Morata opened the scoring and might have got a second, only to be denied by the first of two one-on-one saves from Fernando Pachecho, the goalkeeper who really should get talked about more. But Lucas scored an absolutely belting goal, turning away from one man, escaping another and bending a rocket of a shot into the far corner to secure a draw at Mendizorroza. That\u2019s his fifth in as many games, the first Alav\u00e9s player to do that since the magnificently named Wilson Alfredo Jones Rodr\u00edguez in 1953. As for Simeone he says he sees things \u201cever more clearly\u201d. And what he sees doesn\u2019t look good. \u2022 Two assists, two goals, both stupidly good and yet so very seen before, and two nutmegs \u2013 one of them with a pass. That Lionel Messi can play a bit, eh? \u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Zidane said when he was asked if Real Madrid\u2019s 5-0 win over Legan\u00e9s was Madrid\u2019s best game of the season, but it\u2019s hard to think of a better one. In truth, it\u2019s hard to think of many good ones. This one was, though: 22 shots, five goals by five different players, including Rodrygo and Jovic, and a very comfortable night. \u2022 Eh? That\u2019s not supposed to happen, but it did. Levante beat Real Sociedad at Anoeta, the win set up by a superb dinked finish from Bardhi.",

And well, here we are: Greinke is getting set to start in a bid to bring a second title to Houston in three seasons. </p> \n  <p>The Dodgers, one of Greinke\u2019s old teams, did a similar thing with Yu Darvish in 2017, trading for the Japanese-Persian hurler in mid-season to bolster their chances in the playoffs. Darvish infamously didn\u2019t get out of the second inning against the Astros in Game 7, allowing five runs, four earned. It was ugly. </p> \n  <p>Can Greinke outdo Darvish in a similar spot? Well, Greinke has been inconsistent in the playoffs, sliding somewhere between champagne and BabyCham. Greinke was good in his last outing against Washington, allowing just one run in seven innings. But against the Rays he allowed six runs in 3.2 innings pitched. In 2017, while with the Diamondbacks, he was shelled in starts v Colorado and Los Angeles. </p> \n  <p>Overall, as good as Greinke has been throughout his career, I just don\u2019t trust him in a spot like this, and expect something Darvish-ish. <br></p> \n  <p>Beware. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dba18a68f08cb84c60a1c33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T23:20:07.808Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mad Max </strong></p> \n  <p>So we\u2019ve all heard the cliche about players who are so good that they could get out of bed and score 40 points or throw for 300 yards. Well, here is Max Scherzer\u2019s chance to bounce off the mattress and pitch his team to a World Series title. </p> \n  <p>On Sunday Nats ace couldn\u2019t move his neck and was suffering painful back spasms that saw him pulled from his role as Game 5 starting pitcher. Just days later, with the help of a fairly accurate cortisone shot, Scherzer is preparing to put the fortune of his ballclub on his balky back in a Game 7. </p> \n  <p>As if that wasn\u2019t enough for Washington Nationals fans to worry about, his semi-personal catcher Kurt Suzuki, continues to be sidelined with a hip flexor issue. How did Scherzer pitch this year with Gomes catching? Well, in 12 starts his ERA was 4.09. How did Scherzer throw to Suzuki? Significantly better: in 16 starts his ERA was 2.08. </p> \n  <p>On top of all this, who knows how far he can go. ESPN TV in the US spoke with Nats manager Dave Martinez a few moments ago and spoke about his pitcher. <br><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve been communicating throughout all of this, we\u2019re going to keep communicating...he gets it, he understands, he has a great game plan, we\u2019ll see how far he goes. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You\u2019d have to guess that starters Patrick Corbin and Anibal Sanchez Nats bullpen would be available early if Scherzer is off his game. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dba17588f08cb84c60a1c27\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T23:09:51.667Z\">11.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hola!</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello everybody and welcome to our Game 7 coverage!

Said the Astros skipper: \u201cAll hands on deck means most hands on deck.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Hinch said he spoke three times with Alex Bregman on Tuesday night about the third baseman carrying his bat to first base after hitting a home run in the first inning. Bregman apologized for the move after the game and the Houston manager shared what he told him about it. \u201cIt\u2019s just not how we do things and not something that was necessary,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cIt was an emotional reaction. I love the way he plays and it doesn\u2019t diminish what he brings to the table, but it was unnecessary.\u201d</li> \n   <li>Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki, who\u2019s missed the last three games while dealing with a hip flexor strain, was scratched from the starting lineup. The 36-year-old was initially listed in the starting lineup but was replaced again by Yan Gomes just under three hours before the first pitch.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dba10a88f08d669cdaaff9b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T22:44:50.966Z\">10.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">The starting lineups!</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The lineups for tonight\u2019s game are out. </strong>No major surprises here ... but there could be plenty of those ahead.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all folks The 2019 Major League Baseball season comes to a stunning conclusion as Washington win their first title with four victories on the road against a supposedly superior Houston Astros team. On behalf of fellow live-blogger Hunter Felt, we\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us for the 115th World Series: it\u2019s been a pleasure to help you follow along. And so wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon and good night. Read all about it... MVP Stephen Strasburg, who was infamously held out of the 2012 playoffs to protect his young arm, comes full circle, celebrating a World Series title and an MVP award for his two victories in the Fall Classic. It\u2019s low hanging fruit, but I\u2019m hungry. We stayed in the fight, we won the fight...the biggest thing for us is never quit. We were down 19-31, we didn\u2019t quit then and we weren\u2019t going to quit now! Dave Martinez, Nationals manager Trophy time The Nationals owners, the Lerner family, are talking about how their dream came true during the traditional post-World Series win cringe-worthy interview. Now MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is doing the same before handing the trophy off to Mike Rizzo and Dave Martinez, kicking off another celebration by the Nats. That\u2019s no way to end it? How it ended What is it about this team FOX TV\u2019s Ken Rosenthal asks Max Scherzer. One through 25, everybody, the energy, the camaraderie...everybody believed in each other. Now, who will be MVP? Soto? Rendon? Strasburg? In front of a stunned crowd in Houston, the traveling Nats brass, including GM Mike Rizzo, celebrate all around. It\u2019s the first title in DC since the American League Senators in 1924 and the first for the team that began life in Montreal in 1969. This is a team that were expected to be trounced by a team deemed superior, one seeking to put their stamp on baseball history with a second title in three seasons. But the Nats beat Cole, Greinke and Verlander, not to mention Kershaw. They won all four World Series games on the road after starting a season without their departed franchise player and opening with a 19-31 record. It is certainly one of the most improbable titles in some time. Michael Brantley strikes out swinging! THE WASHINGTON NATIONALS HAVE UPSET THE HOUSTON ASTROS IN A SEVEN-GAME WORLD SERIES WIN FOR THE AGES! Nationals 6-2 Astros, bottom 9th Now Altuve strikes out and the Astros are down to their final out! Nationals 6-2 Astros, bottom 9th Well, here goes nothing for Houston as they face Daniel Hudson, who comes on in relief for Corbin. And Springer promptly pops out to Cabrera! Washington are two outs away! Nationals 6-2 Astros, top 9th Soto flies out to center and here come the Astros needing a rally for the ages to get back into this game. The heart of their order is due up. Nationals 6-2 Astros, top 9th Rendon pops it up and Correa makes the catch on the infield. Two down for Soto. Nationals 6-2 Astros, top 9th The count is full to Rendon. From the House of Hunter Nationals 6-2 Astros, top 9th Turner is at third base after a Marisnick throwing error. So it\u2019s first and third and here comes Rendon with just one out! Eaton hammers a base hit right up the middle! Two more are coming in for DC and the Nats are up four and on the precipice of a first World Series title! Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 9th All that pitching, all that firepower, all those wins, have landed Houston on the cliffs edge. Hinch comes out top get Smith, and it\u2019s Urquidy, the hero of Game 4 (where has he been?), coming out now to face Eaton. Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 9th Smith walked him. And so the reckoning has arrived for Houston. Bases loaded and one out for Adam Eaton and Rendon on deck. Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 9th The count is full - we\u2019re eight pitches in! Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 9th Turner, who has done very little offensively this World Series, hitting .161 while playing well at shortstop, is up. He\u2019s in the hole 1-2. Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 9th Gomes bounces in front of the pitcher - Smith has it and fires to first for one, the throw to first is not in time. So Gomes reaches on a fielders choice, and it\u2019s one out and one on for Robles, who singles to center! Gomes moves up to center, and it\u2019s two on and one one now for Turner. Dangerous is this. Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 9th Sidearm pitcher Joe Smith is in and greeted with a base hit by Ryan Zimmerman. Naturally they cannot allow any more runs to score or that dome is gonna empty out lightning fast. Gomes is next. Nationals 4-2 Astros, bottom 8th It\u2019s 2-2 on the Astros center fielder and Corbin strikes him out swinging! Three scoreless innings out of the pen for Patrick Corbin, and the Astros have three outs left with the top of their lineup due up in the bottom of the ninth inning! Nationals 4-2 Astros, bottom 8th Chirinos, a ground ball deep into the hole, but the catcher is a tortoise, and Turner has plenty of time to get him. Two down and here comes Marisnick, inserted for defense earlier, to try and get something going. Nationals 4-2 Astros, bottom 8th Correa watches strike three pass on the inside corner. He has a word with home plate umpire Jim Wolf as he heads back to the dugout as frustration in Houston mounts. Robinson Chirinos is next. Nationals 4-2 Astros, bottom 8th The good news: Houston, who have left 10 runners on base tonight, are a bloop and a blast away from tying this up. But they\u2019re running out of outs as Correa steps in to face Corbin, who is still in there! The count is 2-2... Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 8th Cabrera lines out to retire the side. It could have been worse, but an important run is in for DC as Hinch insisted on pitching to Soto in a huge spot with first base open. Makes a ton of sense! Nationals 4-2 Astros, top 8th Kendrick lines a shot off the glove of Gurriel and into right field! It moves Soto to third and here comers Hinch to get Osuna! It\u2019s unraveling in a quiet Houston dome, as watchers party inside Nationals Park in DC. Ryan Pressly in in to face Cabrera. They pitched to him and Soto made them pay - a base hit to right field scores Eaton and the Nats have that insurance run they wanted. Why on earth would you let him beat you? Because Kendrick hit a home run off the foul pole? No. That is bad managing. Sorry. Hinch is not having a good game. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 8th Rendon hits it high but shallow - Marisnick is under the ball in center field and has it for the second out. Two down, and Soto is up now. I would not touch him here with a base open. Chrinios comes out to chat with Osuna before this key at-bat begins. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 8th Eaton is running, and sliding into second. The throw is high and that\u2019s a stolen base! And Eaton is no sprinter - he stole that off Osuna for sure. So that\u2019s a key maneuver because now there is a runner in scoring position as DC seek that insurance run. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 8th The count is full to Eaton and it\u2019s inside for ball four. It\u2019s a big walk because Rendon, who started the Nats resurgence with a solo shot off Greinke in the seventh, is at the plate looking for more. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 8th Turner bounces to short, easy for Correa and that\u2019s the first out. Eaton is next. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 8th Winter is coming...but not yet. Osuna is still on, he\u2019s facing Turner while Gerrit Cole warms up in the Houston bullpen. The count is full to Turner. From the House of Hunter How unfair of me to post this now... Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 7th A little bouncer to the left side of the infield. Corbin leaps off the mound and has the ball - he\u2019ll have to hurry to get Alvarez. He throws, in time! That\u2019s the third out. Two scoreless innings for Corbin in relief! Houston are down to their final six outs! Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 7th Gurriel loops a pitch from Corbin into center field and Houston have a two-out base runner with the quite capable Alvarez stepping in. It\u2019s likely Corbin\u2019s last hitter. Daniel Hudson is up and warming in the Nats bullpen. Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 7th Bregman can only offer a harmless ground ball to second base. It\u2019s easy for Cabrera who fires to first for the out. Here\u2019s Gurriel with two outs. He was a hero, putting Houston up earlier in this game, a blast that is now gone and forgotten, unless... Nationals 3-2 Astros, bottom 7th The organ appeals to the Houston faithful who try to get behind their men, down a run, late in Game 7. \u201cLet\u2019s go Astros...\u201d It\u2019s a voice lacking force however: A hit from Brantley would change all that. It\u2019s not coming from the Astros outfielder here - he pops out to left, and that\u2019s the first out of the inning. Now Bregman is up at the plate. He\u2019s playing with a heavy heart as his grandfather passed earlier today. Seventh inning stretch Let\u2019s go old school for the last seventh inning stretch of the season. Everybody up! Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Houston\u2019s fans try to rally their shocked ballclub. Goes skies a pitch to the right side of the infield. Altuve has it for the second out and now it\u2019s up to Victor Robles, who has just three hits this World Series. He flies out to right, and this inning is over. And what an inning it was - Nats up! Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Osuna comes high and tight to Gomes who leans out of the way just in time. Now Gomes fouls off a ball and it\u2019s 1-2. Big at-bat right here. Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th So here\u2019s Zimmerman with one on and one out facing Osuna, who was so wrapped in controversy along with Houston\u2019s brass, earlier in the series. And Osuna promptly walks Zimmerman. So now this could get extremely ugly with two on and one out, and Houston need a ground ball badly. Gomes is up. Baseball is cruel. Life is not fair. Greinke was absolutely incredible, and now he\u2019s not the pitcher of record. Just like that. 6.1IP 2H 2R 2ER 2BB 3SO 1HR And he was better than this... Nationals 3-2 Astros, top 7th Cabrera singles to center and AJ Hinch is coming out to get Harris! This is a stunning development! Osuna enters, and I don\u2019t know if I want my closer in down a run in the seventh, but what choice is there? KENDRICK HITS A BALL OFF THE FOUL POLE IN RIGHT FIELD! NATS LEAD! That\u2019s unbelievable! After being stymied for seven innings, Washington rally in the seventh and the Astros are how down in a game they totally controlled moments ago! It\u2019s quiet in Houston! This is when we talk about all the runners the Astros stranded throughout this game! Maybe this is why it\u2019s Harris and not Cole? Nationals 1-2 Astros, top 7th Soto should have been punched out on a called third strike low in the zone, but the ump missed it and now it\u2019s a favorable 3-1 count. He walks, and here comes the Astros manager and he\u2019s carrying a hook. Harris will come in and Greinke leaves to a raucous ovation in Houston and is greeted warmly in his dugout. So, no Cole, because he doesn\u2019t want him coming in with a man on? Rendon gets one back for Washington! The slugging third baseman destroys a Greinke pitch and sends it to deep left and the NATS HAVE LIFE! That ball was pummeled as Rendon does it again! Here comes Soto as the dance party ensues in the DC dugout. It\u2019s a one-run game 7 Nationals 0-2 Astros, top 7th So after pinch-hitting for Reddick, Marisnick stays in to field in a defense first formation - he\u2019ll play center while Springer moves to right field. Adam Eaton is up, and the count is even at 2-2. The lefty swings and bounces to short - that\u2019s routine for Correa and the outfielder is out by a step. One down, here\u2019s Rendon. Nationals 0-2 Astros, bottom 6th Ground ball to second. Cabrera has it, he steps on second for one out and fires to first in time to get Altuve! That\u2019s a huge double play and we head to the seventh. Time to count Nats outs! Nationals 0-2 Astros, bottom 6th Check swing on a ball in the dirt: did he go? Yes he did! Now there\u2019s one down for Altuve. Nationals 0-2 Astros, bottom 6th The pinch-hitting Jake Marisnick greets Corbin rudely, slapping a base hit to left to start the sixth. Now here comes the heart of the Houston lineup, which is why that first out was so important. Springer is up. Well, Dave Martinez went a little too far with Max if you ask me. Two runs in five innings after not being able to feed yourself a few days ago is a great story, but in Game 7, considering how your opponent is dealing, the leash can\u2019t be that long. 5IP 7H 2R 2ER 4BB 3SO 1HR Yes, he showed guts, but let\u2019s be honest: he danced through the rain drops all night and probably got more than a bit lucky. Nationals 0-2 Astros, top 6th There\u2019s someone dressed as an astronaut waving a giant face of Zack Greinke, and he deserves all of that of that pomp. He\u2019s through six after Turner watches strike three go by. Just one hit for Washington and just 67 pitches for Greinke. He is everything I thought he wouldn\u2019t be. I feel like I need to apologize. Zack, I am sorry. Please forgive me. Oh, here comes Patrick Corbin for Washington. Nationals 0-2 Astros, top 6th Robles, a check swing bouncer down the first base line. Gurriel is there, has it and steps on the bag. Too easy. Top of the lineup now, here\u2019s Turner who is 0-2. Nationals 0-2 Astros, top 6th Gomes is first pitch swinging and he pops to center. The Brazilian flips his bat disgusted as Springer makes the catch for the first out. Gotta at least make Greinke work a little bit. Robles is next. Nationals 0-2 Astros, bottom 5th Chirinos strikes out! Washington survive further damage. But a valuable run comes in, and with Greinke cruising and Cole lurking in the Astros bullpen, that is a valuable run indeed. From the House of Hunter Yeah, what is this 1919? Nationals 0-2 Astros, bottom 5th He looks safe to me but they\u2019re still reviewing the call in New York. The question is, did Alvarez come off the bag during the slide? The umps say no. So now it\u2019s first and third and two outs for Robinson Chirinos. Scherzer is still in there. Man, that is crazy. This is Game 7! Correa rips a ball down the right field line, that\u2019s a fair ball - it just bounced off of Rendon\u2019s glove and went into foul territory! Gurriel comes around to score - Alvarez slides into third - SAFE! They\u2019re going to review that, but did Martinez tempt fate once to often? Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 5th Correa checks and holds on a ball away to make it 1-2. Then Scherzer comes inside and misses which evens the count. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 5th Scherzer is quickly ahead on Correa 0-2...fans are up in Houston! Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 5th Alvarez, a huge cut on a 3-0 count makes it 3-1 before the Cuban draws a walk. So another situation with runners in scoring position fro Houston, which they have yet to cash in on. Where is Corbin? This is bananas. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 5th Ground ball to short - Turner runs to his right, slides, has it and throws to second for one - throw on to first, not in time. Two down on the 6-4 force play as Gurriel beats the throw and keeps the inning alive for the slugging Cuban Alvarez. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 5th Woosh! Scherzer zooms a fastball past Bregman! He\u2019s approaching 90 pitches now and has been resilient. Pretty amazing performance considering the whole not being able to raise his right arm thing. One down for Gurriel. From the House of Hunter Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 5th Bregman has just laced two foul balls. He is just missing, but down in the count 0-2. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 5th Brantley leads off with a base hit through the shift on the right side. And Gerrit Cole is getting up in the Houston bullpen. Why do the Astros have someone up before Washington? Bregman is next. Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 5th Zimmerman pops up on the right side of the infield - Gurriel is there and Greinke has five shutout innings on just 59 pitches. If you\u2019re a Houston fan, what else do you want (besides a hit with a runner in scoring position)? Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 5th Zimmerman is laughing because home plate umpire just blew a call on a ball outside and he\u2019s down in the count 0-2. Good sport is that Zimmerman. Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 5th Now Greinke is behind in the count 2-1 - Cabrera...bunts? It advances the runner, and I don\u2019t mind a bunt, but that is a bit odd considering Cabrera is a professional hitter. But when the pitcher is cruising, you need to get that runner in scoring position, I suppose. Can Zimmerman bring him in and tie up this ballgame? Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 5th It\u2019s not blow you away stuff but he\u2019s putting it where he wants to at various speeds and spins. Full count now to Kendrick... It\u2019s a borderline ball, that probably caught the bottom of the strikezone if we\u2019re being honest. So that\u2019s a rare baserunner for the Nats and here comes Asdrubal Cabrera with one out to try and make something of it. Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 5th What else can Greinke do tonight? He\u2019s facing Soto, who has the only hit for the Nats and he\u2019s already up 0-2 before throwing a fastball low. He\u2019s got no heartbeat does this Greinke, and now he gets Soto to chase: did he go? He didn\u2019t, but the umps say he did! Strike three! It\u2019s slightly unfair, but it\u2019s that kind of night for Greinke, who has it all going. Spelling lesson... Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 4th Now a ball in the dirt that Gomes blocks well. Altuve is up in the count 2-1. Then Altuve pops out to center and Robles puts it away! Huge sigh of relief that you can hear from DC, even if you\u2019re really far away. Houston are now 0-6 with runners in scoring position, which is the sort of number that only gets remembered if you lose. Scherzer is through four and has thrown 76 pitches. Patrick Corbin must stretching, somewhere, surely. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 4th A 96MPH fastball at the knees evens the count at one. Huge at-bat here in this ballgame. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 4th Trouble...Springer walks on a ball that looked like a strike. So from two outs and nobody on, to two outs and two on with Altuve coming up. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I would have someone warming in the bullpen. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just me. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 4th Reddick beats the shift, parking the baseball in right field. It\u2019s a dangerous two-out baserunner because it gives George Springer an opportunity. He\u2019s 0-2 tonight: is the third time a charm? Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 4th Correa grounds out to second as Scherzer crosses the 60 pitch mark and we\u2019re getting to the point where you\u2019re pretty happy as a Nats fan that your injury-challenged ace is holding up reasonably well. Chirinos is next and Scherzer is up in the count 0-2 before earning his first strikeout of the night on a slider in the dirt. Perhaps he\u2019s loosening up? Here\u2019s Reddick with two down. Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 4th Full count and Rendon wings awkwardly through an inside fastball and Greinke is cruising in the spotlight of a Game 7! Now, can Scherzer answer in the fourth? (I\u2019d get somebody up). From the House of Hunter Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 4th Greinke continues to deal and gets Turner to bounce back to him on one of those 70MPH curveballs. Also, Greinke, a great slide to his left to make that play. One down for Eaton, and now he bounces back to Greinke! He\u2019s doing it all on his own! Greinke leaped up to make that play on a high bouncer. Fantastic athleticism from the hurler who is an out away from facing the minimum through four - but he\u2019ll have to get past Rendon. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 3rd It\u2019s 2-2 to Alvarez. Scherzer, from the stretch, and Alvarez gets into one! It\u2019s high and far - Robles is backing up, he\u2019s on the warning track and under it - Robles makes the catch! It\u2019s long, loud out ends this third inning in Houston with the Astros stranding two! Scherzer teeters but ultimately holds steady. He\u2019s on 55 pitches. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 3rd Scherzer\u2019s 50th pitch is skied to right - that\u2019s easy for Eaton. Two down, and the runners do not advance. Here comes the power threat Alvarez. I still think Washington should have someone up, but I\u2019m a notoriously nervous blogger. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 3rd It\u2019s in the dirt - Bregman walks. That means first and second for Gurriel who had the bomb separating these two teams tonight. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 3rd Scherzer falls behind in the count 3-0 before delivering a fast ball for strike one. Now he throws over to first, not once, but twice, for a check on Altuve, who is dancing off first. Then Scherzer fires a heavy fastball at 96 to even the count... Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 3rd Brantley dumps one into left: it\u2019s dying but Soto has a beat on it and runs it down for the first out. Now the ultra-dangerous Bregman steps in to face Scherzer, which should have Nats fans quite nervous. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 3rd Altuve connects and launches a base hit just over the stretched arm of Turner at shortstop. It\u2019s a leadoff runner for Houston who Brantley stepping to the plate. When do Washington get someone up? I wouldn\u2019t mess around here. Nationals 0-1 Astros, top 3rd Zimmerman hits a 2-1 lollipop breaking ball right back to the pitcher, easy for Greinke, and that\u2019s one out. Here\u2019s Gomes of Sao Paulo who is quickly down in the count 0-2 before popping out harmlessly to center. It\u2019s up to Robles, who is 3-21 in the World Series. He gives a Greinke cutter a ride - Springer is back on his horse in center field before getting under it and ending the Nats third. That\u2019s three shutout innings from Greinke who has thrown just 28 pitches. Efficient! Kathy conspiracy writes: Have not heard anyone else speculate about this, but I\u2019ve wondered if Trump chose game 5 because he had a fantasy of an adoring crowd cheering him after the death of al baghdadi, which he must have known was planned for the night before. (writing from Vermont. Go Nats) Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 2nd Scherzer falls behind 3-0 to Springer before lining a shot to left! Soto is falling to his knees, sticking out his glove, and HE\u2019S GOT IT! Wow! Tremendous work from Soto, saving a run right there with that timely catch! Dicey inning for Scherzer but it could have been significantly worse. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 2nd Chirinos...bunts? Does he do that often? I suspect not, he pops out in foul territory as Gomes makes the catch on the left side. Chirinos has some pop, and that strikes me as odd. Now Reddick grounds out to first, but advances the runners to second and third. Now Scherzer is a George Springer away from getting out of this without further damage. A bunt? SMH!. Nationals 0-1 Astros, bottom 2nd Correa pokes a ball intro right and it\u2019s first and second with nobody up. FOX tv in the US are showing lots of cutaways of Nats pitching coach Paul Menhart , which means trouble for DC. Yuli Gurriel takes a Max Scherzer slider WAY OUTTA HERE over the left field wall as the Astros dugout and fans erupt! That was a no-doubter Houston on top early, and now Alvarez follows with a base hit to right...Scherzer needs to steady this thing fast - and remember, he doesn\u2019t have his personal catcher Suzuki behind the plate. Nobody out and a man on for Correa. Hot take From the House of Hunter Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 2nd Lined shot by Cabrera and a nifty pick at first from Gurriel - he makes it look easy, and strolls over to first base to complete the play and the inning. That\u2019s two, convincing, shutout innings from Greinke, which clearly I was not expecting. Credit to him. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 2nd He\u2019ll respond with a 1-6-3 double play! Greinke is cool, calm and steady thus far. And a good throw from the five-time gold glove pitcher to Correra the shortstop on that DP. Two down, here is Asdrubal Cabrera, who just hits. Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 2nd Juan Soto is on first with a leadoff base hit to right field. He\u2019s now 8-24 in this series, with three home runs of course. How will Greinke respond? Here\u2019s Kendrick. Over there It\u2019s late in the UK but there\u2019s plenty of eyes on the World Series... Colo(u)rs Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Bregman is jammed by a 96MPH fastball and he pops harmlessly to right field for the final out of the inning, a relatively easy one for both hurlers. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Ah - Brantley draws a two-out walk, adding intrigue into what looked to be a clean inning for Scherzer. Now here comes Bregman, the bat-carrying MVP candidate to try and put his stamp on Game 7. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Two pitches into his duel with Altuve, the second baseman bounces out to short for the second out of the inning. Yes, just like Greinke, the man is sharp. Brantley is next. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Springer: a fly ball, routine for the center fielder Robles. There\u2019s one down, and a short sample size reveals that Scherzer is in fine form. But it\u2019s early, and is Altuve. Nationals 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st So how will Scherzer respond, having been unable to put on his underwear just days ago. He\u2019s down in the count 2-0 to George Springer before dropping in a slider for the first strike. Then he fires cheddar on the inner half of the plate at a nasty 96MPH. The 2-2 is a breaking pitch outside, and the count is full. The fans are up early in Houston! Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st Rendon is first pitch swinging and bounces to third - easy for Bregman, who fires to Gurriel at first base for the out. It\u2019s a 1-2-3 start for the veteran hurler: here come the Astros! Nationals 0-0 Astros, top 1st The 36-year-old Greinke gets ahead 1-2 on Eaton. So far he\u2019s mixing in a steady does of breaking pitches with his fastball that lives in the low 90\u2019s. Now Eaton bounces out in front of the catcher - Chirinos picks it up, and throws to first for the out. Two down for the slugging Rendon. The road team is up 20-19 overall in Game 7\u2019s. How will this one end? Greinke opens with a strike before Turner lines a shot to Bregman who makes the play! Some sharp fielding straight away in Houston. One down - here\u2019s Eaton. Emails Nick from Portugal writes: Really looking forward to this one. Hoping the Nationals can come through tonight...expecting a very tight low scoring game. Love the Astro\u2019s stadium...crazy design. Big shout to all baseball fans tuning in from Europe And Daniel Strauss has something to say about Bregman and Soto\u2019s bat carrying \u201ccontroversy\u201d... Fie on the fuddy-duddies, I say let the kids carry their bats. After Jose Bautista broke the bat-flip, we\u2019ve needed a new hero to usher in a new age. I\u2019m glad that Bregman\u2019s Game 4 grand slam Statue of Liberty bat salute wasn\u2019t it, but man, the bat carry is some upper-deck grandstanding that we can all get behind. I stand with you Daniel! Carry it all the way home! Prediction time As I wrote earlier, I do not trust Greinke in this spot, especially at home, where the Astros have been at a distinct disadvantage! Having said all that, it will be close, and extra innings, 6-4 to the Nationals, who take their first World Series title in a thrillah! National Anthem This means we\u2019re getting close to first pitch... Cody Johnson is singing the national anthem: I haven\u2019t heard of him, which means he\u2019s probably the most popular singer on the planet. It was definitely what I imagine to be a Texas-like version, which is sensible considering, well, they\u2019re in Texas. Classy. Not spectacular, and a little off, but classy, and finished off with a \u201cgo Astros!\u201d I\u2019ll give it a 7/10. Tweet it out... Amusing Ringo! As we all know, this is the first time in the history of MLB, the NBA and the NHL that away teams have won the first six games of a seven game series. About last night Alex Rodriguez didn\u2019t like the call, saying that it threatened to undermine this World Series. His former teammate Phil Hughes had an amusing reply. So did former Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper by the way. Harper was talking about Barstool Sports\u2019 \u201cRough \u2018N Rowdy\u201d celebrity boxing series, and was thinking, perhaps Martinez, his former manager, fight the umpires. He was certainly up for it. Anyway, we know Bryce is watching, probably in a large house with a lot of imported Italian marble, on a very big TV, perhaps with his feet up on a Restoration Hardware couch. He told the Athletic earlier this month: Those are the guys I played with and came through the organization with \u2026 I wish them nothing but the best. And that\u2019s real. I have no hard feelings toward them, or Mike Rizzo, or anything like that. You know, they\u2019re a great team. And that\u2019s why they are where they are. All Astros on deck As always in Game 7, traditional rules regarding pitchers rest do not apply. That means we could see Gerrit Cole, who pitched on Sunday, tonight. The soon to be free agent ace was hit a bit in Game 1 when he took the loss, but rebounded to toss seven innings of one-run ball with nine strikeouts in Game 5. Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports here in the US says his limit is about two innings and could be in a closer role if Houston\u2019s manager AJ Hinch has to use their usual closer, Roberto Osuna, earlier in the game. Also, don\u2019t forget about Jose Urquidy, who came out of nowhere to toss five stellar innings in Houston\u2019s Game 4 win in Washington. Juan Soto The now 21-year-old has thgree home runs in the World Series, which is more than hall of famers like Mike Schmidt, for example. And if you think Nats fans are excited about their wunderkind, just check out this clip from a pair of his former coaches. Zack Greinke One of the reasons that Houston acquired Zack Greinke was for a potential Game 7 of the World Series. And well, here we are: Greinke is getting set to start in a bid to bring a second title to Houston in three seasons. The Dodgers, one of Greinke\u2019s old teams, did a similar thing with Yu Darvish in 2017, trading for the Japanese-Persian hurler in mid-season to bolster their chances in the playoffs. Darvish infamously didn\u2019t get out of the second inning against the Astros in Game 7, allowing five runs, four earned. It was ugly. Can Greinke outdo Darvish in a similar spot? Well, Greinke has been inconsistent in the playoffs, sliding somewhere between champagne and BabyCham. Greinke was good in his last outing against Washington, allowing just one run in seven innings. But against the Rays he allowed six runs in 3.2 innings pitched. In 2017, while with the Diamondbacks, he was shelled in starts v Colorado and Los Angeles. Overall, as good as Greinke has been throughout his career, I just don\u2019t trust him in a spot like this, and expect something Darvish-ish. Beware. Mad Max So we\u2019ve all heard the cliche about players who are so good that they could get out of bed and score 40 points or throw for 300 yards. Well, here is Max Scherzer\u2019s chance to bounce off the mattress and pitch his team to a World Series title. On Sunday Nats ace couldn\u2019t move his neck and was suffering painful back spasms that saw him pulled from his role as Game 5 starting pitcher. Just days later, with the help of a fairly accurate cortisone shot, Scherzer is preparing to put the fortune of his ballclub on his balky back in a Game 7. As if that wasn\u2019t enough for Washington Nationals fans to worry about, his semi-personal catcher Kurt Suzuki, continues to be sidelined with a hip flexor issue. How did Scherzer pitch this year with Gomes catching? Well, in 12 starts his ERA was 4.09. How did Scherzer throw to Suzuki? Significantly better: in 16 starts his ERA was 2.08. On top of all this, who knows how far he can go. ESPN TV in the US spoke with Nats manager Dave Martinez a few moments ago and spoke about his pitcher. We\u2019ve been communicating throughout all of this, we\u2019re going to keep communicating...he gets it, he understands, he has a great game plan, we\u2019ll see how far he goes. You\u2019d have to guess that starters Patrick Corbin and Anibal Sanchez Nats bullpen would be available early if Scherzer is off his game. Hello everybody and welcome to our Game 7 coverage! We\u2019re all fired up for a high stakes MLB season finale. Some eight months after pitchers and catchers reported to spring training, we are finally down to the last day of the 2019 baseball season, and a Game 7 between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros. It\u2019s the final game of a Series that\u2019s been suddenly supercharged after a controversial umpire call that got folks talking baseball and lit up twitter. In the seventh inning of Game 6, Sam Holbrook called out the Trea Turner for interfering with first baseman Yuli Gurriel\u2019s ability to handle the throw: a contentious ruling that threatened the Nats\u2019 bid to pad their one-run lead. Then, Anthony Rendon stepped in slammed a two-run home run that provided Washington with all the breathing room they needed, while also saving MLB from the embarrassment of an entire offseason dedicated to reviewing the horrific call, over and over and over...and over. But ball don\u2019t lie justice has worked out for everybody except Houston, bringing a bright light to a Series that was threatening to become one of the more mundane encounters in its 115 year history. Now we\u2019ve got a Game 7 and a marquee pitching match-up between two former Cy Young Award winners: Max Scherzer for Washington v Zack Greinke for Houston. There\u2019s plenty of storylines to address between now and first pitch, but for now, settle in, get your popcorn ready, tweet your predictions to @LengelDavid, and get ready for a seventh game to decide a season. Stand by for more baseball history. Stick with us! We\u2019re about an hour from the first pitch. Here\u2019s a couple of newsy notes to pass along from the managers\u2019 pre-game pressers. Houston manager AJ Hinch said Game 6 starter Justin Verlander, who took the loss in last night\u2019s game to fall to 0-6 in seven career World Series starts, won\u2019t be available tonight. Said the Astros skipper: \u201cAll hands on deck means most hands on deck.\u201d Hinch said he spoke three times with Alex Bregman on Tuesday night about the third baseman carrying his bat to first base after hitting a home run in the first inning. Bregman apologized for the move after the game and the Houston manager shared what he told him about it. \u201cIt\u2019s just not how we do things and not something that was necessary,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cIt was an emotional reaction. I love the way he plays and it doesn\u2019t diminish what he brings to the table, but it was unnecessary.\u201d Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki, who\u2019s missed the last three games while dealing with a hip flexor strain, was scratched from the starting lineup. The 36-year-old was initially listed in the starting lineup but was replaced again by Yan Gomes just under three hours before the first pitch. The lineups for tonight\u2019s game are out. No major surprises here ... but there could be plenty of those ahead. The stratospheric stakes and the lack of a need to conserve arms for later outings, since there is no tomorrow, have frequently made for strange happenings in Game 7s. Starters tend to be kept on tight leashes and it\u2019s not unusual to see top-of-the-staff aces making relief appearances that you\u2019d never see in any other game. Basically, don\u2019t be surprised if you see Gerrit Cole or Patrick Corbin getting loose in the bullpen if Scherzer or Greinke run into early trouble.

A total of 2,466 games have been played this Major League Baseball season and it all comes down to one more: Houston\u2019s Zack Greinke v Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer in the first ever showdown between former Cy Young Award winners in Game 7 of the Fall Classic \u2013 and the most delicious pitching matchup in a seventh game since the Yankees\u2019 Roger Clemens and the Diamondbacks\u2019 Randy Johnson faced off in 2001. History suggests Houston\u2019s home-field advantage is all but meaningless in tonight\u2019s one-off with the visiting team having won in 20 of the previous 39 times the World Series has gone the full distance. That\u2019s doubly true with this particular, peculiar matchup: the first time in 1,420 best-of-seven playoff series across MLB, the NBA and the NHL in which the road team has won the first six games. First pitch is at 7.08pm local time or a little over 90 minutes from now. We\u2019ll be back with the lineups in short order. David will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s what fans thought about the recent booing controversy in Game 5:",

      "body": "<p>The first time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/28/on-my-radar-elaine-welteroth-cultural-highlights\" title=\"\">Elaine Welteroth</a> came on to my radar was at a Thanksgiving dinner. American friends in London had invited me and I was torn between gratitude for their hospitality and deep reservations about celebrating something with genocidal undertones. So I decided to embrace the first and challenge the second, arriving with a chilled bottle of wine and a fully loaded YouTube video. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K7jLeBWMA0U\" title=\"\">A video from Welteroth\u2019s Teen Vogue digital team</a>.</p> <p>It showed a group of Native American girls talking about what Thanksgiving means to them. \u201cAfter every killing of a whole village, these European settlers celebrated it and they called it Thanksgiving,\u201d says one. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to be indigenous, resilient and alive,\u201d says another. To say it was a bold move for Teen Vogue \u2013 a publication once better known for lipstick tips \u2013 is an understatement. \u201cNative American Girls Trash Thanksgiving for Teen Vogue,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/video-native-american-girls-trash-thanksgiving-chase-stephens\" title=\"\">said one critical website</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat video was extraordinarily compelling and impossible to ignore,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cYou know Native Americans just rarely get the mic, or have their voices and their perspectives amplified. So it felt good to be part of a team that would actually make people stop, put their turkey down and rethink what they\u2019re really celebrating.\u201d</p> <p>Listening to Welteroth\u2019s reflections as we share a sofa in an airy London auditorium, it is hard to believe that we are already speaking about this era in the past tense. Having whirled the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackGirlMagic\" title=\"\">#BlackGirlMagic</a> into overdrive when she was appointed the first black beauty director at Teen Vogue in 2012, Welteroth was appointed editor-in-chief of the magazine in 2017, aged just 29. It was a remarkable rise in a remarkable career \u2013 in under a decade, Welteroth had gone from intern at the African-American magazine Ebony to the youngest Cond\u00e9 Nast editor in the company\u2019s 108-year history. Championed as \u201cprolific\u201d by Anna Wintour, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s artistic director and the editor of Vogue, Welteroth had helped in her previous role to increase traffic to TeenVogue.com from 2.7 million to 9.2 million unique visitors a year, <a href=\"https://fashionista.com/2017/04/elaine-welteroth-teen-vogue-editor-in-chief\" title=\"\">with print subscriptions reportedly up 535% in a year</a>. And then, just like that, at the end of 2017, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced it was closing down the print edition. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the vision that I had for the future of Teen Vogue,\u201d Welteroth says. A couple of months later, she resigned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a7b979a84267e5ff8c3aa9e40fd0b628d4af72d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a7b979a84267e5ff8c3aa9e40fd0b628d4af72d/0_279_3000_3749/800.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Welteroth speaks at an awards ceremony organised by the magazine Essence in Los Angeles in February\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My mom is from a generation where they don\u2019t talk about their trauma\u2019 ... Welteroth speaks at an awards ceremony organised by the magazine Essence in Los Angeles in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Polk/Getty Images/Essence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The news made headlines, as the new \u2013 in some cases unlikely \u2013 fans of Teen Vogue, myself included, wondered how something going so well could go so wrong. Now, Welteroth is in London, ready to spill all the tea. Her book, More Than Enough, is part memoir, part career guide, part self-help journal. From the reaction I have seen so far on social media, black British women are ready and waiting for it.</p> <p>\u201cBeing able to do these events and see how people react and what we do, what we talk about as black women \u2026 it\u2019s like it is black female professional church,\u201d Welteroth says of an event she did the night before we meet. \u201cThere are white people in the room, and there are men in the room, but you can really see black women are centre \u2026 it\u2019s a hard thing to describe \u2013 a palpable energy. People cry. It\u2019s like everyone is coming to the table with the same brand of PTSD.\u201d</p> <p>The combination of faith, energy and trauma is also a summary, of kinds, of Welteroth\u2019s book. More Than Enough is peppered with anecdotes that illustrate the spunky, do-it-yourself attitude that helped fuel her rise \u2013 such as when her internship expired unnoticed, so she simply gave herself a new job title. \u201cOne day I got ballsy and decided to change the title in my email signature from Editorial Intern to Production Assistant. <em>Boom</em>, just like that: I got my first promotion, albeit fraudulent.\u201d Then there was the time she challenged the decision of Cond\u00e9 Nast \u2013 delivered by Wintour \u2013 to promote her to editor-in-chief with an insultingly small and allegedly non-negotiable pay rise, asking: \u201cDoesn\u2019t this seem contradictory given that this company publishes stories every day encouraging women to advocate for themselves and to negotiate their salaries?\u201d</p> <p>Welteroth is clear that her rise would not have happened without a vision and a plan. Born to a working-class family in a predominantly white neighbourhood in northern California, she says her identity was shaped by growing up \u201cbiracial\u201d, as Americans call it, with an African-American mother and a white father.</p> <p>It is a complicated story that Welteroth unpicks in her book with patience and honesty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/22/maybe-you-dont-say-youre-black-if-youre-biracial-but-its-how-youre-seen\" title=\"\">acknowledging the privilege that comes from being light-skinned in a world that penalises blackness</a> and at the same time challenging the idea that there is one biracial experience. \u201cI think there is something to be said of the difference between having a black mother and a white father,\u201d Welteroth tells me, having established \u2013 with some excitement \u2013 that I, too, am a member of what she calls the \u201cblack mom club\u201d. \u201cI have always had a black woman model for me what a black woman looks like, how to move through the world as a black woman.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worked hard to get a dream job, then found out that I had become a black woman making history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Magazines played a role from the start in her understanding of the way race operates in the US, not least because of her early awareness of the absence of images of people who looked like her. \u201cI write about being in pre-school, having no concept of race, and being handed magazines, being asked to make a family collage and finding no one in those magazines who is black, because I think it will help illuminate the nuances of racial tension and help simplify it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The young Welteroth sought refuge in black magazines, especially the African-American titles Essence and Ebony, filling zipped bags with cuttings and building dramatic story arcs for the black women transformed in her aunt\u2019s hair salon, whom she turned into characters inspired by the success stories she read about in magazines. And magazines played a deeper role in triggering her consciousness, too.</p> <p>\u201cOnly as an adult, in quiet moments of reflection, can I begin to see clearly the subconscious impact of white supremacy at work in the messages I was fed as a child,\u201d Welteroth writes. \u201cBy centring and positioning whiteness as superior, whiteness as the norm, and everything else as a deviation, a racial hierarchy is reinforced. I lived in a world that reflected this hierarchy I saw in the media. I grew up with an unspoken suspicion that the world would see me as second best, too.\u201d</p> <p>It is no surprise, then, that once Welteroth gained editorial control at Teen Vogue she got to work challenging this messaging with headlines such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-is-gaslighting-america\" title=\"\">Donald Trump is Gaslighting America</a>\u201d and detailed features on cultural appropriation. But such is the complexity of race in the US that Welteroth\u2019s mother \u2013 who is from the intensely racialised south \u2013 questioned such features. \u201cMy mom is from a generation where they don\u2019t talk about their trauma, or about black identity in the way that we are intellectualising it,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cSo when I was going through the whole cultural appropriation piece, my mum was like: \u2018You know, in my day, we didn\u2019t have time to worry about no cultural appropriation. Girl, we were trying to get a job and keep a job. What\u2019s that called? Survival. So you can go ahead and take that mess and take it somewhere else.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Welteroth stresses that her parents have supported her work, and that her father has been her biggest advocate. \u201cI think the stories in my book normalise interracial families. Why wouldn\u2019t my dad be proud of his daughter, who is making an impact?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5412c92f919aaac2fb65ef0c49a4c734b038e133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5412c92f919aaac2fb65ef0c49a4c734b038e133/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Welteroth on Project Runway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I always had a multipronged media career as my long-term game plan\u2019 ... Welteroth on Project Runway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karolina Wojtasik/Bravo/NBCU via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Welteroth\u2019s book does not shy away from her struggles, though, such as her father\u2019s alcoholism, or abandoning her dream of studying at Stanford to follow a boyfriend to a state university, only to end up having to visit him in jail at the weekends, hoping her classmates would never find out. It is the kind of decision from which a middle-class kid would been steered away firmly, but Welteroth \u2013 the first person in her family to go to university \u2013 learned many of her lessons the hard way.</p> <p>It took her a while to see the bigger picture of her achievements. \u201cI write about feeling like a bit of an accidental activist,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk to the table with my fist up. I was a 25-year-old black woman who worked hard to get a dream job, then found out in the headlines that in fact I had become a black woman making history.\u201d This was part of why she wanted to write her book. \u201cBecause the headlines just made it seem like I was a sort of token black hire, which feeds into this magical negro complex, right? All you need is one token black person and then they can transform the whole thing. And I don\u2019t want to be a part of selling lies about success.\u201d</p> <p>As such, she seems to have gone out of her way to speak openly about her mistakes \u2013 such as an article she ran celebrating Afrocentric hairstyles, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/teen-vogue-controversy\" title=\"\">but featuring only light-skinned and white women</a>. \u201cHow could you!\u201d wrote one person on Twitter. \u201cWhy\u2019s your magazine so anti black?\u201d wrote another. Welteroth shudders when I ask her about this. \u201cI had wanted to really celebrate Afrocentric beauty by writing about how it is actually a form of activism. And then I realised that, even as a black journalist, I had blind spots, and I had to learn how to be an advocate for my community,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to dispel any myth that just because you\u2019re black and you\u2019re in the room it means that you\u2019re fully equipped to represent your entire race. That is a fallacy. Everyone shares the responsibility of learning how to talk about race more responsibly.\u201d</p> <p>It was not perfect, but there was no mistaking what Teen Vogue became under Welteroth \u2013 a conscious voice, tackling the fraught terrain of our culture wars with nuance and intelligence. \u201cWe were the underdog in a larger media conglomerate \u2026 and I don\u2019t think there were great expectations for the future of a brand like Teen Vogue,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cSo I think our strategy was don\u2019t ask for permission, be prepared to ask for forgiveness, and march forward letting your instincts guide you.\u201d</p> <p>Would the powers-that-be at Cond\u00e9 Nast have sanctioned the progressive content that became normalised during Welteroth\u2019s time at Teen Vogue had they known what was coming? \u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of eyeballs on what we were doing day to day,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cOnce it hit a fever pitch, the reception was overwhelmingly positive \u2013 and there were business results attached to it, you know; our traffic soared. But, in truth, I think it would have made people really nervous if they were invited into the decision-making process more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dee0c4108cc5af8a712ab130d5eb8fef14a08093\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dee0c4108cc5af8a712ab130d5eb8fef14a08093/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Welteroth with Yara Shahidi on Black-ish\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m at the beginning of an exciting new chapter\u2019 ...

      "bodyText": "The first time Elaine Welteroth came on to my radar was at a Thanksgiving dinner. American friends in London had invited me and I was torn between gratitude for their hospitality and deep reservations about celebrating something with genocidal undertones. So I decided to embrace the first and challenge the second, arriving with a chilled bottle of wine and a fully loaded YouTube video. A video from Welteroth\u2019s Teen Vogue digital team. It showed a group of Native American girls talking about what Thanksgiving means to them. \u201cAfter every killing of a whole village, these European settlers celebrated it and they called it Thanksgiving,\u201d says one. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to be indigenous, resilient and alive,\u201d says another. To say it was a bold move for Teen Vogue \u2013 a publication once better known for lipstick tips \u2013 is an understatement. \u201cNative American Girls Trash Thanksgiving for Teen Vogue,\u201d said one critical website. \u201cThat video was extraordinarily compelling and impossible to ignore,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cYou know Native Americans just rarely get the mic, or have their voices and their perspectives amplified. So it felt good to be part of a team that would actually make people stop, put their turkey down and rethink what they\u2019re really celebrating.\u201d Listening to Welteroth\u2019s reflections as we share a sofa in an airy London auditorium, it is hard to believe that we are already speaking about this era in the past tense. Having whirled the hashtag #BlackGirlMagic into overdrive when she was appointed the first black beauty director at Teen Vogue in 2012, Welteroth was appointed editor-in-chief of the magazine in 2017, aged just 29. It was a remarkable rise in a remarkable career \u2013 in under a decade, Welteroth had gone from intern at the African-American magazine Ebony to the youngest Cond\u00e9 Nast editor in the company\u2019s 108-year history. Championed as \u201cprolific\u201d by Anna Wintour, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s artistic director and the editor of Vogue, Welteroth had helped in her previous role to increase traffic to TeenVogue.com from 2.7 million to 9.2 million unique visitors a year, with print subscriptions reportedly up 535% in a year. And then, just like that, at the end of 2017, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced it was closing down the print edition. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the vision that I had for the future of Teen Vogue,\u201d Welteroth says. A couple of months later, she resigned. The news made headlines, as the new \u2013 in some cases unlikely \u2013 fans of Teen Vogue, myself included, wondered how something going so well could go so wrong. Now, Welteroth is in London, ready to spill all the tea. Her book, More Than Enough, is part memoir, part career guide, part self-help journal. From the reaction I have seen so far on social media, black British women are ready and waiting for it. \u201cBeing able to do these events and see how people react and what we do, what we talk about as black women \u2026 it\u2019s like it is black female professional church,\u201d Welteroth says of an event she did the night before we meet. \u201cThere are white people in the room, and there are men in the room, but you can really see black women are centre \u2026 it\u2019s a hard thing to describe \u2013 a palpable energy. People cry. It\u2019s like everyone is coming to the table with the same brand of PTSD.\u201d The combination of faith, energy and trauma is also a summary, of kinds, of Welteroth\u2019s book. More Than Enough is peppered with anecdotes that illustrate the spunky, do-it-yourself attitude that helped fuel her rise \u2013 such as when her internship expired unnoticed, so she simply gave herself a new job title. \u201cOne day I got ballsy and decided to change the title in my email signature from Editorial Intern to Production Assistant. Boom, just like that: I got my first promotion, albeit fraudulent.\u201d Then there was the time she challenged the decision of Cond\u00e9 Nast \u2013 delivered by Wintour \u2013 to promote her to editor-in-chief with an insultingly small and allegedly non-negotiable pay rise, asking: \u201cDoesn\u2019t this seem contradictory given that this company publishes stories every day encouraging women to advocate for themselves and to negotiate their salaries?\u201d Welteroth is clear that her rise would not have happened without a vision and a plan. Born to a working-class family in a predominantly white neighbourhood in northern California, she says her identity was shaped by growing up \u201cbiracial\u201d, as Americans call it, with an African-American mother and a white father. It is a complicated story that Welteroth unpicks in her book with patience and honesty, acknowledging the privilege that comes from being light-skinned in a world that penalises blackness and at the same time challenging the idea that there is one biracial experience. \u201cI think there is something to be said of the difference between having a black mother and a white father,\u201d Welteroth tells me, having established \u2013 with some excitement \u2013 that I, too, am a member of what she calls the \u201cblack mom club\u201d. \u201cI have always had a black woman model for me what a black woman looks like, how to move through the world as a black woman.\u201d Magazines played a role from the start in her understanding of the way race operates in the US, not least because of her early awareness of the absence of images of people who looked like her. \u201cI write about being in pre-school, having no concept of race, and being handed magazines, being asked to make a family collage and finding no one in those magazines who is black, because I think it will help illuminate the nuances of racial tension and help simplify it,\u201d she says. The young Welteroth sought refuge in black magazines, especially the African-American titles Essence and Ebony, filling zipped bags with cuttings and building dramatic story arcs for the black women transformed in her aunt\u2019s hair salon, whom she turned into characters inspired by the success stories she read about in magazines. And magazines played a deeper role in triggering her consciousness, too. \u201cOnly as an adult, in quiet moments of reflection, can I begin to see clearly the subconscious impact of white supremacy at work in the messages I was fed as a child,\u201d Welteroth writes. \u201cBy centring and positioning whiteness as superior, whiteness as the norm, and everything else as a deviation, a racial hierarchy is reinforced. I lived in a world that reflected this hierarchy I saw in the media. I grew up with an unspoken suspicion that the world would see me as second best, too.\u201d It is no surprise, then, that once Welteroth gained editorial control at Teen Vogue she got to work challenging this messaging with headlines such as \u201cDonald Trump is Gaslighting America\u201d and detailed features on cultural appropriation. But such is the complexity of race in the US that Welteroth\u2019s mother \u2013 who is from the intensely racialised south \u2013 questioned such features. \u201cMy mom is from a generation where they don\u2019t talk about their trauma, or about black identity in the way that we are intellectualising it,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cSo when I was going through the whole cultural appropriation piece, my mum was like: \u2018You know, in my day, we didn\u2019t have time to worry about no cultural appropriation. Girl, we were trying to get a job and keep a job. What\u2019s that called? Survival. So you can go ahead and take that mess and take it somewhere else.\u2019\u201d At the same time, Welteroth stresses that her parents have supported her work, and that her father has been her biggest advocate. \u201cI think the stories in my book normalise interracial families. Why wouldn\u2019t my dad be proud of his daughter, who is making an impact?\u201d Welteroth\u2019s book does not shy away from her struggles, though, such as her father\u2019s alcoholism, or abandoning her dream of studying at Stanford to follow a boyfriend to a state university, only to end up having to visit him in jail at the weekends, hoping her classmates would never find out. It is the kind of decision from which a middle-class kid would been steered away firmly, but Welteroth \u2013 the first person in her family to go to university \u2013 learned many of her lessons the hard way. It took her a while to see the bigger picture of her achievements. \u201cI write about feeling like a bit of an accidental activist,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk to the table with my fist up. I was a 25-year-old black woman who worked hard to get a dream job, then found out in the headlines that in fact I had become a black woman making history.\u201d This was part of why she wanted to write her book. \u201cBecause the headlines just made it seem like I was a sort of token black hire, which feeds into this magical negro complex, right? All you need is one token black person and then they can transform the whole thing. And I don\u2019t want to be a part of selling lies about success.\u201d As such, she seems to have gone out of her way to speak openly about her mistakes \u2013 such as an article she ran celebrating Afrocentric hairstyles, but featuring only light-skinned and white women. \u201cHow could you!\u201d wrote one person on Twitter. \u201cWhy\u2019s your magazine so anti black?\u201d wrote another. Welteroth shudders when I ask her about this. \u201cI had wanted to really celebrate Afrocentric beauty by writing about how it is actually a form of activism. And then I realised that, even as a black journalist, I had blind spots, and I had to learn how to be an advocate for my community,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to dispel any myth that just because you\u2019re black and you\u2019re in the room it means that you\u2019re fully equipped to represent your entire race. That is a fallacy. Everyone shares the responsibility of learning how to talk about race more responsibly.\u201d It was not perfect, but there was no mistaking what Teen Vogue became under Welteroth \u2013 a conscious voice, tackling the fraught terrain of our culture wars with nuance and intelligence. \u201cWe were the underdog in a larger media conglomerate \u2026 and I don\u2019t think there were great expectations for the future of a brand like Teen Vogue,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cSo I think our strategy was don\u2019t ask for permission, be prepared to ask for forgiveness, and march forward letting your instincts guide you.\u201d Would the powers-that-be at Cond\u00e9 Nast have sanctioned the progressive content that became normalised during Welteroth\u2019s time at Teen Vogue had they known what was coming? \u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of eyeballs on what we were doing day to day,\u201d Welteroth says. \u201cOnce it hit a fever pitch, the reception was overwhelmingly positive \u2013 and there were business results attached to it, you know; our traffic soared. But, in truth, I think it would have made people really nervous if they were invited into the decision-making process more.\u201d Welteroth\u2019s disappointment with the way Teen Vogue\u2019s rise was rewarded \u2013 or not \u2013 is palpable. But she did not miss a beat, turning to her role model and mentor, the editor, author and all-round media phenomenon Harriette Cole, who hired her at Ebony. \u201cI always had a multipronged media career as my long-term game plan. I knew, like Harriette, that I would start with magazines, build a strong foundation and then eventually I would need to take a leap of faith and build on the different parts of my media career.\u201d That plan saw Welteroth become a judge on the US reality show Project Runway and a writer on the sitcom Grown-ish \u2013 a spin-off of the hit show Blackish, in which she made a cameo as herself. She is now in the process of writing more scripts for TV. \u201cI spent a week in the writers\u2019 room \u2013 it was like a crash course in TV writing,\u201d Welteroth says of her time writing on Grown-ish. \u201cIt was such an amazing experience; I\u2019m at the beginning of an exciting new chapter.\u201d There is an undeniable buzz around Welteroth. This is not hindered by her appearance, which \u2013 like everything else about her career \u2013 is intentional. She is wearing a mesmerising suit in varying green checks; flawless, efficient makeup; and her trademark curly hair. In the book, she writes that this was inspired by advice from Cole. \u201cHarriette [Cole] always told me every notable editor has a signature look, and my big, curly hair would be mine,\u201d she says.

Common sense in this instance seems to have been lost in one of Bailey\u2019s fjords.</p> <h2>Another low note for De La Rue</h2> <p>Short profit warnings are the worst. In three sentences De La Rue, the banknote and security printer, squashed any hope that its multi-year storm had passed with the recent departure of the ineffective chief executive Martin Sutherland. Profits this year will be \u201csignificantly below\u201d the market\u2019s expectation of about \u00a352m. Cue a 20% fall in the share price to a 21-year low of 149p.</p> <p>At the start of last year, before Sutherland threw a silly tantrum when De La Rue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/18/de-la-rue-drops-passport-appeal-issues-profit-warning\">lost the contract to print British passports</a>, the shares stood at over 600p. Since that episode, shareholders have suffered a separate profits warning and news of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jul/23/serious-office-investigates-de-la-rue-over-south-sudan-operations\">Serious Fraud Office inquiry</a> tied to suspected corruption in South Sudan. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan central bank has stopped paying its bills to De Le Rue. And the rise of cashless societies is bad news for all banknote printers.</p> <p>In theory, the group\u2019s authentication division, offering \u201cidentity solutions\u201d and security features, offers a path to salvation. That, at least, was Sutherland\u2019s big plan. We wait to see if the new boss, Clive Vacher, agrees when he unveils his thinking next month. It is alarming for investors that it has taken him only three weeks in post to determine that the profits outlook was wonky. The dividend looks the next casualty.</p> <p>De La Rue, almost incredibly for a company that prints a third of the world\u2019s banknotes, is now worth just \u00a3160m. In normal circumstances, you would say it is a takeover candidate but an open investigation by the SFO may deter decent offers. If shareholders want another reason to be miserable, here\u2019s one: Sutherland somehow got a \u00a3197,000 bonus last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Boeing bosses a protected species</h2> <p>Dennis Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, should count himself lucky.

Even so, hiring a director of a payday lender \u2013 in this case, a company that has now folded with thousands of claims for mis-sold loans unresolved \u2013 is a strange way to promote your consumer protection credentials. Lord has other entries on his CV that might have been attractive to the FCA, including former membership of the Financial Services Consumer Panel. But his QuickQuid gig ought to have been a turnoff, which may be why it is not mentioned on his biography on the FCA\u2019s website. Common sense in this instance seems to have been lost in one of Bailey\u2019s fjords. Another low note for De La Rue Short profit warnings are the worst. In three sentences De La Rue, the banknote and security printer, squashed any hope that its multi-year storm had passed with the recent departure of the ineffective chief executive Martin Sutherland. Profits this year will be \u201csignificantly below\u201d the market\u2019s expectation of about \u00a352m. Cue a 20% fall in the share price to a 21-year low of 149p. At the start of last year, before Sutherland threw a silly tantrum when De La Rue lost the contract to print British passports, the shares stood at over 600p. Since that episode, shareholders have suffered a separate profits warning and news of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry tied to suspected corruption in South Sudan. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan central bank has stopped paying its bills to De Le Rue. And the rise of cashless societies is bad news for all banknote printers. In theory, the group\u2019s authentication division, offering \u201cidentity solutions\u201d and security features, offers a path to salvation. That, at least, was Sutherland\u2019s big plan. We wait to see if the new boss, Clive Vacher, agrees when he unveils his thinking next month. It is alarming for investors that it has taken him only three weeks in post to determine that the profits outlook was wonky. The dividend looks the next casualty. De La Rue, almost incredibly for a company that prints a third of the world\u2019s banknotes, is now worth just \u00a3160m. In normal circumstances, you would say it is a takeover candidate but an open investigation by the SFO may deter decent offers. If shareholders want another reason to be miserable, here\u2019s one: Sutherland somehow got a \u00a3197,000 bonus last year. Boeing bosses a protected species Dennis Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, should count himself lucky. He has been verbally mauled by a Senate committee this week for \u201chiding\u201d information about the anti-stall system that has been implicated in two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, but he is still in his job. Would the boss of a foreign company operating out of the US be in post in similar circumstances? One doubts it. Tony Hayward did not last long at BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, which killed 11 people. Some of Muilenburg\u2019s comments in recent weeks have been as crass as any of Hayward\u2019s back then. Boeing bosses are still a protected species in their own backyard.",

But I gradually discovered that all of them were intensely hostile to thoughtful explorations of ecological and climate breakdown. In total, I was commissioned to write 26 articles. All but two were spiked. Eventually I realised it was impossible to cover these crucial issues properly without supportive editors. Reluctantly at first, I started writing for the Guardian in the early 1990s. Across most of this period, it has been the only paper that has consistently supported powerful writing about the gathering collapse of our life support systems. Now, with your help, it is devoting unprecedented resources to the greatest predicament humankind has ever faced.

That urgency is now playing out in real time, in a tumult of hurricanes, wildfires, heatwaves and protester rage. The US is a crucible for the decisions that led to the climate crisis as well as the disasters wrought by it, demanding that we not only report on the victims \u2013 disproportionately people of colour and the disadvantaged \u2013 of this unfolding catastrophe but also interrogate the policies that have led us to this point.</p> <p>I have sought to illuminate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/whistleblowers-scientists-climate-crisis-trump-administration\">actions of the Trump administration</a>, easily the most destructive when it comes to climate than any previous US administration, and show how the climate crisis is playing out as an existential threat for many Americans on the margins.

It was a huge collective effort with reporters, data journalists and editors working in countries around the world for the past six months. I teamed up with academics in the US to pull together data that revealed that just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/what-we-know-top-20-global-polluters\">20 fossil fuel companies are behind a third of global carbon emissions</a>.</p> <p>I have also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2018/nov/14/the-plastics-conspiracy-who-blame-waste-crisis\">investigating the plastics industry</a>, uncovering how global fossil fuel corporations are investing $180bn in new plastic production companies, even as scientists discover plastic pollution in every aspect of our lives from the oceans to drinking water, food to the air we breathe \u2013 with unknown health implications.</p> <p>Another area of inquiry is air pollution and its impact on people\u2019s day-to-day lives, particularly in big cities where cars dominate the public space.</p> <p>It was, in part, a realisation that the same fossil fuel companies were at the heart of each of these three major ecological crises \u2013 plastics, air pollution and global heating \u2013 that led to focus on the systemic nature of the crisis and the Polluters project.</p> <p>I have also been following the emergence of various environmental protest movements over the past 18 months \u2013 particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/extinction-rebellion-activists-stage-protest-at-bank-of-england\">Extinction Rebellion</a> and the school strikes. I first heard about plans for XR in a central London cafe six months before it launched. One of the founders told me they would bring large parts of central London to a standstill for days on end with hundreds of people arrested for peaceful mass civil disobedience. Eighteen months later that has proved remarkably prescient, although what happens next is unclear.</p> <p>But when I saw some of those involved in the latest XR protests holding up copies of our Polluters project front page, it reminded me that the Guardian\u2019s journalism can help shape and inform the debate around these huge crises we face.</p> <p><strong><br>Adam Morton, environment editor, Guardian Australia</strong></p> <p>Eastern Australia continues to suffer through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/you-count-your-blessings-farm-families-battling-drought-photo-essay\">the worse drought in living memory</a>.

Writing about other species, and our relationships with them, can seem an insignificant dot among all the vital news reported by the Guardian. But we \u2013 both readers and writers \u2013 are joining the dots.

That is a sentence nobody in their right mind would ever want to dwell on, but in different ways on different days, that\u2019s what I spend most of my working life thinking and writing about. Fortunately for my mental health, I also get to talk to the brave and brilliant people who are fighting to change that. This year, I have reported on the environmental crisis from the Arctic to the Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant\">interviewed Greta Thunberg</a>, covered climate protests across the world, collaborated on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/green-blood\">Green Blood investigation</a> into international mining crimes, and helped to pull together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-polluters\">the Polluters series</a> of stories that named and shamed the fossil fuel companies profiting from climate breakdown.</p> <p>In the coming two months, I will join a search for nature-based political solutions in Brazil and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/17/un-climate-talks-set-stage-for-humanitys-two-most-crucial-years\">UN negotiations in Chile</a> that aim to raise action on carbon emissions. Next year, there will be even more important climate and biodiversity summits in Glasgow and Kunming, as well as environmentally crucial elections in the US and elsewhere. This feels like a defining moment for humanity: Excited the issues are finally getting the attention they deserve. Worried the urgency is still not at the level required. Proud the Guardian and its supporters are taking the lead in stepping up the pace.</p> <p><strong>Fiona Harvey, environment journalist</strong></p> <p>If the climate crisis were the only environmental emergency facing us, we might be in with a good chance of solving it. But at the same time as moving to a low-carbon world, we have to grapple with pressing issues from the plastic scourge of the oceans to the pollution we are pouring into our children\u2019s lungs, our failing water supplies, rapidly falling populations of vital fauna, our plundering of the oceans sending fish populations plummeting, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/28/can-we-ditch-intensive-farming-and-still-feed-the-world\">challenge of feeding more than 9 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/28/can-we-ditch-intensive-farming-and-still-feed-the-world\">billion people</a>. We do not have the luxury of choosing which of these to concentrate on: they are all vital to our continued life on the planet, and that is why the Guardian devotes more reporting effort to these issues than any of the world\u2019s other major media.</p> <p>These problems can all be solved and \u2013 contrary to alarmist claims from the extreme left and right \u2013 they can be solved without plunging us into a new dark age or reversing the benefits of modern life. Done right, we can improve life for all and create a happier and more equitable world as well as a healthier planet. Ignoring our pressing environmental problems solves nothing, and writing about them is the first step. The message is one of hope \u2013 but hope only works if we acknowledge and act on the need for change.</p> <p><strong>Nina Lakhani, environmental justice reporter, Guardian US</strong></p> <p>Environmental justice means equal access to clean air, land and water, and healthy food wherever we work, live, play, learn and pray \u2013 regardless of wealth, ethnicity, skin colour, gender, age and social class. In other words, we should all get to breath clean air, have enough water to drink, and be able to buy or grow healthy food. But the reality is that ecological hazards and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/our-unequal-earth\">climate disasters have the harshest impacts on people of colour</a>, indigenous communities and those on low incomes. This isn\u2019t new, but rising sea levels and extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis, coupled with the roll back of environmental protection and climate resilience programmes by the Trump administration, means vulnerable communities face mounting threats.</p> <p>That\u2019s why in my role as the Guardian\u2019s first environmental justice reporter, I\u2019ll be investigating the impact of classist and racist public policies, corporate interests and the climate crisis on communities across the US and beyond. Who breaths the most polluted air? Which communities struggle to access enough water? Where are the food deserts? Who are the environmental justice warriors fighting back against Big Business and state corruption? Which children have access to safe green spaces and which don\u2019t? Environmental racism and discrimination cause and perpetuate health, social and economic inequalities. Help the Guardian expose the shocking, and champion the extraordinary through our year-long series Our Unequal Earth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/guardian-editors-climate-emergency-pledge\">From foreign news to fashion, how our editors see the climate crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Damien Gayle, </strong><strong>reporter</strong></p> <p>Without the logistical, editorial and financial support of the Guardian, I could not have spent two weeks carrying out thorough on-the-ground reporting of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/extinction-rebellion-begin-legal-challenge-against-protest-ban\"> Extinction Rebellion\u2019s \u201cautumn uprising\u201d protests in London</a> this October.

      "bodyText": "George Monbiot, columnist and author of several books on the climate crisis Before I worked for the Guardian, I tried writing for other newspapers, in the belief I should reach the unconverted. But I gradually discovered that all of them were intensely hostile to thoughtful explorations of ecological and climate breakdown. In total, I was commissioned to write 26 articles. All but two were spiked. Eventually I realised it was impossible to cover these crucial issues properly without supportive editors. Reluctantly at first, I started writing for the Guardian in the early 1990s. Across most of this period, it has been the only paper that has consistently supported powerful writing about the gathering collapse of our life support systems. Now, with your help, it is devoting unprecedented resources to the greatest predicament humankind has ever faced. Thanks to your support, I will keep writing about every aspect of our environmental crisis, always striving to dig deeper and to understand more. Emily Holden, environment reporter for Guardian US As the Guardian\u2019s environment and climate crisis reporter in Washington DC, I write about how the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks of key public health and pollution protections will hurt Americans. I investigate how corporate power over public policy stalls climate progress at the national and state level. I have reported on environment policy across the country, tracking the build-out of the plastics industry in Appalachia and local resistance to chemicals manufacturing in Louisiana. For our Toxic America series, I tested my own body to demonstrate how many dangerous chemicals Americans are exposed to in daily life. As a million species face extinction, I have traveled from the west coast to the Gulf of Mexico to chronicle the devastating toll human living takes on nature and to explain what Trump officials\u2019 work to ease wildlife protections will mean for biodiversity. Oliver Milman, environment reporter for Guardian US The media traditionally overlooks slow-moving emergencies so it\u2019s inspiring that the Guardian has long covered the climate crisis in a thoughtful, comprehensive and, increasingly, an urgent way. That urgency is now playing out in real time, in a tumult of hurricanes, wildfires, heatwaves and protester rage. The US is a crucible for the decisions that led to the climate crisis as well as the disasters wrought by it, demanding that we not only report on the victims \u2013 disproportionately people of colour and the disadvantaged \u2013 of this unfolding catastrophe but also interrogate the policies that have led us to this point. I have sought to illuminate the actions of the Trump administration, easily the most destructive when it comes to climate than any previous US administration, and show how the climate crisis is playing out as an existential threat for many Americans on the margins. I\u2019m currently looking at how global heating will shape the 2020 election, as well as some of the emerging solutions to the crisis. This is the defining issue of our time and we need to treat it as such. Matthew Taylor, environment correspondent We have just finished the Polluters project, which aimed to shine a light on the role of fossil fuel companies in the escalating climate crisis \u2013 and the financial, lobbying and political systems that underpin them. It was a huge collective effort with reporters, data journalists and editors working in countries around the world for the past six months. I teamed up with academics in the US to pull together data that revealed that just 20 fossil fuel companies are behind a third of global carbon emissions. I have also been investigating the plastics industry, uncovering how global fossil fuel corporations are investing $180bn in new plastic production companies, even as scientists discover plastic pollution in every aspect of our lives from the oceans to drinking water, food to the air we breathe \u2013 with unknown health implications. Another area of inquiry is air pollution and its impact on people\u2019s day-to-day lives, particularly in big cities where cars dominate the public space. It was, in part, a realisation that the same fossil fuel companies were at the heart of each of these three major ecological crises \u2013 plastics, air pollution and global heating \u2013 that led to focus on the systemic nature of the crisis and the Polluters project. I have also been following the emergence of various environmental protest movements over the past 18 months \u2013 particularly Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes. I first heard about plans for XR in a central London cafe six months before it launched. One of the founders told me they would bring large parts of central London to a standstill for days on end with hundreds of people arrested for peaceful mass civil disobedience. Eighteen months later that has proved remarkably prescient, although what happens next is unclear. But when I saw some of those involved in the latest XR protests holding up copies of our Polluters project front page, it reminded me that the Guardian\u2019s journalism can help shape and inform the debate around these huge crises we face. Adam Morton, environment editor, Guardian Australia Eastern Australia continues to suffer through the worse drought in living memory. Summer is weeks away, but parts of the country are sweltering and burning. Its most celebrated natural wonder is under grave threat. Scientists warn a local extinction crisis is worsening. Australians are increasingly concerned, yet politics continues to wreck itself over global heating, fights between and within parties over climate policy having played a part in the downfall of the previous five prime ministers. The government repeatedly claims to be acting, but has few policies, national emissions are rising year-on-year, vast new fossil fuel projects win support and leaders from the Pacific islands and elsewhere are dismissed when they call for more to be done. Exploring the changes being felt across the country and holding Australia\u2019s political and business leaders to account are the major focus for Guardian Australia\u2019s environment reporting team, which \u2013 with readers\u2019 support \u2013 recently expanded from one to three, with an increased emphasis on investigations. We are also committed to telling the stories of people living on the frontline of climate change and spotlighting tales of hope: showing that, in a wealthy country with unmatched renewable resources, there are options beyond despair. Jillian Ambrose, energy correspondent It has taken only a few decades for the energy industry to power the world into a climate catastrophe. The Guardian\u2019s Polluters series laid this bare: oil companies have understood the consequences of their actions decades ahead of the public, and they have actively fought to conceal the truth about the world\u2019s fossil fuel addiction. This truth is now propelled by social media, and gaining ground in US court hearings and in climate talks across the globe. #TheyKnew. But the Polluters series also revealed that for Big Oil the destruction of the climate is still business as usual. By 2030 the world\u2019s biggest oil producers plan to produce an extra 7m barrels of oil and gas everyday; knowingly putting the world on track for climbing global temperatures and deadly climate chaos. At the same time, UK government officials are using taxpayer money to finance fossil fuels abroad, locking developing countries into decades more of dependence on a dying industry. And the global investment industry stands poised to use people\u2019s pensions pots to buy a stake in Saudi Aramco, easily the world\u2019s biggest polluter. The energy industry, and its backers, must be held to account on its greenwashed PR promises and spin; where journalists shine a light, progressive leaders can take action to dismantle the structures that reward pollution with profits \u2013 and build something new. Patrick Barkham, natural history writer I can\u2019t pretend that revealing how the long-tailed blue butterfly has bred rather well along England\u2019s south coast this year is the world\u2019s most important story. Writing about other species, and our relationships with them, can seem an insignificant dot among all the vital news reported by the Guardian. But we \u2013 both readers and writers \u2013 are joining the dots. The struggles and successes of other species in an age of extinction prick our conscience, tell us about the climate crisis and will ultimately determine whether our civilisation can endure. I\u2019ve recently written about Sir David Attenborough\u2019s career and ancient trees threatened by high-speed rail; I\u2019m researching stories about regenerative farming and rewilding. We need to know what\u2019s happening to plants and animals but we also need hope, and that\u2019s provided by shining a light on solutions \u2013 the many human action that address our current predicament. Jon Watts, global environment editor Our natural life support systems are collapsing. That is a sentence nobody in their right mind would ever want to dwell on, but in different ways on different days, that\u2019s what I spend most of my working life thinking and writing about. Fortunately for my mental health, I also get to talk to the brave and brilliant people who are fighting to change that. This year, I have reported on the environmental crisis from the Arctic to the Amazon, interviewed Greta Thunberg, covered climate protests across the world, collaborated on the Green Blood investigation into international mining crimes, and helped to pull together the Polluters series of stories that named and shamed the fossil fuel companies profiting from climate breakdown. In the coming two months, I will join a search for nature-based political solutions in Brazil and UN negotiations in Chile that aim to raise action on carbon emissions. Next year, there will be even more important climate and biodiversity summits in Glasgow and Kunming, as well as environmentally crucial elections in the US and elsewhere. This feels like a defining moment for humanity: Excited the issues are finally getting the attention they deserve. Worried the urgency is still not at the level required. Proud the Guardian and its supporters are taking the lead in stepping up the pace. Fiona Harvey, environment journalist If the climate crisis were the only environmental emergency facing us, we might be in with a good chance of solving it. But at the same time as moving to a low-carbon world, we have to grapple with pressing issues from the plastic scourge of the oceans to the pollution we are pouring into our children\u2019s lungs, our failing water supplies, rapidly falling populations of vital fauna, our plundering of the oceans sending fish populations plummeting, and the challenge of feeding more than 9 billion people. We do not have the luxury of choosing which of these to concentrate on: they are all vital to our continued life on the planet, and that is why the Guardian devotes more reporting effort to these issues than any of the world\u2019s other major media. These problems can all be solved and \u2013 contrary to alarmist claims from the extreme left and right \u2013 they can be solved without plunging us into a new dark age or reversing the benefits of modern life. Done right, we can improve life for all and create a happier and more equitable world as well as a healthier planet. Ignoring our pressing environmental problems solves nothing, and writing about them is the first step. The message is one of hope \u2013 but hope only works if we acknowledge and act on the need for change. Nina Lakhani, environmental justice reporter, Guardian US Environmental justice means equal access to clean air, land and water, and healthy food wherever we work, live, play, learn and pray \u2013 regardless of wealth, ethnicity, skin colour, gender, age and social class. In other words, we should all get to breath clean air, have enough water to drink, and be able to buy or grow healthy food. But the reality is that ecological hazards and climate disasters have the harshest impacts on people of colour, indigenous communities and those on low incomes. This isn\u2019t new, but rising sea levels and extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis, coupled with the roll back of environmental protection and climate resilience programmes by the Trump administration, means vulnerable communities face mounting threats. That\u2019s why in my role as the Guardian\u2019s first environmental justice reporter, I\u2019ll be investigating the impact of classist and racist public policies, corporate interests and the climate crisis on communities across the US and beyond. Who breaths the most polluted air? Which communities struggle to access enough water? Where are the food deserts? Who are the environmental justice warriors fighting back against Big Business and state corruption? Which children have access to safe green spaces and which don\u2019t? Environmental racism and discrimination cause and perpetuate health, social and economic inequalities. Help the Guardian expose the shocking, and champion the extraordinary through our year-long series Our Unequal Earth. Damien Gayle, reporter Without the logistical, editorial and financial support of the Guardian, I could not have spent two weeks carrying out thorough on-the-ground reporting of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s \u201cautumn uprising\u201d protests in London this October. In-depth reporting is only possible with a newsroom able to give reporters the time they need to walk the streets and meet people face to face, a newsroom that isn\u2019t commissioning us to hammer out six stories a day for the commercial team to throw adverts on to. And without billionaire backers, that kind of news organisation relies on the support of ordinary people like you. Continue to support us, and we can continue to cover the news and issues that you care about. Damian Carrington, environment editor The climate crisis and annihilation of wildlife around the world is finally breaking into the mainstream, as the impacts become obvious and the youth strikers call older generations to account. So I\u2019m focusing on both the increasing dangers of climate breakdown and the solutions, including those that involve restoring nature and, with it, wildlife. The next year is critical, with key UN summits on climate and biodiversity. Human civilisation evolved in a period of settled climate conditions \u2013 its continuation requires stopping our own actions bringing that period to a chaotic end.",

One Ocean Expeditions \u2013 which announced on 29 October plans to restructure amid financial difficulties \u2013 also cancelled a recent trip to Antarctica after it was unable to purchase sufficient fuel, abruptly returning guests to a port in Argentina before it reached the southernmost continent. \u201cUnfortunately, the difficult reality is that in recent months, we have fallen short of these high expectations that we have set for ourselves as a leader in the expedition cruise industry,\u201d the company announced on Facebook. While it struggles to refund passengers and booking companies, the troubled British Columbia-based company has failed pay its many contractors for months, according to ten current and former crew members interviewed by the Guardian. Many of the guides and workers aboard ships run by One Ocean, who come from all over the world, requested anonymity for fear they would be unable to find work in the industry if identified. Until recently, they have been hesitant to speak out about unpaid wages, worried that a bankruptcy could mean they are never compensated for their work. But the recently cancelled trip \u2013 and announcement the company is restructuring \u2013 has prompted worries the company could soon collapse without repaying its debts. \u201cThe people that have been hit the worst are the people that really invested themselves in the company and worked full seasons for them \u2013 and worst of all, the people who are couples, with both members of the couple dependent on the company for the income,\u201d said Sam Edwards, who worked as a guide for two seasons in Antarctica.

Emails to the company and Prossin went unanswered, as did numerous calls to the company\u2019s headquarters in Squamish, British Columbia. The company has received positive coverage in the past, with the Royal Canadian Geographic Society awarding Prossin the Lawrence J Burpee Medal, one of its highest honours, for his role in the discovery of the long-lost ships of the British polar explorer Sir John Franklin. Many who have worked with the company feel One Ocean\u2019s public messaging is at odds with the current compensation and treatment. \u201cThere\u2019s been absolutely no communication or apology from the owners who love to tout themselves as such a family business with that personalized touch,\u201d one crew member claimed in an email. Under payment terms seen by the Guardian, contractors were to invoice for the preceding month worked. They would be paid 50% within that month\u2019s payment period \u2014 and the rest would be compensated \u201con or around 60 days\u201d later. Many staff alleged they were \u201cstonewalled\u201d when asking for pay. For an estimated 100 contractors \u2013 some of whom are owed tens of thousands \u2013 little to no payment has been received despite months of requesting compensation for the work.

Contractors claim to have not received any information from the company itself on the restructuring. Instead, they learned about the latest development from emails forwarded to them from travel agents and a post on the company\u2019s Facebook page. One Ocean has faced a number of financial setbacks in recent months, beginning last August, when their ship, the Akademik Ioffe ran aground in the Canadian Arctic.

That may still happen at some point but for now VAR not only keeps coming up with new controversies, it is introducing travesties into games instead of clearing them up.</p> <p>The penalty awarded against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/26/brighton-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Michael Keane at Brighton</a> last Saturday was a case in point. Though clearly looking at the ball and not seeking to foul his opponent in any way, the defender accidentally stepped on Aaron Connolly\u2019s toe in the act of playing the ball. Pre-VAR, such an incident would have gone completely unnoticed. Not only was the contact slight and trivial, the attacking player would have risked a card for diving had he hit the deck in search of a penalty, because no one would have been able to work out what sort of foul had taken place. The subtle difference now is that a player in search of a penalty for any sort of felt contact can be fairly sure VAR will back him up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c41252275f9c1b2789005d93cfeea2b607692cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c41252275f9c1b2789005d93cfeea2b607692cb/62_59_1416_850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal had a winning goal against Crystal Palace disallowed seven minutes from time on Sunday after a lengthy VAR review with no explanation offered to fans in the stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal had a winning goal against Crystal Palace disallowed seven minutes from time on Sunday after a lengthy VAR review with no explanation offered to fans in the stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony O\u2019Brien/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andy Burnham is an Everton fan, as well as the mayor of Greater Manchester, but he raised a valid point when he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1188546560394743808\" title=\"\">described VAR as a nitpicker</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1188546560394743808\" title=\"\">s\u2019 charter</a>. That is precisely how it is operating and the Premier League meeting would do well to discuss that rather than the slow take-up of the pitchside monitor facility.</p> <p>In fairness to paying spectators inside stadiums, what referees should start doing anyway is calling for replays to be played on the big screens, rather than pitchside monitors. It has long been ludicrous that people at games should get less information and less of a view than people watching from their sofas. The couple of major stadiums still without big screens \u2013 Anfield and Old Trafford \u2013 will just have to install them. It\u2019s called progress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/28/james-milner-liverpool-interview-var-premier-league\">James Milner: \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of VAR \u2026 the atmosphere is being ruined\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other aspect of VAR that urgently needs discussing is the number of perfectly good goals that have been disallowed for microscopic measurements of offside. The technology is at its most nitpicky and intrusive in this area, and there is simply no need for replays to be pored over again and again just to establish that someone was ahead of the offside line by a knee or a big toe.</p> <p>The game should not really be interested in distances that small, because both attacker and defender are likely to be moving rather than static when the ball is played and unaware of the precise location of the line that will eventually be applied on-screen by remote officials. In those circumstances a player cannot possibly know whether he is an inch or two offside, and therefore cannot be accused of seeking to gain an unfair advantage.</p> <p>Being broadly level with the last defender cannot be regarded as cheating \u2013 it is part of the forward\u2019s remit to be as far up the pitch as permissible \u2013 but the effect of VAR has been to wipe out the concept of level. You are always going to be slightly on or off, even though you might not know which until a minute or so later when your potential winner has been disallowed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a wholly unsatisfactory situation, annoying for everyone in the stadium, and in view of the likelihood that precise measurements are here to stay, the offside law itself needs looking at. If you are not deemed to be goalhanging when you are level, why would you be assumed to be gaining an unfair advantage if you are momentarily caught a couple of inches in front without realising it? The old concept of daylight between attacker and defender might be useful here, except VAR would doubtless end up spending most of its time measuring the tiniest of gaps before sanctioning goals. A more workable idea is that a player should be considered onside if any part of his body is onside. It is not perfect but it is better than seeing goals chalked off for offsides both fractional and accidental.</p> <p>As with the Keane incident at Brighton, VAR cannot seem to differentiate between the accidental and the deliberate. The old certainties about what constitutes a foul inside the area or a player being caught offside are being eroded dangerously quickly. The technology is already impressive and will only get better; what is important, as ever, is that the game is careful about how best to use it.</p>",

Though clearly looking at the ball and not seeking to foul his opponent in any way, the defender accidentally stepped on Aaron Connolly\u2019s toe in the act of playing the ball. Pre-VAR, such an incident would have gone completely unnoticed. Not only was the contact slight and trivial, the attacking player would have risked a card for diving had he hit the deck in search of a penalty, because no one would have been able to work out what sort of foul had taken place. The subtle difference now is that a player in search of a penalty for any sort of felt contact can be fairly sure VAR will back him up. Andy Burnham is an Everton fan, as well as the mayor of Greater Manchester, but he raised a valid point when he described VAR as a nitpickers\u2019 charter. That is precisely how it is operating and the Premier League meeting would do well to discuss that rather than the slow take-up of the pitchside monitor facility. In fairness to paying spectators inside stadiums, what referees should start doing anyway is calling for replays to be played on the big screens, rather than pitchside monitors. It has long been ludicrous that people at games should get less information and less of a view than people watching from their sofas. The couple of major stadiums still without big screens \u2013 Anfield and Old Trafford \u2013 will just have to install them. It\u2019s called progress. The other aspect of VAR that urgently needs discussing is the number of perfectly good goals that have been disallowed for microscopic measurements of offside. The technology is at its most nitpicky and intrusive in this area, and there is simply no need for replays to be pored over again and again just to establish that someone was ahead of the offside line by a knee or a big toe. The game should not really be interested in distances that small, because both attacker and defender are likely to be moving rather than static when the ball is played and unaware of the precise location of the line that will eventually be applied on-screen by remote officials. In those circumstances a player cannot possibly know whether he is an inch or two offside, and therefore cannot be accused of seeking to gain an unfair advantage. Being broadly level with the last defender cannot be regarded as cheating \u2013 it is part of the forward\u2019s remit to be as far up the pitch as permissible \u2013 but the effect of VAR has been to wipe out the concept of level. You are always going to be slightly on or off, even though you might not know which until a minute or so later when your potential winner has been disallowed. This is a wholly unsatisfactory situation, annoying for everyone in the stadium, and in view of the likelihood that precise measurements are here to stay, the offside law itself needs looking at. If you are not deemed to be goalhanging when you are level, why would you be assumed to be gaining an unfair advantage if you are momentarily caught a couple of inches in front without realising it? The old concept of daylight between attacker and defender might be useful here, except VAR would doubtless end up spending most of its time measuring the tiniest of gaps before sanctioning goals. A more workable idea is that a player should be considered onside if any part of his body is onside. It is not perfect but it is better than seeing goals chalked off for offsides both fractional and accidental. As with the Keane incident at Brighton, VAR cannot seem to differentiate between the accidental and the deliberate. The old certainties about what constitutes a foul inside the area or a player being caught offside are being eroded dangerously quickly. The technology is already impressive and will only get better; what is important, as ever, is that the game is careful about how best to use it.",

      "bodyText": "Diane Abbott has spoken out about how she deals with online vitriol after a growing number of female MPs announced they would not be standing in the general election, with some citing the abuse they faced in public office. The shadow home secretary, who was found by a study to be subject to nearly half the abusive tweets sent to female MPs, said she coped with it by \u201cputting one foot in front of the other\u201d. Abbott wants social media companies to record the real identities of people using their platforms in order to tackle the problem. She was speaking after the cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said she would not be standing as a candidate, with one of her reasons being the abuse she had received. The former home secretary Amber Rudd is also among the moderate Tory MPs who have said they will not fight the election on 12 December. Heidi Allen, the former Conservative MP who defected to the Liberal Democrats via Change UK, also said she would not stand, highlighting \u201cthe nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace\u201d. Asked about online abuse, Abbott told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cA lot of people try to make party political points or factional points about this. What I say is the huge rise in online abuse \u2013 and obviously it\u2019s addressed more to women than anybody else \u2013 has to do with anonymity online, and my view is we should make it harder for people to be anonymous online. \u201cThey can have an anonymous identity, but the website, Twitter, Facebook, should have their real name and address. I believe that the fact that people are completely anonymous has made this problem worse. \u201cWhen we try, when the police try and track down people who are abusing me, they find they can\u2019t identify them. If Twitter, Facebook and online had the people\u2019s real name and address, I think you\u2019d be able to crack down on this.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, tweeted his sadness at the number of MPs who were stepping down after citing abuse. The Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, had appeared to downplay the issue as he retweeted the Conservative commentator Tom Harwood\u2019s remarks about the proportion of female MPs standing down. The Lib Dem MP Sarah Wollaston, who defected from the Tories, said she disagreed with Cleverly\u2019s analysis. \u201cIf you look at the nine Conservative women who are standing down who are part of the 2017 women elected to the Conservative party, five of them are aged 50 or under,\u201d she told the Today programme. \u201cBut two of the 20 men are 50 or under so there\u2019s a difference in terms of the age breakdown and the proportion, so I think James [Cleverly] should be taking this far more seriously. You look at 67 women and 249 men elected as Conservative MPs in 2017, and he should be looking very carefully at why women are stepping down at a younger age and having served for far shorter time in [arliament.\u201d Cleverly later tweeted that it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see so many colleagues, particularly women, leaving parliament. Meanwhile, Abbott called for the Labour MP Keith Vaz, who offered to buy drugs for sex workers, not to stand as a candidate for the party in the general election. Vaz, who was among the first ethnic minority parliamentarians when he was elected alongside Abbott more than 30 years ago, was the subject of a tabloid story that claimed he offered to purchase cocaine for male sex workers while posing as a washing machine salesman. An official inquiry by the Commons standards body this week recommended he be suspended from parliament for six months, after finding there was \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d he offered to pay for the class A drug and had paid-for sex in August 2016. But after the MP received support from his local constituency association in the event that he decided to stand again, Abbott urged Vaz to consider his position. \u201cI\u2019ve known Keith for a very long time. We were young people together looking to go forward in the Labour party. I think he should consider his position and I think he himself should agree not to be a candidate,\u201d she told the Today programme. The general election campaign has begun on the day Boris Johnson had pledged the country would be leaving the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn will outline Labour\u2019s vision for the country by promising to side with the public against a \u201ccorrupt system\u201d run by those with vested interests. Earlier this week, the EU granted the UK a Brexit extension until 31 January. Asked whether the prime minister would be apologising for failing to deliver on his promise that the country would leave the EU on 31 October, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the Today programme: \u201cI think most people listening to this are thinking, actually, it\u2019s quite clearly parliament that has failed to deliver it. After all, he did absolutely everything in his power to get parliament to come to its senses.\u201d Asked again whether Johnson would apologise, Shapps replied: \u201cI think the clear thing is parliament is not going to let it happen, then we\u2019re going to have to have this election that nobody particularly wanted.\u201d Shapps also downplayed concerns about the number of prominent female Tory MPs not standing for re-election.",

The last killing was less precise, and left the face of university student Ansarullah badly disfigured. His family thought perhaps he had heard the muffled gunshot that ended a cousin\u2019s life, and briefly tried to struggle against his captors. The men who killed them were from a pro-government force backed by the CIA and largely unaccountable to Afghan authorities, the family say, one of several which operate across east and south Afghanistan in traditional Taliban strongholds. In the last two years, as the battle for Afghanistan has intensified and a regional Isis affiliate has joined the civil war, there has been a sharp rise in abusive night-time raids by these forces, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Thousands of men strong, the units have been implicated in multiple, serious human rights abuses including summary executions, forcibly disappearing detainees, and attacking medical facilities. The report, titled They have shot many like this, details 14 deadly raids, where victims have included an elderly woman, a child, and a 60-year-old tribal elder, and says that abusive visits by these units have become a daily fact of life for many communities. \u201cI believe the 14 [raids we investigated] are only a fraction of the cases of this kind \u2026 but because they occur in remote areas most go unreported,\u201d said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director for HRW and author of the report. \u201cIn ramping up operations against the Taliban, the CIA has enabled abusive Afghan forces to commit atrocities including extrajudicial executions and disappearances. In case after case, these forces have simply shot people in their custody.\u201d According to witnesses, on 11 August this year troops from one of these CIA-backed units \u2013 which, the witnesses said, was accompanied by at least one US soldier and a translator \u2013 served as judge, jury and executioner for 11 men in Kulgago village.

Although the family campaign has led to meetings with senior Afghan officials, including the defence minister, head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) intelligence service, and the provincial governor, they say they do not feel any closer to either understanding why their children were killed or seeing justice. \u201cThe government should tell us why they were killed. Until we get an answer we will keep asking,\u201d he said. HRW said it did not know of any case where someone had been held accountable for abuse by CIA-backed troops. The report identifies five different forces which nominally come under the control of Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence service, the NDS. Unofficially though, they are a law unto themselves. A security source said operational sign-offs required by the NDS are treated as a nominal courtesy, and sometimes done after the fact. The governor of Paktia province also told Ulfatullah\u2019s family that he had no authority over the forces. The Nato combat operation in Afghanistan officially ended in 2014, and now only supports Afghan security forces. But the US has a separate counter-terrorism mission in Afghanistan, which has continued fighting aggressively, and includes the covert CIA-backed forces. There has been growing concern about the civilian toll from operations under this mission, particularly air strikes, with casualties rising steadily from these since 2014, according to UN figures. But deaths and injuries caused by search operations have been rising too, with more than half caused by NDS special forces \u2013 the units with CIA links \u2013 according to the UN. These incidents also show more victims killed than injured, a disturbing reversal of common civilian casualty patterns in the conflict. \u201cThe high number of fatalities compared to the number of injured suggests that force was employed indiscriminately,\u201d the UN said. In Kulalgo, survivors say the killings have emptied the village. Drones and planes still patrol the skies, so those who do stay are frightened to sleep in their own homes. \u201cThe schools are shut down, the agricultural work is not being done. The youth are not staying in their homes at night because of fear of night raids,\u201d said Ulfatullah\u2019s only surviving son, Hekmatullah. \u201cThere is no life in the village at the moment because people are scared they will come back and kill more innocent people.\u201d The young men in Kulalgo were targeted as insurgents, but Shafiullah and Hayatullah, both 26, worked for the same government as the men who killed them, as a teacher and an education ministry official respectively. Emanullah, 19, helped in the family pharmacy and his cousin Ansarullah, also 19, was in the second year of a chemistry degree. And the choice of targets seemed casual; Hekmatullah was taken off with the men who were killed, but released just minutes before the shooting after he told the soldiers he worked for the UN. The family insist that if they are given any evidence of Taliban links they will drop their campaign immediately, but they are sure they were not legitimate targets. \u201cIf they can prove that our kids were wrong, we will forgive everything, but if it can\u2019t we want (the people who did this) brought to justice,\u201d said Ulfatullah. Mistaken identity, poor intelligence and local political rivalries all led to civilians being targeted in raids investigated by HRW, the group said. Some families were also attacked after providing food to insurgents, even if they acted under duress. The CIA said it had not had time to investigate the Kulalgo raid, or any of the other raids detailed in the HRW report, in a response to the rights group. It said reports of abuse were \u201clikely false or exaggerated\u201d, and attacked the Taliban for spreading false propaganda. \u201cWe neither condone nor would knowingly participate in illegal activities,\u201d the statement said. The accounts given to the Guardian came from relatives and survivors, not insurgents. \u201cCIA conducts its global operations in accordance with law and under a robust system of oversight,\u201d Timothy Barrett, the CIA press secretary, told the Guardian. Another villager said the raids would only push people into the arms of insurgents, an argument made consistently by human rights groups over two decades and at one point when Hamid Karzai was president, by the Afghan government. \u201cWe invested in these guys to work against radicalisation, and they are the ones who got killed,\u201d asked one local who supported the young men\u2019s education. \u201cThey are part of our planning for how we should brighten our future, get rid of the influence of Taliban. What will be the impact of their deaths?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Kingston, New York is a diverse city of 23,000, flanked to the east by Rondout Creek and the Hudson River and to the west by the Catskill mountains. It boasts a rustic industrial waterfront, a colorful historic district and Revolutionary War-era stone buildings. A stranger might call it bucolic. The streets of uptown are bustling with eateries and, of late, places to buy velvet halter dresses, vintage boleros, CBD tinctures, and LCD tea kettles with precision-pour spouts. But strolling by 10-year-old Half Moon Books, passersby might glimpse a different side of this city.

      "bodyText": "Kingston, New York is a diverse city of 23,000, flanked to the east by Rondout Creek and the Hudson River and to the west by the Catskill mountains. It boasts a rustic industrial waterfront, a colorful historic district and Revolutionary War-era stone buildings. A stranger might call it bucolic. The streets of uptown are bustling with eateries and, of late, places to buy velvet halter dresses, vintage boleros, CBD tinctures, and LCD tea kettles with precision-pour spouts. But strolling by 10-year-old Half Moon Books, passersby might glimpse a different side of this city. The bookshop\u2019s windows exclusively feature nonfiction on the end of the world as we know it. \u201cI started out putting together a window of utopias,\u201d says bookseller Jessica DuPont, \u201cbut somehow I ended up with the death throes of capitalism.\u201d I moved to Kingston from New York City just over a decade ago, on the heels of the 2008 recession.

      "body": "<p>Three years into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the moral panic over \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cpost-truth\u201d has not abated. If anything, it has now blossomed into a full-blown culture war. Conservatives insist that their views are suppressed by Facebook and Twitter; progressives accuse the same platforms of not doing enough to crack down on hate speech and foreign manipulation of elections.</p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent testimony in US Congress \u2013 where politicians competed to deal him the lethal rhetorical blow \u2013 doesn\u2019t bode well for Silicon Valley. The Valley\u2019s only savior, at this point, is the Communist Party of China. Only indefinite trade war with China will prevent US lawmakers from regulating the \u201cstrategic\u201d tech sector; to break up the industry would weaken Washington\u2019s global standing. The Trump administration is not blind to these risks.</p> <p>Invoking the Chinese threat has bought the tech companies some time but it won\u2019t work forever. The impending tech bubble is only going to increase everyone\u2019s hatred of Silicon Valley; the calls for action will grow louder. The public humiliations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/28/wework-finance-workspace-unicorn-economic-model\">WeWork</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/11/20850878/california-passes-ab5-bill-uber-lyft\">Uber</a>, the former darlings of tech investors, are signs that public tolerance of highfalutin technology platforms (and their leaders) is already running short. More government regulation is, indeed, likely to follow \u2013 and stemming the tide of \u201cfake news\u201d would be one of the highest priorities.</p> <p>But just how strong is that tide? What remains unexamined \u2013 in the public debate but also in many academic discussions of \u201cpost-truth\u201d \u2013 is the background assumption that ours is the time of postmodernism on steroids: a time where no firm truths hold and no single narrative can survive the assault of radically different worldviews grounded in diverse material, cultural, and racial experiences.</p> <p>To deny that something like this is happening \u2013 facilitated by the business models of digital platforms, their algorithmic nudges, and the filter bubbles that result thereof \u2013 would be disingenuous. But the fragmentation of truth is only one \u2013 and perhaps not the most important part \u2013 of the story.</p> <p>One unappreciated paradox of today\u2019s \u201cdigital condition\u201d is that it celebrates post-truth and hyper-truth simultaneously. As narratives get fragmented, allowing competing truths to proliferate, there\u2019s also a concurrent effort to deploy bots, ledgers, and algorithms to produce a singular, objective, and eternal truth.</p> <p>The first stage of this \u201cobjectification\u201d began with Wikipedia.

      "bodyText": "Three years into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the moral panic over \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cpost-truth\u201d has not abated. If anything, it has now blossomed into a full-blown culture war. Conservatives insist that their views are suppressed by Facebook and Twitter; progressives accuse the same platforms of not doing enough to crack down on hate speech and foreign manipulation of elections. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent testimony in US Congress \u2013 where politicians competed to deal him the lethal rhetorical blow \u2013 doesn\u2019t bode well for Silicon Valley. The Valley\u2019s only savior, at this point, is the Communist Party of China. Only indefinite trade war with China will prevent US lawmakers from regulating the \u201cstrategic\u201d tech sector; to break up the industry would weaken Washington\u2019s global standing. The Trump administration is not blind to these risks. Invoking the Chinese threat has bought the tech companies some time but it won\u2019t work forever. The impending tech bubble is only going to increase everyone\u2019s hatred of Silicon Valley; the calls for action will grow louder. The public humiliations of WeWork and Uber, the former darlings of tech investors, are signs that public tolerance of highfalutin technology platforms (and their leaders) is already running short. More government regulation is, indeed, likely to follow \u2013 and stemming the tide of \u201cfake news\u201d would be one of the highest priorities. But just how strong is that tide? What remains unexamined \u2013 in the public debate but also in many academic discussions of \u201cpost-truth\u201d \u2013 is the background assumption that ours is the time of postmodernism on steroids: a time where no firm truths hold and no single narrative can survive the assault of radically different worldviews grounded in diverse material, cultural, and racial experiences. To deny that something like this is happening \u2013 facilitated by the business models of digital platforms, their algorithmic nudges, and the filter bubbles that result thereof \u2013 would be disingenuous. But the fragmentation of truth is only one \u2013 and perhaps not the most important part \u2013 of the story. One unappreciated paradox of today\u2019s \u201cdigital condition\u201d is that it celebrates post-truth and hyper-truth simultaneously. As narratives get fragmented, allowing competing truths to proliferate, there\u2019s also a concurrent effort to deploy bots, ledgers, and algorithms to produce a singular, objective, and eternal truth. The first stage of this \u201cobjectification\u201d began with Wikipedia. Although the platform could be used to provide multiple readings and interpretations of any subject or phenomenon, a decision was taken that a \u201ccommunity\u201d of editors and writers, armed with trustworthy and reliable sources, would converge upon a single interpretation of history. While the critics of Wikipedia zeroed in on the fact that it was, in a truly radical manner, democratizing the production of knowledge \u2013 everyone could contribute! \u2013 they missed a more fundamental, conservative side of the project: while many controversial topics featured lengthy and often bitter discussions among the editors, the front-end presentation often gave no explicit sign of internal disagreement. The controversy and disagreement were, thus, hidden from the average viewer. Instead, the proliferation of editorial and citational guidelines and regulations on Wikipedia ensured that those rules were presumed to have more say in determining the content of a page than the information supplied by the very subject of the entry.

When the state approved PG&amp;E\u2019s deenergization plans for public safety power shutoffs last year, no one seemed prepared for how frequently the utility would be conducting rolling blackouts for millions of residents: in October, some Californians suffered three separate power shutdowns. In some places, it was functionally just two \u2013 because PG&amp;E didn\u2019t finish inspecting lines and restoring service before it turned off the lights yet again.</p> <p>Some criticized the embattled utility for overzealously imposing blackouts according to an opaque set of internal criteria, motivated primarily to protect itself from the liabilities incurred by its faulty equipment. After PG&amp;E equipment was linked to the Kincade fire, and at least three other fires across the San Francisco Bay Area during the power shutoff last week, some wondered if the blackouts didn\u2019t go far enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"80f59e3a928cc655dcb7ea672d95ab9b60673dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80f59e3a928cc655dcb7ea672d95ab9b60673dc4/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fallen PG&amp;E utility pole lays on a property burned during the Kincade Fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fallen PG&amp;E utility pole lays on a property burned during the Kincade Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Pacheco/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf anything, the evidence from the [public safety power shutoff] experience in northern California so far indicates that the utility probably should have turned off more, not less,\u201d said Michael Wara, the Stanford Climate and Energy Policy Program director. \u201cWhat happened up in Sonoma makes me think we don\u2019t fully understand the risk.\u201d</p> <p>After PG&amp;E\u2019s grid was linked to deadly fires in 2017 and 2018 that totaled close to the company\u2019s market value, the utility filed for bankruptcy. But any new PG&amp;E-sparked fires pose a challenge to the company\u2019s bankruptcy plans, as any post-bankruptcy fire claims will have to be paid in full before any pre-bankruptcy claims, which includes the $10.5bn in estimated liabilities from the 2018 Camp fire that PG&amp;E admitted was sparked by its faulty infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cSince they filed for bankruptcy, we\u2019ve known that they were operating a dangerous business that could cause harm to others. They can\u2019t guarantee consistent uptime for their grid, they can\u2019t guarantee they won\u2019t start a fire \u2013 they can just promise to do the best that they can,\u201d said Jared Ellias, a UC Hastings bankruptcy law professor. \u201cBankruptcy law in some ways wasn\u2019t built for that.\u201d</p> <h2>Liability: \u2018it\u2019s a hot potato\u2019</h2> <p>Power lines have been starting fires in California since there were power lines in California, and PG&amp;E\u2019s were some of the first. As communities have grown in California\u2019s wildland urban interface, where cities meet brushland and forest across the state, that electricity grid has been expanded further into rugged, steep terrain, where it\u2019s especially expensive just to send crews for repairs and transport new equipment, sometimes dropping it in by helicopter.</p> <p>The state went to lengths to stabilize PG&amp;E earlier this year and offset the costs of further fire risk amid its bankruptcy. One piece of legislation, signed into law in July, set up a $21bn compensation fund for future wildfire liabilities, with half the money coming from ratepayers and half from investor-owned utilities. In order to cash in, the utilities were required to institute new safety measures tied to executive compensation.</p> <p>The fund was essentially a kind of insurance meant in part to restore investor confidence. But if the fires continue, that fund could quickly be depleted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b1c6d8a8e9629889b12ab86183b14e26de806658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1c6d8a8e9629889b12ab86183b14e26de806658/0_0_3240_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pacific Gas and Electric CEO Bill Johnson listens to speakers during a California Public Utilities Commission meeting in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pacific Gas and Electric CEO Bill Johnson listens to speakers during a California Public Utilities Commission meeting in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou wonder if seeing these fires will scare the investors,\u201d said Ellias. \u201cBut you have to imagine that California will be willing to step in again, because at the end of the day, they need private investors for this company,\u201d said Ellias.</p> <p>But just how California might step in remains an open question.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hot potato,\u201d said Leah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political science professor. \u201cI think that the government\u2019s probably thinking if we take this on, and then the fires keep happening, because they will, then it becomes it\u2019s even more our fault. So I can see why Gavin Newsom wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-26/california-s-governor-wants-berkshire-to-bid-for-bankrupt-pg-e\">Bloomberg</a> on Saturday, Newsom, the California governor, said he hoped Berkshire Hathaway, which owns a utility in Nevada, might buy and take over the company. But there is a growing movement calling for public ownership \u2013 either through a state takeover, or local municipalities splitting up PG&amp;E\u2019s grid.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the California representative Ro Khanna called on Newsom to support turning PG&amp;E into a customer-owned utility. \u201cCalifornia needs to be bold and take over PG&amp;E,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A state takeover would mean more public oversight, as well as more public liability for any future wildfire costs.</p> <p>But breaking up the utility is a more complicated proposition. Wealthy cities like San Francisco seceding from PG&amp;E and creating its own municipal system \u2013 which the city has a plan to do \u2013 would mean even more of those liability costs concentrated in the rest of the less-wealthy California customer base.</p> <p>\u201cWhen San Francisco says, \u2018we want to secede,\u2019 I hear that and I think, what you actually want is to not have to deal with the problems of your neighbors,\u201d said Ellias.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of liabilities on the table and breaking it up is going to make it harder for certain communities,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cThere\u2019s a question about equity.\u201d</p> <h2>Crisis or opportunity?</h2> <p>Regardless of who owns the poles and the power lines, making the repairs and upgrades necessary to run electricity mostly worry-free when the wind starts blowing in California will take a long time, and be very expensive \u2013 for PG&amp;E investors, for ordinary California ratepayers or both. Consumer advocacy groups are torn between lobbying for an increase in safety, but not in rates. But the money will have to come from somewhere.</p> <p>PG&amp;E has estimated the cost of undergrounding its lines at $3m to $5m per mile.</p> <p>Any solution, public or private, will require huge investments in the infrastructure that electrifies California \u2013 infrastructure that will only grow more vital as California moves toward using more renewable energy sources and reducing emissions, in part through new municipal policies throughout the state requiring electrification of buildings and the phase-out of natural gas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7331218277ff99c6f26a5ef11f00cc07e05f9b38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7331218277ff99c6f26a5ef11f00cc07e05f9b38/0_0_2130_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PG&amp;E crews work on restoring power lines in a Santa Rosa neighborhood ravaged by fire in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PG&amp;E crews work on restoring power lines in a Santa Rosa neighborhood ravaged by fire in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>PG&amp;E has repeatedly blamed the climate crisis for worsening wildfires in California \u2013 a stark contrast from the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/10/pge-blackouts-climate-denial/\">climate-denial efforts</a> 20 years ago. Utilities have historically been part of the carbon-emitting fossil fuel industrial complex that has driven the climate crisis.</p> <p>PG&amp;E is today a comparatively clean electricity provider, because California requires it to be \u2013 at least at present. State Republicans suggested the utility could find funding for necessary maintenance and upgrades if the state cancelled plans to source 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2045.</p> <p>Wara presents another possible solution: that this crisis, and much-needed climate adaptation as a whole, could be an opportunity for a kind of California Green New Deal for economic investment in the state\u2019s infrastructure. Through a package of home hardening, vegetation management and microgrid backup for blackouts \u2013 so that they don\u2019t continue to disproportionately impact low-income people \u2013 California could turn PG&amp;E\u2019s crisis into a public climate adaptation project.</p> <p>\u201cLuck is not in our favor, given the evolving climate situation in California,\u201d said Wara. \u201cBut we\u2019re a wealthy state. We can make sure that people are not left behind, and that we don\u2019t end up with climate change making inequality worse.\u201d</p>",

They can\u2019t guarantee consistent uptime for their grid, they can\u2019t guarantee they won\u2019t start a fire \u2013 they can just promise to do the best that they can,\u201d said Jared Ellias, a UC Hastings bankruptcy law professor. \u201cBankruptcy law in some ways wasn\u2019t built for that.\u201d Liability: \u2018it\u2019s a hot potato\u2019 Power lines have been starting fires in California since there were power lines in California, and PG&amp;E\u2019s were some of the first. As communities have grown in California\u2019s wildland urban interface, where cities meet brushland and forest across the state, that electricity grid has been expanded further into rugged, steep terrain, where it\u2019s especially expensive just to send crews for repairs and transport new equipment, sometimes dropping it in by helicopter. The state went to lengths to stabilize PG&amp;E earlier this year and offset the costs of further fire risk amid its bankruptcy. One piece of legislation, signed into law in July, set up a $21bn compensation fund for future wildfire liabilities, with half the money coming from ratepayers and half from investor-owned utilities. In order to cash in, the utilities were required to institute new safety measures tied to executive compensation. The fund was essentially a kind of insurance meant in part to restore investor confidence. But if the fires continue, that fund could quickly be depleted. \u201cYou wonder if seeing these fires will scare the investors,\u201d said Ellias. \u201cBut you have to imagine that California will be willing to step in again, because at the end of the day, they need private investors for this company,\u201d said Ellias. But just how California might step in remains an open question. \u201cIt\u2019s a hot potato,\u201d said Leah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political science professor. \u201cI think that the government\u2019s probably thinking if we take this on, and then the fires keep happening, because they will, then it becomes it\u2019s even more our fault. So I can see why Gavin Newsom wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d In an interview with Bloomberg on Saturday, Newsom, the California governor, said he hoped Berkshire Hathaway, which owns a utility in Nevada, might buy and take over the company. But there is a growing movement calling for public ownership \u2013 either through a state takeover, or local municipalities splitting up PG&amp;E\u2019s grid. On Tuesday, the California representative Ro Khanna called on Newsom to support turning PG&amp;E into a customer-owned utility. \u201cCalifornia needs to be bold and take over PG&amp;E,\u201d he said. A state takeover would mean more public oversight, as well as more public liability for any future wildfire costs. But breaking up the utility is a more complicated proposition. Wealthy cities like San Francisco seceding from PG&amp;E and creating its own municipal system \u2013 which the city has a plan to do \u2013 would mean even more of those liability costs concentrated in the rest of the less-wealthy California customer base. \u201cWhen San Francisco says, \u2018we want to secede,\u2019 I hear that and I think, what you actually want is to not have to deal with the problems of your neighbors,\u201d said Ellias. \u201cThere are a lot of liabilities on the table and breaking it up is going to make it harder for certain communities,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cThere\u2019s a question about equity.\u201d Crisis or opportunity? Regardless of who owns the poles and the power lines, making the repairs and upgrades necessary to run electricity mostly worry-free when the wind starts blowing in California will take a long time, and be very expensive \u2013 for PG&amp;E investors, for ordinary California ratepayers or both. Consumer advocacy groups are torn between lobbying for an increase in safety, but not in rates. But the money will have to come from somewhere. PG&amp;E has estimated the cost of undergrounding its lines at $3m to $5m per mile. Any solution, public or private, will require huge investments in the infrastructure that electrifies California \u2013 infrastructure that will only grow more vital as California moves toward using more renewable energy sources and reducing emissions, in part through new municipal policies throughout the state requiring electrification of buildings and the phase-out of natural gas. PG&amp;E has repeatedly blamed the climate crisis for worsening wildfires in California \u2013 a stark contrast from the company\u2019s climate-denial efforts 20 years ago. Utilities have historically been part of the carbon-emitting fossil fuel industrial complex that has driven the climate crisis. PG&amp;E is today a comparatively clean electricity provider, because California requires it to be \u2013 at least at present. State Republicans suggested the utility could find funding for necessary maintenance and upgrades if the state cancelled plans to source 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2045. Wara presents another possible solution: that this crisis, and much-needed climate adaptation as a whole, could be an opportunity for a kind of California Green New Deal for economic investment in the state\u2019s infrastructure. Through a package of home hardening, vegetation management and microgrid backup for blackouts \u2013 so that they don\u2019t continue to disproportionately impact low-income people \u2013 California could turn PG&amp;E\u2019s crisis into a public climate adaptation project. \u201cLuck is not in our favor, given the evolving climate situation in California,\u201d said Wara. \u201cBut we\u2019re a wealthy state. We can make sure that people are not left behind, and that we don\u2019t end up with climate change making inequality worse.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Two New South Wales police officers have been found to have engaged in serious misconduct after they racially abused and belittled two Afghan women at a traffic stop in western Sydney. On Thursday the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission released a series of investigations into police conduct in the state, including video footage of a 24-year-old woman and her stepmother being pulled over by police in April. The footage shows one of the officers telling the 24-year-old driver she was \u201cthe most stupidest person I\u2019ve met as the driver of a motor vehicle\u201d before threatening to falsely charge her as an accessory to murder. Later, the second officer is heard asking one of the women what her religion is and demanding she \u201cswear to Allah\u201d. The two officers pulled the women over because they believed one of the women wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt. After shouting at the driver while she attempts to apologise, he demands she and her stepmother produce identification. When the younger woman explains that her stepmother recently arrived on a temporary visa, he threatens to put her in prison. The second officer can later be heard using the word \u201cVillawood\u201d, a reference to a Sydney immigration detention centre. The officer then orders both women out of the car and when the driver protests he threatens to make a false charge against her. \u201cDon\u2019t argue with me love or you\u2019ll be going in the back of the paddy wagon as accessory to bloody murder,\u201d he says. When she tries to explain to the officer that she wasn\u2019t sure where to stop her car, he tells her to \u201chand your licence back if you don\u2019t know how to drive on Australian roads\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t you get aggro or you\u2019ll be in the back of a divvy going back to the jail, don\u2019t take advantage of our system,\u201d one of the officers says. The incident was investigated by the LECC after the 24-year-old woman made a complaint about the officers\u2019 conduct. She alleged the officers made further offensive comments after the police body-worn camera was switched off, including accusing her of having drugs in the car and suggesting that if they had been pulled over by police in Afghanistan they would be \u201cshot from behind\u201d. In its report, the LECC recommended disciplinary action be considered against both officers, saying it was satisfied the first officer had used \u201cintimidating and abusive language\u201d and deliberately \u201cbullied and frightened\u201d the two women. It was satisfied that the \u201crace and religion\u201d of the two women was relevant to their treatment, pointing out that in making comments about them taking \u201cadvantage of our system\u201d the officer was \u201creferring to two immigrants\u201d. \u201cWhat is obvious is that when he referred to \u201cour system\u201d he did so because he did not consider that [the two women] were part of that system,\u201d the LECC wrote in its report. It was also satisfied that the officer\u2019s conduct was \u201cpartially motivated by and exhibited racial prejudice\u201d. The LECC said it was also satisfied the second officer had been \u201cmaking baseless threats\u201d to both women about being taken into custody or immigration detention. The commission also expressed concern about the \u201cripple effect\u201d the conduct would have on members of the Afghan-Australian community. \u201cIt is almost certain that the officers\u2019 conduct would be widely reported in the community of which the complainant was a member, with the result that other officers would be tarred with the same brush,\u201d the LECC report. \u201cThis \u2018ripple effect\u2019 cannot be underestimated.

Chalmers said investment activity had weakened, but expressed hope that the UK\u2019s general election in December would resolve Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThat uncertainty will hopefully come to an end over the course of the next nine months, 12 months, be it what it may, and we hope that will then encourage more long-term investment into the economy. The commercial business at Lloyds will benefit and the rest of the economy.\u201d</p> <p>Impairments at Lloyds rose 15% to \u00a3371m due to a single large corporate failure, which the bank declined to identify and analysts speculated could be the bank\u2019s exposure to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Lower used-car prices hurt the bank\u2019s Black Horse motor finance business.</p> <p>However, Chalmers said credit conditions overall remained benign. Lloyds, which owns Halifax, is Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, and is seen as a bellwether for the UK economy.</p> <p>Lloyds announced that its chairman, Lord Blackwell, would retire at or before next year\u2019s annual meeting, after seven years in the role. The firm\u2019s chief operating officer, Juan Colomb\u00e1s, will step down in July after four years in the job.</p> <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at investment platform interactive investor, said: \u201cThe shares have had the benefit of a \u2018Brexit bounce\u2019 of late, rising 9% in the last three months as perception switched to ruling out the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. That particular cloud will not be lifted in the immediate future, and on balance the third quarter numbers were largely uninspiring.\u201d</p>",

PPI was sold alongside loans and mortgages to cover repayments if customers fell ill or lost their jobs, but the insurance was often sold to people who did not want or need it. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, said: \u201cI am disappointed that our statutory result was significantly impacted by the additional PPI charge in the third quarter, driven by an unprecedented level of PPI information requests received in August.\u201d William Chalmers, the bank\u2019s new chief financial officer, a former Morgan Stanley banker, said the charge reflected its \u201cbest estimate of what PPI might come out as\u201d but he could not rule out further provisions. \u201cWhen George walked out the door he said: \u2018Never say never\u2019 on the issue,\u201d he quipped about his predecessor, George Culmer. Chalmers said the bank would look at all claims \u201cno matter where they came from\u201d. The official receiver is pursuing outstanding compensation payouts in respect of bankrupt and insolvent individuals. Royal Bank of Scotland took another \u00a3900m PPI charge last week, which pushed the 62%-state-owned bank into a quarterly loss of \u00a38m. Barclays set aside a further \u00a31.4bn, taking its bill to \u00a311bn, and reported an 80% plunge in profits. Similar to Barclays, Lloyds warned that the \u201ccontinued economic uncertainty could further impact the outlook\u201d. Chalmers said investment activity had weakened, but expressed hope that the UK\u2019s general election in December would resolve Brexit uncertainty. He said: \u201cThat uncertainty will hopefully come to an end over the course of the next nine months, 12 months, be it what it may, and we hope that will then encourage more long-term investment into the economy. The commercial business at Lloyds will benefit and the rest of the economy.\u201d Impairments at Lloyds rose 15% to \u00a3371m due to a single large corporate failure, which the bank declined to identify and analysts speculated could be the bank\u2019s exposure to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Lower used-car prices hurt the bank\u2019s Black Horse motor finance business. However, Chalmers said credit conditions overall remained benign. Lloyds, which owns Halifax, is Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, and is seen as a bellwether for the UK economy. Lloyds announced that its chairman, Lord Blackwell, would retire at or before next year\u2019s annual meeting, after seven years in the role. The firm\u2019s chief operating officer, Juan Colomb\u00e1s, will step down in July after four years in the job. Richard Hunter, head of markets at investment platform interactive investor, said: \u201cThe shares have had the benefit of a \u2018Brexit bounce\u2019 of late, rising 9% in the last three months as perception switched to ruling out the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. That particular cloud will not be lifted in the immediate future, and on balance the third quarter numbers were largely uninspiring.\u201d",

Liverpool are due to play at Aston Villa after their extraordinary win over Arsenal on penalties following a 5-5 draw, and Leicester face a trip to Everton. Oxford, who won the League Cup in 1986, will aim to become the first team to defeat City in the competition since Manchester United in October 2016, Pep Guardiola team having won the tournament over the past two seasons. Colchester have played United twice in cups, in 1979 and 1983, and lost on both occasions. They are ninth in League Two but may recall how United were taken to a shootout by League One Rochdale at Old Trafford in the third round. The draw was made hours after J\u00fcrgen Klopp threatened to withdraw Liverpool from the competition should the EFL and Premier League fail to find what he considers \u201ca proper date\u201d for their quarter-final. The quarter-final against Villa is scheduled for 17 December \u2013 one day before the European champions will play in Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup tournament in Qatar. The Premier League and Football League have been in talks with clubs over switching a potential quarter-final involving Liverpool to the week commencing 6 January, currently scheduled for the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.

The myths peddled by Soviet officials had created \u201ca society steadily falling apart; run your fingers over it and you\u2019d feel the widening stitches. In the night they snapped one by one.\u201d Hope\u2019s observation of a society undone by its own falsehoods echoes throughout Rory MacLean\u2019s gripping book, part-travelogue, part-contemporary history of Europe.</p> <p>In 1989, MacLean recorded his journey from Berlin to Moscow across what was for many still Europe\u2019s terra incognita. A united, liberal Europe had seemed tantalisingly near as walls and dictatorships tumbled, families and nations were reunited, and \u2013 it appeared \u2013 communism finally joined fascism on the scrap heap of history. Now, he retraces his steps from east to west to explore what became of that dream, and finds it battered and besieged by the resurgent forces of authoritarianism, racism and demagoguery.</p> <p>Russia is the dark heart of MacLean\u2019s story. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, \u201cRussians were in trauma, their collective memory racked by historical suffering and guilt.\u201d Unable to cope with their blood-soaked past, they once again embraced a \u201cmythologised version of history\u201d. New state-sponsored narratives about the Soviet Union\u2019s heroic defeat of Nazi Germany eclipsed public discussion of humanmade famines, firing squads, mass burial grounds, the empire of forced labour camps, and the brutal annexation of neighbouring states. MacLean visits the island of Solovki in the White Sea, home to both a celebrated Orthodox monastery and the Bolsheviks\u2019 first forced labour camp. Art Hangar \u2013 a gallery-cum-community centre on the outskirts of the monastery complex \u2013 was briefly an exuberant art scene before the organisers staged an exhibition that sought to confront the horrors perpetrated there by the Soviet regime. The Orthodox church, closely allied to the Kremlin, was determined to preserve historical memory of Solovki as a place of worship uncontaminated by torture and killing. Art Hangar was forced to shut its doors.</p> <p>In Putin\u2019s Russia, as in the Soviet years, MacLean writes, \u201clies became the glue that held people together\u201d. They also became something of an export industry. In St Petersburg, MacLean meets Adina, whose language skills, flexible morality and economic hardship had landed her a job at one of Russia\u2019s troll farms. There she spent her shifts spewing out torrents of disinformation and anti-immigrant and anti-EU invective across social media. MacLean sees a naive west imperilled by Russia\u2019s propagation of \u201ca toxic nihilism, undermining objectivity, deepening splits in our societies and even changing the way we think\u201d. Quite why western societies have proved so receptive to this hate-filled rhetoric is a question that goes largely unaddressed.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, politics now follows a trail seemingly blazed by the Kremlin. Hungary is another country in the grip of \u201coutdated notions of greatness, of superiority\u201d. Here too, \u201cnostalgia replaced optimism as a ruling emotion, its people swallowed astonishing untruths about scheming enemies.\u201d The most gullible are the losers in \u201cthe changes\u201d, which have disrupted established communities and livelihoods. The son of a long-time friend in Tokaj lost his grocery shop when the local branch of Aldi opened. MacLean finds the man in Budapest, now a homeless alcoholic railing about the threats posed to Hungary by its non-existent Muslim population.</p> <p>MacLean is an accomplished writer; his immersive prose crackles with wit and wry humour, and captures scenes and personalities with aplomb. As a narrator, he is frank about his own liberal beliefs and unabashedly partisan in his thumping of reactionaries, ethno-nationalists and xenophobes. But if his colourful encounters with Europeans from alt-right Polish executives to German neo-fascists offer a fascinating and grim portrait of our current predicament, how compelling is MacLean\u2019s explanation of how we got here?</p> <p><em>Pravda Ha Ha</em> argues that unprincipled leaders across the continent have unleashed a blizzard of lies and self-serving myths in order to deflect public anger about poverty and powerlessness on to scapegoats and imaginary enemies. MacLean\u2019s story unfolds from the seeming high-water mark of liberalism and freedom at the end of the 1980s and reveals populations in eastern and central Europe to be nostalgic, historically ignorant and alarmingly susceptible to the manipulations of their rulers.</p> <p>There is a great deal of truth to his account. But illiberalism, ethno-nationalism and authoritarianism are deeply embedded in European culture \u2013 they are not confections of recent politics. In the first half of the 20th century, fascist movements dominated much of the continent in what Charles de Gaulle termed \u201cEurope\u2019s second thirty years\u2019 war\u201d. When the Berlin Wall fell, Europeans were free to experiment not just with new economic and democratic opportunities; they were also liberated from a political consensus in both east and west that kept far-right ideas confined to the margins. Nationalists and populists have exploited this with disconcerting ease to fuel their political campaigns. As a Ukrainian theatre director points out from the staging of her latest play in Dnipro, a mere 100 miles from the battlefields of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/18/new-video-evidence-of-russian-tanks-in-ukraine-european-court-human-rights\" title=\"\">Donbass</a>: \u201cWe have always lived with the dark, with war, deceit, ruin \u2026 This is part of Europe\u2019s essence, part of the nightmare.

      "body": "<p>The US men\u2019s soccer team will be forever looking up at the world\u2019s powers for several reasons.</p> <p>The USA fell behind by 100 years, in part because of cultural forces that made Americans favor American sports. Now that soccer is relatively ingrained into mainstream America (the kid on the new drama Stumptown often wears a Portland Timbers shirt), US soccer entrepreneurs and supporters are battling to pick the right direction forward, and those battles too frequently end up in court. Americans are obsessed with the quick fix for whatever ails the men\u2019s team, ignoring the more systemic issues beneath the surface, and the constant in-fighting imposes a somber air on a sport built on joy.</p> <p>One more reason the USA always struggle: US supporters are insecure in their identities.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: The US soccer community is justly proud of its inclusivity. Everyone is acutely aware that this is a global game. English-speaking soccer fans try to teach each other enough Spanish to follow broadcasts on Univision and Telemundo. Soccer is ahead of most sports in providing professional opportunities for women, and most of us recognize that we still have a long way to go. Soccer fans embrace the many lesbian players in the women\u2019s game, and it\u2019s no surprise that soccer was the first major US sport with an openly gay male player \u2013 Robbie Rogers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/07/robbie-rogers-first-openly-gay-us-male-soccer-player-retires\">who came out after his release from English club Leeds United</a> and figured his career was done, only to be coaxed out of his brief retirement to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy, whose fans greeted his first appearance with a standing ovation. We are a diverse bunch.</p> <p>But among suburbanites and young urban hipsters, being a soccer fan used to carry a sort of outsider\u2019s cachet. This is a group that wants a wide selection of craft beers, and is more likely to argue the merits of recent Radiohead albums than dance to Taylor Swift.

      "bodyText": "The US men\u2019s soccer team will be forever looking up at the world\u2019s powers for several reasons. The USA fell behind by 100 years, in part because of cultural forces that made Americans favor American sports. Now that soccer is relatively ingrained into mainstream America (the kid on the new drama Stumptown often wears a Portland Timbers shirt), US soccer entrepreneurs and supporters are battling to pick the right direction forward, and those battles too frequently end up in court. Americans are obsessed with the quick fix for whatever ails the men\u2019s team, ignoring the more systemic issues beneath the surface, and the constant in-fighting imposes a somber air on a sport built on joy. One more reason the USA always struggle: US supporters are insecure in their identities. Let\u2019s be clear: The US soccer community is justly proud of its inclusivity. Everyone is acutely aware that this is a global game. English-speaking soccer fans try to teach each other enough Spanish to follow broadcasts on Univision and Telemundo. Soccer is ahead of most sports in providing professional opportunities for women, and most of us recognize that we still have a long way to go. Soccer fans embrace the many lesbian players in the women\u2019s game, and it\u2019s no surprise that soccer was the first major US sport with an openly gay male player \u2013 Robbie Rogers, who came out after his release from English club Leeds United and figured his career was done, only to be coaxed out of his brief retirement to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy, whose fans greeted his first appearance with a standing ovation. We are a diverse bunch. But among suburbanites and young urban hipsters, being a soccer fan used to carry a sort of outsider\u2019s cachet. This is a group that wants a wide selection of craft beers, and is more likely to argue the merits of recent Radiohead albums than dance to Taylor Swift. At the extreme, some soccer fans are the Goth kids from South Park \u2013 elitist nonconformists who frankly can be kind of obnoxious about it. Let the Great Unwashed watch brutal (football) or boring (baseball) sports. So Major League Soccer\u2019s growth poses a problem. We want to keep up our soccer cred. But MLS isn\u2019t a microbrew. It\u2019s Budweiser, a former MLS sponsor. (The league has moved one rung up the beer snob\u2019s ladder, to Heineken.) \u201cWe\u201d are certainly divided. Young city dwellers are happy to partake of the MLS fan experience, especially in Portland and Seattle. But for many segments of this crowd, MLS is simply too pedestrian. And the world\u2019s biggest clubs are clearly better than any MLS club, even Atlanta United, so they can\u2019t support that. We\u2019re that desperate to be hip. More precisely, we have to be snobs. In the parlance of the US soccer community, Eurosnobs. So if you\u2019ve ever wondered whatever happened to the guy in your college who insisted that the campus radio station had gone too commercial, now you know. In 2014, a couple of months before the World Cup, Deadspin held a vote \u2013 an NCAA tournament-style set of brackets in which the \u201cwinning\u201d entity in the vote advanced to the next round \u2013 to find the \u201cBitchiest, Most Defensive Fans in America.\u201d The top seed in the sports-related bracket: Soccer fans.

      "bodyText": "Angus Taylor has apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d to Sydney\u2019s lord mayor after relying on falsified figures to launch a public attack on her council\u2019s climate record. Clover Moore\u2019s office received a letter on Thursday afternoon from the energy minister almost a week after he conceded he had relied on false data while publicly lambasting her for the council\u2019s travel record. \u201cIt is now clear to me that the correspondence I sent you on 29 September 2019 included numbers that were not correct,\u201d Taylor wrote. \u201cGiven this, I regret not clarifying those figures with you before writing, and relying on those figures in media commentary, I apologise unreservedly.\u201d The letter represents a change from Taylor\u2019s position last week, when he refused to apologise and labelled the affair a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that Taylor\u2019s office had relied on figures that grossly inflated the council\u2019s expenditure on travel during a public attack over its declaration of a climate emergency earlier this year. Moore\u2019s office received a letter from Taylor on 30 September criticising what the minister said was a $15m travel bill during 2017-18 and suggesting Moore could reduce the council\u2019s carbon emissions by cutting down on international travel. The letter had already been leaked to the Daily Telegraph, which reported the figures. The numbers, though, were incorrect. When the council queried the newspaper about the source, it provided a copy of what purported to be a council annual report it had been given by Taylor\u2019s office. The report had been altered to show spending of \u201c$14.2\u201d on domestic travel for councillors and \u201c$1.7\u201d on international travel. Those figures were completely different to those that appeared in the annual report published on the council\u2019s website, which showed just $4,206.32 on domestic travel and $1,727.77 on international travel for councillors. The total travel budget for all employees was $229,000. Taylor insists his office downloaded its copy of the report from the council\u2019s own website. But the council produced evidence showing that its publicly-available annual reports had only ever contained accurate figures. Metadata and screenshots from the council\u2019s content management system showed the annual reports on its website had not been changed since they were uploaded with the accurate figures 11 months ago. The revelations prompted Labor to refer the matter to New South Wales police, asking for an investigation of whether a forgery had been created to influence the mayor in her public duties. That referral is still being considered by NSW police. Taylor has not yet provided evidence that the document his office relied upon ever existed on the council\u2019s website. Instead his office has suggested that there may have been multiple versions of the document on the council\u2019s website because the files currently online \u2013 a PDF and a Word document \u2013 have minor formatting differences. The council and Labor have rejected that explanation.",

      "bodyText": "Adani has sought to delay significant upfront expenses for its Carmichael coalmine by another two years, raising questions about the company\u2019s claims its Indian parent has allocated the required finance. Guardian Australia can reveal Adani was granted a reissued water licence to take up to 12.5bn litres a year from the Suttor River by the Queensland government on 29 May. The deadline for the $18.5m outstanding payment has now been pushed back until mid-2021. The company had previously been given a year\u2019s extension beyond the initial July 2018 payment deadline. Adani\u2019s own water modelling shows it requires 3.35bn litres of water during the first year of construction. Adani says the reason for the delay is because the company is working through the implications of \u201clegal challenges by activist groups\u201d to its water scheme, and will pay when those matters are finalised. The company has also recently sought and been granted approval by the federal government for a two-year extension to the deadline to legally acquire properties to be used as environmental offsets for the western portion of its rail corridor. Adani will have to negotiate with landholders and pay compensation to secure the offset areas. Since announcing it had secured finance from within the Adani group to build a scaled-down version of the Carmichael mine in November 2018, Adani\u2019s Australian operation aggressively sought to pressure governments to sign off on outstanding environmental approvals. The campaign included messaging that \u201cwe have finance\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re ready to start\u201d and linked the push for environmental approvals to the immediate provision of jobs. Since gaining those approvals, Adani says it has agreed $450m worth of contracts and has 150 workers on site conducting land clearing, surveying, fencing works, civil earthworks and other construction activities. Financial market sentiment appears to be improving towards Adani\u2019s Australian operations, with bonds in the Abbot Point coal terminal increasing 15% in the past month. In a statement, Adani said Carmichael was proceeding in line with its schedule and cost estimates and that \u201cminor variations are a matter of course on major mining projects\u201d. \u201cWorks will continue to ramp up over the coming weeks and months and we are on track to deliver our first coal in 2021.\u201d But satellite images show little physical progress has been made since the notional start of construction in June. Analysis of those images shows the company has cleared about 365 hectares (900 acres) of land at the 28,000 hectare mine site. Guardian Australia understands many of the workers on site are employed by external contractors under short-term agreements. The energy finance expert Tim Buckley says any notional finance allocated by the Adani group to the Carmichael project was still \u201csitting in India\u201d. \u201cThe fact they don\u2019t have $18.5m [to pay for the water licence] is pretty telling,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cIn the scheme of the Adani group\u2019s business that\u2019s small change. \u201c[Adani chairman and founder] Gautam Adani has got the cash to build Carmichael and pay for things, let\u2019s not pretend he doesn\u2019t. The money is there now, but it\u2019s sitting in India. By definition, the finance hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d Buckley says projects with secure finance were typically then able to spend the money without restriction. \u201cWhen a project gets finance, you\u2019re off to the races. You don\u2019t say you\u2019re going to build a quarter of a railway line.\u201d He said Adani\u2019s attempts to progress the Carmichael mine were \u201cdebt on debt on debt\u201d and that was a good indication the Indian parent had at least some hesitation about the project, given the risks that remain from environmental activism, the diving price of thermal coal and additional regulatory hurdles, such as negotiating access to the Aurizon rail network. Guardian Australia has spoken to contractors who previously discussed working with Adani, and who said the company had proposed an unusual sort of \u201cvendor finance\u201d arrangement that would effectively delay payments for work by up to two-and-a-half years, until after the mine was operational. Adani Mining\u2019s negative balance sheet and the groups\u2019s lack of assets in Australia, other than the heavily in debt Abbot Point port, have raised concerns about its ability to offer security to contractors and others. The state government requires financial assurance to cover a potential royalties deferral deal, which is still under negotiation. The Lock the Gate Alliance said the extension for the water licence payment was \u201cfurther evidence that Adani is in no way financially prepared to put its money where its mouth is\u201d. The Lock the Gate coordinator, Carmel Flint, said the water licence conditions contained a trigger for the Queensland government to cancel it, should payment not be made by the due date. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate the Queensland government didn\u2019t take the opportunity to cancel this licence and reassess the water impacts on the graziers and waterways in Central Queensland,\u201d Flint said. The Australian Conservation Foundation says it is concerned about allowing a further delay in securing offset areas, which would provide habitat for native species including the black-throated finch. Christian Slattery from the ACF said offsets were inadequate, but that the variation to Adani\u2019s conditions further weakened the protection for those species. \u201cThis decision means delayed protection for threatened species like the black-throated finch, which Adani\u2019s coalmine places at further risk of extinction. \u201cAdani\u2019s coalmine will never have a social licence to operate in Australia. Any company that shackles itself to this project risks a permanent mark against its reputation and must be prepared for the financial consequences that will follow,\u201d Slattery said. In its statement, Adani said that \u201call activities are being conducted safely and in line with Adani Mining\u2019s environmental requirements, including having wildlife spotters on site monitoring all construction activity\u201d.",

Are there any alternatives that treat the artist well? <strong>Robert</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Your problem is that you don\u2019t really have a problem. I\u2019m in almost exactly the same position, only slightly worse, because I still use an MP3 player to listen to albums in MP3 format. The main difference is that I\u2019m almost completely happy about not using any music streaming services. They are not obligatory. If you don\u2019t need them, don\u2019t use them. Spend the money on downloads or CDs instead.</p> <p>As always, there is no universal answer because it depends on all sorts of factors. These include the kinds of music you enjoy, how you listen to it, and why you listen to it.</p> <p>Streaming music services are very good for people who like popular music and are singles-oriented. (Yes, I know you can listen to albums. Most people don\u2019t.) They also provide playlists that are much like thematic replacements for live radio or, as we used to call it, background music. Apart from Today\u2019s Top Hits on Spotify, there are playlists of happy songs to wake up to, relaxing music to unwind to, party music to dance to, music to go with various types of exercise, music to fall asleep to plus any number of genre-specific playlists.</p> <p>Streaming music services may have limited appeal for classical music or jazz fans who are album or even box set oriented, and who care deeply about knowing who is playing what, when and how. That\u2019s me.</p> <p>For example, Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic recorded Beethoven\u2019s nine symphonies four times and they are different, even though they sometimes have the same soloists in the ninth. Simon Rattle\u2019s set with the Vienna Philharmonic is even more different. It\u2019s the same for versions of The Messiah, Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion and any opera you can think of. As far as I can tell, streaming music services just don\u2019t care about this kind of thing, except when someone like Ed Sheeran releases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/24/weve-got-more-money-swirling-around-how-streaming-saved-the-music-industry\">half a dozen different versions</a> of the same song.</p> <p>Having said that, I did like Pandora\u2019s streaming music service, and would still use had it not been withdrawn from the UK market. Pandora lets you create your own radio station by seeding it with something you like. I had a William Orbit station, and Pandora\u2019s algorithms surfaced all sorts of fascinating stuff by musicians I had (mostly) never heard before. It was brilliant. For those fully on-board with Spotify, its algorithmic Discover Weekly playlist can be a source of similar inspiration for both new and old music, but it requires you listen to everything through the service and invest time in liking or disliking songs to teach it what you want.</p> <p>Today\u2019s mainstream radio stations are deliberately bad at music discovery, because they know listeners will switch over if they don\u2019t keep hearing the same familiar stuff. That leaves a hole that streaming services could fill, if only they were as good as Pandora. In theory, specialised playlists can do the job, but finding them can feel like more work than it\u2019s worth.</p> <h2><strong>Money, money, money</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ac7673d25dff56a512b8c70771319da28d29f1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ac7673d25dff56a512b8c70771319da28d29f1d/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify is the biggest streaming service, but others are available.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify is the biggest streaming service, but others are available.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvic/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Streaming music services are notorious for paying minuscule amounts for playing songs, and several major artists have <a href=\"https://www.ranker.com/list/musicians-against-spotify/ranker-music\">not joined or removed their music in protest</a>. Whether the payments are good or bad depends to some extent on how you look at it: they are not good if they are replacing download sales, but not so bad if they\u2019re replacing radio plays. However, all the major services have been losing money, and most probably still are. Even Spotify, the biggest and richest service with 80 million paying subscribers, would struggle to pay significantly more.</p> <p>Spotify was launched in Sweden in 2008 and made its first quarterly profits this year. However, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2019/Spotify-Technology-SA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Third-Quarter-2019/default.aspx\">predicting an operating loss</a> of \u20ac31-\u20ac131m for the next quarter, despite growing its number of monthly active users by 30% in the past year to 191 million. It\u2019s a numbers game, and smaller rivals don\u2019t have Spotify\u2019s economies of scale.</p> <p>Digital Music News has tried to establish <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/12/25/streaming-music-services-pay-2019/\">how much</a> various music services pay for streaming. According to its analysis, Napster pays the highest rate at $0.019 per stream, followed by Jay-Z\u2019s Tidal at $0.0125 and Apple at $0.00735 per stream. YouTube pays the lowest rate of only $0.00069 per stream. Spotify is now, it seems, somewhere in the middle ground, paying about $0.00437 per stream.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t a lot of money for most of the artists with music on Spotify, because 10,000 plays only pays $43.70. However, a song that gets 10m streams will earn $43,700, and big hits can earn a lot. Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You has been streamed more than 2bn times, which would be worth $8.74m at current rates. Three other Sheeran songs have been streamed more than a billion times, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-streamed_songs_on_Spotify\">Wikipedia\u2019s list</a>.</p> <p>Another benefit is that singles can stick around earning money for years after they would have gone out of stock at record shops. A successful artist with a back catalogue of half a dozen albums on Spotify \u2013 perhaps 50 or more tracks \u2013 could do quite well, especially if their music fits easily on popular playlists. In other words, your grandmother might like it.</p> <h2><strong>Supporting artists</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f0c098c420b193150f7e2bed47084d1a547ab23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0c098c420b193150f7e2bed47084d1a547ab23/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buying albums, merchandise and going to concerts are the best ways to support the artists you love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buying albums, merchandise and going to concerts are still the best ways to support the artists you love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spotify\u2019s stated aim \u201cis to harness Spotify\u2019s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work\u201d. That would be nice. However \u2013 as with sales of records, blockbuster movies, books, YouTube videos and so on \u2013 the bulk of the money goes to the people with the biggest hits.</p> <p>So, if your musical tastes favour mainstream pop, you shouldn\u2019t worry too much about Spotify\u2019s pay rates. Every time you stream a song by Ed Sheeran, Drake, Justin Bieber, Adele, Ariana Grande and so on then you are \u201cvoting\u201d their songs up the charts. The higher they go, the more people will play them, and the more money these superstars will make.</p> <p>But if your tastes are relatively, or even absolutely, obscure, then you should find other ways to support your favourite artists. Even if you never play any songs by Ed Sheeran et al, Spotify is going to send them your money. The \u201cminor artists\u201d you are playing will get almost none of it.</p> <p>As a result, the vast majority of musicians are not making enough to live on from streaming, but they shouldn\u2019t expect to. As with radio plays, their best hope is to attract an audience. They can do that on a music service like Spotify \u2013 Justin Bieber did it on YouTube, Billie Eilish on SoundCloud \u2013 without having to go via record labels, DJs and other gatekeepers. After that, they can <a href=\"https://blog.patreon.com/amanda-palmer-community\">create their own communities, like Amanda Palmer</a>, the Grateful Dead or Lady Gaga.</p> <p>The best way to support musicians you care about is to buy their albums on CD or digitally from <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp</a>, go to their concerts, buy their merchandise, join their fan clubs, follow them on Instagram, subscribe to their <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer\">Patreons</a>, and so on. That way, they will get far more of your cash than they would get from Spotify and similar services. Better than that, they will feel their work is appreciated, which is what most artists actually want.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

Today\u2019s mainstream radio stations are deliberately bad at music discovery, because they know listeners will switch over if they don\u2019t keep hearing the same familiar stuff. That leaves a hole that streaming services could fill, if only they were as good as Pandora. In theory, specialised playlists can do the job, but finding them can feel like more work than it\u2019s worth. Money, money, money Streaming music services are notorious for paying minuscule amounts for playing songs, and several major artists have not joined or removed their music in protest. Whether the payments are good or bad depends to some extent on how you look at it: they are not good if they are replacing download sales, but not so bad if they\u2019re replacing radio plays. However, all the major services have been losing money, and most probably still are. Even Spotify, the biggest and richest service with 80 million paying subscribers, would struggle to pay significantly more. Spotify was launched in Sweden in 2008 and made its first quarterly profits this year. However, it\u2019s predicting an operating loss of \u20ac31-\u20ac131m for the next quarter, despite growing its number of monthly active users by 30% in the past year to 191 million. It\u2019s a numbers game, and smaller rivals don\u2019t have Spotify\u2019s economies of scale. Digital Music News has tried to establish how much various music services pay for streaming. According to its analysis, Napster pays the highest rate at $0.019 per stream, followed by Jay-Z\u2019s Tidal at $0.0125 and Apple at $0.00735 per stream. YouTube pays the lowest rate of only $0.00069 per stream. Spotify is now, it seems, somewhere in the middle ground, paying about $0.00437 per stream. That isn\u2019t a lot of money for most of the artists with music on Spotify, because 10,000 plays only pays $43.70. However, a song that gets 10m streams will earn $43,700, and big hits can earn a lot. Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You has been streamed more than 2bn times, which would be worth $8.74m at current rates. Three other Sheeran songs have been streamed more than a billion times, according to Wikipedia\u2019s list. Another benefit is that singles can stick around earning money for years after they would have gone out of stock at record shops. A successful artist with a back catalogue of half a dozen albums on Spotify \u2013 perhaps 50 or more tracks \u2013 could do quite well, especially if their music fits easily on popular playlists. In other words, your grandmother might like it. Supporting artists Spotify\u2019s stated aim \u201cis to harness Spotify\u2019s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work\u201d. That would be nice. However \u2013 as with sales of records, blockbuster movies, books, YouTube videos and so on \u2013 the bulk of the money goes to the people with the biggest hits. So, if your musical tastes favour mainstream pop, you shouldn\u2019t worry too much about Spotify\u2019s pay rates. Every time you stream a song by Ed Sheeran, Drake, Justin Bieber, Adele, Ariana Grande and so on then you are \u201cvoting\u201d their songs up the charts. The higher they go, the more people will play them, and the more money these superstars will make. But if your tastes are relatively, or even absolutely, obscure, then you should find other ways to support your favourite artists. Even if you never play any songs by Ed Sheeran et al, Spotify is going to send them your money. The \u201cminor artists\u201d you are playing will get almost none of it. As a result, the vast majority of musicians are not making enough to live on from streaming, but they shouldn\u2019t expect to. As with radio plays, their best hope is to attract an audience. They can do that on a music service like Spotify \u2013 Justin Bieber did it on YouTube, Billie Eilish on SoundCloud \u2013 without having to go via record labels, DJs and other gatekeepers. After that, they can create their own communities, like Amanda Palmer, the Grateful Dead or Lady Gaga. The best way to support musicians you care about is to buy their albums on CD or digitally from Bandcamp, go to their concerts, buy their merchandise, join their fan clubs, follow them on Instagram, subscribe to their Patreons, and so on. That way, they will get far more of your cash than they would get from Spotify and similar services. Better than that, they will feel their work is appreciated, which is what most artists actually want. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "\u201cToday\u2019s news is tomorrow\u2019s fish and chip papers\u201d is a saying long used to soothe celebrities facing scandal, but increasingly it\u2019s one that could just as easily describe British politics. In this era of Brexit-mania, a headline declaring major breaking news is barely published before a new turn of events makes it instantly out of date. But as the nation \u2013 and the media \u2013 prepares for what will be the most febrile election campaign in a generation, it means some of the most serious issues facing the country are being forgotten. I\u2019d call it a kind of political amnesia. Millions of families endure turmoil at the hands of government polices \u2013 yet as the years pass, those policies barely get a mention in news reports any more. To see this amnesia in action, look at the bedroom tax. Introduced in 2013, it was the most controversial of the so-called welfare reforms of the coalition era, punishing hundreds of thousands of the poorest social housing tenants \u2013 many of them disabled \u2013 for having a spare room in their home. It was a minor detail that the \u201cspare rooms\u201d in question were often filled with hospital-style beds or boxes of medicine, or that there were generally no smaller properties for families to move into. Flick through news reports from that time and outraged concern dominates the headlines. \u201cBedroom tax nightmare is worse than Afghanistan, says war veteran reduced to living on \u00a35 a day,\u201d said the Daily Record in 2013. \u201cFoster carers hit by bedroom tax,\u201d reported ITN in the same year. Six years later the policy has hit the headlines again. This time it was when the European court of human rights (ECHR) ruled that a domestic violence survivor had suffered a violation of her rights by being penalised through the bedroom tax. The mum, known only as \u201cA\u201d for her protection, lives in a three-bedroom home specially adapted by police to contain a panic room to protect her and her 11-year-old son from her violent ex-partner.

Think of the homeless people dying on our streets, or the disabled people put through \u201cfit for work\u201d tests.

In this collection of 20 sparkling mini-essays, Christina Hardyment sets out to show how bricks and mortar make compelling fictional characters just as surely as skin and bone. Skilfully deploying biography, close reading and psychogeography, Hardyment creates a series of charming house portraits, starting with Horace Walpole\u2019s gothic castle of Otranto (1764) and winding up with the equally crenellated Hogwarts, courtesy of JK Rowling (1997-2007). Along the way we stop off at Jane Austen\u2019s Mansfield Park (1814), Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (1852) and JRR Tolkien\u2019s Bag End (1937).</p> <p>You can\u2019t help noticing that there aren\u2019t many airy, well-lit interiors in evidence here. No one seems keen on open plan, cleaning up or putting things away in their proper place. Instead, corridors twist and turn to nowhere, paintings of fussy-looking ancestors stare from the wall and talismanic objects \u2013 books, a dagger, an out-of-place saucepan \u2013 are left lying carelessly around just waiting to make mischief. This must be because the houses that authors create in their imaginations are dragged up from the twistiest parts of their unconscious, replicating those hidden corners where neurosis and creativity do their special dance. It is also, Hardyment suggests, because authors frequently base their fictional houses on their own beloved homes, which \u2013 surprise \u2013 turn out to be hugger-mugger too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The four-year-old  EM Forster fell in love with his home\u2019s breaks in logic, the way the three attics could smell of apple, mice and jam simultaneously</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A case in point. In 1883 EM Forster and his indomitable mother Lily moved into Rooks Nest, a mellow red farmhouse in Hertfordshire. Four-year-old Morgan fell in love with his rented home\u2019s sharp breaks in logic, the way that there was a surprise set of stairs behind a door leading off the hall, or that the three large attics could smell simultaneously of apple, mice and jam. Away at boarding school in Kent he drew careful plans of the house, and even wrote it a nine-page love letter. He assumed that he would live and die at Rooks Nest and so when, after a mere decade, the owners reclaimed their delightful home for themselves, the boy was devastated. Twenty years later Forster recreated Rooks Nest as Howards End, the near-sacred refuge in which the Wilcox and Schlegel families work through the psychic wounds that come with being alive in the early 20th century. Here are the ruddy bricks of the original, there the flowering plum trees, while the smell of apple, mice and jam lingers too. \u201cThis house is my childhood and its safety,\u201d murmured Forster on an ecstatic return visit to Rooks Nest in middle age, but it\u2019s clear that he was dreaming too of Howards End.</p> <p>Not all fictional houses are made out of deep feeling. Some, indeed, are purposefully built from paper. Stella Gibbons\u2019s Cold Comfort Farm is a carefully constructed parody of the grubby, seething homesteads that you find in the 1920s \u201cloam and lovechild\u201d potboilers of Mary Webb and Sheila Kaye-Smith, with an extra dash of filth from DH Lawrence. The incomparable Starkadder family have lived for centuries in Howling, Sussex, in a farm which \u201ccrouched like a beast, about to spring, under the bulk of Mockuncle Hill\u201d. In the filthy kitchen, a bubbling \u201csnood of porridge\u201d hangs over the sullen fire and gives \u201can ominous, leering heave\u201d. The stage is set for Flora Poste, the book\u2019s brisk heroine, to descend on her cousins\u2019 filthy burrow from London and work her cleansing magic. By the end of the book everyone, and even the farm itself, has had a good wash and brush-up and is ready to show a sparkling new face to the modern world.</p> <p>In truth, Hardyment has not found much new to say about these literary homes but, like an excellent housekeeper, she rearranges and polishes up the furniture in such a way that you find yourself inclined to linger. Nor is her job always quite as easy or obvious as you might at first think. Literary houses have a disconcerting habit of either disappearing halfway through a text, or switching places with an uncanny twin. Take Dickens\u2019s Bleak House. Despite its ominous name, John Jarndyce\u2019s eponymous mansion is actually a place of \u201clight, warmth and comfort\u201d and \u201chospitable jingle\u201d. It is Chesney Wold, Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock\u2019s cheery-sounding Lincolnshire stately home that exudes the drenched melancholy and clenched terror of the novel\u2019s doubly narrated plot. And that\u2019s not forgetting, of course, all the other bleak houses in the novel, from Krook\u2019s hovel, to Tulkinghorn\u2019s lair to Chancery\u2019s fog-choked grandeur and, finally, the feverish accusation that is Tom-All-Alone\u2019s.

to victory that doesn\u2019t travel through the ring roads and growth corridors of outer metropolitan Australia,\u201d Chalmers said, launching a new book from the head of the John Curtin Research Centre, Nick Dyrenfurth.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have a strong national economy without good jobs and rising living standards in the suburbs.</p> <p>\u201cPut it this way: this country succeeds when economic policy has a suburban sensibility.\u201d</p> <p>While saying the cities are \u201cobviously\u201d important and the regions were also \u201ccritical\u201d, Chalmers points to the political imperative of connecting to the outer suburbs, saying a third of all federal electorates are classified \u201couter metropolitan\u201d by the Australian Electoral Commission.</p> <aside

combined 45.3% of the primary vote, compared to the 38.7% won in May this year.</p> <p>\u201cThe suburbs are where the political contest between the major parties is most frequently and most prominently joined,\u201d Chalmers said.</p> <p>\u201cThe suburbs determine whether Labor prevails or fails.\u201d</p> <p>Acknowledging that prime minister Scott Morrison had also targeted outer suburban Australians by pitching to the so-called \u201cquiet Australians\u201d, Chalmers said that the economy was failing those living in outer metropolitan Australia.</p> <p>Pointing to a median weekly income $100 lower than inner city areas, high levels of mortgage stress, higher unemployment and lower incomes, Chalmers said that economic growth was not \u201ctrickling down\u201d to these people.</p> <p>\u201cIf the PM understood anything about life in the suburbs he\u2019d know the quiet Australians are faring badly under a Liberal government in its seventh year and third

needed to shape the centre ground of politics with a focus on wages and jobs and the outer suburbs, Chalmers said this did not mean retreating from progressive politics of the environment and social justice.</p> <p>On climate change, he rejects the idea that action on climate change is an inner-city issue, or something that only the \u201cluvvies\u201d care about.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a central and defining issue in suburbs like those I represent, which goes to cheaper and cleaner energy, cost of living, investment certainty, and \u2013 as Anthony put it really well on Tuesday in

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s \u201cpath to victory\u201d must travel through Australia\u2019s outer suburbs and give struggling families a voice, Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says, as the party seeks to reposition itself in the wake of the May election. Chalmers, who was promoted to the treasury portfolio in Anthony Albanese\u2019s shadow cabinet, used a speech in Melbourne on Thursday to argue that the Labor party is at its \u201cbest and truest self\u201d when it acts as the \u201cparty of the outer suburbs\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no path to victory that doesn\u2019t travel through the ring roads and growth corridors of outer metropolitan Australia,\u201d Chalmers said, launching a new book from the head of the John Curtin Research Centre, Nick Dyrenfurth. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a strong national economy without good jobs and rising living standards in the suburbs. \u201cPut it this way: this country succeeds when economic policy has a suburban sensibility.\u201d While saying the cities are \u201cobviously\u201d important and the regions were also \u201ccritical\u201d, Chalmers points to the political imperative of connecting to the outer suburbs, saying a third of all federal electorates are classified \u201couter metropolitan\u201d by the Australian Electoral Commission. At the 2007 election \u2013 the last time Labor was elected to government from opposition \u2013 the party won a combined 45.3% of the primary vote, compared to the 38.7% won in May this year. \u201cThe suburbs are where the political contest between the major parties is most frequently and most prominently joined,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cThe suburbs determine whether Labor prevails or fails.\u201d Acknowledging that prime minister Scott Morrison had also targeted outer suburban Australians by pitching to the so-called \u201cquiet Australians\u201d, Chalmers said that the economy was failing those living in outer metropolitan Australia. Pointing to a median weekly income $100 lower than inner city areas, high levels of mortgage stress, higher unemployment and lower incomes, Chalmers said that economic growth was not \u201ctrickling down\u201d to these people. \u201cIf the PM understood anything about life in the suburbs he\u2019d know the quiet Australians are faring badly under a Liberal government in its seventh year and third term.\u201d \u201cMorrison celebrates the silence of the quiet Australians instead of understanding their struggles \u2013 we want to give them a voice.\u201d While arguing the party needed to shape the centre ground of politics with a focus on wages and jobs and the outer suburbs, Chalmers said this did not mean retreating from progressive politics of the environment and social justice. On climate change, he rejects the idea that action on climate change is an inner-city issue, or something that only the \u201cluvvies\u201d care about. \u201cI think it\u2019s a central and defining issue in suburbs like those I represent, which goes to cheaper and cleaner energy, cost of living, investment certainty, and \u2013 as Anthony put it really well on Tuesday in Perth \u2013 the jobs of the future.\u201d He also rejected an argument put forward by Dyrenfurth that Labor had become too middle class and should consider establishing a \u201cnew working-class quota system\u201d \u2013 a key argument made in the book. \u201cI believe our parliamentary ranks are more diverse \u2013 more suburban and more working class \u2013 than the caricature allows.\u201d The comments from Chalmers come as a series of frontbenchers put forward their views on the direction of the party and the faults of the election campaign led by Bill Shorten. In a speech on Thursday, frontbencher Clare O\u2019Neil will argue that changing political faultlines will require Labor to take a different approach to its economic program and to reconsider how it engages with voters on cultural issues. Next week, a review that has been conducted by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson into the party\u2019s campaign will be handed to the party\u2019s federal executive and then publicly released. Chalmers said that it was important for the party to learn the lessons of the party\u2019s defeat and then \u201cdraw a line\u201d and focus on the future. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a responsibility to learn from what happened and get on with our jobs,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cRecapturing lost support also means learning the lessons of the campaign without obsessing over the outcome forever.\u201d He also said that responsibility for the defeat should not rest with Shorten alone, saying the former leader should not \u201ccarry the can on his own\u201d for the party\u2019s collective failures. \u201cIn the Labor party we take decisions collectively and we take responsibility for them collectively as well.\u201d",

Its two soaring blocks, connected by an aerial bridge and topped with a long-closed rotating restaurant resembling a space capsule, are such an unusual sight, the 1977-build tower has become a magnet for tourists despite years of neglect. The tower is one of the most significant examples of brutalism \u2013 an architectural style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, based on crude, block-like forms cast from concrete. Genex Tower, also known as the Western City gate, in Belgrade, Serbia. Brutalism was popular throughout the eastern bloc but the former Yugoslavia made it its own \u2013 seizing on it as a way to forge a visual identity poised between east and west. Interest in the style is soaring \u2013 particularly since a 2018 exhibition in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980. Top: Karaburma Housing Tower, also known as the Toblerone building, in Belgrade, Serbia; Above: the Eastern City Gate apartment buildings complex in the Konjarnik neighbourhood of Belgrade \u201cWe have dozens of people every week interested in taking our Yugo tour around city landmarks built from the 1950s to 1980s,\u201d says Vojin Muncin, manager of the Yugotour sightseeing agency which guides tourists around the Serbian capital in Yugos, the former Yugoslavia\u2019s once ubiquitous car. \u201cGenex Tower is among the most interesting sight. People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.\u201d Today one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s. Above: laundry hangs out to dry inside Block 23, New Belgrade. Right: A staircase in Block 11; garage doors in Block 23. Below: Windows face out of the building, known as the \u201cTV building\u201d, a facade in Block 28. After the second world war, socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country. The architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds \u2013 western democracy and the communist east, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia. But after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture.

It\u2019s also cheaper than its bigger sibling the \u00a3829 Pixel 4 XL. The concern is: which corners have been cut and do they matter?</p> <p>The 5.7in FHD+ OLED display has the same 90Hz refresh rate as the larger 6.3in version on the Pixel 4 XL. It looks very similar too, with good viewing angles, inky blacks and bold colours and smooth experience thanks to that high refresh rate.

The Pixel 4 only lasts just over 14 hours between charges. Remove it from the charger at 7am and it will be dead by 9pm. Turning off the bells and whistles such as the ambient display only added about 40 minutes to the battery life. Anything under 24 hours simply is not good enough, particularly given I didn\u2019t play any games or do anything particularly battery-draining.</p> <p>That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, two hours of browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and three photos.</p> <p>For comparison, similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro lasts 32 hours and the Pixel 4 XL lasts 26 hours under similar conditions, while the majority of smartphones in 2019 can last at least 24 hours with heavy usage.</p> <p>The Pixel 4 fast charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, of which one is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W.

At least three years of software updates from the phone\u2019s release are included and it will get Android version updates before most other devices.</p> <p>The Pixel 4 also has the same new on-device natural language processing that was so impressive on the larger Pixel 4 XL. Google Assistant is much faster and works without an internet connection for many tasks. Google\u2019s voice transcription app is equally excellent, as is the Live Caption feature.</p> <p>The new Assistant still doesn\u2019t work with Google\u2019s own commercial G Suite accounts though, which is a bit of a blunder.

      "bodyText": "Google is one of only a handful of smartphone manufacturers still making flagship phones that aren\u2019t ginormous beasts, with the new Pixel 4 the cheapest in a while that significantly undercuts the competition. Priced at \u00a3669, the Pixel 4 is \u00a370 cheaper than last year\u2019s Pixel 3 and \u00a360 cheaper than Apple\u2019s iPhone 11. It\u2019s also cheaper than its bigger sibling the \u00a3829 Pixel 4 XL. The concern is: which corners have been cut and do they matter? The 5.7in FHD+ OLED display has the same 90Hz refresh rate as the larger 6.3in version on the Pixel 4 XL. It looks very similar too, with good viewing angles, inky blacks and bold colours and smooth experience thanks to that high refresh rate. But it\u2019s not the brightest screen available, which makes it fine for most things but not quite as bright as I would like in direct sunlight. There\u2019s the same large forehead containing the sensors for Google\u2019s new Face Unlock and Motion Sense systems. The sides are aluminium, but with a black textured coating, while the glass back is frosted with a texture similar to super-smooth skin. Buy the white or orange version and the contrasting colours make the Pixel 4 stand out. Combined with its slender proportions of just 68.8mm wide and 162g, the Pixel 4 is one of the smallest, lightest and easiest of top-end smartphones to hold and use. It\u2019s a joy to be able to easily use a smartphone one-handed again. For comparison, Apple\u2019s \u00a31,049 iPhone 11 Pro is currently the best smaller phone available, but it\u2019s 71.4mm wide and 188g, while the \u00a3799 Samsung Galaxy S10 is 70.4mm wide and 157g. Specifications Screen: 5.7in FHD+ OLED (90Hz, 444ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 6GB of RAM Storage: 64 or 128GB Operating system: Android 10 Camera: Dual rear cameras (12.2+16MP) with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 5, NFC, eSIM, Bluetooth 5, GPS, 3D face recognition Dimensions: 68.8 x 147.1 x 8.2mm Weight: 162g Awful battery life The Pixel 4 has the same 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 as the Pixel 4 XL and performs identically \u2013 fast and fluid, but not quite as speedy as the OnePlus 7T. Battery life was really poor. The Pixel 4 only lasts just over 14 hours between charges. Remove it from the charger at 7am and it will be dead by 9pm. Turning off the bells and whistles such as the ambient display only added about 40 minutes to the battery life. Anything under 24 hours simply is not good enough, particularly given I didn\u2019t play any games or do anything particularly battery-draining. That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, two hours of browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and three photos. For comparison, similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro lasts 32 hours and the Pixel 4 XL lasts 26 hours under similar conditions, while the majority of smartphones in 2019 can last at least 24 hours with heavy usage. The Pixel 4 fast charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, of which one is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W. A full charge via cable took 105 minutes hitting 70% in 45 minutes. Android 10 The Pixel 4 is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, complete with system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation. At least three years of software updates from the phone\u2019s release are included and it will get Android version updates before most other devices. The Pixel 4 also has the same new on-device natural language processing that was so impressive on the larger Pixel 4 XL. Google Assistant is much faster and works without an internet connection for many tasks. Google\u2019s voice transcription app is equally excellent, as is the Live Caption feature. The new Assistant still doesn\u2019t work with Google\u2019s own commercial G Suite accounts though, which is a bit of a blunder. Google says it\u2019s still working on a fix. Motion Sense Motion Sense uses radar to track motions around the phone. It lights up the ambient screen when you\u2019re within 60cm, will silence calls or snooze alarms when you reach for the phone, and skip music tracks when you swipe in mid-air above it. The technology is more impressive than the functionality currently. Face Unlock Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new Face Unlock using 3D face recognition technology similar to Apple\u2019s Face ID. It\u2019s seriously fast and worked through polarised sunglasses just fine. Look at the phone and it\u2019ll unlock, skipping the lockscreen and taking you straight back into the last thing you were doing. Although technically you don\u2019t need to actually look at it, as it\u2019ll unlock with your eyes closed, which might be a problem for some. Google says it\u2019ll add the option to require attention at a later date. The biggest issue is that most third-party apps do not recognise Face Unlock, meaning without a fingerprint scanner they just assume the Pixel 4 doesn\u2019t have a biometric input forcing you back to entering pins or passwords, which is tedious. To use Face Unlock developers need to update their apps to support the new unified biometric system built into Android, with only a small handful having done so currently. For those that have done, such as LastPass, using Face Unlock is a seamless experience \u2013 just as Face ID is on an iPhone. Given Monzo is saying it will take a while to implement, you can probably forget your traditional banking apps working soon. Camera Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the new dual-camera system on the back of the Pixel 4 is no different. It\u2019s the same camera as that fitted to the Pixel 4 XL and performs the same. That is to say it has fantastic still image quality, even in very difficult lighting conditions.

Not so good is video capture, which caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second, not the 60fps rivals manage.

For comparison, the smaller Google Pixel 4 XL costs \u00a3829 ($899), the OnePlus 7T costs \u00a3549, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs \u00a3799, the iPhone 11 costs \u00a3729 and the iPhone 11 Pro costs \u00a31,049.

      "body": "<p>When exactly did Halloween turn into such a monstrously big thing? How much bigger can it get? Will it eventually overwhelm Christmas? I find it all a bit much. A couple of times, I\u2019ve spent Halloween in the US, where there seemed to be a collective leave-taking of senses. Homes were done up to the nines. Children were plainly mad for it, but not as much as their parents who often had wild looks in their eyes. Really frightening stuff. Back then, I could smile indulgently while I enjoyed the spectacle; it was reassuring to know that in Blighty we were above that kind of thing. But now we could give them a run for their money.</p> <p>As we always used to say about Christmas, Halloween seems to start earlier every year. Pumpkins came rolling into sight a good month ago. And last Tuesday, fully nine days out from the main event, I walked into a pub near Swansea that was already fully decorated. Ghosts, plastic spiders, cobwebs \u2013 you know the drill.</p> <p>I noticed this kicking in 15 years ago in west London. I was living in a house in Hammersmith on a residential street of terraced three-storey properties. Some were million-pound homes, others multi-million pound homes with basements excavated to accommodate playrooms, cinemas, snooker tables, Olympic-sized swimming pools etc. There were houses converted into three nice flats; and many-roomed doss-houses where all manner of dodgy stuff was assumed to go on.</p> <p>Somehow these disparate socio-economic groups managed, despite living cheek by jowl, to avoid any social interaction with each other for 364 days of the year. But the 365th day was Halloween, when everything changed. Like characters in the Thriller video, various horror characters of all social classes emerged into the darkness intent on terrorising the neighbours. I don\u2019t know which I found more terrifying, the harrowingly posh or the downright threatening. I remember opening the door to an extremely well-spoken witch, flanked by several immaculate little ghouls. One was thrust towards me. \u201cGo on, Evie darling, your turn,\u201d said the witch.</p> <p>\u201cTrick or treat,\u201d demanded Evie, sweetly.</p> <p>I handed over some sweets from a bargain tub.</p> <p>\u201cMy daughter\u2019s an Evie,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s short for Evelyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvelyn?\u201d snorted the witch. \u201cMy Evie is Evangelina,\u201d she said, lengthening the penultimate syllable for great effect: E-van-gel-EEEEE-nah.</p> <p>That told me.</p> <p>As the evening wore on, the kids became progressively less sweet and more demanding. The last knock came gone 11 o\u2019clock. Three angry-looking men, all taller than me, asked me not very politely to give them a treat or, in so many words, face the consequences. I knew sweets wouldn\u2019t cut it. I ran to the kitchen and got a four-pack of lager out of the fridge. They took it with a grunt that suggested they were less grateful to me than I should have been to myself for coming up with something to get me off the hook. I live in a flat now. It\u2019s easier like that.</p>",

Some were million-pound homes, others multi-million pound homes with basements excavated to accommodate playrooms, cinemas, snooker tables, Olympic-sized swimming pools etc. There were houses converted into three nice flats; and many-roomed doss-houses where all manner of dodgy stuff was assumed to go on. Somehow these disparate socio-economic groups managed, despite living cheek by jowl, to avoid any social interaction with each other for 364 days of the year. But the 365th day was Halloween, when everything changed. Like characters in the Thriller video, various horror characters of all social classes emerged into the darkness intent on terrorising the neighbours. I don\u2019t know which I found more terrifying, the harrowingly posh or the downright threatening. I remember opening the door to an extremely well-spoken witch, flanked by several immaculate little ghouls. One was thrust towards me. \u201cGo on, Evie darling, your turn,\u201d said the witch. \u201cTrick or treat,\u201d demanded Evie, sweetly. I handed over some sweets from a bargain tub. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s an Evie,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s short for Evelyn.\u201d \u201cEvelyn?\u201d snorted the witch. \u201cMy Evie is Evangelina,\u201d she said, lengthening the penultimate syllable for great effect: E-van-gel-EEEEE-nah. That told me. As the evening wore on, the kids became progressively less sweet and more demanding. The last knock came gone 11 o\u2019clock. Three angry-looking men, all taller than me, asked me not very politely to give them a treat or, in so many words, face the consequences. I knew sweets wouldn\u2019t cut it. I ran to the kitchen and got a four-pack of lager out of the fridge. They took it with a grunt that suggested they were less grateful to me than I should have been to myself for coming up with something to get me off the hook. I live in a flat now. It\u2019s easier like that.",

The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2018/dec/10/should-you-stop-eating-blood-avocados\">reported</a> last year on the decision of several restaurant owners and chefs, including the Michelin-starred Irish chef JP McMahon, to drop Mexican avocados from their menus. McMahon likened the fruits to blood diamonds, and the London chef Joseph Ryan has <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6476313/British-restaurants-ban-avocados-profits-funding-Mexican-drug-lords.html\">welcomed</a> a \u201cpost-avocado era\u201d.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a problem: boycotting Mexican avocados is probably not a good way to fight the cartels.</p> <p>\u201cThis notion of asking consumers to stop buying avocados because farmers are suffering extortion from organized crime is kind of like punishing the victim even more,\u201d Rodrigo Canales, a Yale School of Management associate professor, <a href=\"https://nuvomagazine.com/magazine/summer-2016/the-avocado-wars\">told me</a> during a 2016 interview.</p> <p>Canales studies the wider implications of the Mexican war on drugs. \u201cBoycotting avocados,\u201d he argues, \u201cwould be the worst thing we could do for people who are suffering the most.\u201d</p> <p>Should avocados become unprofitable, cartels can simply diversify, following stronger revenue sources and leaving farmers ruined, only to return if and when business picks up again. Plus, Michoac\u00e1n exports limes, strawberries, mangoes and a variety of other produce; to blacklist avocados is arbitrary when most of the region\u2019s lucrative agricultural production has been infiltrated by cartels in one way or another.</p> <p>If we want to sap the cartels\u2019 strength, there are better ways to do so.</p> <p>One reason cartels are able to effectively intimidate farmers is because they wield military-grade weapons legally purchased in the US and smuggled across the border. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/us/15guns.html\">According to</a> the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, a significant number of firearms recovered from cartels originated in US stores; some estimates suggest gunrunners move a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/arming-mexican-cartels-inside-story-of-a-texas-gun-smuggling-ring-866836/\">quarter of a million</a> guns over the southern border each year. As Rolling Stone <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/arming-mexican-cartels-inside-story-of-a-texas-gun-smuggling-ring-866836/\">reports</a>, a 2013 University of San Diego study found that \u201cnearly half of all gun stores in the United States would go out of business were it not for the sales boost provided by the carnage in Mexico\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s border wall and tightened immigration policy have also been a boon to cartels, who are able to charge more for complicated, high-stakes human smuggling operations. As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/opinion/sunday/mexican-drug-smugglers-to-trump-thanks.html?_r=0\">reports</a>, \u201cStrengthening defenses does not stop smuggling. It only makes it more expensive, which inadvertently gives more money to criminal networks.\u201d</p> <p>Taking action to strengthen gun laws and end the US immigration crises would accomplish far more than boycotting avocados. You can also, it bears mention, not buy drugs. Drug sales in the US account for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/02/world/americas/mexico-drug-war-fast-facts/index.html\">$19 to $29b</a><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/02/world/americas/mexico-drug-war-fast-facts/index.html\">n</a> of the cartels\u2019 annual revenue.</p> <p>Granted, guns, immigration and drugs are massive socio-political issues. Fortunately there are more specific and accessible ways consumers can support ethical avocado farming as we wait for institutional change. You can buy from farmers <a href=\"https://www.thenews.coop/33786/sector/agriculture/through-avocado-obstacle-course/\">doing their best</a> to operate outside cartel influence, like those of the Michoac\u00e1n growers collective <a href=\"http://fairtradeamerica.org/Media-Center/Blog/2017/September/Unpacking-the-Avocado-Industry\">Pragor</a>. Pragor\u2019s avocados are fair trade, organic-certified and identifiable by the presence of an Equal Exchange sticker.</p> <p>Buying environmentally friendly fruit is also important because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/avocado-illegal-deforestation-mexico-pine-forests\">evidence</a> that the Michoac\u00e1n avocado trade has contributed to local deforestation and the destruction of butterfly habitat.</p> <p>The somewhat higher cost of ethical avocados is a small price to pay for enjoying guacamole with a clean conscience.</p> <ul> <li><p>Adrienne Matei is a journalist who writes on subjects including technology, culture and food.</p></li> </ul>",

But there\u2019s a problem: boycotting Mexican avocados is probably not a good way to fight the cartels. \u201cThis notion of asking consumers to stop buying avocados because farmers are suffering extortion from organized crime is kind of like punishing the victim even more,\u201d Rodrigo Canales, a Yale School of Management associate professor, told me during a 2016 interview. Canales studies the wider implications of the Mexican war on drugs. \u201cBoycotting avocados,\u201d he argues, \u201cwould be the worst thing we could do for people who are suffering the most.\u201d Should avocados become unprofitable, cartels can simply diversify, following stronger revenue sources and leaving farmers ruined, only to return if and when business picks up again. Plus, Michoac\u00e1n exports limes, strawberries, mangoes and a variety of other produce; to blacklist avocados is arbitrary when most of the region\u2019s lucrative agricultural production has been infiltrated by cartels in one way or another. If we want to sap the cartels\u2019 strength, there are better ways to do so. One reason cartels are able to effectively intimidate farmers is because they wield military-grade weapons legally purchased in the US and smuggled across the border. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, a significant number of firearms recovered from cartels originated in US stores; some estimates suggest gunrunners move a quarter of a million guns over the southern border each year. As Rolling Stone reports, a 2013 University of San Diego study found that \u201cnearly half of all gun stores in the United States would go out of business were it not for the sales boost provided by the carnage in Mexico\u201d. Trump\u2019s border wall and tightened immigration policy have also been a boon to cartels, who are able to charge more for complicated, high-stakes human smuggling operations. As the New York Times reports, \u201cStrengthening defenses does not stop smuggling. It only makes it more expensive, which inadvertently gives more money to criminal networks.\u201d Taking action to strengthen gun laws and end the US immigration crises would accomplish far more than boycotting avocados. You can also, it bears mention, not buy drugs. Drug sales in the US account for $19 to $29bn of the cartels\u2019 annual revenue. Granted, guns, immigration and drugs are massive socio-political issues. Fortunately there are more specific and accessible ways consumers can support ethical avocado farming as we wait for institutional change. You can buy from farmers doing their best to operate outside cartel influence, like those of the Michoac\u00e1n growers collective Pragor. Pragor\u2019s avocados are fair trade, organic-certified and identifiable by the presence of an Equal Exchange sticker. Buying environmentally friendly fruit is also important because of evidence that the Michoac\u00e1n avocado trade has contributed to local deforestation and the destruction of butterfly habitat. The somewhat higher cost of ethical avocados is a small price to pay for enjoying guacamole with a clean conscience.

      "bodyText": "The former defence minister Christopher Pyne\u2019s lobbying firm is acting for an IT contractor that won more than $50m in work from the defence department in the last four years. Pyne\u2019s firm, GC Advisory, recently added the contractor, Ethan Group, to its client list. Tender data suggests it won about 43 contracts with defence worth $8.9m during Pyne\u2019s time as defence minister. In the past four years, it has won roughly 365 contracts worth $53m with defence. It is at least the second defence-related client GC Advisory has taken on in recent months, after it was engaged by Saber Astronautics, a company that has won more than $2m in contracts from the defence department in the past year. That arrangement prompted concerns about compliance with the lobbying code and the ministerial standards, which prohibit former ministers from lobbying on matters they have recently had official dealings with, or using information gained in office for private gain. Pyne is one of two principals registered as lobbyists for GC Advisory. But a GC Advisory spokesman said the former defence minister did not lobby for defence clients and complied with all his obligations under the code and the standards. \u201cMr Pyne is well aware of the code of conduct for previous ministers and he abides by it,\u201d he said. \u201cMr Pyne does not lobby for any defence clients. GC Advisory adheres to the Lobbying Code of Conduct in every respect.\u201d There is no suggestion that Ethan Group has won any of its contracts unfairly or that it has acted unethically in any way. A company spokesman said it had engaged GC Advisory Group in August for general consulting work. \u201cAll consulting services that will be provided to Ethan Group by GC Advisory are general in nature and will be in full compliance with all applicable Commonwealth of Australia guidelines and legislation,\u201d the spokesman said. Pyne\u2019s post-political career has been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent months. His job helping the consulting giant EY expand its defence business sparked an inquiry into a potential breach of the ministerial standards. Ministerial standards prevent former ministers from lobbying or holding business meetings with members of the government, parliament, public service or defence force on any matter for which they held ministerial responsibility for 18 months after leaving parliament. They also require ministers not to use information they have obtained in office for private gain. Pyne was cleared of any breach of the standards by the former department of prime minister and cabinet secretary Martin Parkinson, but a subsequent Senate inquiry recommended that the department\u2019s investigation be reopened. The department issued a brief statement in response to questions about the arrangement between Pyne and Ethan Group, saying: \u201cMr Pyne has said publicly that he fully understands his obligations, and will abide by the requirements of the Statement of Ministerial Standards on former ministers.\u201d Pyne is also bound by the lobbying code of conduct, which prohibits former government ministers from engaging \u201cin lobbying activities relating to any matter that they had official dealings with in their last 18 months in office\u201d. The code of conduct is loosely administered by the attorney general\u2019s department, but possible breaches are rarely acted upon.",

My sunrise starting point was St Giles\u2019s Cathedral in Edinburgh, where the warden was kind enough to let me in before hours. I wild camped: in the ruined 12th-century <a href=\"https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/st-bridgets-kirk/\" title=\"\">St Bridget\u2019s Kirk</a>, in woods near East Wemyss, and by the loch at Kilconquhar.

The 700km route meanders south-west through deep gorges, over rolling hills and by fields of sunflowers. The villages and towns are rustic perfection. Accommodation for pilgrims comes in the form of <em>g\u00eetes d\u2019\u00e9tape</em> (walkers\u2019 hostels) and is basic but cheap (\u20ac5-\u20ac10) or in g\u00eetes that provide dinner, bed and breakfast for around \u20ac30.

Farmers will hail you along the way and share their food or dinner with you and even put you up in their barns if the weather turns bad \u2013 as one family did for me.

The 30km coastal route between Finisterre (Fisterra in Galician) and Mux\u00eda \u2013 west of Santiago and so away from the main Camino \u2013 is the antidote. This is a microcosm of every Iberian pilgrimage. The coast is never far away, but the route winds over hills, through woods and fields and then gently, oh so gently, descends to Mux\u00eda. The setting of its gothic chapel, right on the shoreline, is beautiful beyond words. If you are looking for refreshment over the route, or want to split your walk over two days, the Albergue as Eiras in Lires (dorm bed from \u20ac14 including breakfast), which has a good restaurant and is generous with food and attitude for pilgrims, is right on the trail. <br><strong>\u2022 </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.pilgrimagetraveler.com/camino-finisterre-to-muxia.html\" title=\"\">pilgrimagetraveler.com</a></em><br><strong>Alex Bell</strong></p> \n<h2>Wool Route, Spain</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a591c0c5dacd63d71755783ed3f25d9b92d6a0d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a591c0c5dacd63d71755783ed3f25d9b92d6a0d/0_170_4431_2660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caracena canyon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caracena canyon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/23/galicia-camino-finisterre-lighthouse-way-walk-hike-spain-camino-de-santiago-alternative\">Walking Spain's most spectacular coastline</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The 700km Ruta de la Lana, or Wool Route, is part of the Camino de Santiago that links Valencia and Alicante with Burgos, with the wool from the south once following the same path.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Pilgrims\u2019 Way, Winchester to Canterbury A 10-day pilgrimage from Winchester to Canterbury, following Walking The Pilgrim\u2019s Way by Leigh Hatts (Cicerone), included many ups and downs, both literal and emotional. There are many glorious parts of the walk, but the one that took my breath away was the hard push up Hackhurst Downs in Surrey, through a gorgeous yew-lined avenue, which then opened magnificently on to Blatchford Down. The splendid views from the top are well worth the ascent. To get the most of the pilgrimage, make sure you go off-path to visit the many divine little churches along the way, especially 900-year-old St Benedict\u2019s in Paddlesworth (near Maidstone), Kent. \u2022 britishpilgrimage.org Kirrily Long St Conan\u2019s Way, Highlands Wildflowers, waterfalls and rainbows \u2013 there can hardly be anywhere more lovely and more varied to walk than Argyll in June. I walked St Conan\u2019s Way from Dalmally to Iona, part of a planned pilgrimage route from St Andrews. I went with a friendly small organised group and was left with an enduring sense of replenishment. After 100km of walking (six days) and two ferry crossings, we reached Iona, a destination for pilgrims since the seventh century. \u2022 britishpilgrimage.org Sarah Akehurst St Margaret\u2019s Way, Edinburgh to St Andrews Last Easter I followed St Margaret\u2019s Way from Edinburgh to St Andrews. It\u2019s a beautiful and varied route \u2013 west and over the Forth Road Bridge, back east along the Fife Coastal Path, then north at Shell Bay, with easy terrain that took four days to walk. My sunrise starting point was St Giles\u2019s Cathedral in Edinburgh, where the warden was kind enough to let me in before hours. I wild camped: in the ruined 12th-century St Bridget\u2019s Kirk, in woods near East Wemyss, and by the loch at Kilconquhar. Cafes in coastal towns served haggis-heavy breakfasts. I stayed in cheap hostels at either end of the walk. \u2022 thewayofstandrews.com Sam Via Podiensis, France I\u2019ve walked many of the pilgrim routes across Europe and they are all beautiful but my favourite is the Via Podiensis, from Le Puy in south-central France to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the Pyrenees. The 700km route meanders south-west through deep gorges, over rolling hills and by fields of sunflowers. The villages and towns are rustic perfection. Accommodation for pilgrims comes in the form of g\u00eetes d\u2019\u00e9tape (walkers\u2019 hostels) and is basic but cheap (\u20ac5-\u20ac10) or in g\u00eetes that provide dinner, bed and breakfast for around \u20ac30. The walk takes just over a month but can be done in shorter stages. Alison Jilks St Olav\u2019s Way, Norway This route, really a network of paths, is a great way of remembering Norway\u2019s 11th centrury King Olav II Haraldsson, who was later made a saint. The 643km path leads to the splendid cathedral in Trondheim, which according to tradition you should walk around three times before saying a prayer. Farmers will hail you along the way and share their food or dinner with you and even put you up in their barns if the weather turns bad \u2013 as one family did for me. We sat around a campfire at night sharing a plate of moose tacos washed down with forest berry juice \u2013 a spiritual and nourishing experience that really helped me on my way. \u2022 pilegrimsleden.no Nigel A stretch of the Via Francigena, Switzerland Hiking in the hills just north of Lake Geneva this year, I came across a small wooden sign near a village saying Via Francigena. Curious, I followed some Spanish monks through the vineyards east of Lausanne. Replenished with their picnic offerings in spring sunshine we rested on the shores of the lake near Vevey. They taught me Spanish phrases; I taught them some English ones. We shared some food, some prayers under the stars and then a big tent before hiking another day together heading towards Montreux and the bend of the Rh\u00f4ne on the condition of mobile phones being switched off. A heavenly hike! \u2022 viefrancigene.org Greta Cooper Camino de Finisterre, Galicia Because Santiago and much of Galicia are often somewhat busy, committing to any pilgrimage can be a struggle if you are seeking a more spiritual experience. The 30km coastal route between Finisterre (Fisterra in Galician) and Mux\u00eda \u2013 west of Santiago and so away from the main Camino \u2013 is the antidote. This is a microcosm of every Iberian pilgrimage. The coast is never far away, but the route winds over hills, through woods and fields and then gently, oh so gently, descends to Mux\u00eda. The setting of its gothic chapel, right on the shoreline, is beautiful beyond words. If you are looking for refreshment over the route, or want to split your walk over two days, the Albergue as Eiras in Lires (dorm bed from \u20ac14 including breakfast), which has a good restaurant and is generous with food and attitude for pilgrims, is right on the trail. \u2022 pilgrimagetraveler.com Alex Bell Wool Route, Spain The 700km Ruta de la Lana, or Wool Route, is part of the Camino de Santiago that links Valencia and Alicante with Burgos, with the wool from the south once following the same path. It passes through two of Spain\u2019s most sparsely populated provinces, Soria and Guadalajara, and was used by pilgrims in the 16th and 17th centuries. En route are many magnificent Romanesque churches and some outstanding landscapes, including the vulture-rich Rio Dulce natural park, and the glorious canyon of Caracena. Of the larger towns, Cuenca and Sig\u00fcenza are both well worth a rest day, and neither is on the overseas tourists\u2019 map. If you want, you can walk another 500km to Santiago on the more popular Camino Franc\u00e9s from Burgos. \u2022 csj.org.uk Harriet Korean food, Spain The Camino de Santiago is the \u201cgateway\u201d pilgrimage \u2013 it\u2019s easy to be a pilgrim when cheap lodgings and bars can be found round every corner.

      "bodyText": "Top story: John Bolton slated to give evidence Hello \u2013 I\u2019m Warren Murray with today\u2019s roster of must-read stories. The US House of Representatives will today vote on formalising the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry \u2013 and actually, it was the Republicans\u2019 idea. The president\u2019s party has argued the hearings being held into Trump\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercions are illegitimate without congressional approval. Despite there being no such constitutional requirement, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, is obliging \u2013 and turning it into something of an event. Her Democratic party controls the House and is unlikely to have any trouble getting the vote through. Another resignation from the Trump administration is on the cards: his top Russia adviser, Tim Morrison, is about to give testimony to the impeachment inquiry that is unlikely to help the president, and is being given in defiance of a White House order not to participate. Recent White House departee John Bolton may be soon to testify as well \u2013 the national security adviser sacked by Donald Trump in September has been asked to make a deposition on 7 November. Previous witnesses are understood to have told impeachment investigators that Bolton said he wanted no part of whatever \u201cdrug deal\u201d was being cooked up concerning Ukraine by the circle that included Rudy Giuliani. It has also emerged that the White House blocked plans to censure Russia for attacking and then seizing Ukrainian vessels. * * * Election catch-up \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn will today position Labour as the people\u2019s party, declaring: \u201cThis election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind.\u201d The Jewish Labour Movement has announced that because of the antisemitism scandals within Labour it will not mount a blanket campaign for the party, instead supporting only individual \u201cexceptional candidates\u201d. A tactical voting website from the pro-remain Best for Britain organisation has been accused of advising people to vote Lib Dem in Labour-held seats where doing so could actually result in a leaver Conservative being elected. Best for Britain insists the data behind its advice is robust. City of London analysts say they are hoping for a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d if Johnson retains the key to No 10 and secures a deal with the EU \u2013 though some dissenters say a hung parliament leading to a second referendum, with an option to remain, would be better for business confidence. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is due to publish a review of its \u00a3100,000 grant to the company of Jennifer Arcuri, who has said Boris Johnson knew there was potential for conflict of interest around their relationship. And the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, steps down today. Please enjoy our made-to-ORDER! video tribute. * * * Political lies \u2018are not free speech\u2019 \u2013 Twitter will ban all political advertising, its CEO has announced, taking the opportunity to get in a few digs at Facebook which has refused to even stop political adverts that peddle lies. The policy will come into effect on 22 November, in time for the UK snap election, and also apply to ads related to political issues. Jack Dorsey, in a seeming riposte to the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about free expression \u2026 It\u2019s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad \u2026 well \u2026 they can say whatever they want!\u2019\u201d By its own admission Facebook doesn\u2019t need the money from political advertising \u2013 Zuckerberg has just announced a 29% jump in revenue to $17.7bn. \u201cWe estimate that these ads from politicians will be less than 0.5% of our revenue next year,\u201d he said. * * * \u2018Exquisitely planned\u2019 \u2013 The Pentagon has released video from the raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader, which shows people outside the Syrian compound being fired upon from the air and special forces moving in. The head of US Central Command, General Kenneth McKenzie, confirmed Baghdadi fled into a hole and blew himself up, killing himself and two children. One other man and four women were killed in the exchange of fire as US forces assaulted the compound. Two men were taken prisoner. As part of the \u201cexquisitely planned\u201d operation the compound was bombed to the ground after it had been evacuated, to prevent it becoming a shrine, McKenzie said. * * * CIA link to Afghanistan abuses \u2013 A pro-Afghan government force backed by the CIA is being blamed for at least 14 deadly raids including cases of civilians being shot dead on the spot or \u201cdisappeared\u201d. The units comprised of thousands of men have rampaged through traditional Taliban strongholds, according to Human Rights Watch. \u201cIn ramping up operations against the Taliban, the CIA has enabled abusive Afghan forces to commit atrocities including extrajudicial executions and disappearances,\u201d said Patricia Gossman, author of the HRW report on the subject. The Nato combat operation in Afghanistan officially ended in 2014 but the US has a separate counter-terrorism mission that has continued fighting aggressively and includes the covert CIA-backed forces. * * * And finally \u2013 It\u2019s Halloween and if you\u2019re up for a scare, some of our writers have listed the films that haunted their childhood, from Witches to, umm E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Your Briefing compiler is still terrified of Event Horizon. I saw it in my 20s \u2026 Today in Focus podcast: Johnson\u2019s election gamble The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, tells Anushka Asthana that the general election on 12 December will be highly unpredictable as Brexit preferences, unpopular leaders and tactical voting intersect. Plus: Guy Standing on the plunder of natural resources by private interests. Lunchtime read: Playing it too safe? \u201cHere, they can play with very dangerous tools,\u201d said Lady Marjory Allen, the postwar children\u2019s rights activist who advocated junk-filled playgrounds. \u201cThey can create their own houses, their own climbing frames. They can take really dangerous risks and overcome them. And above all, it\u2019s a place where they can meet their friends, where they can make new friends, in a very free and permissive atmosphere.\u201d But by the 1990s and 2000s things had changed: \u201cClimbing frames were getting smaller, roundabouts and swings were going more slowly,\u201d says Nicola Butler, chair of Play England. \u201cWhen playgrounds become really safe and boring, kids climb on top of bus shelters instead because it\u2019s more fun.\u201d Now, writes Oliver Wainwright, there is a fightback against risk-averse playparks. Sport Kyle Sinckler has been passed fit for England\u2019s Rugby World Cup final against South Africa on Saturday with Eddie Jones selecting an unchanged XV to face the Springboks. The Washington Nationals are World Series champions for the first time after a dramatic 6-2 win over the Houston Astros in Wednesday\u2019s winner-take-all Game 7. Following Liverpool\u2019s remarkable 5-5 draw and subsequent penalty shootout win over Arsenal at Anfield, J\u00fcrgen Klopp threatened to withdraw his team from the Carabao Cup should the EFL and Premier League fail to find what he considers \u201ca proper date\u201d for their quarter-final. Manchester United\u2019s passage to the last eight was secured after Marcus Rashford scored an astonishing free-kick winner to give Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side a 2-1 victory at Chelsea. Manchester City went out of the Champions League after an own goal from Steph Houghton and \u00c1ngela Sosa\u2019s second-half effort proved decisive in a 2-1 win for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Bianca Andreescu was forced to retire with a left knee injury while losing 6-3 to Karolina Pliskova at the WTA Finals as injuries continue to define the young Canadian\u2019s career. And an independent review of football\u2019s anti-racism organisation, Kick It Out, has found a series of governance failings including poor communication and a lack of training in staff welfare. Business The US central bank has cut interest rates for the third time this year in an attempt to keep the longest running period of growth in the country\u2019s history continuing into the crucial election year of 2020. As a result most Asian stock markets have followed Wall Street higher. Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore advanced, though Shanghai retreated on figures showing weaker Chinese factory activity. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P-ASX 200 also fell. This morning the pound is trading around $1.292 and \u20ac1.157 while the FTSE is ticking a little lower ahead of the open. The papers The looming election features on the front pages of the Times: \u201cMorgan in exodus of moderate Tory MPs\u201d, the Telegraph: \u201cBrexit Party could aid Tories by not fighting hundreds of seats\u201d and the Guardian: \u201cCorbyn: the Tories don\u2019t represent the people, we do\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A child was sexually abused by a sex offender who should have been monitored by police and two people were unlawfully imprisoned as a result of widespread mismanagement of the New South Wales child protection register. On Thursday the NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission released the findings of a long-running investigation into police handling of the state\u2019s child sex offender register. The LECC investigation has revealed that the force has mismanaged the register for almost two decades, resulting in more than 700 incorrect decisions. In one case a man who should have been subject to police monitoring committed an act of indecency in front of a 10-year-old girl on a bus in 2015. In two other cases, people were unlawfully imprisoned for more than a year because they were erroneously placed on the register. The NSW child sex offender register includes people who have been convicted of sexual or violent offences against children, and people convicted of having child abuse material. Since 2009 the number of people on the register has increased by 83%, from 2,376 to 4,344. The LECC\u2019s investigation revealed that \u201csignificant errors\u201d in the handling of the register began as early as 2002. In the past 17 years, it found, 96 people have been incorrectly left off the register, while 485 have had their reporting period \u2013 the amount of time their names appear on the register \u2013 under-calculated. It also found that although the force had been aware of problems since as far back as 2014, it waited two years to begin reviewing case files. When it did, its own review found errors in 44% of the more than 5,000 cases investigated. Those included \u201cincorrect decisions by the NSW Police Force about which persons should be included on the register, and incorrect decisions about how long persons were legally required to make reports of their personal information to police\u201d, the LECC said. Shockingly, the LECC found that the man who committed the act of indecency against the girl on a bus did so just a month after he was incorrectly removed from the register. In 2003 the man, referred to in the report as \u201cMr AA114\u201d, was convicted of two counts of aggravated indecent assault of a child. He was released on parole in 2006, but owing to mistakes made when calculating his reporting period \u2013 including the failure to take into account another offence in 1997 \u2013 he was removed from the register after eight years. In November 2015 the man \u201cboarded a bus and committed an act of indecency in front of a 10 year old girl\u201d, the report reveals. After serving 12 months in prison, the man was again placed on the register for 15 years until a review of his case by the LECC recommended he be subject to monitoring for the rest of his life. In another case, a man who was convicted of two counts of using a carriage service to procure a child under the age of 16 for sex had his period on the register underestimated by seven years and nine months. As a result, he was taken off the register in December 2014 when he should have been subject to police monitoring until September 2022. In the more than 5,000 cases reviewed by police, 45 people were also found to have been have incorrectly placed on the register, the report states. Among those, the LECC found the two cases in which people were unlawfully imprisoned. In one of the cases, a man known as Mr DD120 was placed on the register after a 2006 conviction for the indecent assault of a victim under the age of 10. Despite being a minor at the time of the offence, the man was incorrectly placed on the register and between 2010 and 2015 served 413 days in prison for failure to report to police. In the other case, a man referred to as Mr NN was convicted of a sexual offence against an adult member of his family. \u201cAs the victim of that offence was not a child, he did not meet the definition of a registrable person under the [Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act],\u201d the LECC said. \u201cDespite this in 2014 he was convicted of failing to comply with reporting obligations under the CPOR Act and received an 18 month good behaviour bond.\u201d According to the investigation, nicknamed Operation Tusket, the errors were the result of failures to correctly interpret rules surrounding the register, as well as insufficient resourcing amid the 83% increase in the number of people placed on the register in the last decade. It also said that \u201calmost since its inception\u201d the multiagency system, in which police are supposed to be assisted in running the register by courts and government departments, \u201chas not been functioning as parliament intended\u201d. The LECC said that since it began its investigation the state\u2019s police had made changes to the register, including doubling the number of staff responsible for running it. But the report makes 11 recommendations, including that the act of parliament governing the register be referred to the NSW Law Reform Commission for review.",

      "body": "<p>Carly Simon somehow appears both brittle and unbreakable as she opens the door to her hotel room in Boston, Massachusetts, where a publicist hovers discreetly. She is wearing a blue sweater, blue jeans and a blue scarf and is smiling broadly. Her hair is shoulder length with the familiar low fringe. She puts on a pair of glasses; lukewarm hotel tea is ordered and poured.</p> <p>The singer-songwriter is chatty and charming. She says she has just been listening to the audio version of her latest memoir, <a href=\"https://www.carlysimon.com/\" title=\"\">Touched by the Sun,</a> about her friendship with Jackie Kennedy Onassis, the widow of former president John F Kennedy and the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. It is read by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/16/elizabeth-mcgovern-downton-andrew-anthony\" title=\"\">Elizabeth McGovern</a>, who plays the Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey. That is fine with Simon, a fan of British TV, including Downton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/29/last-tango-in-halifax-homeland-review\" title=\"\">Last Tango in Halifax</a>.</p> <p>Simon was described as a \u201cfeminist icon\u201d on the book jacket of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/23/carly-simon-boys-in-the-trees-review\" title=\"\">her 2015 memoir Boys in the Trees,</a> a bible of A-list gossip. The daughter of Andrea Heinemann Simon, a civil rights activist,<strong> </strong>and Richard Simon, co-founder of the book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, she found singing an effective way to overcome a childhood stutter, recorded more than a dozen Top 40 hits and offered lyrics that stuck in the cultural consciousness.</p> <p>She had romantic liaisons with Warren Beatty, Mick Jagger, Kris Kristofferson, Jack Nicholson and Cat Stevens, and an ill-fated marriage to James Taylor. Now, at 74, if anyone has earned the right to casually drop names and use terms such as \u201clover\u201d without affectation, it is her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dacd42108414dc514e8c030e1628ee3fa2e02eab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dacd42108414dc514e8c030e1628ee3fa2e02eab/0_0_3000_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carly Simon with Warren Beatty in 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carly Simon with Warren Beatty in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul R Benoit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both her memoirs are searingly frank. When she was seven, Simon was sexually exploited by a 16-year-old boy. An abusive relationship continued until she was about 14. \u201cI think it\u2019s changed me for ever and there was nobody around who could possibly have believed the stories I would have told,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just an awful thing to have happened. Do I think it would have happened now? The awareness of it might have prevented it. I don\u2019t know that for sure, but also I\u2019ve been abused in other ways and by some of the same people that Ronan Farrow talks about in his book.\u201d</p> <p>Farrow, an investigative journalist and friend of Simon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/12/ronan-farrow-on-investigating-harvey-weinstein-family-issues-thrown-at-me-is-a-dirty-move\" title=\"\">has just published Catch and Kill</a>, about his quest to uncover numerous sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Simon alleges that she, too, was abused by the disgraced Hollywood producer \u2013 not sexually, but in other humiliating ways.</p> <p>\u201cHe asked me to score a movie that his wife at the time had made, a little Japanese cartoon, and so I did it in good faith,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI hired musicians and scored the movie and, at the recording session, I said: \u2018Well, how shall I get paid?\u2019 He said: \u2018Well, we\u2019ll figure it out later,\u2019 and he never followed up.\u201d</p> <p>There was another incident at Camp David, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/movie-night-with-the-reagans\" title=\"\">the US presidential country retreat,</a> the weekend before Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment hearings. Weinstein brought his film Paris, Texas for a screening attended by the president, first lady Hillary Clinton and guests including Simon.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of it, Harvey had the nerve to get this cheap guitar from somewhere and bring it to me in the theatre seat and say: \u2018Sing now. Sing Anticipation.\u2019 The guitar was out of tune and one of the strings was off it. So he embarrassed me greatly. I couldn\u2019t not do it because everybody turned around to look at me in the theatre and there I was.\u201d</p> <p>How did Weinstein get away with so much for so long? \u201cWell, people obviously were so intimidated by his power and wanted to be on the receiving end of what one maybe thought of as largesse, that maybe there was goodwill behind all of his seduction. I can just see him in all the scenes that are painted of him with the women. I was lucky not to be one of them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"baaa73777d9829cca5c9592379af40dd3f25ea23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baaa73777d9829cca5c9592379af40dd3f25ea23/0_0_4901_3316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon and James Taylor, to whom she was married for 10 years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon and James Taylor, to whom she was married for 10 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard E Aaron/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the way in which Weinstein, and others, took advantage of her still rankles: \u201cI<strong> </strong>think that stealing from one financially may be one step below [doing so] sexually. I wrote about it for this book: I wrote about the various experiences that I\u2019ve just talked to you about, and my editors, all of whom are men, said: \u2018No, don\u2019t write about that.\u2019 I don\u2019t blame them for that. It was just that you\u2019re not supposed to talk about it.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe the time will come when we women who have been raped financially will be on the record to talk about that because I know a lot of other women who have been screwed. A lot of men have been screwed, too. There aren\u2019t as many of them as men who are in powerful positions to do it, but I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s probably being done by women as we speak.\u201d She adds mischievously: \u201cI can see 10 of them right now seducing young boys, saying that they\u2019ll pay them.\u201d</p> <p>And yet she has gnawing doubts about the #MeToo movement. \u201cI welcome it and now I hope that it will go back to a position where things will be normalised,\u201d she says. \u201cNot that I want anybody to shut up or to not tell it like it is, but it also feels a little bit unnatural for me that men can\u2019t say a flattering thing to a woman without there being a possible reckoning.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman and I\u2019ve been subject to that and there was the casting couch in a number of cases in my life that I was harmed by. But I think at this point it\u2019s just dangerous for men to act like men. Not that the men who go overboard and disrespect a woman are acting like men. You know what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>As has become clear by now, a conversation with Simon is an exercise in six degrees of separation. On Bill Clinton, she says: \u201cWhen he\u2019s interested in a subject and he\u2019s talking about it to a woman, there\u2019s a different energy that comes across. He has \u2018the glint\u2019 and he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s charisma. His face changes. He doesn\u2019t look the same. His energy comes through the expressions of his mouth and his eyes. He lights up a room with his energy.\u201d</p> <p>Yet even as Hillary Clinton continues to speak out, Bill is conspicuously absent from the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, effectively banished to exile in the #MeToo era. Simon is dismayed at the thought. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad because, to me, he\u2019s a tremendous asset and he\u2019s such a charismatic and brilliant, brilliant man, and whatever lesson he had to learn, he learned it.</p> <p>\u201cIt was of a particular time where there was a hairline of a difference between then and now. He didn\u2019t do himself proud, but that\u2019s passed, that\u2019s over with, and now let his brilliance shine through.\u201d</p> <p>Her view of Trump is rather different. She met him once in New York at a luncheon for Benazir Bhutto, the late prime minister of Pakistan, and was left cold by his overtures. \u201cWhen I came into the room, there was Trump and a whole bunch of New York dignitaries. Trump wasn\u2019t paying any attention to me at all. Why would he?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/benazir-bhutto\" title=\"\">\u201cBenazir Bhutto</a> summoned me and asked me to go into the bedroom with her and so I went and we sat on the bed and she held my hands and said: \u2018I just love your music.\u2019 We talked about different songs that were her favourites and it maybe lasted three minutes.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I went out of the bedroom, obviously I had all of a sudden become important through the eyes of Donald Trump. So he was very anxious to meet me and invited me to Mar-a-Lago [his luxury estate in Florida] and was all over me like ugly on an ape.\u201d</p> <p>She turned down the offer, she says, \u201cbecause I thought he was kind of repulsive\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcf800429d6f6b65b5134b26bde95a0fa6fd5527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcf800429d6f6b65b5134b26bde95a0fa6fd5527/0_47_1979_2395/826.jpg\" alt=\"Simon with Bill Clinton in 2003: \u201cHe has \u2018the glint\u2019 and he can\u2019t help himself.\u201d\" width=\"826\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon with Bill Clinton in 2003: \u201cHe has \u2018the glint\u2019 and he can\u2019t help himself.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon\u2019s greatest hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQZmCJUSC6g\" title=\"\">You\u2019re So Vain,</a> seems spookily apt for Trump. Simon agrees. \u201cHe is so vain, that\u2019s for sure, and not in the best possible way. He doesn\u2019t bring humour to the word. In the song, hopefully, the person could wink at himself in the mirror because he got the joke.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much interest outside himself. What will happen with a narcissist is that they\u2019re interested in themselves and anything that\u2019s an extension of themselves, perhaps their children, but he\u2019s not interested in the philosophy of great thinkers. I suspect.\u201d</p> <p>Thrice-married Trump has boasted about groping women, and been accused of sexual harassment, and of making a hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. What would Kennedy Onassis, whom Simon befriended in 1983 and whose own first husband was a notorious philanderer, have made of him?</p> <p>\u201cI think she would have been astounded that he could have risen to the position that he rose to. And some of the things he did and said would have been fodder for her amusement and probably disdain.\u201d</p> <p>Simon would call Kennedy regularly from rehab while dealing with anxiety and depression, which have haunted her as long as she can remember. She starting taking Prozac in 1989 to help her deal with a fear of flying and nerves when she was up for an award at the Oscars; fortunately, her category was up first, and she won, for the Working Girl theme song Let the River Run (she also sang Nobody Does It Better for the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me).</p> <p>But Simon continued taking medication, including those not necessarily prescribed for depression, but which \u201cchanged my consciousness\u201d. She admits now: \u201cI have a special interest in pills. They have a certain effect on me in the same way that little candies would. If I want to change my consciousness, especially if I have a terrible headache, there\u2019s something very promising about taking a pill. I developed a relationship with them as if there was something more secretive about it than there really is. Now I take pills in front of people or not in front of people.\u201d</p> <p>When recovering from breast cancer, she took the opioid OxyContin for about two years but, unlike millions of Americans, did not become addicted. There have been other drugs. \u201cIs cocaine readily being done still, I wonder? I\u2019ve done it four times, on my gums, and I loved it. I thought I was so wonderful. It made me feel confident. It made me lose all of my self-consciousness. I just thought: \u2018My God, I\u2019m not worried about how I\u2019m coming across.\u2019 I was actually recording, but it wasn\u2019t on stage.\u201d</p> <p>Simon has seen a radical shift in attitudes towards drugs during her lifetime. She is adamant: \u201cThey should all be legalised. It makes it much more attractive to the wrong people if it\u2019s not legal. It makes the price soar. If prohibition hadn\u2019t happened, it wouldn\u2019t have created some of the alcoholics.\u201d</p> <p>Alcoholism played a part in the breakdown in 1983 of her decade-long marriage to Taylor, she says. \u201cI was too young. I think we were both too young to understand what the disease of alcoholism was like. He was blinded by the force of the alcohol and the other drugs he was high on.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. If I had been stronger, I would have done. I tried so many different things and I was wrong about at least half of them. I was wrong about saying you can never do that again or it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll do it with you. Every turn I took seemed to be the wrong turn, but I tried really hard and so did he. He really tried hard.\u201d</p> <p>The couple had two children, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/style/carly-simon-family-band-marthas-vineyard.html\" title=\"\">Sally and Ben</a> (\u201cJohn Lennon was our nextdoor neighbour and the first person that gave us a gift after Ben was born\u201d) and \u201cinspired each other artistically\u201d, she recalls. But she and Taylor have not spoken for years. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sad things in my life. He just doesn\u2019t want to have any contact with me at all. I don\u2019t know what he says about it in interviews. I think he just avoids the question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b0fa7a0d76188345bbd322f1e86df47febde113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b0fa7a0d76188345bbd322f1e86df47febde113/0_0_1764_2250/784.jpg\" alt=\"Simon with her friend Jackie Onassis in 1989.\" width=\"784\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon with her friend Jackie Onassis in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI listen to some of my songs now as if through James\u2019s ears and I don\u2019t like them because I think: \u2018Oh my God, what was I thinking?

It\u2019s wistful, but happy because I love his music so much. I love him.\u201d</p> <p>After Taylor, Simon was married to the writer James Hart for 19 years \u2013 they divorced in 2007 <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carly-simons-ex-husband-james-hart-tells-all-in-new-memoir\" title=\"\">and he came out as gay.</a> She has been in a relationship with Richard Koehler, a surgeon, for nearly 14 years.</p> <p>\u201cMonogamy is a very hard thing,\u201d she says. \u201cVery hard.

I\u2019ve never known a man who wasn\u2019t attracted to the adventure of seeing whether he could get a woman to be interested in him.\u201d</p> <p>It is a sentiment that evokes Simon\u2019s most famous lyric, \u201cYou\u2019re so vain/You probably think this song is about you.\u201d How did she come to write it? \u201cIt was at a party that my sister and I were giving because I was living with my older sister at the time and somebody walked into the party. And I thought: \u2018Wow, he\u2019s so vain.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since the song\u2019s release in 1972, the identity of the vain man has been the subject of intense speculation. \u201cI have told a number of people,\u201d she says cryptically.

      "bodyText": "Carly Simon somehow appears both brittle and unbreakable as she opens the door to her hotel room in Boston, Massachusetts, where a publicist hovers discreetly. She is wearing a blue sweater, blue jeans and a blue scarf and is smiling broadly. Her hair is shoulder length with the familiar low fringe. She puts on a pair of glasses; lukewarm hotel tea is ordered and poured. The singer-songwriter is chatty and charming. She says she has just been listening to the audio version of her latest memoir, Touched by the Sun, about her friendship with Jackie Kennedy Onassis, the widow of former president John F Kennedy and the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. It is read by Elizabeth McGovern, who plays the Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey. That is fine with Simon, a fan of British TV, including Downton and Last Tango in Halifax. Simon was described as a \u201cfeminist icon\u201d on the book jacket of her 2015 memoir Boys in the Trees, a bible of A-list gossip. The daughter of Andrea Heinemann Simon, a civil rights activist, and Richard Simon, co-founder of the book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, she found singing an effective way to overcome a childhood stutter, recorded more than a dozen Top 40 hits and offered lyrics that stuck in the cultural consciousness. She had romantic liaisons with Warren Beatty, Mick Jagger, Kris Kristofferson, Jack Nicholson and Cat Stevens, and an ill-fated marriage to James Taylor. Now, at 74, if anyone has earned the right to casually drop names and use terms such as \u201clover\u201d without affectation, it is her. Both her memoirs are searingly frank. When she was seven, Simon was sexually exploited by a 16-year-old boy. An abusive relationship continued until she was about 14. \u201cI think it\u2019s changed me for ever and there was nobody around who could possibly have believed the stories I would have told,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just an awful thing to have happened. Do I think it would have happened now? The awareness of it might have prevented it. I don\u2019t know that for sure, but also I\u2019ve been abused in other ways and by some of the same people that Ronan Farrow talks about in his book.\u201d Farrow, an investigative journalist and friend of Simon, has just published Catch and Kill, about his quest to uncover numerous sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Simon alleges that she, too, was abused by the disgraced Hollywood producer \u2013 not sexually, but in other humiliating ways. \u201cHe asked me to score a movie that his wife at the time had made, a little Japanese cartoon, and so I did it in good faith,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI hired musicians and scored the movie and, at the recording session, I said: \u2018Well, how shall I get paid?\u2019 He said: \u2018Well, we\u2019ll figure it out later,\u2019 and he never followed up.\u201d There was another incident at Camp David, the US presidential country retreat, the weekend before Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment hearings. Weinstein brought his film Paris, Texas for a screening attended by the president, first lady Hillary Clinton and guests including Simon. \u201cAt the end of it, Harvey had the nerve to get this cheap guitar from somewhere and bring it to me in the theatre seat and say: \u2018Sing now. Sing Anticipation.\u2019 The guitar was out of tune and one of the strings was off it. So he embarrassed me greatly. I couldn\u2019t not do it because everybody turned around to look at me in the theatre and there I was.\u201d How did Weinstein get away with so much for so long? \u201cWell, people obviously were so intimidated by his power and wanted to be on the receiving end of what one maybe thought of as largesse, that maybe there was goodwill behind all of his seduction. I can just see him in all the scenes that are painted of him with the women. I was lucky not to be one of them.\u201d But the way in which Weinstein, and others, took advantage of her still rankles: \u201cI think that stealing from one financially may be one step below [doing so] sexually. I wrote about it for this book: I wrote about the various experiences that I\u2019ve just talked to you about, and my editors, all of whom are men, said: \u2018No, don\u2019t write about that.\u2019 I don\u2019t blame them for that. It was just that you\u2019re not supposed to talk about it. \u201cMaybe the time will come when we women who have been raped financially will be on the record to talk about that because I know a lot of other women who have been screwed. A lot of men have been screwed, too. There aren\u2019t as many of them as men who are in powerful positions to do it, but I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s probably being done by women as we speak.\u201d She adds mischievously: \u201cI can see 10 of them right now seducing young boys, saying that they\u2019ll pay them.\u201d And yet she has gnawing doubts about the #MeToo movement. \u201cI welcome it and now I hope that it will go back to a position where things will be normalised,\u201d she says. \u201cNot that I want anybody to shut up or to not tell it like it is, but it also feels a little bit unnatural for me that men can\u2019t say a flattering thing to a woman without there being a possible reckoning. \u201cI\u2019m a woman and I\u2019ve been subject to that and there was the casting couch in a number of cases in my life that I was harmed by. But I think at this point it\u2019s just dangerous for men to act like men. Not that the men who go overboard and disrespect a woman are acting like men. You know what I mean.\u201d As has become clear by now, a conversation with Simon is an exercise in six degrees of separation. On Bill Clinton, she says: \u201cWhen he\u2019s interested in a subject and he\u2019s talking about it to a woman, there\u2019s a different energy that comes across. He has \u2018the glint\u2019 and he can\u2019t help himself. It\u2019s charisma. His face changes. He doesn\u2019t look the same. His energy comes through the expressions of his mouth and his eyes. He lights up a room with his energy.\u201d Yet even as Hillary Clinton continues to speak out, Bill is conspicuously absent from the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, effectively banished to exile in the #MeToo era. Simon is dismayed at the thought. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad because, to me, he\u2019s a tremendous asset and he\u2019s such a charismatic and brilliant, brilliant man, and whatever lesson he had to learn, he learned it. \u201cIt was of a particular time where there was a hairline of a difference between then and now. He didn\u2019t do himself proud, but that\u2019s passed, that\u2019s over with, and now let his brilliance shine through.\u201d Her view of Trump is rather different. She met him once in New York at a luncheon for Benazir Bhutto, the late prime minister of Pakistan, and was left cold by his overtures. \u201cWhen I came into the room, there was Trump and a whole bunch of New York dignitaries. Trump wasn\u2019t paying any attention to me at all. Why would he? \u201cBenazir Bhutto summoned me and asked me to go into the bedroom with her and so I went and we sat on the bed and she held my hands and said: \u2018I just love your music.\u2019 We talked about different songs that were her favourites and it maybe lasted three minutes. \u201cWhen I went out of the bedroom, obviously I had all of a sudden become important through the eyes of Donald Trump. So he was very anxious to meet me and invited me to Mar-a-Lago [his luxury estate in Florida] and was all over me like ugly on an ape.\u201d She turned down the offer, she says, \u201cbecause I thought he was kind of repulsive\u201d. Simon\u2019s greatest hit, You\u2019re So Vain, seems spookily apt for Trump. Simon agrees. \u201cHe is so vain, that\u2019s for sure, and not in the best possible way. He doesn\u2019t bring humour to the word. In the song, hopefully, the person could wink at himself in the mirror because he got the joke. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much interest outside himself. What will happen with a narcissist is that they\u2019re interested in themselves and anything that\u2019s an extension of themselves, perhaps their children, but he\u2019s not interested in the philosophy of great thinkers. I suspect.\u201d Thrice-married Trump has boasted about groping women, and been accused of sexual harassment, and of making a hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. What would Kennedy Onassis, whom Simon befriended in 1983 and whose own first husband was a notorious philanderer, have made of him? \u201cI think she would have been astounded that he could have risen to the position that he rose to. And some of the things he did and said would have been fodder for her amusement and probably disdain.\u201d Simon would call Kennedy regularly from rehab while dealing with anxiety and depression, which have haunted her as long as she can remember. She starting taking Prozac in 1989 to help her deal with a fear of flying and nerves when she was up for an award at the Oscars; fortunately, her category was up first, and she won, for the Working Girl theme song Let the River Run (she also sang Nobody Does It Better for the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me). But Simon continued taking medication, including those not necessarily prescribed for depression, but which \u201cchanged my consciousness\u201d. She admits now: \u201cI have a special interest in pills. They have a certain effect on me in the same way that little candies would. If I want to change my consciousness, especially if I have a terrible headache, there\u2019s something very promising about taking a pill. I developed a relationship with them as if there was something more secretive about it than there really is. Now I take pills in front of people or not in front of people.\u201d When recovering from breast cancer, she took the opioid OxyContin for about two years but, unlike millions of Americans, did not become addicted. There have been other drugs. \u201cIs cocaine readily being done still, I wonder? I\u2019ve done it four times, on my gums, and I loved it. I thought I was so wonderful. It made me feel confident. It made me lose all of my self-consciousness. I just thought: \u2018My God, I\u2019m not worried about how I\u2019m coming across.\u2019 I was actually recording, but it wasn\u2019t on stage.\u201d Simon has seen a radical shift in attitudes towards drugs during her lifetime. She is adamant: \u201cThey should all be legalised. It makes it much more attractive to the wrong people if it\u2019s not legal. It makes the price soar. If prohibition hadn\u2019t happened, it wouldn\u2019t have created some of the alcoholics.\u201d Alcoholism played a part in the breakdown in 1983 of her decade-long marriage to Taylor, she says. \u201cI was too young. I think we were both too young to understand what the disease of alcoholism was like. He was blinded by the force of the alcohol and the other drugs he was high on. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. If I had been stronger, I would have done. I tried so many different things and I was wrong about at least half of them. I was wrong about saying you can never do that again or it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll do it with you. Every turn I took seemed to be the wrong turn, but I tried really hard and so did he. He really tried hard.\u201d The couple had two children, Sally and Ben (\u201cJohn Lennon was our nextdoor neighbour and the first person that gave us a gift after Ben was born\u201d) and \u201cinspired each other artistically\u201d, she recalls. But she and Taylor have not spoken for years. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sad things in my life. He just doesn\u2019t want to have any contact with me at all. I don\u2019t know what he says about it in interviews. I think he just avoids the question. \u201cI listen to some of my songs now as if through James\u2019s ears and I don\u2019t like them because I think: \u2018Oh my God, what was I thinking? What would James have thought?\u2019 I listen to his music, especially the older music of his. I just hear it on the radio all the time and it always makes me happy. It\u2019s wistful, but happy because I love his music so much. I love him.\u201d After Taylor, Simon was married to the writer James Hart for 19 years \u2013 they divorced in 2007 and he came out as gay. She has been in a relationship with Richard Koehler, a surgeon, for nearly 14 years. \u201cMonogamy is a very hard thing,\u201d she says. \u201cVery hard. I think there\u2019s always an attraction to novelty \u2026 It\u2019s more of a man\u2019s problem. I\u2019ve never known a man who wasn\u2019t attracted to the adventure of seeing whether he could get a woman to be interested in him.\u201d It is a sentiment that evokes Simon\u2019s most famous lyric, \u201cYou\u2019re so vain/You probably think this song is about you.\u201d How did she come to write it? \u201cIt was at a party that my sister and I were giving because I was living with my older sister at the time and somebody walked into the party.

      "body": "<p>Luigi never seems to learn his lesson. It\u2019s been 18 years since he was first lured to a haunted house and tortured by its spooky inhabitants. Now, having been duped again, he\u2019s trapped in an even bleaker building \u2013 the Hotel of Last Resort \u2013 as he races to rescue a familiar cast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/super-mario\">Mushroom Kingdom characters</a>.</p> <p>Although it treads very familiar ground to its predecessors, there\u2019s a lot to love in the third instalment of the adventure series that lets Mario\u2019s timid twin take charge. You still guide the character through uniquely themed sections of the building, relying on his flashlight and multi-functional Poltergust vacuum to rid the place of ghosts.</p> <p>Luigi keeps track of his progress through the 15 main hotel floors with the help of a digital assistant, amusingly called a Virtual Boo, as well as the quirky Professor E Gadd, who\u2019s on hand to offer tips and tutorials.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRlK9Dz3Eqs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jRlK9Dz3Eqs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The game was never likely to stray too far from its roots as a hunt-and-chase adventure, but Nintendo has attempted to breathe new life into the format, and it\u2019s these changes that truly elevate the game. The most innovative addition is Gooigi, a glowing gummy bear-like Luigi clone made of, well, goo. Previously appearing in the 3DS version of Luigi\u2019s Mansion, his malleable nature allows Gooigi to squeeze through grates and pipes, helping to solve puzzles and reach previously inaccessible areas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d4f7a39e7447f58f987dee2598b9a088749afc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4f7a39e7447f58f987dee2598b9a088749afc8/370_0_864_1080/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gooigi, the gummy clone of Luigi, can move through objects and small spaces.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooigi, the gummy clone of Luigi, can move through objects and small spaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The presence of Gooigi enhances the experience a great deal, especially when playing in co-op mode, where you partner up with a friend and explore different parts of a room at the same time. While many puzzles are straightforward, some don\u2019t have obvious solutions, so being able to call on a second pair of eyes for clue-spotting is a welcome addition.</p> <p>The game\u2019s painstakingly detailed levels, featuring themes ranging from ancient Egyptian to medieval to modern-day Hollywood, also have much more depth than its predecessors. Each level, including the one set in a sewer, has its own kind of serene beauty that invites you to explore every corner.</p> <p>Curiosity is readily rewarded with stacks of money and treasure. Much of it just lying around, but some is hidden away and requires you to experiment with your tools in suspicious spaces. Creative players will enjoy discovering ways to access the most hard-to-reach treasure. Your stash can later be traded for a small selection of items in a shop accessed via the Virtual Boo.</p> <p>As is traditional, an end-of-level boss awaits you after you have cleared each room. These battles with an eccentric array of ghouls and goblins can be slightly maddening due to the trial-and-error approach needed discover their hidden weak spot. If you\u2019re really struggling, though, a few clues will occasionally appear on screen to help you out.</p> <p>The random equipment and characters you find scattered about the hotel can prove useful too, once you figure out the best way to use them; it\u2019s deeply satisfying \u2013 and hilarious \u2013 to use a rescued Toad as a weapon, for example. One floor also requires the near-continuous use of a giant rubber duck to navigate the obstacle-strewn surroundings, which was by far one of the most enjoyable experiences I\u2019ve had playing any Switch game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67a07e8212ced82dfa86b52ba8b3be4f877a55d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67a07e8212ced82dfa86b52ba8b3be4f877a55d8/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Multiplayer fans have two options to choose from (separate from the co-op mode). ScareScraper lets you play in a team of up to eight, online or locally, to complete missions such as collecting Toads or cash, or engage in further ghost busting activities. And ScreamPark offers up three Mario Party-style mini-games that work best with four or more players. It offers short bursts of frenzied fun but those looking for a longer, more immersive experience are likely to find ScareScraper the more entertaining of the two modes.</p> <p>Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is a captivating and charming game, but it\u2019s not without its flaws. If you follow the main storyline without breaking off to collect treasure, it can start to feel repetitive \u2013 a more substantial range of side quests less reliant on the Polturgust would have been welcome. And while it\u2019s satisfying to be able to collect so much cash, the items you receive in exchange are underwhelming. In the later stages of the game, we deserve a sizeable new gadget or tool.</p> <p>However, like many of Nintendo\u2019s best-loved franchises, Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is imaginative, humorous and highly inventive. It may be nearly two decades old but the series continues to evolve in pleasing ways.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Luigi never seems to learn his lesson. It\u2019s been 18 years since he was first lured to a haunted house and tortured by its spooky inhabitants. Now, having been duped again, he\u2019s trapped in an even bleaker building \u2013 the Hotel of Last Resort \u2013 as he races to rescue a familiar cast of Mushroom Kingdom characters. Although it treads very familiar ground to its predecessors, there\u2019s a lot to love in the third instalment of the adventure series that lets Mario\u2019s timid twin take charge. You still guide the character through uniquely themed sections of the building, relying on his flashlight and multi-functional Poltergust vacuum to rid the place of ghosts. Luigi keeps track of his progress through the 15 main hotel floors with the help of a digital assistant, amusingly called a Virtual Boo, as well as the quirky Professor E Gadd, who\u2019s on hand to offer tips and tutorials. The game was never likely to stray too far from its roots as a hunt-and-chase adventure, but Nintendo has attempted to breathe new life into the format, and it\u2019s these changes that truly elevate the game. The most innovative addition is Gooigi, a glowing gummy bear-like Luigi clone made of, well, goo. Previously appearing in the 3DS version of Luigi\u2019s Mansion, his malleable nature allows Gooigi to squeeze through grates and pipes, helping to solve puzzles and reach previously inaccessible areas. The presence of Gooigi enhances the experience a great deal, especially when playing in co-op mode, where you partner up with a friend and explore different parts of a room at the same time. While many puzzles are straightforward, some don\u2019t have obvious solutions, so being able to call on a second pair of eyes for clue-spotting is a welcome addition. The game\u2019s painstakingly detailed levels, featuring themes ranging from ancient Egyptian to medieval to modern-day Hollywood, also have much more depth than its predecessors. Each level, including the one set in a sewer, has its own kind of serene beauty that invites you to explore every corner. Curiosity is readily rewarded with stacks of money and treasure. Much of it just lying around, but some is hidden away and requires you to experiment with your tools in suspicious spaces. Creative players will enjoy discovering ways to access the most hard-to-reach treasure. Your stash can later be traded for a small selection of items in a shop accessed via the Virtual Boo. As is traditional, an end-of-level boss awaits you after you have cleared each room. These battles with an eccentric array of ghouls and goblins can be slightly maddening due to the trial-and-error approach needed discover their hidden weak spot. If you\u2019re really struggling, though, a few clues will occasionally appear on screen to help you out. The random equipment and characters you find scattered about the hotel can prove useful too, once you figure out the best way to use them; it\u2019s deeply satisfying \u2013 and hilarious \u2013 to use a rescued Toad as a weapon, for example. One floor also requires the near-continuous use of a giant rubber duck to navigate the obstacle-strewn surroundings, which was by far one of the most enjoyable experiences I\u2019ve had playing any Switch game. Multiplayer fans have two options to choose from (separate from the co-op mode). ScareScraper lets you play in a team of up to eight, online or locally, to complete missions such as collecting Toads or cash, or engage in further ghost busting activities. And ScreamPark offers up three Mario Party-style mini-games that work best with four or more players. It offers short bursts of frenzied fun but those looking for a longer, more immersive experience are likely to find ScareScraper the more entertaining of the two modes. Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is a captivating and charming game, but it\u2019s not without its flaws. If you follow the main storyline without breaking off to collect treasure, it can start to feel repetitive \u2013 a more substantial range of side quests less reliant on the Polturgust would have been welcome. And while it\u2019s satisfying to be able to collect so much cash, the items you receive in exchange are underwhelming. In the later stages of the game, we deserve a sizeable new gadget or tool. However, like many of Nintendo\u2019s best-loved franchises, Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is imaginative, humorous and highly inventive. It may be nearly two decades old but the series continues to evolve in pleasing ways.",

      "body": "<p>That day, 20 November 2014, the argument was about a hundred things, but mostly it was about cigarettes and milk. Farieissia Martin and Kyle Farrell were always arguing about something. They\u2019d been like that ever since they first got together, aged 16. On again, then off again. Now 21, Kyle and Fri, as everyone called her, had two young daughters, but they still fought constantly. They loved each other too much, their friends said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/audio/2019/nov/22/intimate-terrorism-how-an-abusive-relationship-led-a-young-woman-to-kill-her-partner\">\u2018Intimate terrorism\u2019: how an abusive relationship led a young woman to kill her partner \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fri and Kyle didn\u2019t live together, at least not officially. Kyle still lived with his parents in Toxteth in Liverpool, but he was always over at Fri\u2019s, a few streets away. Fri lived with the girls in a small red terraced house on Charlecote Street, a pretty road that slopes steeply down towards the River Mersey. There are hanging baskets outside the houses, flowerbeds filled with lavender and primroses. From the top of the street you can see across the grey water to hills in the distance.</p> <p>Kyle had agreed to come over to watch the kids in the late afternoon while Fri went to the shops with her friend Katrina and her daughter. They took a taxi into the centre of town, and Fri bought some makeup and browsed in a shoe shop. A crowd was gathering and someone told them the Christmas lights were about to be turned on, so they hung around. Katrina videoed the three of them walking towards the Christmas tree, all happy.</p> <p>At 6.30pm, while they were still shopping, Kyle started texting:</p> <p>\u201cthink am a dik ed\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat have ya done,\u201d replied Fri.</p> <p>\u201ctake me for a prick\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat have ya done?\u201d she texted again.</p> <p>Kyle\u2019s messages came in a rush, every 15 seconds or so. In the space of 10 minutes, he sent nearly 30, and Fri replied to many of them. This always happened when she went out without him. He\u2019d want to know where she was, who she was with, when she\u2019d be back. Even if she was just round the corner with a friend, he\u2019d barrage her with messages, then show up at their door to take her home.</p> <p>Fri showed some of Kyle\u2019s texts to Katrina, who was shocked to see how he wrote to her. Kyle was starting to make demands: he wanted to go out, wanted to leave the kids with Fri\u2019s mum, wanted Fri to come back, wanted her to bring him cigarettes and milk. Katrina noticed that Fri seemed more fatigued and disbelieving than particularly upset by it.</p> <p>\u201cHow the fuck can we be together if u don\u2019t even let me have a drink or a break. I\u2019m fuckin drained\u201d, she texted Kyle.</p> <p>\u201cI would of if u would of come in like supposed wid shopping that ye supposed to get\u201d, he replied.</p> <p>Fri told Katrina she was sure Kyle had broken something at her house. He was always threatening to damage her things \u2013 smash the telly, break the bed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat have ya done!!!\u201d she texted him again, at 6.37pm.</p> <p>\u201cbroke it!!!!!!!\u201d he replied, referring to her bed.</p> <p>\u201cOmg! I was going Iceland then comin ome!\u201d she wrote. \u201cYour just a big chid an won\u2019t let me have a life!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cwon\u2019t let you have a life hahahahahhahaha\u201d, he replied.</p> <p>\u201clil slag stay out get shagged or raped\u201d, he wrote a few minutes later.</p> <p>Fri texted a friend and told her what was going on:</p> <p>\u201cTellin ya chick, hate him, just loves to make life hard for me\u201d, she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIgnore him\u201d, her friend replied.</p> <p>But then Kyle told Fri he was going to go out and leave the kids by themselves and she started to worry that he actually might. Fri\u2019s phone battery ran out, so she used Katrina\u2019s to call Kyle just after 7pm to say they were coming home. Katrina noticed Fri was on edge now, anxious. She told Fri to call her mum or her brothers, to tell them what Kyle was saying, but Fri wouldn\u2019t. She never did. She didn\u2019t want them going round and confronting Kyle, getting into trouble on her behalf.</p> <p>On the way back, Katrina told Fri to pick up the kids and come stay at her house. Fri agreed, but when she got back to Charlecote Street, at 8pm, things seemed a little calmer. The kids were fine, Kyle was still there and he hadn\u2019t broken the bed, just some crystal decorations on the frame. They talked, Fri cried, and she told Kyle it felt like she couldn\u2019t do anything without his permission. They made up, and Kyle asked if she still wanted to go out for a drink. He said he didn\u2019t mind looking after the kids. So Fri, feeling better, went back to Katrina\u2019s. When she got there, at 9.10pm, she sent him a message, apologising. He replied: \u201cMe 2 xx\u201d.</p> <p>Over the next few hours, Fri and Katrina sat in the kitchen, chatting and drinking brandy and Pepsi. Fri was relaxed, happy to be out.</p> <p>In the early hours of the morning, Kyle started texting again. \u201cWhat time u comin in\u201d, he wrote at 1.35am. \u201cdon\u2019t take the piss bbe xxx\u201d, he added.</p> <p>Fri had said she\u2019d be home by midnight, so she knew she\u2019d be in trouble. Kyle still wanted the cigarettes and the milk. \u201cI know babe I got it xxx\u201d, she assured him. But it was late now, too late.</p> <p>Kyle kept texting:</p> <p>\u201cNah am vexed\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCunt\u201d</p> <p>\u201cdirty little piss ed\u201d</p> <p>\u201ccausing arguments again u stupid twat\u201d</p> <p>Finally, just before 4.30am, Fri got in a cab. \u201cOn me way xxx\u201d, she texted Kyle. It was only a short journey from Katrina\u2019s: past St Cleopas Church, past the paddocks and allotments, past the Team Oasis \u201cHappy Days\u201d Activity Centre and the Bleak House pub. The area, still associated with the Toxteth riots that happened nearly 40 years ago, was quiet. The police are still held in profound suspicion, I was often told, but it\u2019s different here now to how it was. It was unrecognisable, it was better.</p> <p>The cab turned right at the kebab shop on the corner, down Charlecote Street.</p> <p>\u201cEre now\u201d, Fri texted as the taxi pulled up.</p> <p>Kyle replied: \u201cbout fukin time\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Farieissia was the baby. That\u2019s what her family called her, and still call her \u2013 the baby. She had an older sister, Natasha, and three older brothers, Ishmael, Samuel and Marcus. They spoiled Fri, couldn\u2019t help it; she was always so tiny and cute. Even fully grown she was only five foot three, and slight as a child. \u201cLike this,\u201d her uncle, Steve Cassidy, told me, holding up his little finger.</p> <p>Fri was the outgoing one, her friends would say \u2013 funny, bubbly, happy-go-lucky. As she grew up, she became obsessed with dancing. She was a backing dancer for Ishmael\u2019s rap collective, attended a performing arts college for a while and imagined teaching dance one day. She loved to dress up, make herself immaculate. She\u2019d wear bright tops, red lipstick, and pose with her head thrown back so her long, dark hair fell like satin down her back. She even wore her school uniform with pride, her teachers remembered.</p> <p>When Fri was 10, her mother and father split up. Her mum, Lyly, got together with a new partner and life at home became a little more chaotic: parties at night, arguments among the family. Fri started hanging around with a big group of friends that included Kyle. They\u2019d known each other since they were five, at primary school at St Silas\u2019s on Pengwern Street and then at Shorefields secondary school. Kyle was popular, but quietly so. He liked to play football and computer games. Everyone said how little he spoke. When they were out with friends, he was often too shy to talk to Fri. Instead, he\u2019d send her messages afterwards. In 2010, Fri and Kyle finally got together. Marcus, Fri\u2019s brother, was a little concerned. He knew Kyle from playing Sunday football, had spent time at his house. He remembered Kyle hanging around on the corner with older guys in the neighbourhood and had seen him be a bit of a bully at times. But he could tell his sister was happy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ef1e8d585698bac3b3343ba898095681de93dc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef1e8d585698bac3b3343ba898095681de93dc7/0_0_615_809/380.jpg\" alt=\"Farieissia \u2018Fri\u2019 Martin\" width=\"380\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farieissia Martin, known as Fri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justice For Women</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fri was more than happy: she was hooked. She thought Kyle was gorgeous and would write notes to her friends saying how she loved him. But even in the first year of their relationship Fri and Kyle squabbled. They\u2019d call each other names, then make up. Fri noticed early on that Kyle was jealous, obsessed with who she\u2019d been with before him, convinced she was sleeping with his friends. He wanted to know who she was friends with on Facebook, who she was messaging. He would come to pick her up from college so she wouldn\u2019t walk past any men on the way back. When they argued, he\u2019d call her a slut or a slag. To Fri, it became normal. \u201cChange the record,\u201d she\u2019d say.</p> <p>In 2010, aged 16, Fri went to a pub with her mum and Marcus. A family sitting at the bar called them the N-word and threw a banana at them from a fruit bowl. Lyly went for them, got hit, Marcus punched the guy who did it, broke his jaw, and then Fri piled in, too. Marcus went to prison briefly. Fri got a supervision order, which she breached, and, in 2011, she had to spend two months and 20 days in a youth offending unit. When she came out, she felt isolated. Friends had drifted away: she could count them on one hand, she said. Everyone was doing their own thing, she felt, and so it was just her and Kyle, hanging out at his parents\u2019 house or her mum\u2019s. Neither was working \u2013 Kyle was in and out of college, doing a construction course and qualifying for a security badge, but he never had a full-time job. Both lived on benefits, and they spent all their time together.</p> <p>The first time Fri remembers Kyle hitting her was an evening in December 2011. She\u2019d gone out with some friends and come back to Kyle\u2019s house later than she said she would, so he slapped her across the face and dragged her out of the house by her hair. They worked it out, moved on. But then it happened again, and again. It became almost normal. He\u2019d lash out and she\u2019d fight back, scratching him or trying to push him off her. According to Fri, Kyle\u2019s mother sometimes had to intervene. Kyle\u2019s cousin, Cody Rowson, speaking on behalf of Kyle\u2019s family, says she never witnessed an aggressive side to him. \u201cKyle was brought up around a working-class family and knew his morals, and loved nothing more than being a dad and playing football,\u201d she told me. The following accounts are based on Fri\u2019s later statements and those of her family and friends. Kyle\u2019s family have always said they never saw him being violent.</p> <p>In January 2012, aged 18, Fri became pregnant with their first baby. When she was about five months along, they had a row on her mum\u2019s doorstep because Fri wouldn\u2019t let Kyle in, and he kicked her in the stomach. He said he hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her, he had been trying to kick the door. The next day, Fri went to hospital with a friend to get the baby checked. She told the midwife she\u2019d been hurt accidentally while trying to stop a fight at a party. Fri became good at excuses. When she had a black eye and bruising on her face, she told her family she\u2019d hit herself on the oven door. Another time, she told them the baby had thrown a toy at her head. Her brother Ishmael thought it sounded weird at the time. But then again, he thought, kids throw stuff.</p> <p>After Fri had their baby, things improved. Ishmael remembers Fri coming over to his house, showing off her daughter, delighted. Kyle was still quiet and withdrawn, but Fri seemed so happy. But then, when the baby was only three months old, Fri found out she was pregnant again. When he heard the news, Kyle punched her in the arm and told her she should get an abortion. They kept the baby, but the pregnancy seemed to trigger some new animosity in Kyle. Fri felt he didn\u2019t want to be with her any more. When they argued now, he\u2019d call her fat and ugly, and say no one would want her now she had kids.</p> <p>On 5 July 2013, a couple of weeks before she gave birth to their second baby, Fri moved into her new house on Charlecote Street. It was a chance, she thought, for her and Kyle to start afresh. They agreed he\u2019d stay with her four times a week and otherwise be at his mum\u2019s. Their second daughter arrived on 25 July, and things seemed all right at first. But it wasn\u2019t long before arguments started again. Kyle would try to dictate where she could go, who with, what time she had to be in. If she was late, he\u2019d get angry, break her things, punch holes in the wall, throw her to the ground, kick her. Friends began to witness the violence. Once, when Fri was round at Katrina\u2019s house, Kyle was texting as usual, wanting to know who she was with. Katrina told Fri to tell him to come over and see for himself \u2013 it was just the two of them there, having a dance in the living room. Kyle came, he and Fri argued and he threw Fri across the room so she landed hard on the sofa. Katrina couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d seen \u2013 the whole thing had escalated from 0 to 100 in seconds.</p> <p>When they argued, Fri often felt she provoked Kyle. He\u2019d call her a slag, and she\u2019d say: \u201cYeah I know I am\u201d, and it would drive him crazy. It was the same when he was violent \u2013 Fri felt she allowed it to happen, that it was somehow her fault. He\u2019d sit on top of her, hold down her wrists and laugh, and she\u2019d try to wriggle out from under him but would get too hot and give up or cry. He\u2019d say he was just messing around. After arguments, Kyle would sometimes ask if she wanted to have sex, and if she said no, he\u2019d accuse her of not liking it, or him, any more. Several times, he forced her, raped her. He\u2019d pin her down, spit on her and mock her body. She felt too embarrassed to tell anyone, and too scared. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Fri later wrote in a statement, \u201cbut I stayed with him and forgave him because I love him and just wanted to be a happy family.\u201d She imagined them getting married one day, had picked out her wedding dress: shorter at the front, longer at the back.</p> <p>Over the course of 2014, everything seemed to collapse. Fri found out that Kyle had got another girl pregnant while she\u2019d been pregnant with their first child. She couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 the betrayal when she was newly pregnant, the year of lies that must have followed. After she found out, their arguments always came back to it \u2013 his cheating and lying. According to Cody Rowson, Fri once had a conversation with Kyle\u2019s mother, who asked why she didn\u2019t leave him. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d replied Fri. \u201cI love him too much.\u201d</p> <p>By now, Fri was hardly seeing anyone else. Everyone in her family has a story of inviting her to something \u2013 a Sunday lunch, a party \u2013 and Fri making an excuse and not turning up. On the occasions they did manage to see her, her family and friends noticed that she looked exhausted, drawn, like she\u2019d lost some vitalising spirit. Fri never wore makeup any more, never got dressed up.</p> <p>That summer, Fri\u2019s mum was so worried that she took Fri and the kids to the Lake District for a holiday. She told Fri to turn off her phone, and Fri seemed to relax without the constant stream of texts from Kyle. They ended up staying an extra couple of days because Fri didn\u2019t want to go home. After the time away, she felt emboldened enough to break up with Kyle and briefly, in the early autumn, started seeing someone else. (Everyone said he looked exactly like Kyle.)</p> <p>It didn\u2019t last. Soon enough, as usual, she and Kyle were back together. In the days leading up to 21 November 2014, Kyle and Fri endlessly messaged each other, going round and round the same loops. They were vicious to each other, then calm again, Kyle either pleading to get back together or accusing her of infidelity. Fri told him to leave her alone. On 18 November, she wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t want a relationship where r kids see us boxin an arguin constantly its only a matter of time it will happen again ill end up with a black eye and the kids will be tellin people\u201d.</p> <p>But on 19 November, they made up. Kyle came over to Fri\u2019s house and they watched movies together. He asked to see her phone, wanted to know who she was messaging. They argued and Fri told him they had to trust each other if they were going to make it work. Kyle agreed, and, for the 100th time, the 1,000th time, they were together again. \u201cThe night was nice,\u201d remembered Fri, afterwards. \u201cWe were both happy.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By the time Fri arrived home from Katrina\u2019s house shortly after 4.30am on 21 November 2014, Kyle was furious. She hadn\u2019t brought the cigarettes and milk. He shouted at her, pulled the TV off the wall and smashed her phone. They kept arguing in the kitchen, and then Kyle grabbed her by the neck and pushed her back against the kitchen counter. He pressed his thumb into her throat. Her eyes started to stream. Fri tried to push him off her but he was too strong. She reached for a knife from a block on the counter.</p> <p>Fri has never been able to explain what happened next. Kyle kept goading her, and then she heard him say: \u201cFucking hell, Fri, you\u2019ve stabbed me.\u201d She\u2019s always said she never felt it happen. She didn\u2019t even believe him until she saw the blood. Kyle was still walking around, so she thought it couldn\u2019t have been that bad, that maybe the end of the knife had just caught him somehow. Kyle told Fri to get rid of the knife, so she picked up what she thought was the knife she\u2019d used and ran out the back door to put it in the bin in the alleyway behind the house. When she got back, Kyle was worse, stumbling, the wound pouring.</p> <p>By the time Fri called an ambulance, at 4.50am, she was hysterical. The call lasted for just over eight minutes, and for most of it, as the operator asked her questions, Fri kept desperately talking to Kyle: \u201cBaby, look at me, look at me \u2026 Look at me baby, stay awake \u2026 \u201d By now, Kyle was lying on the floor, blood all over his chest. Fri was kneeling beside him, cradling his head in her arms, weeping. \u201cI promise I\u2019m gonna never ever let you go,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>Fri called out for help and a neighbour, Claire Jones, came over. Jones had been up late with friends and heard Fri and Kyle arguing. That was nothing new \u2013 she heard them fighting all the time. Now, walking into Fri\u2019s living room, Jones saw blood all over the floor and Kyle lying in Fri\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019ve just come in and found him like that,\u201d Fri explained. Her first lie.</p> <p>The paramedics arrived at 5.05am and started treating Kyle in the house, before taking him out to the ambulance to administer CPR. When the first policeman arrived, shortly afterwards, he asked Fri what had happened. \u201cI\u2019ve just come home and found my boyfriend on the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone burst in and stabbed him.\u201d The officer went inside and saw the blood everywhere, the TV half pulled off the wall and a bloody knife under the table. Fri had taken the wrong knife to the bin.</p> <p>Three more police officers, two male and one female, arrived and Fri explained again what had happened: \u201cSome lads have burst in and done this,\u201d she said. The male officers both reported that she seemed suspiciously calm, but the female officer had a different impression. Fri kept going in and out of the house, and at one point the female officer found her inside, agitated and crying, asking repeatedly if Kyle was going to be OK. She helped Fri take the kids next door to Jones\u2019s house with some nappies and milk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside, the police questioned Jones and her friends. They said they\u2019d heard Fri and Kyle fighting and Fri shout: \u201cI\u2019ll stab you!\u201d This was enough: Fri was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, at about 5.35am, the police were radioed the news that Kyle had died from his injuries at the Royal Liverpool hospital. Fri was handcuffed and told she was now being arrested on suspicion of murder. According to the police, Fri began to cry and kept saying, \u201cMy babies, my babies.\u201d</p> <p>Fri was taken to Wavertree Road police station. On the way, police recorded her saying, \u201cI\u2019m not even arsed, I just want my babies\u201d \u2013 words that would later come back to haunt her. At the station, she had her picture taken. The photos show her looking exhausted and scared, hair tied up in a messy bun, eyes expressionless. There are multiple photos of her neck, where Kyle had been gripping her. In the medical notes, a nurse wrote \u201cmarks to neck\u201d.</p> <p>Over the next 36 hours, she was interviewed four times. They went over the background of her relationship with Kyle, and asked if he had ever been violent. Fri repeatedly said he hadn\u2019t: \u201cHe\u2019d get in my face sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he never hit me or anything like that.\u201d</p> <p>By then, they\u2019d taken a witness statement from Katrina, who told them what she\u2019d seen Kyle do to Fri, and what Fri had said about Kyle hurting her. But Fri kept defending him: \u201cI might have had the odd few bruises on my arms where he\u2019s been holding me or things like that, but he\u2019s never actually like, smacked me in my face or anything like that.\u201d Later, one of the police said to Fri she seemed to think she hadn\u2019t been assaulted unless she\u2019d been punched. Fri agreed, and the officer explained that being pushed, thrown and bruised did in fact count as assault. \u201cSo he has been violent towards you, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d asked the officer. \u201cYeah,\u201d said Fri.</p> <p>As they moved on to what had happened the previous night, Fri kept telling the same story, insisting that Kyle had been stabbed by intruders. The police went over the details, asking her to retell her version again and again. Towards the end of the third interview, one of the police read out a line from Fri\u2019s 999 call: \u201cBaby, baby, look at me, look at me, I didn\u2019t mean it, look at me.\u201d They told Fri it was time to tell the truth.</p> <p>Fri asked for a break. When she returned for the fourth interview, it was like something giving way. She\u2019d been trying to protect an image of her and Kyle, the story of their life that she wanted to be true. In her version, he\u2019d never been violent and she hadn\u2019t stabbed him. It was the story that meant neither of them would get in trouble. Fri apologised for lying and told the police that they\u2019d been arguing, he\u2019d smashed her phone, hurt her, she\u2019d been terrified. She hadn\u2019t known what she was doing.</p> <p>The police told her that according to the postmortem report they\u2019d received, Kyle had died from a single stab wound to the chest that must have been inflicted with enough force for it to pass under his ribs and up to the heart. It wasn\u2019t something that could have happened by accident, they said.</p> <p>\u201cHave you stabbed Kyle on purpose?\u201d asked one of the officers.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Fri.</p> <p>\u201cIntending to kill him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, I\u2019m 100% sure, I wouldn\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids, I\u2019ve got two kids. I wouldn\u2019t dare think about it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Fri\u2019s trial date was set for May 2015. Her legal team had just six months to prepare. In a domestic homicide case, there are some key questions around which a defence case can revolve: has the accused acted in self-defence? Has she been provoked and lost control? If there is a clear history of domestic abuse, a defence team could seek to have their client psychiatrically assessed. In Fri\u2019s case, if they could show she had been suffering from a mental health condition, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), caused by prolonged abuse, they might be able to use a defence of diminished responsibility.</p> <p>Fri\u2019s lawyers did not commission a psychiatric assessment, because Fri had told them she \u201cgave as good as she got\u201d and she had never displayed obvious signs of mental illness when they visited her in prison. They concentrated their defence on the grounds that Fri had acted in self-defence and been provoked to a loss of control.</p> <p>Fri\u2019s solicitor was Richard Whitehead, from a firm of Toxteth solicitors called KWP. (Whitehead did not respond to a request for an interview. Fri\u2019s barristers declined to be interviewed.) Fri\u2019s uncle, Steve Cassidy, wasn\u2019t sure the firm had enough experience of murder trials. He tried to hire a different lawyer, Helen Dugdale, who visited Fri in Styal women\u2019s prison in Cheshire and managed to get Fri to open up about Kyle\u2019s abuse. By the time Cassidy heard that the court had refused the transfer of legal aid to Dugdale, there were only three months left until the trial.</p> <p>To help Fri\u2019s case, her solicitors asked her to write a statement describing the domestic violence she had experienced. Family and friends also wrote statements giving details of incidents of abuse they\u2019d witnessed. Reports were gathered from friends and former teachers testifying to Fri\u2019s character \u2013 how courteous she\u2019d always been at school, how popular she was with her friends, how devoted she was to her kids \u2013 and how she\u2019d changed since being with Kyle, becoming reclusive and depressed. (Character statements were also provided for Kyle: his aunt said she had \u201cnever known Kyle to be violent towards Farieissia\u201d and a friend described Kyle as a \u201crelaxed, calm and gentle person. I never saw Kyle being violent towards anyone.\u201d) But in court those supporting statements would be less important than what Fri said. To receive a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder, Fri herself would have to use her time on the stand to prove to the jury the severity of the abuse she\u2019d suffered.</p> <p>All trials require performance. A jury needs a story they can believe, and a narrator they can trust. But how do you perform the story of your own abuse? Even in the most private of settings, survivors can find it hard to talk about what they have endured. There can be feelings of shame and denial. Sometimes the abused seeks to protect the abuser. Often, like Fri, they feel they are partly to blame. Social workers, helpline managers and psychotherapists all told me the same thing: stories emerge in bits and pieces, if at all. They might take months to come out, even years. There are things survivors can never say out loud. And if they do manage to tell their story, the process can be harrowing. Fri had told her closest friends about a fraction of Kyle\u2019s abuse. She hadn\u2019t told her family at all. It was unlikely she would be able to give a convincing account of it to a courtroom.</p> <p>When the trial started at Liverpool crown court in May 2015, it was the first time her family had seen Fri since before her arrest six months earlier. Ishmael thought she looked blank. Her friend Katrina thought she looked smaller than ever, as though she were 12 years old. When she took the stand, her uncle Steve said he tried to signal to her with his eyes: \u201cGo on, go on\u201d \u2013 as in, say what you need to say, say what needs to be heard. But Fri wasn\u2019t in any state to perform: she looked terrified, sobbed as she tried to talk. Cassidy recalled them playing the 999 call again and again in court, the sight of Fri having to listen to herself weeping and imploring Kyle to wake up. \u201cBaby, baby, look at me.\u201d</p> <p>The trial lasted two weeks. By the end, Fri\u2019s family were hopeful that she\u2019d get off on self-defence, or at worst, be convicted of manslaughter. Kyle\u2019s family wanted the verdict to be murder. \u201cNo family out there who have suffered the same thing would want the perpetrator to get a verdict of manslaughter,\u201d Cody Rowson told me. They couldn\u2019t get over how Fri had repeatedly lied about what she had done. \u201cShe should have owned up to it on the day it happened,\u201d said Rowson.</p> <p>On 28 May 2015, the judge, Mr Justice Dove, gave his summing up of the case. After going over the facts, he gave the jury a series of questions to answer, which would lead them to a verdict of either murder or manslaughter. He also referred to the background of domestic violence, including Kyle kicking Fri in the stomach when she was pregnant. There were no previous convictions related to the assaults, Dove noted, but the jury could still take them into account when considering the argument that Fri acted in self-defence, and was provoked to a loss of control.</p> <p>The jury deliberated for an hour-and-a-half. When they returned and delivered their unanimous verdict, it appeared they had decided against attaching any significant weight to the history of abuse. Fri was found guilty of murder.</p> <p>In his sentencing, Mr Justice Dove admonished Fri for initially lying to the police, but he also went over what he called \u201cconsiderable elements of mitigation\u201d. He could never be sure Fri had intended to kill Kyle. He believed, too, that what happened was not a premeditated attack but a heated argument that spiralled out of control. \u201cThere is no doubt that the violent relationship you had with Kyle Farrell played some part in fuelling what happened on that occasion,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it could never be justification, it is some mitigation for how you have ended up in this position.\u201d Dove gave her a lower-than-average life sentence: a minimum term of 13 years. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the aftermath of the trial, Fri\u2019s family said they were told that the chances of an appeal weren\u2019t high. Steve Cassidy wasn\u2019t persuaded. Cassidy drives a car breakdown truck and is the kind of person who sees problems as things to be taken away and mended. His niece was no different: he would rescue her. Cassidy heard from a friend about Justice for Women, an organisation that represents women who have been convicted of the murder of an abusive partner (they are currently working on 10 such cases). Shortly after the trial, he got in touch and passed on the details of Fri\u2019s case. One of Justice for Women\u2019s founders, the campaigning lawyer Harriet Wistrich, decided to <a href=\"https://www.justiceforwomen.org.uk/farieissia-martin\" title=\"\">take it on</a>.</p> <p>Wistrich, who is short, with a crop of grey hair and an air of brisk pragmatism, is based at Birnberg Pierce, a solicitors\u2019 firm renowned for representing Guant\u00e1namo prisoners and terrorism suspects. Most of the time she\u2019s not in their cramped Camden office, which is sandwiched between a pan-Asian cocktail bar and a Brazilian restaurant, but out meeting clients and juggling an overwhelming caseload. After Wistrich took on Fri\u2019s case, she commissioned both a psychiatrist and a psychologist to visit her in prison. Only after repeated visits and the encouragement of a support worker in prison was Fri able to talk openly about the abuse she\u2019d experienced. Often she was too upset to speak. There were words she didn\u2019t want to say, events she didn\u2019t want to remember. There is much that she still does not want shared with her family.</p> <p>In August 2018, Wistrich and the barrister Claire Wade QC submitted their application for permission to appeal Fri\u2019s conviction. They argued that having received the psychiatric assessments, there was now fresh evidence to show that at the time of the offence, Fri was suffering from both PTSD and mild depressive disorder. These conditions would have impaired her self-control and contributed to a dissociative state, also known as \u201ctraumatic amnesia\u201d, which explained why Fri was not able to explain or remember the moment of the stabbing itself, or to know which knife she had used immediately afterwards. After years of abuse, they argued, Kyle\u2019s aggression and the action of putting his hands around her neck would have acted as a trigger to the loss of control. As a consequence, the partial defences of diminished responsibility and loss of control could now be deployed.</p> <p>In February this year, the court of appeal responded. Mr Justice William Davis refused permission to appeal. In nine short paragraphs, he explained his reasoning. He sympathised with the original legal team who had not sought medical evidence because \u201cnothing was said by the applicant which suggested that the partial defence of diminished responsibility might be available\u201d. Wistrich\u2019s new arguments for the defence of diminished responsibility were dismissed because \u201cthe applicant did not raise the relevant factual matters before or at the time of the trial\u201d. Similarly, he noted that Wistrich was only able to offer a loss of control defence now because of new evidence that Fri hadn\u2019t previously disclosed. He concluded: \u201cThe onus was on her to be full and frank in her instructions at that time.\u201d</p> <p>The onus was on her. Fri, it seemed, had not told the right story to the right people at the right time; she had not performed as she should have done. The note of disbelief is hard to avoid in the judge\u2019s remarks: why hadn\u2019t she told anyone before, when it mattered? Why should anyone trust her now?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One of Wistrich\u2019s earlier cases was that of Sally Challen. In 2010, Challen was convicted of the murder of her abusive husband, Richard. Wistrich went on to win Challen\u2019s appeal on the grounds of diminished responsibility \u2013 and, in a momentous victory, a judge announced in June 2019 that Challen would not have to face a retrial. Her conviction had been downgraded to manslaughter, the nine years she\u2019d already served in prison were deemed sufficient punishment and she was able to walk free.</p> <p>Challen\u2019s case heightened public awareness of a form of domestic abuse now known as coercive control. Although Richard was violent towards Sally early on in their relationship, his abuse mostly manifested itself in the obsessive control he took over almost every aspect of her existence \u2013 money, social life, self-perception. In 2015, the Serious Crime Act made coercive control an offence in its own right. England and Wales were the first countries in the world to introduce such a law, and only Ireland and Scotland have so far followed suit. (Tasmania and France have laws related to psychological abuse.) Coercive control is defined as a pattern of acts, including assault, threats, monitoring and intimidation designed to frighten and punish the victim and isolate them from family and friends. Since 2015, it has become more widely recognised \u2013 the subject of storylines on The Archers and Coronation Street. In early October, during a debate in parliament on the new domestic abuse bill, Labour MP Rosie Duffield\u2019s account of her own experience of coercive control <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/02/labour-mp-moves-colleagues-to-tears-with-domestic-abuse-story\" title=\"\">moved many MPs to tears</a>.</p> <p>According to Evan Stark, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University in New Jersey who invented the term, coercive control should be seen as a form of \u201cintimate terrorism\u201d, analogous to being held hostage or kidnapped. Instead of measuring the suffering of women in broken bones, he believes the experience of coercive control is better understood as like living under a tyrannical regime. Often, as in Fri\u2019s case, violence is used to enforce the system of control. \u201cIt is just one of the many bits of the toolkit the abuser can use,\u201d Marianne Hester, a professor in gender violence at Bristol University, told me.</p> <p>Framed in this way, the crime of domestic abuse could be defined as one of long-term liberty deprivation, rather than a series of individual violent episodes. In cases where a woman has killed their abuser, Stark believes that lawyers should be able to use a \u201cliberty defence\u201d rather than a psychiatric one. \u201cIf a hostage kills their captor, that\u2019s considered self-defence,\u201d Stark told me. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to charge <em>them</em> with homicide.\u201d</p> <p>For now, being a victim of domestic abuse does not in itself constitute a defence in court. The Prison Reform Trust is currently calling for a new statutory defence to be added to the domestic abuse bill for those whose offending was driven by their experience of domestic abuse. But in the meantime, in Challen\u2019s case, the lawyers won her appeal on the grounds that she was not in her right mind when she repeatedly battered Richard with a hammer. \u201cMy crime was a result of 40 years of coercive control which was not recognised in my original trial,\u201d Challen told me. \u201cThe limitations in the criminal justice system\u2019s understanding of coercive control meant my mental health [was the] primary route to appeal.\u201d</p> <p>Challen\u2019s victory was significant \u2013 the judge at least recognised the impact of abuse on her mental state. But it was not enough that Richard had deprived her of her freedom for decades; to secure justice, Challen had to be seen as mentally ill. Wistrich will make the same argument on behalf of Fri and hope that a judge is similarly understanding. But we are still a long way from recognising the retaliation of an abused woman as a desperate bid to escape, rather than an act of murderous insanity.</p> <p>There is much that marks Sally Challen and Fri Martin apart: age, race, class, geography. Challen lived in a \u00a31m house in Claygate, Surrey; Richard owned a car dealership and drove a Ferrari. Fri lived in a council house in Liverpool, Kyle was unemployed. But there are similarities. Kyle, like Richard, tried to control his partner\u2019s life; he hurt and humiliated her over many years. Both women were trapped, physically and mentally. Both took their partners\u2019 lives. Both were found guilty of murder. One of them is now free.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Fri\u2019s family knows that she has to be punished for what she did. A life was taken. Time is being served, as it must be. But they do not accept that she is a murderer. There was no plotting or intent, they say. There was fear and panic. At present, they are waiting for the date of a hearing in which Wistrich and Wade will again argue for Fri\u2019s permission to appeal, this time to a panel of three judges. If they win, and go on to win an appeal, the family hopes that a retrial might find Fri guilty of manslaughter and that a new sentence would reflect the time she has already spent in prison. Perhaps she, too, could be free.</p> <p>A verdict can be rewritten, but Fri\u2019s life can\u2019t be. Nor can Kyle\u2019s, or the lives of their children, their families. As Cody Rowson told me: \u201cWe were all losing someone.\u201d Steve Cassidy once described the effect of it all \u2013 the killing, the case, Fri\u2019s imprisonment \u2013 as being like a waterfall: \u201cIt just keeps on going.\u201d Fri\u2019s family struggle with the guilt of not knowing about the abuse she suffered until the trial. They can\u2019t help going over and over what they now realise were clues. All those excuses, the bruises, the evasiveness. It\u2019s so obvious, in retrospect. Ishmael didn\u2019t get to see Fri as much as he\u2019d like \u2013 he worked hard, had two young children of his own. One time, he drove past her house and thought he\u2019d see if she was in. When he knocked on the door, he thought he saw a curtain move upstairs. He couldn\u2019t be sure, thought he must have imagined it, and drove away again. He can\u2019t stop thinking about that curtain.</p> <p>Recently, Fri was moved from Styal to a prison near Durham. If the traffic is bad, it can take four hours to get there from Liverpool. It\u2019s harder for her family to visit now. When Cassidy goes, they talk about the children, never about what happened. The kids visit, too; they think their mum lives in a castle like a princess. When Ishmael goes, he tries to keep the tone light. As the oldest brother, he feels a responsibility to keep everyone on track, positive. He tries to keep Fri focused on the future. When she\u2019s out, he\u2019s going to set her up to work with him. But he knows that when she does come out, she won\u2019t be the same. Already, she\u2019s not the same.</p> <p>When Ishmael told me about leaving his sister in prison, the sadness seemed to wind him. He couldn\u2019t speak, bumped his fist against his chest as if to dislodge something. He exhaled loudly through puffed cheeks, jerked his head from side to side, cleared his throat. It was like he was trying to get rid of it, the sadness, as though it were a sickness he was trying to shake off. Ishmael\u2019s a big guy, works in security. He doesn\u2019t often cry.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Back in the spring of 2015, just before he delivered the precise terms of her life sentence, Mr Justice Dove said he didn\u2019t think Fri was a wicked or violent person. \u201cYou were a loving (and still will remain, I have no doubt, a loving) and conscientious mother,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd you are going to have to live with the consequences of having killed the person who was your childhood sweetheart, the father of your children and someone who, I have no doubt, you still loved at the time when you took his life.\u201d</p> <p>Fri still loves Kyle now. It\u2019s hard for her family to understand. \u201cLove is a strange thing,\u201d said Ishmael, shaking his head. Many people struggle to comprehend when a victim of abuse still professes to love their abuser. How can you love someone who\u2019s hurting you? Why don\u2019t you leave? It\u2019s like a hostage falling for their captor, Prof Hester told me: \u201cIn the end, you become so bound up with the person who is defining everything about your being, that you end up not having a being outside of them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/08/my-mother-sally-challen-killed-my-father-finally-justice\">My mother, Sally Challen, was branded a cold-blooded killer. At last, she has justice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evan Stark pointed out that there is no incompatibility between hate and love: the two coexist in relationships all the time. So do violence and love, as strange and awful as it may seem. In such cases, the definition of love is stretched beyond any conventional understanding. But relationships like Fri\u2019s don\u2019t tend to start abusively: \u201cYou don\u2019t go out with someone who punches you in the face on the first date,\u201d said Fiona Dwyer, chief executive of Solace Women\u2019s Aid. Women sometimes don\u2019t recognise they are in an abusive relationship until they are too enmeshed in it to escape. By then, the consequences of leaving can feel too dangerous, and they are trapped.</p> <p>Steve Cassidy has a plastic bag full of documents related to Fri\u2019s case. Sitting in her brother Marcus\u2019s flat one afternoon, he pulled out a letter Fri had written to Kyle from prison. He passed it to Fri\u2019s father, Leroy, who tried to read it but couldn\u2019t get to the end. Leroy passed it on to me. The letter was written in Fri\u2019s neat, round handwriting on a sheet of lined paper. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d it began, \u201cit just all happened so fast. I tried to protect myself and this is how it\u2019s ended up.\u201d Fri went on to say how sorry she was for what had happened and told Kyle she\u2019d always love him. \u201cUntil we meet again,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRest in paradise, my man, my true love, my Kyle John Farrell.\u201d At the end, she\u2019d drawn a small heart and coloured it in with black biro.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "That day, 20 November 2014, the argument was about a hundred things, but mostly it was about cigarettes and milk. Farieissia Martin and Kyle Farrell were always arguing about something. They\u2019d been like that ever since they first got together, aged 16. On again, then off again. Now 21, Kyle and Fri, as everyone called her, had two young daughters, but they still fought constantly. They loved each other too much, their friends said. Fri and Kyle didn\u2019t live together, at least not officially. Kyle still lived with his parents in Toxteth in Liverpool, but he was always over at Fri\u2019s, a few streets away. Fri lived with the girls in a small red terraced house on Charlecote Street, a pretty road that slopes steeply down towards the River Mersey. There are hanging baskets outside the houses, flowerbeds filled with lavender and primroses. From the top of the street you can see across the grey water to hills in the distance. Kyle had agreed to come over to watch the kids in the late afternoon while Fri went to the shops with her friend Katrina and her daughter. They took a taxi into the centre of town, and Fri bought some makeup and browsed in a shoe shop. A crowd was gathering and someone told them the Christmas lights were about to be turned on, so they hung around. Katrina videoed the three of them walking towards the Christmas tree, all happy. At 6.30pm, while they were still shopping, Kyle started texting: \u201cthink am a dik ed\u201d \u201cWhat have ya done,\u201d replied Fri. \u201ctake me for a prick\u201d \u201cWhat have ya done?\u201d she texted again. Kyle\u2019s messages came in a rush, every 15 seconds or so. In the space of 10 minutes, he sent nearly 30, and Fri replied to many of them. This always happened when she went out without him. He\u2019d want to know where she was, who she was with, when she\u2019d be back. Even if she was just round the corner with a friend, he\u2019d barrage her with messages, then show up at their door to take her home. Fri showed some of Kyle\u2019s texts to Katrina, who was shocked to see how he wrote to her. Kyle was starting to make demands: he wanted to go out, wanted to leave the kids with Fri\u2019s mum, wanted Fri to come back, wanted her to bring him cigarettes and milk. Katrina noticed that Fri seemed more fatigued and disbelieving than particularly upset by it. \u201cHow the fuck can we be together if u don\u2019t even let me have a drink or a break. I\u2019m fuckin drained\u201d, she texted Kyle. \u201cI would of if u would of come in like supposed wid shopping that ye supposed to get\u201d, he replied. Fri told Katrina she was sure Kyle had broken something at her house. He was always threatening to damage her things \u2013 smash the telly, break the bed. \u201cWhat have ya done!!!\u201d she texted him again, at 6.37pm. \u201cbroke it!!!!!!!\u201d he replied, referring to her bed. \u201cOmg! I was going Iceland then comin ome!\u201d she wrote. \u201cYour just a big chid an won\u2019t let me have a life!\u201d \u201cwon\u2019t let you have a life hahahahahhahaha\u201d, he replied. \u201clil slag stay out get shagged or raped\u201d, he wrote a few minutes later. Fri texted a friend and told her what was going on: \u201cTellin ya chick, hate him, just loves to make life hard for me\u201d, she wrote. \u201cIgnore him\u201d, her friend replied. But then Kyle told Fri he was going to go out and leave the kids by themselves and she started to worry that he actually might. Fri\u2019s phone battery ran out, so she used Katrina\u2019s to call Kyle just after 7pm to say they were coming home. Katrina noticed Fri was on edge now, anxious. She told Fri to call her mum or her brothers, to tell them what Kyle was saying, but Fri wouldn\u2019t. She never did. She didn\u2019t want them going round and confronting Kyle, getting into trouble on her behalf. On the way back, Katrina told Fri to pick up the kids and come stay at her house. Fri agreed, but when she got back to Charlecote Street, at 8pm, things seemed a little calmer. The kids were fine, Kyle was still there and he hadn\u2019t broken the bed, just some crystal decorations on the frame. They talked, Fri cried, and she told Kyle it felt like she couldn\u2019t do anything without his permission. They made up, and Kyle asked if she still wanted to go out for a drink. He said he didn\u2019t mind looking after the kids. So Fri, feeling better, went back to Katrina\u2019s. When she got there, at 9.10pm, she sent him a message, apologising. He replied: \u201cMe 2 xx\u201d. Over the next few hours, Fri and Katrina sat in the kitchen, chatting and drinking brandy and Pepsi. Fri was relaxed, happy to be out. In the early hours of the morning, Kyle started texting again. \u201cWhat time u comin in\u201d, he wrote at 1.35am. \u201cdon\u2019t take the piss bbe xxx\u201d, he added. Fri had said she\u2019d be home by midnight, so she knew she\u2019d be in trouble. Kyle still wanted the cigarettes and the milk. \u201cI know babe I got it xxx\u201d, she assured him. But it was late now, too late. Kyle kept texting: \u201cNah am vexed\u201d \u201cCunt\u201d \u201cdirty little piss ed\u201d \u201ccausing arguments again u stupid twat\u201d Finally, just before 4.30am, Fri got in a cab. \u201cOn me way xxx\u201d, she texted Kyle. It was only a short journey from Katrina\u2019s: past St Cleopas Church, past the paddocks and allotments, past the Team Oasis \u201cHappy Days\u201d Activity Centre and the Bleak House pub. The area, still associated with the Toxteth riots that happened nearly 40 years ago, was quiet. The police are still held in profound suspicion, I was often told, but it\u2019s different here now to how it was. It was unrecognisable, it was better. The cab turned right at the kebab shop on the corner, down Charlecote Street. \u201cEre now\u201d, Fri texted as the taxi pulled up. Kyle replied: \u201cbout fukin time\u201d. * * * Farieissia was the baby. That\u2019s what her family called her, and still call her \u2013 the baby. She had an older sister, Natasha, and three older brothers, Ishmael, Samuel and Marcus. They spoiled Fri, couldn\u2019t help it; she was always so tiny and cute. Even fully grown she was only five foot three, and slight as a child. \u201cLike this,\u201d her uncle, Steve Cassidy, told me, holding up his little finger. Fri was the outgoing one, her friends would say \u2013 funny, bubbly, happy-go-lucky. As she grew up, she became obsessed with dancing. She was a backing dancer for Ishmael\u2019s rap collective, attended a performing arts college for a while and imagined teaching dance one day. She loved to dress up, make herself immaculate. She\u2019d wear bright tops, red lipstick, and pose with her head thrown back so her long, dark hair fell like satin down her back. She even wore her school uniform with pride, her teachers remembered. When Fri was 10, her mother and father split up. Her mum, Lyly, got together with a new partner and life at home became a little more chaotic: parties at night, arguments among the family. Fri started hanging around with a big group of friends that included Kyle. They\u2019d known each other since they were five, at primary school at St Silas\u2019s on Pengwern Street and then at Shorefields secondary school. Kyle was popular, but quietly so. He liked to play football and computer games. Everyone said how little he spoke. When they were out with friends, he was often too shy to talk to Fri. Instead, he\u2019d send her messages afterwards. In 2010, Fri and Kyle finally got together. Marcus, Fri\u2019s brother, was a little concerned. He knew Kyle from playing Sunday football, had spent time at his house. He remembered Kyle hanging around on the corner with older guys in the neighbourhood and had seen him be a bit of a bully at times. But he could tell his sister was happy. Fri was more than happy: she was hooked. She thought Kyle was gorgeous and would write notes to her friends saying how she loved him. But even in the first year of their relationship Fri and Kyle squabbled. They\u2019d call each other names, then make up. Fri noticed early on that Kyle was jealous, obsessed with who she\u2019d been with before him, convinced she was sleeping with his friends. He wanted to know who she was friends with on Facebook, who she was messaging. He would come to pick her up from college so she wouldn\u2019t walk past any men on the way back. When they argued, he\u2019d call her a slut or a slag. To Fri, it became normal. \u201cChange the record,\u201d she\u2019d say. In 2010, aged 16, Fri went to a pub with her mum and Marcus. A family sitting at the bar called them the N-word and threw a banana at them from a fruit bowl. Lyly went for them, got hit, Marcus punched the guy who did it, broke his jaw, and then Fri piled in, too. Marcus went to prison briefly. Fri got a supervision order, which she breached, and, in 2011, she had to spend two months and 20 days in a youth offending unit. When she came out, she felt isolated. Friends had drifted away: she could count them on one hand, she said. Everyone was doing their own thing, she felt, and so it was just her and Kyle, hanging out at his parents\u2019 house or her mum\u2019s. Neither was working \u2013 Kyle was in and out of college, doing a construction course and qualifying for a security badge, but he never had a full-time job. Both lived on benefits, and they spent all their time together. The first time Fri remembers Kyle hitting her was an evening in December 2011. She\u2019d gone out with some friends and come back to Kyle\u2019s house later than she said she would, so he slapped her across the face and dragged her out of the house by her hair. They worked it out, moved on. But then it happened again, and again. It became almost normal. He\u2019d lash out and she\u2019d fight back, scratching him or trying to push him off her. According to Fri, Kyle\u2019s mother sometimes had to intervene. Kyle\u2019s cousin, Cody Rowson, speaking on behalf of Kyle\u2019s family, says she never witnessed an aggressive side to him. \u201cKyle was brought up around a working-class family and knew his morals, and loved nothing more than being a dad and playing football,\u201d she told me. The following accounts are based on Fri\u2019s later statements and those of her family and friends. Kyle\u2019s family have always said they never saw him being violent. In January 2012, aged 18, Fri became pregnant with their first baby. When she was about five months along, they had a row on her mum\u2019s doorstep because Fri wouldn\u2019t let Kyle in, and he kicked her in the stomach. He said he hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her, he had been trying to kick the door. The next day, Fri went to hospital with a friend to get the baby checked. She told the midwife she\u2019d been hurt accidentally while trying to stop a fight at a party. Fri became good at excuses. When she had a black eye and bruising on her face, she told her family she\u2019d hit herself on the oven door. Another time, she told them the baby had thrown a toy at her head. Her brother Ishmael thought it sounded weird at the time. But then again, he thought, kids throw stuff. After Fri had their baby, things improved. Ishmael remembers Fri coming over to his house, showing off her daughter, delighted. Kyle was still quiet and withdrawn, but Fri seemed so happy. But then, when the baby was only three months old, Fri found out she was pregnant again. When he heard the news, Kyle punched her in the arm and told her she should get an abortion. They kept the baby, but the pregnancy seemed to trigger some new animosity in Kyle. Fri felt he didn\u2019t want to be with her any more. When they argued now, he\u2019d call her fat and ugly, and say no one would want her now she had kids. On 5 July 2013, a couple of weeks before she gave birth to their second baby, Fri moved into her new house on Charlecote Street. It was a chance, she thought, for her and Kyle to start afresh. They agreed he\u2019d stay with her four times a week and otherwise be at his mum\u2019s. Their second daughter arrived on 25 July, and things seemed all right at first. But it wasn\u2019t long before arguments started again. Kyle would try to dictate where she could go, who with, what time she had to be in. If she was late, he\u2019d get angry, break her things, punch holes in the wall, throw her to the ground, kick her. Friends began to witness the violence. Once, when Fri was round at Katrina\u2019s house, Kyle was texting as usual, wanting to know who she was with. Katrina told Fri to tell him to come over and see for himself \u2013 it was just the two of them there, having a dance in the living room. Kyle came, he and Fri argued and he threw Fri across the room so she landed hard on the sofa. Katrina couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d seen \u2013 the whole thing had escalated from 0 to 100 in seconds. When they argued, Fri often felt she provoked Kyle. He\u2019d call her a slag, and she\u2019d say: \u201cYeah I know I am\u201d, and it would drive him crazy. It was the same when he was violent \u2013 Fri felt she allowed it to happen, that it was somehow her fault. He\u2019d sit on top of her, hold down her wrists and laugh, and she\u2019d try to wriggle out from under him but would get too hot and give up or cry. He\u2019d say he was just messing around. After arguments, Kyle would sometimes ask if she wanted to have sex, and if she said no, he\u2019d accuse her of not liking it, or him, any more. Several times, he forced her, raped her. He\u2019d pin her down, spit on her and mock her body. She felt too embarrassed to tell anyone, and too scared. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Fri later wrote in a statement, \u201cbut I stayed with him and forgave him because I love him and just wanted to be a happy family.\u201d She imagined them getting married one day, had picked out her wedding dress: shorter at the front, longer at the back. Over the course of 2014, everything seemed to collapse. Fri found out that Kyle had got another girl pregnant while she\u2019d been pregnant with their first child. She couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 the betrayal when she was newly pregnant, the year of lies that must have followed. After she found out, their arguments always came back to it \u2013 his cheating and lying. According to Cody Rowson, Fri once had a conversation with Kyle\u2019s mother, who asked why she didn\u2019t leave him. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d replied Fri. \u201cI love him too much.\u201d By now, Fri was hardly seeing anyone else. Everyone in her family has a story of inviting her to something \u2013 a Sunday lunch, a party \u2013 and Fri making an excuse and not turning up. On the occasions they did manage to see her, her family and friends noticed that she looked exhausted, drawn, like she\u2019d lost some vitalising spirit. Fri never wore makeup any more, never got dressed up. That summer, Fri\u2019s mum was so worried that she took Fri and the kids to the Lake District for a holiday. She told Fri to turn off her phone, and Fri seemed to relax without the constant stream of texts from Kyle. They ended up staying an extra couple of days because Fri didn\u2019t want to go home. After the time away, she felt emboldened enough to break up with Kyle and briefly, in the early autumn, started seeing someone else. (Everyone said he looked exactly like Kyle.) It didn\u2019t last. Soon enough, as usual, she and Kyle were back together. In the days leading up to 21 November 2014, Kyle and Fri endlessly messaged each other, going round and round the same loops. They were vicious to each other, then calm again, Kyle either pleading to get back together or accusing her of infidelity. Fri told him to leave her alone. On 18 November, she wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t want a relationship where r kids see us boxin an arguin constantly its only a matter of time it will happen again ill end up with a black eye and the kids will be tellin people\u201d. But on 19 November, they made up. Kyle came over to Fri\u2019s house and they watched movies together. He asked to see her phone, wanted to know who she was messaging. They argued and Fri told him they had to trust each other if they were going to make it work. Kyle agreed, and, for the 100th time, the 1,000th time, they were together again. \u201cThe night was nice,\u201d remembered Fri, afterwards. \u201cWe were both happy.\u201d * * * By the time Fri arrived home from Katrina\u2019s house shortly after 4.30am on 21 November 2014, Kyle was furious. She hadn\u2019t brought the cigarettes and milk. He shouted at her, pulled the TV off the wall and smashed her phone. They kept arguing in the kitchen, and then Kyle grabbed her by the neck and pushed her back against the kitchen counter. He pressed his thumb into her throat. Her eyes started to stream. Fri tried to push him off her but he was too strong. She reached for a knife from a block on the counter. Fri has never been able to explain what happened next. Kyle kept goading her, and then she heard him say: \u201cFucking hell, Fri, you\u2019ve stabbed me.\u201d She\u2019s always said she never felt it happen. She didn\u2019t even believe him until she saw the blood. Kyle was still walking around, so she thought it couldn\u2019t have been that bad, that maybe the end of the knife had just caught him somehow. Kyle told Fri to get rid of the knife, so she picked up what she thought was the knife she\u2019d used and ran out the back door to put it in the bin in the alleyway behind the house. When she got back, Kyle was worse, stumbling, the wound pouring. By the time Fri called an ambulance, at 4.50am, she was hysterical. The call lasted for just over eight minutes, and for most of it, as the operator asked her questions, Fri kept desperately talking to Kyle: \u201cBaby, look at me, look at me \u2026 Look at me baby, stay awake \u2026 \u201d By now, Kyle was lying on the floor, blood all over his chest. Fri was kneeling beside him, cradling his head in her arms, weeping. \u201cI promise I\u2019m gonna never ever let you go,\u201d she told him. Fri called out for help and a neighbour, Claire Jones, came over. Jones had been up late with friends and heard Fri and Kyle arguing. That was nothing new \u2013 she heard them fighting all the time. Now, walking into Fri\u2019s living room, Jones saw blood all over the floor and Kyle lying in Fri\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019ve just come in and found him like that,\u201d Fri explained. Her first lie. The paramedics arrived at 5.05am and started treating Kyle in the house, before taking him out to the ambulance to administer CPR. When the first policeman arrived, shortly afterwards, he asked Fri what had happened. \u201cI\u2019ve just come home and found my boyfriend on the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone burst in and stabbed him.\u201d The officer went inside and saw the blood everywhere, the TV half pulled off the wall and a bloody knife under the table. Fri had taken the wrong knife to the bin. Three more police officers, two male and one female, arrived and Fri explained again what had happened: \u201cSome lads have burst in and done this,\u201d she said. The male officers both reported that she seemed suspiciously calm, but the female officer had a different impression. Fri kept going in and out of the house, and at one point the female officer found her inside, agitated and crying, asking repeatedly if Kyle was going to be OK. She helped Fri take the kids next door to Jones\u2019s house with some nappies and milk. Outside, the police questioned Jones and her friends. They said they\u2019d heard Fri and Kyle fighting and Fri shout: \u201cI\u2019ll stab you!\u201d This was enough: Fri was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Shortly afterwards, at about 5.35am, the police were radioed the news that Kyle had died from his injuries at the Royal Liverpool hospital. Fri was handcuffed and told she was now being arrested on suspicion of murder. According to the police, Fri began to cry and kept saying, \u201cMy babies, my babies.\u201d Fri was taken to Wavertree Road police station. On the way, police recorded her saying, \u201cI\u2019m not even arsed, I just want my babies\u201d \u2013 words that would later come back to haunt her. At the station, she had her picture taken. The photos show her looking exhausted and scared, hair tied up in a messy bun, eyes expressionless. There are multiple photos of her neck, where Kyle had been gripping her. In the medical notes, a nurse wrote \u201cmarks to neck\u201d. Over the next 36 hours, she was interviewed four times. They went over the background of her relationship with Kyle, and asked if he had ever been violent. Fri repeatedly said he hadn\u2019t: \u201cHe\u2019d get in my face sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he never hit me or anything like that.\u201d By then, they\u2019d taken a witness statement from Katrina, who told them what she\u2019d seen Kyle do to Fri, and what Fri had said about Kyle hurting her. But Fri kept defending him: \u201cI might have had the odd few bruises on my arms where he\u2019s been holding me or things like that, but he\u2019s never actually like, smacked me in my face or anything like that.\u201d Later, one of the police said to Fri she seemed to think she hadn\u2019t been assaulted unless she\u2019d been punched. Fri agreed, and the officer explained that being pushed, thrown and bruised did in fact count as assault. \u201cSo he has been violent towards you, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d asked the officer. \u201cYeah,\u201d said Fri. As they moved on to what had happened the previous night, Fri kept telling the same story, insisting that Kyle had been stabbed by intruders. The police went over the details, asking her to retell her version again and again. Towards the end of the third interview, one of the police read out a line from Fri\u2019s 999 call: \u201cBaby, baby, look at me, look at me, I didn\u2019t mean it, look at me.\u201d They told Fri it was time to tell the truth. Fri asked for a break. When she returned for the fourth interview, it was like something giving way. She\u2019d been trying to protect an image of her and Kyle, the story of their life that she wanted to be true. In her version, he\u2019d never been violent and she hadn\u2019t stabbed him. It was the story that meant neither of them would get in trouble. Fri apologised for lying and told the police that they\u2019d been arguing, he\u2019d smashed her phone, hurt her, she\u2019d been terrified. She hadn\u2019t known what she was doing. The police told her that according to the postmortem report they\u2019d received, Kyle had died from a single stab wound to the chest that must have been inflicted with enough force for it to pass under his ribs and up to the heart. It wasn\u2019t something that could have happened by accident, they said. \u201cHave you stabbed Kyle on purpose?\u201d asked one of the officers. \u201cNo,\u201d said Fri. \u201cIntending to kill him.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure, I\u2019m 100% sure, I wouldn\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids, I\u2019ve got two kids. I wouldn\u2019t dare think about it.\u201d * * * Fri\u2019s trial date was set for May 2015. Her legal team had just six months to prepare. In a domestic homicide case, there are some key questions around which a defence case can revolve: has the accused acted in self-defence? Has she been provoked and lost control? If there is a clear history of domestic abuse, a defence team could seek to have their client psychiatrically assessed. In Fri\u2019s case, if they could show she had been suffering from a mental health condition, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), caused by prolonged abuse, they might be able to use a defence of diminished responsibility. Fri\u2019s lawyers did not commission a psychiatric assessment, because Fri had told them she \u201cgave as good as she got\u201d and she had never displayed obvious signs of mental illness when they visited her in prison. They concentrated their defence on the grounds that Fri had acted in self-defence and been provoked to a loss of control. Fri\u2019s solicitor was Richard Whitehead, from a firm of Toxteth solicitors called KWP. (Whitehead did not respond to a request for an interview. Fri\u2019s barristers declined to be interviewed.) Fri\u2019s uncle, Steve Cassidy, wasn\u2019t sure the firm had enough experience of murder trials. He tried to hire a different lawyer, Helen Dugdale, who visited Fri in Styal women\u2019s prison in Cheshire and managed to get Fri to open up about Kyle\u2019s abuse. By the time Cassidy heard that the court had refused the transfer of legal aid to Dugdale, there were only three months left until the trial. To help Fri\u2019s case, her solicitors asked her to write a statement describing the domestic violence she had experienced. Family and friends also wrote statements giving details of incidents of abuse they\u2019d witnessed. Reports were gathered from friends and former teachers testifying to Fri\u2019s character \u2013 how courteous she\u2019d always been at school, how popular she was with her friends, how devoted she was to her kids \u2013 and how she\u2019d changed since being with Kyle, becoming reclusive and depressed. (Character statements were also provided for Kyle: his aunt said she had \u201cnever known Kyle to be violent towards Farieissia\u201d and a friend described Kyle as a \u201crelaxed, calm and gentle person. I never saw Kyle being violent towards anyone.\u201d) But in court those supporting statements would be less important than what Fri said. To receive a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder, Fri herself would have to use her time on the stand to prove to the jury the severity of the abuse she\u2019d suffered. All trials require performance. A jury needs a story they can believe, and a narrator they can trust. But how do you perform the story of your own abuse? Even in the most private of settings, survivors can find it hard to talk about what they have endured. There can be feelings of shame and denial. Sometimes the abused seeks to protect the abuser. Often, like Fri, they feel they are partly to blame. Social workers, helpline managers and psychotherapists all told me the same thing: stories emerge in bits and pieces, if at all. They might take months to come out, even years. There are things survivors can never say out loud. And if they do manage to tell their story, the process can be harrowing. Fri had told her closest friends about a fraction of Kyle\u2019s abuse. She hadn\u2019t told her family at all. It was unlikely she would be able to give a convincing account of it to a courtroom. When the trial started at Liverpool crown court in May 2015, it was the first time her family had seen Fri since before her arrest six months earlier. Ishmael thought she looked blank. Her friend Katrina thought she looked smaller than ever, as though she were 12 years old. When she took the stand, her uncle Steve said he tried to signal to her with his eyes: \u201cGo on, go on\u201d \u2013 as in, say what you need to say, say what needs to be heard. But Fri wasn\u2019t in any state to perform: she looked terrified, sobbed as she tried to talk. Cassidy recalled them playing the 999 call again and again in court, the sight of Fri having to listen to herself weeping and imploring Kyle to wake up. \u201cBaby, baby, look at me.\u201d The trial lasted two weeks. By the end, Fri\u2019s family were hopeful that she\u2019d get off on self-defence, or at worst, be convicted of manslaughter. Kyle\u2019s family wanted the verdict to be murder. \u201cNo family out there who have suffered the same thing would want the perpetrator to get a verdict of manslaughter,\u201d Cody Rowson told me. They couldn\u2019t get over how Fri had repeatedly lied about what she had done. \u201cShe should have owned up to it on the day it happened,\u201d said Rowson. On 28 May 2015, the judge, Mr Justice Dove, gave his summing up of the case. After going over the facts, he gave the jury a series of questions to answer, which would lead them to a verdict of either murder or manslaughter. He also referred to the background of domestic violence, including Kyle kicking Fri in the stomach when she was pregnant. There were no previous convictions related to the assaults, Dove noted, but the jury could still take them into account when considering the argument that Fri acted in self-defence, and was provoked to a loss of control. The jury deliberated for an hour-and-a-half. When they returned and delivered their unanimous verdict, it appeared they had decided against attaching any significant weight to the history of abuse. Fri was found guilty of murder. In his sentencing, Mr Justice Dove admonished Fri for initially lying to the police, but he also went over what he called \u201cconsiderable elements of mitigation\u201d. He could never be sure Fri had intended to kill Kyle. He believed, too, that what happened was not a premeditated attack but a heated argument that spiralled out of control. \u201cThere is no doubt that the violent relationship you had with Kyle Farrell played some part in fuelling what happened on that occasion,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it could never be justification, it is some mitigation for how you have ended up in this position.\u201d Dove gave her a lower-than-average life sentence: a minimum term of 13 years. * * * In the aftermath of the trial, Fri\u2019s family said they were told that the chances of an appeal weren\u2019t high. Steve Cassidy wasn\u2019t persuaded. Cassidy drives a car breakdown truck and is the kind of person who sees problems as things to be taken away and mended. His niece was no different: he would rescue her. Cassidy heard from a friend about Justice for Women, an organisation that represents women who have been convicted of the murder of an abusive partner (they are currently working on 10 such cases). Shortly after the trial, he got in touch and passed on the details of Fri\u2019s case. One of Justice for Women\u2019s founders, the campaigning lawyer Harriet Wistrich, decided to take it on. Wistrich, who is short, with a crop of grey hair and an air of brisk pragmatism, is based at Birnberg Pierce, a solicitors\u2019 firm renowned for representing Guant\u00e1namo prisoners and terrorism suspects. Most of the time she\u2019s not in their cramped Camden office, which is sandwiched between a pan-Asian cocktail bar and a Brazilian restaurant, but out meeting clients and juggling an overwhelming caseload. After Wistrich took on Fri\u2019s case, she commissioned both a psychiatrist and a psychologist to visit her in prison. Only after repeated visits and the encouragement of a support worker in prison was Fri able to talk openly about the abuse she\u2019d experienced. Often she was too upset to speak. There were words she didn\u2019t want to say, events she didn\u2019t want to remember. There is much that she still does not want shared with her family. In August 2018, Wistrich and the barrister Claire Wade QC submitted their application for permission to appeal Fri\u2019s conviction. They argued that having received the psychiatric assessments, there was now fresh evidence to show that at the time of the offence, Fri was suffering from both PTSD and mild depressive disorder. These conditions would have impaired her self-control and contributed to a dissociative state, also known as \u201ctraumatic amnesia\u201d, which explained why Fri was not able to explain or remember the moment of the stabbing itself, or to know which knife she had used immediately afterwards. After years of abuse, they argued, Kyle\u2019s aggression and the action of putting his hands around her neck would have acted as a trigger to the loss of control. As a consequence, the partial defences of diminished responsibility and loss of control could now be deployed. In February this year, the court of appeal responded. Mr Justice William Davis refused permission to appeal. In nine short paragraphs, he explained his reasoning. He sympathised with the original legal team who had not sought medical evidence because \u201cnothing was said by the applicant which suggested that the partial defence of diminished responsibility might be available\u201d. Wistrich\u2019s new arguments for the defence of diminished responsibility were dismissed because \u201cthe applicant did not raise the relevant factual matters before or at the time of the trial\u201d. Similarly, he noted that Wistrich was only able to offer a loss of control defence now because of new evidence that Fri hadn\u2019t previously disclosed. He concluded: \u201cThe onus was on her to be full and frank in her instructions at that time.\u201d The onus was on her. Fri, it seemed, had not told the right story to the right people at the right time; she had not performed as she should have done. The note of disbelief is hard to avoid in the judge\u2019s remarks: why hadn\u2019t she told anyone before, when it mattered? Why should anyone trust her now? * * * One of Wistrich\u2019s earlier cases was that of Sally Challen. In 2010, Challen was convicted of the murder of her abusive husband, Richard. Wistrich went on to win Challen\u2019s appeal on the grounds of diminished responsibility \u2013 and, in a momentous victory, a judge announced in June 2019 that Challen would not have to face a retrial. Her conviction had been downgraded to manslaughter, the nine years she\u2019d already served in prison were deemed sufficient punishment and she was able to walk free. Challen\u2019s case heightened public awareness of a form of domestic abuse now known as coercive control. Although Richard was violent towards Sally early on in their relationship, his abuse mostly manifested itself in the obsessive control he took over almost every aspect of her existence \u2013 money, social life, self-perception. In 2015, the Serious Crime Act made coercive control an offence in its own right. England and Wales were the first countries in the world to introduce such a law, and only Ireland and Scotland have so far followed suit. (Tasmania and France have laws related to psychological abuse.) Coercive control is defined as a pattern of acts, including assault, threats, monitoring and intimidation designed to frighten and punish the victim and isolate them from family and friends. Since 2015, it has become more widely recognised \u2013 the subject of storylines on The Archers and Coronation Street. In early October, during a debate in parliament on the new domestic abuse bill, Labour MP Rosie Duffield\u2019s account of her own experience of coercive control moved many MPs to tears. According to Evan Stark, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University in New Jersey who invented the term, coercive control should be seen as a form of \u201cintimate terrorism\u201d, analogous to being held hostage or kidnapped. Instead of measuring the suffering of women in broken bones, he believes the experience of coercive control is better understood as like living under a tyrannical regime. Often, as in Fri\u2019s case, violence is used to enforce the system of control. \u201cIt is just one of the many bits of the toolkit the abuser can use,\u201d Marianne Hester, a professor in gender violence at Bristol University, told me. Framed in this way, the crime of domestic abuse could be defined as one of long-term liberty deprivation, rather than a series of individual violent episodes. In cases where a woman has killed their abuser, Stark believes that lawyers should be able to use a \u201cliberty defence\u201d rather than a psychiatric one. \u201cIf a hostage kills their captor, that\u2019s considered self-defence,\u201d Stark told me. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to charge them with homicide.\u201d For now, being a victim of domestic abuse does not in itself constitute a defence in court. The Prison Reform Trust is currently calling for a new statutory defence to be added to the domestic abuse bill for those whose offending was driven by their experience of domestic abuse. But in the meantime, in Challen\u2019s case, the lawyers won her appeal on the grounds that she was not in her right mind when she repeatedly battered Richard with a hammer. \u201cMy crime was a result of 40 years of coercive control which was not recognised in my original trial,\u201d Challen told me. \u201cThe limitations in the criminal justice system\u2019s understanding of coercive control meant my mental health [was the] primary route to appeal.\u201d Challen\u2019s victory was significant \u2013 the judge at least recognised the impact of abuse on her mental state. But it was not enough that Richard had deprived her of her freedom for decades; to secure justice, Challen had to be seen as mentally ill. Wistrich will make the same argument on behalf of Fri and hope that a judge is similarly understanding. But we are still a long way from recognising the retaliation of an abused woman as a desperate bid to escape, rather than an act of murderous insanity. There is much that marks Sally Challen and Fri Martin apart: age, race, class, geography. Challen lived in a \u00a31m house in Claygate, Surrey; Richard owned a car dealership and drove a Ferrari. Fri lived in a council house in Liverpool, Kyle was unemployed. But there are similarities. Kyle, like Richard, tried to control his partner\u2019s life; he hurt and humiliated her over many years. Both women were trapped, physically and mentally. Both took their partners\u2019 lives. Both were found guilty of murder. One of them is now free. * * * Fri\u2019s family knows that she has to be punished for what she did. A life was taken. Time is being served, as it must be. But they do not accept that she is a murderer. There was no plotting or intent, they say. There was fear and panic. At present, they are waiting for the date of a hearing in which Wistrich and Wade will again argue for Fri\u2019s permission to appeal, this time to a panel of three judges. If they win, and go on to win an appeal, the family hopes that a retrial might find Fri guilty of manslaughter and that a new sentence would reflect the time she has already spent in prison. Perhaps she, too, could be free. A verdict can be rewritten, but Fri\u2019s life can\u2019t be. Nor can Kyle\u2019s, or the lives of their children, their families. As Cody Rowson told me: \u201cWe were all losing someone.\u201d Steve Cassidy once described the effect of it all \u2013 the killing, the case, Fri\u2019s imprisonment \u2013 as being like a waterfall: \u201cIt just keeps on going.\u201d Fri\u2019s family struggle with the guilt of not knowing about the abuse she suffered until the trial. They can\u2019t help going over and over what they now realise were clues. All those excuses, the bruises, the evasiveness. It\u2019s so obvious, in retrospect. Ishmael didn\u2019t get to see Fri as much as he\u2019d like \u2013 he worked hard, had two young children of his own. One time, he drove past her house and thought he\u2019d see if she was in. When he knocked on the door, he thought he saw a curtain move upstairs. He couldn\u2019t be sure, thought he must have imagined it, and drove away again. He can\u2019t stop thinking about that curtain. Recently, Fri was moved from Styal to a prison near Durham. If the traffic is bad, it can take four hours to get there from Liverpool. It\u2019s harder for her family to visit now. When Cassidy goes, they talk about the children, never about what happened. The kids visit, too; they think their mum lives in a castle like a princess. When Ishmael goes, he tries to keep the tone light. As the oldest brother, he feels a responsibility to keep everyone on track, positive. He tries to keep Fri focused on the future. When she\u2019s out, he\u2019s going to set her up to work with him. But he knows that when she does come out, she won\u2019t be the same. Already, she\u2019s not the same. When Ishmael told me about leaving his sister in prison, the sadness seemed to wind him. He couldn\u2019t speak, bumped his fist against his chest as if to dislodge something. He exhaled loudly through puffed cheeks, jerked his head from side to side, cleared his throat. It was like he was trying to get rid of it, the sadness, as though it were a sickness he was trying to shake off. Ishmael\u2019s a big guy, works in security. He doesn\u2019t often cry. * * * Back in the spring of 2015, just before he delivered the precise terms of her life sentence, Mr Justice Dove said he didn\u2019t think Fri was a wicked or violent person. \u201cYou were a loving (and still will remain, I have no doubt, a loving) and conscientious mother,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd you are going to have to live with the consequences of having killed the person who was your childhood sweetheart, the father of your children and someone who, I have no doubt, you still loved at the time when you took his life.\u201d Fri still loves Kyle now. It\u2019s hard for her family to understand. \u201cLove is a strange thing,\u201d said Ishmael, shaking his head. Many people struggle to comprehend when a victim of abuse still professes to love their abuser. How can you love someone who\u2019s hurting you? Why don\u2019t you leave? It\u2019s like a hostage falling for their captor, Prof Hester told me: \u201cIn the end, you become so bound up with the person who is defining everything about your being, that you end up not having a being outside of them.\u201d Evan Stark pointed out that there is no incompatibility between hate and love: the two coexist in relationships all the time. So do violence and love, as strange and awful as it may seem. In such cases, the definition of love is stretched beyond any conventional understanding. But relationships like Fri\u2019s don\u2019t tend to start abusively: \u201cYou don\u2019t go out with someone who punches you in the face on the first date,\u201d said Fiona Dwyer, chief executive of Solace Women\u2019s Aid. Women sometimes don\u2019t recognise they are in an abusive relationship until they are too enmeshed in it to escape. By then, the consequences of leaving can feel too dangerous, and they are trapped. Steve Cassidy has a plastic bag full of documents related to Fri\u2019s case. Sitting in her brother Marcus\u2019s flat one afternoon, he pulled out a letter Fri had written to Kyle from prison. He passed it to Fri\u2019s father, Leroy, who tried to read it but couldn\u2019t get to the end. Leroy passed it on to me. The letter was written in Fri\u2019s neat, round handwriting on a sheet of lined paper. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d it began, \u201cit just all happened so fast. I tried to protect myself and this is how it\u2019s ended up.\u201d Fri went on to say how sorry she was for what had happened and told Kyle she\u2019d always love him. \u201cUntil we meet again,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRest in paradise, my man, my true love, my Kyle John Farrell.\u201d At the end, she\u2019d drawn a small heart and coloured it in with black biro. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

As well as extending children\u2019s sense of urban ownership, his fence-free compounds encouraged a more relaxed attitude to risk.

      "bodyText": "In the decades after the second world war, the celebrated architect Aldo van Eyck designed more than 700 playgrounds in Amsterdam, filling bomb sites with dazzling constellations of tumbling bars, leapfrog posts and climbing domes. His idea was that by providing children with a range of elemental forms and open-ended structures \u2013 rather than swings, roundabouts and other playground staples \u2013 their creativity would be stimulated and they would invent new games. These \u201ctools for the imagination\u201d, as he called his kit of sandpits, frames and posts, became a familiar part of Amsterdam\u2019s streetscape, a connected galaxy of playtime fragments that spread across the city, from public spaces and even to roadside verges, never fenced off. It was a vision of play without walls, the protected domain of the child thrown open and spilling over into the rest of the city. Van Eyck\u2019s pioneering work is one of the highlights of Play Well, a new exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London. This fun, candy-coloured romp through the transformative power of play is nothing if not wide-ranging: it explores the work of Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel, inventor the kindergarten; the role of ad-hoc \u201cplay labs\u201d set up by humanitarian organisations in refugee camps; and the rarefied realm of adult larping, or live-action role-playing, for those who wish it was Halloween every day \u2013 from battle re-enactors to bonnet-wearing Jane Austen superfans. For Van Eyck, the playground was the place where the child could be \u201clord of the city\u201d. As well as extending children\u2019s sense of urban ownership, his fence-free compounds encouraged a more relaxed attitude to risk. Some were even located on the central reservations of roads \u2013 forcing children and cars to be more aware of each other, making the city feel like a more equal, accessible place. Van Eyck\u2019s work was lauded by architects and psychologists, but the idea of kids freed from fences set alarm bells ringing among the health and safety lobby in more conservative parts of the world, and his ideas were rarely repeated elsewhere. This sense of owning the streets is also captured in the postwar photography of Bert Hardy, Nigel Henderson and Shirley Baker, displayed alongside Van Eyck\u2019s designs. Their striking black-and-white images depict a bygone era of kids playing outside, using whatever scraps they could find, very much lords of the city with their catapults and toy guns at the ready. There\u2019s an air of anarchy, one that children\u2019s rights activist Lady Marjory Allen encouraged in her promotion of junk playgrounds around the same time. These were later rebranded as adventure playgrounds to make the idea more palatable to nervous parents and local authorities. \u201cChildren are needlessly overprotected by adults,\u201d she says in a film from the 1970s. \u201cThey\u2019re never given any freedom to explore and experiment and find out what the world is all about.\u201d The camera then cuts to kids rampaging around one of her wild playgrounds, full of scavenged junk and firepits. \u201cHere, they can play with very dangerous tools,\u201d she says proudly, in a cut-glass accent. \u201cThey can create their own houses, their own climbing frames.

The legions of the dead have come together for an annual Halloween night parade that will be watched by thousands of costumed revellers. But this isn\u2019t the US \u2013 a country most people consider to be the Halloween mothership \u2013 this is Derry, Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The Derry Halloween festival started small in the mid-80s as a fancy dress disco in a pub. Now it has snowballed into a massive four-day event, with more than 120,000 people attending in 2018 \u2013 double the number from 2016. On Halloween night itself, there were 45,000 people watching the parade and fireworks. The sheer size of the extravaganza hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed across the pond either, with <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2015/10/19/10best-readers-choice-halloween-winners/74211116/\">USA Today</a> crowning it the world\u2019s best Halloween destination in 2015.

Aeidin McCarter, head of culture at Derry City and Strabane district council calls it the \u201cfestival of the people\u201d. It attracts people of all ages and everybody dresses up. You look strange if you don\u2019t, she says.</p> <p>\u201cIn most other organised festivals, you are bringing something to the people, but this is the people bringing something to the world,\u201d McCarter says. \u201cHalloween is to Derry what carnival is to Rio or what new year is to Edinburgh. Instead of Christmas stuff, supermarket aisles are full of Halloween merchandise. There are pop-up shops that have been open for the last three weeks selling purely Halloween things. People plan their costumes at least a year in advance. Even local people who have left the city come back. In the same way that people come back for Christmas, people from Derry come back for Halloween.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"415946528c038ada29d2c32a995c7d16fe93d9fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415946528c038ada29d2c32a995c7d16fe93d9fa/0_0_5148_3560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, Manhattan, New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, Manhattan, New York</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonia Moskowitz/Globe Photos via Zuma/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Revellers at a Halloween parade in Greenwich Village, New York City</p></li> </ul> <p>Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/oct/24/derry-halloween-europe-largest-carnival-of-frights-fireworks-parades\">connection with All Hallow</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/oct/24/derry-halloween-europe-largest-carnival-of-frights-fireworks-parades\">s\u2019 Eve</a> dates back millennia to the Celtic festival of Samhain when spirits were believed to walk the Earth before the new year began on 1 November.

The legions of the dead have come together for an annual Halloween night parade that will be watched by thousands of costumed revellers. But this isn\u2019t the US \u2013 a country most people consider to be the Halloween mothership \u2013 this is Derry, Northern Ireland. The Derry Halloween festival started small in the mid-80s as a fancy dress disco in a pub. Now it has snowballed into a massive four-day event, with more than 120,000 people attending in 2018 \u2013 double the number from 2016. On Halloween night itself, there were 45,000 people watching the parade and fireworks. The sheer size of the extravaganza hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed across the pond either, with USA Today crowning it the world\u2019s best Halloween destination in 2015. So is it safe to say Derry is the capital of Halloween? Or are there other cities that go even further? The Derry Halloween festival is a huge four-day event While 23% of revellers attending the Derry festival are travelling there from outside Northern Ireland, organisers claim its growth in popularity has more to do with local enthusiasm than clever marketing. Aeidin McCarter, head of culture at Derry City and Strabane district council calls it the \u201cfestival of the people\u201d. It attracts people of all ages and everybody dresses up. You look strange if you don\u2019t, she says. \u201cIn most other organised festivals, you are bringing something to the people, but this is the people bringing something to the world,\u201d McCarter says. \u201cHalloween is to Derry what carnival is to Rio or what new year is to Edinburgh. Instead of Christmas stuff, supermarket aisles are full of Halloween merchandise. There are pop-up shops that have been open for the last three weeks selling purely Halloween things. People plan their costumes at least a year in advance. Even local people who have left the city come back. In the same way that people come back for Christmas, people from Derry come back for Halloween.\u201d Revellers at a Halloween parade in Greenwich Village, New York City Ireland\u2019s connection with All Hallows\u2019 Eve dates back millennia to the Celtic festival of Samhain when spirits were believed to walk the Earth before the new year began on 1 November. It is thought the ancient tradition was first introduced to the US by Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine of the mid-19th century. Undoubtedly, Americans have turned what was once a religious rite into a secular spectacular. A terrifying 68% of people will celebrate Halloween, with the average household in the US spending $86.27 (\u00a367) on the festival, adding up to a whopping nationwide total spend of $8.8bn. That\u2019s a lot of treats. Speaking of which, it\u2019s estimated that more than 41 million children aged five to 14 will go trick or treating in 2019 and $2.1bn will be spent buying sweets to give away on the night. Halloween is so lucrative for the country that the Halloween and Costume Association is petitioning the government to extend the celebration to include an additional day of freakish fun on the weekend after 31 October. So which city in this Halloween-mad nation deserves the title of pumpkin king? After taking into account factors such as trick or treat friendliness, general fun and even the average weather forecast, website WalletHub did the maths and ranked New York City number one and Los Angeles a close second as the most spook-tacular places to enjoy the annual frightfest. Halloween parades take place in Los Angeles and New York City One of the most popular activities to do during Halloween is to attend a party or parade and both the top cities boast some of the biggest shindigs around. The largest event in New York City is the Village Halloween Parade on the evening of 31 October. About 60,000 revellers will join in the costumed march up 6th Avenue to 16th Street, while an estimated 2 million people watch it. \u201cIt\u2019s full of the energy and creativity of NYC,\u201d says Jeanne Fleming, artistic and producing director of New York\u2019s Village Halloween Parade. \u201cThe parade is a folk art phenomenon \u2026 it often reflects the zeitgeist of what is happening in the world and then all the individuals take that on. Its energy derives from its state of constant change and renewal with the underpinnings of ancient ritual.\u201d Over on the west coast, 500,000 partygoers take part in the West Hollywood Halloween carnival, which proudly celebrates its LGBT community with a mix of theatrical performers, over-the-top costumes and bawdy drag queens. West Hollywood also tops the US for most Halloween Instagram shares, based on hashtags and mentions. And with 17% of Americans claiming they dress their pets up for the occasion, the city of angels also plays host to several canine costume parades. Their owners, meanwhile, could take inspiration from this year\u2019s Google data, which reveals some of the most searched-for outfits in the US.

      "bodyText": "In January 2018, a terrified 18-year-old Vietnamese man walked into a police station in London and told police that he had spent five years being trafficked in and out of cannabis houses by criminal gangs across the capital. In halting English, he tried to explain how he had been taken from Vietnam, travelling overland across Europe, before being put in the back of a refrigerated lorry in France and brought to the UK to work in cannabis cultivation, he says. Yet instead of interviewing him as a potential victim of modern slavery, the police called the Home Office, his lawyers say. He was then detained under immigration powers and taken to Brook House immigration removal centre where he remained until lawyers from Duncan Lewis managed to get him released. The man, known as KQT in legal documents, has now launched legal action in the high court against the Metropolitan police for their failure in the legal duty of care to potential victims under the 2015 Modern Slavery Act. The Met police said that it would be defending the claim, adding that it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further. But Ahmed Aydeed, the lawyer from Duncan Lewis who is representing KQT in his civil compensation claim, says his client\u2019s case is one of many where the police have treated those reporting modern slavery as criminals instead of victims. \u201cThe police are asking victims to come forward and report their exploitation,\u201d Aydeed said. \u201cBut what this case, and many other cases we have worked on, shows is that the police\u2019s policy of reporting undocumented migrants to the Home Office helps traffickers and smugglers remain immune from prosecution.\u201d After 39 people were found dead in a refrigerated trailer in Essex last week, it quickly became clear that people like KQT could be of crucial importance to the investigation.

Under new guidance issued in 2018, it is police policy to share information with the Home Office if they believe a victim of crime could be an illegal immigrant. \u201cThis shows a central conflict in the police\u2019s approach to fighting modern slavery,\u201d says Aydeed. Despite the 2015 Modern Slavery Act stipulating that anyone found in modern slavery should be considered a victim and not a criminal, trafficking victims can end up being detained under immigration powers, with one piece of research this year finding more than 500 were in detention facilities in 2018.

      "body": "<p>Before we all charge off into the electoral unknown, let us remember some realities that are at risk of being left behind in the rush. In the 30 years before 2010, no British general election produced a hung parliament. In the nine years since 2010, two have done so. Nothing about this is predictive for 12 December. But it is clearly within the bounds of possibility that there could be a third hung parliament \u2013 and a fourth Conservative government in this decade without an overall majority.</p> <p>\u201cSingle-party government is the British norm,\u201d wrote the political scientist David Butler in a 1978 book, <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.co.uk/products/isbn/9780333235669/22893317503&amp;cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-PLP8\" title=\"\">Coalitions in British Politics</a>, that presciently considered what might happen if that norm were ever to change. Forty years on, change has come. In this election at least seven British parties, and three more in Northern Ireland, could win seats. So the new norm could easily continue, recur or perhaps even become more entrenched.</p> <p>It is not as if multiparty politics is from Mars. Coalitions or minority governments are commonplace in Europe. They exist closer to home too: in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish devolved institutions, and in more than a quarter of English local authorities. Different electoral systems contribute to this, but these are emphatically not the only explanation. We live in a Britain of disintegrating and lighter political loyalties.</p> <p>As a result, single-party British government has been in eclipse. But the majoritarian culture that goes with it is alive and well, and living in Westminster. Listening to the parties this week, you would never suppose that we were living in more fragmented political times than in the past. The calling of the election has triggered an outburst of denialism across the political spectrum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cc386e96181785c85b97ef35246e9f70ea7b0aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cc386e96181785c85b97ef35246e9f70ea7b0aa/0_164_4840_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Salmond made compromise work in Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Salmond made compromise work in Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tories are not alone in dreaming of the return of the old norm. Labour is gripped by the same fantasy. \u201cThere will be no deals, no coalition,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50230931\" title=\"\">John McDonnell said yesterday</a>. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win an overall majority, we will have a minority government.\u201d If parliament won\u2019t back Labour\u2019s measures \u201cwe will go back to the people\u201d. Even the Liberal Democrats are running on the basis that they will \u201cwin by ourselves\u201d. They can\u2019t all be right. But they could all be wrong. If they are not thinking about a hung parliament, they are letting the electorate and themselves down.</p> <p>McDonnell is nobody\u2019s fool, but one is forced to ask where he has been for the last decade.

      "bodyText": "Before we all charge off into the electoral unknown, let us remember some realities that are at risk of being left behind in the rush. In the 30 years before 2010, no British general election produced a hung parliament. In the nine years since 2010, two have done so. Nothing about this is predictive for 12 December. But it is clearly within the bounds of possibility that there could be a third hung parliament \u2013 and a fourth Conservative government in this decade without an overall majority. \u201cSingle-party government is the British norm,\u201d wrote the political scientist David Butler in a 1978 book, Coalitions in British Politics, that presciently considered what might happen if that norm were ever to change. Forty years on, change has come. In this election at least seven British parties, and three more in Northern Ireland, could win seats. So the new norm could easily continue, recur or perhaps even become more entrenched. It is not as if multiparty politics is from Mars. Coalitions or minority governments are commonplace in Europe. They exist closer to home too: in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish devolved institutions, and in more than a quarter of English local authorities. Different electoral systems contribute to this, but these are emphatically not the only explanation. We live in a Britain of disintegrating and lighter political loyalties. As a result, single-party British government has been in eclipse. But the majoritarian culture that goes with it is alive and well, and living in Westminster. Listening to the parties this week, you would never suppose that we were living in more fragmented political times than in the past. The calling of the election has triggered an outburst of denialism across the political spectrum. The Tories are not alone in dreaming of the return of the old norm. Labour is gripped by the same fantasy. \u201cThere will be no deals, no coalition,\u201d John McDonnell said yesterday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win an overall majority, we will have a minority government.\u201d If parliament won\u2019t back Labour\u2019s measures \u201cwe will go back to the people\u201d. Even the Liberal Democrats are running on the basis that they will \u201cwin by ourselves\u201d. They can\u2019t all be right. But they could all be wrong. If they are not thinking about a hung parliament, they are letting the electorate and themselves down. McDonnell is nobody\u2019s fool, but one is forced to ask where he has been for the last decade. As Boris Johnson has just discovered, an ambitious minority government can quickly become unsustainable. Not only can you not get your bills through the House of Commons, but going \u201cback to the people\u201d can be harder than you might want too.

Yet this put-upon bird is anything but a Darwinian dead end, being a successful and widespread species \u2013 and far tougher than its delicate appearance suggests, enduring in some of our harshest landscapes. Welcome companions of hikers in all weathers, they can feel like the only birdlife around on a squally autumn day such as this. Their staccato calls follow me back down to the river and out to the edge of the moor.",

In 2019, there are apps aplenty, decked with snazzy algorithms, GPS trackers and \u201conline now\u201d buttons to help people find the hottest \u2013 and nearest \u2013 version of love in a heartbeat. Why revert to a plain text and longer wait times when you can find the most available person right here, right now?</p> <p>But there clearly is an appetite for it. So much, in fact, that when 39-year-old Kelly Rakowski first set up an online document asking people to send in submissions for a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_personals_/\">personal ads page</a>, she was overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cIt really snowballed. At first I got a couple dozen, then all of a sudden I was getting maybe 500 submissions every two days,\u201d says Rakowski.</p> <p>Her page became so popular she had to bring on interns to help her manage the stream of submissions. Now it has met the fate of anything that gets popular on the internet: after nearly $50,000 worth of donations through Kickstarter, Rakowski is making an app.</p> <p>She attributes the attention to people being hungry to find more genuine connections online \u2013 something that isn\u2019t fostered by conventional dating apps where people \u201cjust throw out a selfie and maybe a cute emoji, but don\u2019t really get to know much about the person\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4IteXogohY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

They muster up the courage to send out their write-up, and then it\u2019s a waiting game: ads can take up to five weeks to be sent out, plus waiting time for responses.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sincere process. You\u2019re more vulnerable and people are really responding to that,\u201d says Rakowski.</p> <p>For 26-year-old Marisa Rosa Grant, who has already posted two successful personal ads on the queer persons of color (QPOC) personals <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/qpocpersonals/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>, the appeal is that people might actually talk to her off the back of a personal ad.</p> <p>She spent a long time on dating apps before turning to personals, and had a hard time getting any responses \u2013 something she largely suspects is to do with being black and queer.</p> <p>Evidence suggests she is probably right. As with all markets, in the online dating world there are clear winners and losers \u2013 and black women get a particularly rough deal. Black women are the <a href=\"https://theblog.okcupid.com/race-and-attraction-2009-2014-107dcbb4f060\">least likely to be messaged</a> on some dating apps, and research shows <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article219361075.html\">a white person is </a><a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article219361075.html\">10 times less likely to send a message to a black person</a> online than vice versa.</p> <p>Apps themselves are partly to blame for this. Some, such as Grindr and Hinge, allow people to filter who they see by race.</p> <p>Add to that the fact that hardly any apps exist solely for gay women, or people who are gender-queer or trans, and you can see why normal dating apps are a hostile environment for queer women of color.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RedYenta/status/1183456157819723776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/damnimredyenta1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@damnimredyenta1</a> <br>Chicago<br><br>Marxist Leninist, bisexual nonmonogamous cis woman.<br>I&#39;m brown, I&#39;m cute, I read, I organize.

Of course we all care about how people look \u2013 it\u2019s a key part of relationships \u2013 but we\u2019re saying it\u2019s not the only part.\u201d</p> <p>The format encourages openness because you read first and look later. If a person\u2019s bio sings to you, there\u2019s the chance physical attributes will be overlooked, or that people may end up going for someone they wouldn\u2019t normally see themselves with.</p> <p>For Grant, that has been hugely helpful. Grant\u2019s advert reads: \u201cI\u2019m a black lesbian from Toronto looking for friends, makeouts and cuddles for when I visit Brooklyn for biz! I love to eat, dance party and make art &amp; love ;) Let\u2019s meet? Show me around!\u201d Since she posted it, she has had about 30 responses \u2013 a huge markup on what she would get on a normal dating app.</p> <p>\u201cI think the difference is that when someone sees your personal and messages you, you know that they actually took time to read it,\u201d says Grant. \u201cI feel like it gives people more of a chance, especially people of color.\u201d</p> <p>Grant describes herself as gender non-conforming, which doesn\u2019t translate easily to most apps, where many people make the decision of whether to talk further based on one photo.</p> <p>\u201cMy gender is so fluid that I might present more feminine in one photo, or completely masculine in another \u2013 people might look at one photo and think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a bit masculine, I\u2019m not into that\u2019,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Personal dating ads are less prescriptive. When someone writes their own advert, they don\u2019t have to tick a box for gender, they can use what pronouns they like and they don\u2019t have to say whether they only like men or women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/29/the-intimacy-secret-how-to-have-fantastic-sex-after-decades-together\">The intimacy secret: how to have fantastic sex after decades together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also allows people to take control over the parts of them that are judged. For example, many ads use the word \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cfatty\u201d in a celebratory rather than a degrading way \u2013 a far cry from the fat-shaming of some apps. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be judged on their weight, they don\u2019t have to mention it at all.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting exercise for people to have to describe themselves in just a few words and get information about themselves across really fast,\u201d says Marissa Brostoff of Red Yenta.</p> <p>For Brostoff and Isser, the entire process of writing a personal ad is an act of revolution. Brostoff says: \u201cThere is something exciting about the fact that we don\u2019t need the dating apparatus [that is currently in place] just to meet each other. It\u2019s really the most technologically simple thing you could do, and yet it works. That\u2019s empowering.\u201d</p> <p>Politics aside, there is, of course, a voyeuristic element to personal ads\u2019 popularity. When you go on a personals page, whether or not you intend to participate, you already are just by reading them. And it feels naughty \u2013 like looking through someone\u2019s love letters.</p> <p>Grant describes it as a rare bit of sunshine in an otherwise gloomy social media landscape.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a place where you know that whatever people post, it\u2019s always positive, because they\u2019re just looking for company,\u201d she says.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 31 October 2019 to correct a misattributed quote. </p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "In 2019, there seems to be a hankering for nostalgic things. Young people love knitting, children are asking for record players for Christmas, and presidents have gone back to the good, old-fashioned business of building walls. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be surprised, then, that the old-school personal dating ad is also making a comeback. You may know the format: short, candid bios written by people looking for love, displayed in public places such as newspapers. Today, of course, they appear on Instagram and Twitter rather than at the back of the morning paper. They gesture towards simplicity, with adverts displayed in typewriter text on plain backgrounds, no photo necessary. But they have the sort of cult-like following only social media can amass. On Instagram, one LGBTQIA+ personals page has over 60,000 followers, and posts multiple ads a day. Pared-back pages, such as the Red Yenta personals page on Twitter (which helps socialists find politically like-minded lovers), get submissions from across the world, and a personals page for queer people of color is also flourishing online. Something about this seems antithetical to the 2.0 version of dating that many millennials have grown up with. In 2019, there are apps aplenty, decked with snazzy algorithms, GPS trackers and \u201conline now\u201d buttons to help people find the hottest \u2013 and nearest \u2013 version of love in a heartbeat. Why revert to a plain text and longer wait times when you can find the most available person right here, right now? But there clearly is an appetite for it. So much, in fact, that when 39-year-old Kelly Rakowski first set up an online document asking people to send in submissions for a personal ads page, she was overwhelmed. \u201cIt really snowballed. At first I got a couple dozen, then all of a sudden I was getting maybe 500 submissions every two days,\u201d says Rakowski. Her page became so popular she had to bring on interns to help her manage the stream of submissions. Now it has met the fate of anything that gets popular on the internet: after nearly $50,000 worth of donations through Kickstarter, Rakowski is making an app. She attributes the attention to people being hungry to find more genuine connections online \u2013 something that isn\u2019t fostered by conventional dating apps where people \u201cjust throw out a selfie and maybe a cute emoji, but don\u2019t really get to know much about the person\u201d. Modern-day apps function more like slot machines than matchmakers: it turns out looking through photos and swiping left to right is not only highly addictive, it also rarely results in long-lasting relationships. Writing up a description of yourself and posting it online, on the other hand, slows down the process of dating completely. First, it forces people to sit down and think about who they are and what they desire. They muster up the courage to send out their write-up, and then it\u2019s a waiting game: ads can take up to five weeks to be sent out, plus waiting time for responses. \u201cIt\u2019s a sincere process. You\u2019re more vulnerable and people are really responding to that,\u201d says Rakowski. For 26-year-old Marisa Rosa Grant, who has already posted two successful personal ads on the queer persons of color (QPOC) personals Instagram, the appeal is that people might actually talk to her off the back of a personal ad. She spent a long time on dating apps before turning to personals, and had a hard time getting any responses \u2013 something she largely suspects is to do with being black and queer. Evidence suggests she is probably right. As with all markets, in the online dating world there are clear winners and losers \u2013 and black women get a particularly rough deal. Black women are the least likely to be messaged on some dating apps, and research shows a white person is 10 times less likely to send a message to a black person online than vice versa. Apps themselves are partly to blame for this. Some, such as Grindr and Hinge, allow people to filter who they see by race. Add to that the fact that hardly any apps exist solely for gay women, or people who are gender-queer or trans, and you can see why normal dating apps are a hostile environment for queer women of color. The revival of personal ads represents a rejection of the meat-market mentality of traditional dating platforms, because the focus of the advert is personality. Mindy Isser, who co-founded Red Yenta, the dating platform for socialists, says: \u201cIt\u2019s not the photo that\u2019s drawing you in, that\u2019s the key distinction. Of course we all care about how people look \u2013 it\u2019s a key part of relationships \u2013 but we\u2019re saying it\u2019s not the only part.\u201d The format encourages openness because you read first and look later. If a person\u2019s bio sings to you, there\u2019s the chance physical attributes will be overlooked, or that people may end up going for someone they wouldn\u2019t normally see themselves with. For Grant, that has been hugely helpful. Grant\u2019s advert reads: \u201cI\u2019m a black lesbian from Toronto looking for friends, makeouts and cuddles for when I visit Brooklyn for biz! I love to eat, dance party and make art &amp; love ;) Let\u2019s meet? Show me around!\u201d Since she posted it, she has had about 30 responses \u2013 a huge markup on what she would get on a normal dating app. \u201cI think the difference is that when someone sees your personal and messages you, you know that they actually took time to read it,\u201d says Grant. \u201cI feel like it gives people more of a chance, especially people of color.\u201d Grant describes herself as gender non-conforming, which doesn\u2019t translate easily to most apps, where many people make the decision of whether to talk further based on one photo. \u201cMy gender is so fluid that I might present more feminine in one photo, or completely masculine in another \u2013 people might look at one photo and think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a bit masculine, I\u2019m not into that\u2019,\u201d she says. Personal dating ads are less prescriptive. When someone writes their own advert, they don\u2019t have to tick a box for gender, they can use what pronouns they like and they don\u2019t have to say whether they only like men or women. It also allows people to take control over the parts of them that are judged. For example, many ads use the word \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cfatty\u201d in a celebratory rather than a degrading way \u2013 a far cry from the fat-shaming of some apps. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be judged on their weight, they don\u2019t have to mention it at all. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting exercise for people to have to describe themselves in just a few words and get information about themselves across really fast,\u201d says Marissa Brostoff of Red Yenta. For Brostoff and Isser, the entire process of writing a personal ad is an act of revolution. Brostoff says: \u201cThere is something exciting about the fact that we don\u2019t need the dating apparatus [that is currently in place] just to meet each other. It\u2019s really the most technologically simple thing you could do, and yet it works. That\u2019s empowering.\u201d Politics aside, there is, of course, a voyeuristic element to personal ads\u2019 popularity. When you go on a personals page, whether or not you intend to participate, you already are just by reading them. And it feels naughty \u2013 like looking through someone\u2019s love letters. Grant describes it as a rare bit of sunshine in an otherwise gloomy social media landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a place where you know that whatever people post, it\u2019s always positive, because they\u2019re just looking for company,\u201d she says.

I still remember a suitably childlike awe at the size of the room and my glee when the film began with a glittering dance sequence. The occasion was my older brother\u2019s seventh birthday and naturally he had chosen the film. Like any self-respecting seven-year-old in the mid-1980s, he wanted to see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. So my first big-screen movie was a supposedly family-friendly film that features ritual sacrifice and pits of fire as well as a banquet of baby snakes, monkey brains and eyeball soup \u2013 not to mention the scene in which a man\u2019s heart is ripped, still beating, from his chest.</p> <p>Overimaginative at the best of times, my tiny brain was overwhelmed by each new horror, and I was terrorstruck by the thought of what gore might spurt next. I even squirmed 180 degrees in my seat, only to see the adult next to me averting his eyes too. Subsequently, Temple of Doom was heavily criticized for its dark and offensive imagery, but it was too late for five-year-old me. To this day, I feel a frisson of nervousness as the lights go down in the cinema \u2013 the fear that the chorus line will be pushed off the screen by a parade of bloody monstrosities. And yet, I keep going back \u2026 <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Lonely Water</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZWD2sDRESk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xZWD2sDRESk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I wasn\u2019t allowed to see horror movies when I was a little kid, certainly not allowed to stay up late and watch scary films on television, and this was in that ancient pre-internet and pre-VCR era when it was physically impossible to get your hands on them covertly. So I was shocked \u2013 really shocked \u2013 by the public information films on safety which reached out of the TV screen around teatime and punched you in the face, about the same time of day as Jackanory or Hector\u2019s House. This one is a classic, Lonely Water from 1973, sometimes called Dark And Lonely Water (although no title appears). It was commissioned by the government\u2019s Central Office of Information (COI) in response to an increase in child drowning accidents: written and produced by the COI official Christine Harmon and directed by Jeff Grant, who <a href=\"https://besonian.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/dark-and-lonely-water/\">blogged</a> about his experience.</p> <p>Lonely Water is brutally addressed to children, not to the adults who are supposed to be taking care of them. A dark, hooded figure appears to be walking on the dangerous stretches of water, looming up behind the kids, with Donald Pleasence doing the creepy narration. Like so many chillingly contemptuous teachers that I remember from those days, this Angel Of Death sneers knowingly at the \u201cshowoffs\u201d who mess about near water and fall in and drown, and also at the simply \u201cunwary\u201d who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. The dark cloaked figure appears disturbingly behind them, as if walking on the misty water itself. Lonely Water is often compared to the beginning of Nicolas Roeg\u2019s Don\u2019t Look Now (and it is eerily similar) and Pleasence might bring to mind John Carpenter\u2019s Halloween from 1978, in which he starred. But for me the film-maker who most comes to mind is Peter Watkins, who made the chilling The War Game and Punishment Park: film-making with a clinically icy establishment voice whose clear, cruel purpose is to disturb. <em>PB</em></p> <h2>Freddy vs Jason</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"066f2abe65b3da6a45211ef423610b9249bdcc8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/066f2abe65b3da6a45211ef423610b9249bdcc8c/0_25_3027_1817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Scary movies and I have never gotten along. Life is frightful enough.</p> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure I was dragged to see Freddy vs Jason as a kid because my parents did not want to sit through whatever else was out at that time, like<em> </em>Freaky Friday or Uptown Girls. I was eight years old and officially tall enough to ride the cool rollercoasters \u2013 I wanted to prove that I was mature enough to withstand blood and gore. But I still didn\u2019t understand that everything on TV and film was fake. Because how can you fake getting your head chopped off? So imagine my horror when I saw Kelly Rowland of Destiny\u2019s Child, my favorite girl group <em>ever</em>, on the big screen. There she was, pissing off Freddy Kruger by calling him a faggot (Rowland\u2019s release of gay circuit party staples like Commander make up for this uncomfortable moment, in my opinion). And then, BAM! Rowland gets smacked with Jason Voorhees\u2019s machete out of nowhere.</p> <p>I could not fall asleep that night. Kelly Rowland was dead! Destiny\u2019s Child would never make music again. And my mom was no help with my eight-year-old anxieties. She just brushed off my pop music concerns with: \u201cIt\u2019s not real. Go back to bed.\u201d A few months later, I saw Rowland on TV in a live appearance. She was healthy. Her head was still intact. And there were no traces of blood. The world could go on. Every member of Destiny\u2019s Child was still alive. <em>AW</em></p> <h2>The Witches</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c7bb3756444639ded03e3d7ad7f1356241dd76c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c7bb3756444639ded03e3d7ad7f1356241dd76c/0_0_1872_1259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was eight when I first saw Nicolas Roeg\u2019s sadistic adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s The Witches, a horror film for children made with a cruel, adult sensibility. I was at a friend\u2019s house, too embarrassed to admit that I was terrified and too terrified to stop watching, and by the time it was over, I was left with a horrifying new outlook on life. Many of the films that rank among the scariest for children subvert a traditionally harmless character into something monstrous (it\u2019s why Pennywise and Chucky had such a profound effect on so many) and at an age when I still defined women in soft, simplistic terms, I was suddenly made aware that not all of them wanted to coo over me \u2013 some of them might want to kill me instead.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the grandiose unmasking of the witches that stuck, as gruesome as it was, but instead I was haunted by the smaller moments, the scenes when they were still in full disguise, insidiously targeting vulnerable children, overcome with pure hate. There was the witch who trapped a girl in a painting, the witch who tried to lure a boy down from his treehouse with chocolate and a snake, the witch who pushed a pram toward the edge of a cliff \u2013 insidious scenes designed to provoke nightmares and that they did. I remember not sleeping well for months, horrified that they were hiding in my suburban setting, disgusted by my existence, waiting patiently to eradicate me.</p> <p>I was eager to grow up for a number of reasons \u2013 my own money, an escape from my bleak small town, the ability to devour a second and third portion of dessert without restriction \u2013 but the most overwhelming of all was the knowledge that once I turned 18, I\u2019d be safe from the witches. <em>BL</em></p> <h2>The Ring</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"322115ad89d4ae64ecf304afe92f48a009f9567b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/322115ad89d4ae64ecf304afe92f48a009f9567b/0_21_2825_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The first time I saw The Ring I was about 12, and the viewing was basically forced on me during a classroom movie day. Looking back on it now, it\u2019s a pretty quiet, atmospheric film for most of its runtime, but for the entire duration I was scared out of my wits, watching it behind my fingers. What Gore Verbinski does so well in The Ring is imbuing the most mundane objects with menace. I couldn\u2019t look at TVs, chairs, ladders and mirrors for a while without feeling spooked, all because they featured in Samara\u2019s video. It\u2019s weirdly the chair that haunted me for years after: the image of it spinning upside down returns to me occasionally, and the eerie wrongness of it still unsettles me.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a movie that taught me early on about futility, and that kindness is not always repaid: despite finding Samara and giving her a proper burial, Rachel\u2019s man still dies, and her son would have too if she hadn\u2019t made a copy of the tape in order to infect the next person. It\u2019s ultimately a sad film about a very harsh, dog-eat-dog world, and that really bothered me as a kid. <em>GS</em></p> <h2>Patrick</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2kw3K7t7Pg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L2kw3K7t7Pg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As a sensitive, if not to say delicate, child, I always steered well clear of scary films \u2013 still do. But there was a time in my mid-teens \u2013 the early 1980s \u2013 when I felt I should investigate this horror movie thing, and (before the video-nasty scare really took hold) they were often on late-night TV. I managed to get through The Amityville Horror, Alien and Halloween without incident, but the one that really shook me up was an Australian film that I never heard of again until it was remade to little fanfare in 2013.</p> <p>Kicking off with a gruesome scene where the murderous title character chucks an electric fire into a bath containing his mother and her lover, Patrick is a classic spin on the old kill-everyone-with-telekinesis-you-are-sexually-threatened-by trope, popularised by Carrie a couple of years earlier. The main twist here is that, shortly after the electric fire incident, the glassy-eyed teen of the title slips into a coma, and does all his nastiness while lying in a hospital bed. I think it was the fact that he was unconscious the entire time (as well as the very creepy touch of communicating via a possessed typewriter) that really freaked me out. And there\u2019s an amazing final flip-out: I won\u2019t give it away exactly what it is but it\u2019s far worse and shocking than any Hitcher-type unkillable killers. I\u2019m getting worried again just thinking about it. <em>AP</em></p> <h2>Arachnophobia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3443d12aa7ba632ae4ebc56682f5f16fd54172e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3443d12aa7ba632ae4ebc56682f5f16fd54172e/0_120_2413_1448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Given that people the world over cower in fear of them, it\u2019s strange that arachnids haven\u2019t been more of a major player in Hollywood horror over the years. Sure, there was the giant spider in Harry Potter, and the final hideous transformation of Pennywise in It, but they were minor elements rather than the main event. Instead, for the most part they have have been restricted to sub-Sharknado B-movies with titles like Lavalantula.</p> <p>The one respectable exception was Arachnophobia, a genuinely terrifying effort that sadistic TV schedulers would regularly drop in before the watershed when I was a child. The genius of Frank Marshall\u2019s 1990 film was that, rather than making the spiders giant, he made a virtue of their smallness: the gist was that a deadly South American spider mated with a common house spider, producing hundreds of lethal offspring that lay waste to a small American town. Here, the deadly killer could appear at any moment, lurking up a coat sleeve, or lying in wait in a dusty corner. In the end Jeff Daniels\u2019 heroic physician does the decent thing and kills the spider queen with fire, but I never enjoyed this cathartic conflagration, having long since legged it from the living room. <em>GM</em></p> <h2>Don\u2019t Look Under the Bed</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5PtnsOl-dw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R5PtnsOl-dw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Encountering genuinely frightening material in a Disney Channel original movie feels as unexpected and scandalizing as discovering a razor blade in a candy apple \u2013 these things are supposed to be for children! I watched this kiddie horror flick (the last that the Disney Channel ever produced, due to an influx of aggrieved letters from parents tending to their hysterical offspring) through the wide, terrified eyes of a boy in 19-never-you-mind, having come in prepared for a spooky good time about a girl and her imaginary friend battling the Boogeyman. What I got instead was a demented funhouse fantasia of fear, real fear, the kind of immediate visually \u2013 sourced fear completely alien to a child theretofore frightened only by the figments of his own imagination.<br><br>There are lots of psychologically unsettling elements to the script: the notion of a loved one transforming into something monstrous and turning on you, the transition from being a dependent toddler to a semi-autonomous grade-schooler, the locus of danger being the safe confines of your bedroom. But as a youngster, I was hit hardest by the old-fashioned stuff. The Boogeyman character\u2019s design \u2013 long nails, rangy hair, sharp teeth \u2013 and the Twin Peaks-style eeriness of his slow, creeping approach laid me right out. If one day I do become a father, my only priority will be protecting my progeny from this film. <em>CB</em></p> <h2>Asylum</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xQVO0DdNIc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1xQVO0DdNIc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I have no idea how old I was when I caught 20-odd minutes of the 1972 portmanteau horror Asylum on telly. I had no idea that\u2019s what I had seen until I did some Googling for this feature and figured out this was the origin of those images seared on to my brain. The individual limbs wrapped in brown paper heaving their way up the cellar stairs. The severed head, similarly packaged, rolling slowly into the kitchen.</p> <p>These body parts, it turns out from rewatch, belong to Ruth (Sylvia Sims), who has been chopped up by her cheating husband, Walter (Richard Todd) so he can pop off with foxy Bonnie (Barbara Parkins).

      "bodyText": "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom My first trip to the cinema scarred me for the rest of my filmgoing life. I still remember a suitably childlike awe at the size of the room and my glee when the film began with a glittering dance sequence. The occasion was my older brother\u2019s seventh birthday and naturally he had chosen the film. Like any self-respecting seven-year-old in the mid-1980s, he wanted to see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. So my first big-screen movie was a supposedly family-friendly film that features ritual sacrifice and pits of fire as well as a banquet of baby snakes, monkey brains and eyeball soup \u2013 not to mention the scene in which a man\u2019s heart is ripped, still beating, from his chest. Overimaginative at the best of times, my tiny brain was overwhelmed by each new horror, and I was terrorstruck by the thought of what gore might spurt next. I even squirmed 180 degrees in my seat, only to see the adult next to me averting his eyes too. Subsequently, Temple of Doom was heavily criticized for its dark and offensive imagery, but it was too late for five-year-old me. To this day, I feel a frisson of nervousness as the lights go down in the cinema \u2013 the fear that the chorus line will be pushed off the screen by a parade of bloody monstrosities. And yet, I keep going back \u2026 PH Lonely Water I wasn\u2019t allowed to see horror movies when I was a little kid, certainly not allowed to stay up late and watch scary films on television, and this was in that ancient pre-internet and pre-VCR era when it was physically impossible to get your hands on them covertly. So I was shocked \u2013 really shocked \u2013 by the public information films on safety which reached out of the TV screen around teatime and punched you in the face, about the same time of day as Jackanory or Hector\u2019s House. This one is a classic, Lonely Water from 1973, sometimes called Dark And Lonely Water (although no title appears). It was commissioned by the government\u2019s Central Office of Information (COI) in response to an increase in child drowning accidents: written and produced by the COI official Christine Harmon and directed by Jeff Grant, who blogged about his experience. Lonely Water is brutally addressed to children, not to the adults who are supposed to be taking care of them. A dark, hooded figure appears to be walking on the dangerous stretches of water, looming up behind the kids, with Donald Pleasence doing the creepy narration. Like so many chillingly contemptuous teachers that I remember from those days, this Angel Of Death sneers knowingly at the \u201cshowoffs\u201d who mess about near water and fall in and drown, and also at the simply \u201cunwary\u201d who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. The dark cloaked figure appears disturbingly behind them, as if walking on the misty water itself. Lonely Water is often compared to the beginning of Nicolas Roeg\u2019s Don\u2019t Look Now (and it is eerily similar) and Pleasence might bring to mind John Carpenter\u2019s Halloween from 1978, in which he starred. But for me the film-maker who most comes to mind is Peter Watkins, who made the chilling The War Game and Punishment Park: film-making with a clinically icy establishment voice whose clear, cruel purpose is to disturb. PB Freddy vs Jason Scary movies and I have never gotten along. Life is frightful enough. I\u2019m pretty sure I was dragged to see Freddy vs Jason as a kid because my parents did not want to sit through whatever else was out at that time, like Freaky Friday or Uptown Girls. I was eight years old and officially tall enough to ride the cool rollercoasters \u2013 I wanted to prove that I was mature enough to withstand blood and gore. But I still didn\u2019t understand that everything on TV and film was fake. Because how can you fake getting your head chopped off? So imagine my horror when I saw Kelly Rowland of Destiny\u2019s Child, my favorite girl group ever, on the big screen. There she was, pissing off Freddy Kruger by calling him a faggot (Rowland\u2019s release of gay circuit party staples like Commander make up for this uncomfortable moment, in my opinion). And then, BAM! Rowland gets smacked with Jason Voorhees\u2019s machete out of nowhere. I could not fall asleep that night. Kelly Rowland was dead! Destiny\u2019s Child would never make music again. And my mom was no help with my eight-year-old anxieties. She just brushed off my pop music concerns with: \u201cIt\u2019s not real. Go back to bed.\u201d A few months later, I saw Rowland on TV in a live appearance. She was healthy. Her head was still intact. And there were no traces of blood. The world could go on. Every member of Destiny\u2019s Child was still alive. AW The Witches I was eight when I first saw Nicolas Roeg\u2019s sadistic adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s The Witches, a horror film for children made with a cruel, adult sensibility. I was at a friend\u2019s house, too embarrassed to admit that I was terrified and too terrified to stop watching, and by the time it was over, I was left with a horrifying new outlook on life. Many of the films that rank among the scariest for children subvert a traditionally harmless character into something monstrous (it\u2019s why Pennywise and Chucky had such a profound effect on so many) and at an age when I still defined women in soft, simplistic terms, I was suddenly made aware that not all of them wanted to coo over me \u2013 some of them might want to kill me instead. It wasn\u2019t the grandiose unmasking of the witches that stuck, as gruesome as it was, but instead I was haunted by the smaller moments, the scenes when they were still in full disguise, insidiously targeting vulnerable children, overcome with pure hate. There was the witch who trapped a girl in a painting, the witch who tried to lure a boy down from his treehouse with chocolate and a snake, the witch who pushed a pram toward the edge of a cliff \u2013 insidious scenes designed to provoke nightmares and that they did. I remember not sleeping well for months, horrified that they were hiding in my suburban setting, disgusted by my existence, waiting patiently to eradicate me. I was eager to grow up for a number of reasons \u2013 my own money, an escape from my bleak small town, the ability to devour a second and third portion of dessert without restriction \u2013 but the most overwhelming of all was the knowledge that once I turned 18, I\u2019d be safe from the witches. BL The Ring The first time I saw The Ring I was about 12, and the viewing was basically forced on me during a classroom movie day. Looking back on it now, it\u2019s a pretty quiet, atmospheric film for most of its runtime, but for the entire duration I was scared out of my wits, watching it behind my fingers. What Gore Verbinski does so well in The Ring is imbuing the most mundane objects with menace. I couldn\u2019t look at TVs, chairs, ladders and mirrors for a while without feeling spooked, all because they featured in Samara\u2019s video. It\u2019s weirdly the chair that haunted me for years after: the image of it spinning upside down returns to me occasionally, and the eerie wrongness of it still unsettles me. It\u2019s also a movie that taught me early on about futility, and that kindness is not always repaid: despite finding Samara and giving her a proper burial, Rachel\u2019s man still dies, and her son would have too if she hadn\u2019t made a copy of the tape in order to infect the next person. It\u2019s ultimately a sad film about a very harsh, dog-eat-dog world, and that really bothered me as a kid. GS Patrick As a sensitive, if not to say delicate, child, I always steered well clear of scary films \u2013 still do. But there was a time in my mid-teens \u2013 the early 1980s \u2013 when I felt I should investigate this horror movie thing, and (before the video-nasty scare really took hold) they were often on late-night TV. I managed to get through The Amityville Horror, Alien and Halloween without incident, but the one that really shook me up was an Australian film that I never heard of again until it was remade to little fanfare in 2013. Kicking off with a gruesome scene where the murderous title character chucks an electric fire into a bath containing his mother and her lover, Patrick is a classic spin on the old kill-everyone-with-telekinesis-you-are-sexually-threatened-by trope, popularised by Carrie a couple of years earlier. The main twist here is that, shortly after the electric fire incident, the glassy-eyed teen of the title slips into a coma, and does all his nastiness while lying in a hospital bed. I think it was the fact that he was unconscious the entire time (as well as the very creepy touch of communicating via a possessed typewriter) that really freaked me out. And there\u2019s an amazing final flip-out: I won\u2019t give it away exactly what it is but it\u2019s far worse and shocking than any Hitcher-type unkillable killers. I\u2019m getting worried again just thinking about it. AP Arachnophobia Given that people the world over cower in fear of them, it\u2019s strange that arachnids haven\u2019t been more of a major player in Hollywood horror over the years. Sure, there was the giant spider in Harry Potter, and the final hideous transformation of Pennywise in It, but they were minor elements rather than the main event. Instead, for the most part they have have been restricted to sub-Sharknado B-movies with titles like Lavalantula. The one respectable exception was Arachnophobia, a genuinely terrifying effort that sadistic TV schedulers would regularly drop in before the watershed when I was a child. The genius of Frank Marshall\u2019s 1990 film was that, rather than making the spiders giant, he made a virtue of their smallness: the gist was that a deadly South American spider mated with a common house spider, producing hundreds of lethal offspring that lay waste to a small American town. Here, the deadly killer could appear at any moment, lurking up a coat sleeve, or lying in wait in a dusty corner. In the end Jeff Daniels\u2019 heroic physician does the decent thing and kills the spider queen with fire, but I never enjoyed this cathartic conflagration, having long since legged it from the living room. GM Don\u2019t Look Under the Bed Encountering genuinely frightening material in a Disney Channel original movie feels as unexpected and scandalizing as discovering a razor blade in a candy apple \u2013 these things are supposed to be for children! I watched this kiddie horror flick (the last that the Disney Channel ever produced, due to an influx of aggrieved letters from parents tending to their hysterical offspring) through the wide, terrified eyes of a boy in 19-never-you-mind, having come in prepared for a spooky good time about a girl and her imaginary friend battling the Boogeyman. What I got instead was a demented funhouse fantasia of fear, real fear, the kind of immediate visually \u2013 sourced fear completely alien to a child theretofore frightened only by the figments of his own imagination. There are lots of psychologically unsettling elements to the script: the notion of a loved one transforming into something monstrous and turning on you, the transition from being a dependent toddler to a semi-autonomous grade-schooler, the locus of danger being the safe confines of your bedroom. But as a youngster, I was hit hardest by the old-fashioned stuff. The Boogeyman character\u2019s design \u2013 long nails, rangy hair, sharp teeth \u2013 and the Twin Peaks-style eeriness of his slow, creeping approach laid me right out. If one day I do become a father, my only priority will be protecting my progeny from this film. CB Asylum I have no idea how old I was when I caught 20-odd minutes of the 1972 portmanteau horror Asylum on telly. I had no idea that\u2019s what I had seen until I did some Googling for this feature and figured out this was the origin of those images seared on to my brain. The individual limbs wrapped in brown paper heaving their way up the cellar stairs. The severed head, similarly packaged, rolling slowly into the kitchen. These body parts, it turns out from rewatch, belong to Ruth (Sylvia Sims), who has been chopped up by her cheating husband, Walter (Richard Todd) so he can pop off with foxy Bonnie (Barbara Parkins). But Ruth has been taking African voodoo classes, so her bits and bobs don\u2019t stay shut in the newfangled deep freeze Walter has bought specially \u2013 instead they conspire to strangle him to death and so mess up his mistress that she\u2019s wheeled off to the institute. I expected the scenes to look a bit clunky to my 40-year-old eyes \u2013 a touch hokey, perhaps, the scares maybe over-signposted. Actually, the whole thing was atrocious: completely without chills, poorly played and appallingly paced. All you can think about is what an incredibly meticulous job Walter has done with his brown paper and string (no seepage at all!) and what a smashing utility room they have in their basement. CS ET One day when I was about five, I found my dad watching ET. I don\u2019t remember meeting Drew Barrymore; all I can recall now is the scene in which one kid searches for ET in the woods and finds him, splayed and freezing and nearly dead from homesickness, in a creek bed.

      "body": "<p>The price of a drug crucial to prevent tuberculosis is to be slashed by two-thirds in a deal that could stop millions from developing the disease.</p> <p>TB is the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, killing 1.5 million people a year, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/\">global TB report</a>.</p> <p>An estimated 1.7 billion people, a quarter of the world\u2019s population, are infected by TB but have no symptoms and are not contagious. Most do not know they are infected. Access to the antibiotic, rifapentine, would stop this \u201clatent\u201d TB from becoming active.</p> <p>Without treatment, 5% to 10% of people with latent TB \u2013 up to 170 million people globally \u2013 will develop the disease, which can be passed from person to person.</p> <p>The price drop, negotiated on a volume basis by Unitaid, the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi, means the drug can be used in 100 low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>Effective prevention will be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in eliminating TB, according to Unitaid\u2019s executive director, Lelio Marmora. Available to those who could afford it since 2017, rifapentine has, until now, been \u201ccompletely unaffordable\u201d in developing countries. \u201cThis agreement will help transform political commitment to tangible action,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Affordability of medicines is an issue affecting countries worldwide. In England, a standoff over the price of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/27/600-years-supply-of-cystic-fibrosis-drug-destroyed-in-price-row\">cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi</a> finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/24/nhs-england-vertex-agrees-price-for-orkambi-unaffordable-cystic-fibrosis-drug\">ended last week</a>.</p> <p>Today, only 1.8 million people are on preventive treatment for TB. Last year at the UN, heads of state agreed a <a href=\"http://stoptb.org/assets/documents/global/advocacy/unhlm/UNHLM_Targets&amp;Commitments.pdf\">target of 30 million people by 2022</a>. That jump looks more achievable now that the price of a three-month course of rifapentine will drop from approximately $45 (\u00a335) to $15 for public health services in poorer countries.</p> <p>Last month, donors pledged more than $14bn to replenish the Global Fund for the next three years, the largest amount raised for a multilateral health organisation. But demands on these funds are growing.</p> <p>Peter Sands, the Global Fund\u2019s executive director, said that enabling people to access the treatment would be doubly effective, keeping them healthy and therefore helping to \u201cbuild more stable and prosperous communities\u201d.</p> <p>Those living with HIV are up to 37 times more likely to be affected by TB.</p> <p>Until now, preventive treatment took from six to 36 months and uptake was poor. Using rifapentine shortens the care to 12 weekly doses in combination with another drug, isoniazid. Research has found that patients are much more likely to finish shorter treatments.</p> <p>The WHO recommends this treatment for people living with HIV and those of any age who have had contact, for example by living in the same household, with confirmed TB cases.</p> <p>Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO\u2019s global TB programme, called the deal a \u201csignificant development\u201d and said: \u201cWe hope that countries with the highest TB burdens can benefit. Continued efforts to make medicines more affordable and patient-friendly will facilitate national TB and HIV programmes quicken their pace to scale up preventive treatment services.\u201d</p> <p>South Africa, a country with high rates, plans to roll out the new treatment. The country\u2019s minister of health, Zweli Mkhize, said: \u201cHundreds of thousands of vulnerable people can be initiated on this new treatment regimen starting next year, thanks to this price agreement.\u201d</p> <p>India, where more people are affected by TB than in any other country, has set a target to eliminate TB by 2025. More affordable rifapentine should help more than 1 million people.</p> <p>Jon Fairest, Sanofi\u2019s vice-president for external affairs Africa, Eurasia and Middle East, believes this is a \u201csustainable commercial approach\u201d that will widen access to the \u201cnew standard of care for latent tuberculosis infection\u201d.</p> <p>Unitaid and partners are negotiating a generic supply of the drug for 2020.</p> <p>Another development announced this week is a new treatment for people with extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB).</p> <p>The drug pretomanid has<strong> </strong>recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for a six-month course. This new treatment, which in combination with two other drugs, bedaquiline and linezolid, is known as BPal, reduces the time needed to tackle drug-resistant TB and is also more effective. Previous treatments typically lasted at least two years.</p> <p>Mel Spigelman, president and CEO of the TB Alliance, which developed the new treatment, said it is the first to win regulatory approval anywhere, although he cautioned that \u201cthe job is not done until the medicine gets into the hands of the patients who need it\u201d.</p> <p>This week, the Global Drug Facility announced that the drug will be available for $2 a day to 140 countries with the highest incidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/20/climate-emergency-poses-major-threat-to-future-global-health-say-top-medics\">Climate emergency poses major threat to future global health, say top medics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cost of all three drugs will be roughly $1,000 for a full course.

Available to those who could afford it since 2017, rifapentine has, until now, been \u201ccompletely unaffordable\u201d in developing countries. \u201cThis agreement will help transform political commitment to tangible action,\u201d he said. Affordability of medicines is an issue affecting countries worldwide. In England, a standoff over the price of the cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi finally ended last week. Today, only 1.8 million people are on preventive treatment for TB. Last year at the UN, heads of state agreed a target of 30 million people by 2022. That jump looks more achievable now that the price of a three-month course of rifapentine will drop from approximately $45 (\u00a335) to $15 for public health services in poorer countries. Last month, donors pledged more than $14bn to replenish the Global Fund for the next three years, the largest amount raised for a multilateral health organisation. But demands on these funds are growing. Peter Sands, the Global Fund\u2019s executive director, said that enabling people to access the treatment would be doubly effective, keeping them healthy and therefore helping to \u201cbuild more stable and prosperous communities\u201d. Those living with HIV are up to 37 times more likely to be affected by TB. Until now, preventive treatment took from six to 36 months and uptake was poor. Using rifapentine shortens the care to 12 weekly doses in combination with another drug, isoniazid. Research has found that patients are much more likely to finish shorter treatments. The WHO recommends this treatment for people living with HIV and those of any age who have had contact, for example by living in the same household, with confirmed TB cases. Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO\u2019s global TB programme, called the deal a \u201csignificant development\u201d and said: \u201cWe hope that countries with the highest TB burdens can benefit. Continued efforts to make medicines more affordable and patient-friendly will facilitate national TB and HIV programmes quicken their pace to scale up preventive treatment services.\u201d South Africa, a country with high rates, plans to roll out the new treatment. The country\u2019s minister of health, Zweli Mkhize, said: \u201cHundreds of thousands of vulnerable people can be initiated on this new treatment regimen starting next year, thanks to this price agreement.\u201d India, where more people are affected by TB than in any other country, has set a target to eliminate TB by 2025. More affordable rifapentine should help more than 1 million people. Jon Fairest, Sanofi\u2019s vice-president for external affairs Africa, Eurasia and Middle East, believes this is a \u201csustainable commercial approach\u201d that will widen access to the \u201cnew standard of care for latent tuberculosis infection\u201d. Unitaid and partners are negotiating a generic supply of the drug for 2020. Another development announced this week is a new treatment for people with extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB). The drug pretomanid has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for a six-month course. This new treatment, which in combination with two other drugs, bedaquiline and linezolid, is known as BPal, reduces the time needed to tackle drug-resistant TB and is also more effective. Previous treatments typically lasted at least two years. Mel Spigelman, president and CEO of the TB Alliance, which developed the new treatment, said it is the first to win regulatory approval anywhere, although he cautioned that \u201cthe job is not done until the medicine gets into the hands of the patients who need it\u201d. This week, the Global Drug Facility announced that the drug will be available for $2 a day to 140 countries with the highest incidence. The cost of all three drugs will be roughly $1,000 for a full course. According to the Stop TB Partnership, previous treatments cost up to $8,000. MSF has called for bedaquiline to be reduced to no more than $1 a day for those who need it. Sharonann Lynch, HIV &amp; TB policy adviser for MSF\u2019s access campaign, said: \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable that drug corporations continue to put profits over people\u2019s lives\u201d. A new vaccine to prevent TB, under development by GlaxoSmithKline, is being watched with \u201ccautious optimism\u201d. A three-year clinical trial has shown sustained protection against tuberculosis of the lungs, a particularly aggressive form, and will now move to the next phase.",

Adel al-Shuraifi\u2019s battle could have been over after a year but was prolonged when the agency took the rare step of sending his case to the top tier of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in a last-ditch bid to deny him the $466.70-a-week payment. Al-Shuraifi, who has been on Newstart since 2017 because he could no longer keep working as a labourer, had his disability pension application twice denied by Centrelink, first in September 2017. But when the AAT overturned those decisions, judging al-Shuraifi as permanently blind and automatically eligible for the pension, the agency chose to appeal. The second tier of the AAT heard al-Shuraifi was diagnosed with the degenerative condition bilateral optic atrophy, which left him with \u201cvery blurry\u201d vision. Both his lawyer and Centrelink did not argue he was permanently blind, as the first tier of the AAT ruled when it found him automatically eligible for the pension. At issue during the hearings, held in Brisbane, was whether al-Shuraifi\u2019s impairment was severe enough that he still met the criteria to get the pension. The tribunal member Deborah Mitchell was told al-Shuraifi could no longer drive, did not go grocery shopping because he could not see items on the shelf and that he sometimes tripped because he could not see obstacles in his path. While he was able to catch a bus, he would wave down each one that came by as he could not see the numbers from a distance, his occupational therapist said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Al-Shuraifi told the tribunal his sight had deteriorated since April 2017 and said that sunlight made it feel like his eyes were burning. \u201cIt\u2019s always getting worse. It\u2019s never stable. It\u2019s always getting worse and worse,\u201d al-Shuraifi said. His lawyer told the tribunal he was unable to read documents during the hearing. To gain access to the disability support pension without undertaking 18 months of work training, a person must obtain at least 20 points on one of the impairment tables and prove they cannot work at least 15 hours a week. Their condition must also be fully diagnosed and stabilised. Centrelink argued al-Shuraifi\u2019s vision impairment was worth only 10 points and relied on a consultant ophthalmologist\u2019s report that was provided to the tribunal. As is common, the specialist did not examine al-Shuraifi, but used his medical records to state that his impairment was only moderate and that he could have worked at least 15 hours a week. But Mitchell accepted written evidence from al-Shuraifi\u2019s ophthalmologist, who has treated him since 2014, and his occupational therapist, who also fronted the tribunal. She did not find al-Shuraifi\u2019s sight impairment was so bad as to find him legally blind, but judged it \u201csevere\u201d. \u201cThe evidence demonstrates that the Respondent\u2019s vision impairment condition is deteriorating and there is no further treatment that will assist to improve the condition,\u201d Mitchell wrote in her decision. Until he was granted the pension by the tribunal this week, al-Shuraifi was among the record-high 280,000 sick and disabled people on Newstart with a \u201cpartial capacity to work\u201d. Guardian Australia last week revealed that official statistics have underreported the number of \u201cpartial capacity to work\u201d Newstart recipients for years. A Senate estimates hearing was told this month that there was a 48% increase in disability support pension appeals to the AAT in the past financial year.

Air quality in the lower Hunter, eastern Sydney, western Sydney and north-west Sydney has been classed as hazardous, with NSW Health urging people with respiratory conditions, in particular, to take precautions, including staying indoors and protecting the eyes, nose and throat to avoid irritation.

Smoke from an out of control bushfire in Port Macquarie and other fires on the mid-north coast, far-north coast and the New England region has contributed to the haze blanketing large parts of Sydney. Hundreds of koalas are feared to have died in the fire near Port Macquarie, which has burned more than 2500 hectares, including a koala breeding ground. Jordan Notara, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology said the smoke was likely to remain in eastern parts of the state until later on Sunday or early on Monday, when the next front is expected. In Victoria, maximum forecast temperatures on Thursday were more than 10 degrees above average in some areas. Melbourne was forecast to reach 35C, its hottest October day in four years. Sale, in the Gippsland region, was also forecast to reach 35C , its hottest October day since records began in 1945. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast very warm overnight temperatures in the low to mid 20s and a second day of temperatures in the mid 30s across the state on Friday. Fire danger ratings in Victoria will reach severe on Friday with the potential for strong and gusty northerly winds. There is also potential for hazy conditions in the state on Friday due to dust.

In Victoria, transmission of the disease has until now been confined to the Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas.</p> <p>But on Thursday Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton issued an alert saying Aireys Inlet, a coastal town along the Great Ocean Road, and the Geelong suburb of Belmont, had been newly identified as transmission areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/12/flesh-eating-ulcers-spread-to-new-part-of-australia-worries-infectious-disease-experts\">Flesh-eating ulcer's spread to new part of Australia worries infectious disease experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the health advisory, Sutton urged doctors across the state to be aware of the warning signs of the disease and said laboratory testing for Buruli ulcer was now free for patients, although a handling fee may be charged by private pathology companies.</p> <p>There can be a delay of several months between infection and symptoms, and given the coastal towns were popular tourist destinations people were often far away from the transmission site by the time of diagnosis.</p> <p>Though risk of transmission is low due to the confined areas where the ulcer occurs, the spread is nonetheless a cause for concern since it can be difficult to detect and treat. Despite being recognised in Victoria since 1948, efforts to control the disease have been severely hampered because the mode of transmission to humans is unknown.</p> <p>The first sign of infection is usually a painless lump on the skin often dismissed as an insect bite. The slow-moving infection then burrows into a layer of fat located between the skin and the lining that covers muscles. It is in this fatty layer that the infection takes hold, spreading sideways and through the body, destroying tissue along the way, before eventually erupting back through the skin in the form of an ulcer. Those with the infection often have no idea the infection has taken hold until the ulcer appears. But when the ulcer does erupt, the pain can be extreme.</p> <p>Anyone is susceptible. While the infection responds to a roughly eight-week course of antibiotics, in rare cases surgery to remove skin or even amputation is needed, making early detection critical.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been a total 240 cases notified so far in 2019,\u201d Sutton said.<br><br>There is growing evidence that mosquitoes play an important role in transmitting the infection though it\u2019s not yet known exactly how infections occur or where in the environment the bacteria prefer to live. It is not thought to be spread person to person.<br><br>Those travelling to transmission areas have been urged to avoid insect bites, protect cuts and abrasions, and see a doctor if any persistent skin lesions occur.</p> <p>It follows concern from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/12/flesh-eating-ulcers-spread-to-new-part-of-australia-worries-infectious-disease-experts\"> doctors earlier in October that the disease</a> had also spread in Queensland. There, it has moved from the Douglas Shire to the Atherton Tablelands, south of its usual catchment area in the far north.</p>",

But on Thursday Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton issued an alert saying Aireys Inlet, a coastal town along the Great Ocean Road, and the Geelong suburb of Belmont, had been newly identified as transmission areas. In the health advisory, Sutton urged doctors across the state to be aware of the warning signs of the disease and said laboratory testing for Buruli ulcer was now free for patients, although a handling fee may be charged by private pathology companies. There can be a delay of several months between infection and symptoms, and given the coastal towns were popular tourist destinations people were often far away from the transmission site by the time of diagnosis. Though risk of transmission is low due to the confined areas where the ulcer occurs, the spread is nonetheless a cause for concern since it can be difficult to detect and treat. Despite being recognised in Victoria since 1948, efforts to control the disease have been severely hampered because the mode of transmission to humans is unknown. The first sign of infection is usually a painless lump on the skin often dismissed as an insect bite. The slow-moving infection then burrows into a layer of fat located between the skin and the lining that covers muscles. It is in this fatty layer that the infection takes hold, spreading sideways and through the body, destroying tissue along the way, before eventually erupting back through the skin in the form of an ulcer. Those with the infection often have no idea the infection has taken hold until the ulcer appears. But when the ulcer does erupt, the pain can be extreme. Anyone is susceptible. While the infection responds to a roughly eight-week course of antibiotics, in rare cases surgery to remove skin or even amputation is needed, making early detection critical. \u201cThere have been a total 240 cases notified so far in 2019,\u201d Sutton said. There is growing evidence that mosquitoes play an important role in transmitting the infection though it\u2019s not yet known exactly how infections occur or where in the environment the bacteria prefer to live. It is not thought to be spread person to person. Those travelling to transmission areas have been urged to avoid insect bites, protect cuts and abrasions, and see a doctor if any persistent skin lesions occur. It follows concern from doctors earlier in October that the disease had also spread in Queensland. There, it has moved from the Douglas Shire to the Atherton Tablelands, south of its usual catchment area in the far north.",

      "body": "<p>The peak body representing doctors is the latest group to call for an overhaul of the private health insurance industry, as pressure mounts on the federal government to force greater transparency and better value for money from insurers.</p> <p>On Thursday the Australian Medical Association released its private health insurance report card which emphasised that young people especially were dropping private health insurance or never taking it up in the first place, instead favouring the public health system.</p> <p>\u201cWith more than 60% of elective surgery in Australia occurring in the private sector, the prospect of greater stress and demand being placed on the already overstretched public hospital system is looming large unless the drift away from private health insurance is stopped,\u201d AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/30/private-health-insurance\">Private health insurance review finds reforms failed and industry in a 'death spiral'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAustralians need and demand private health policies that are affordable, transparent, good value and appropriate for their individual or family circumstances, or they will walk away from private health insurance altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Private health insurance for hospital treatments has declined as a percentage of the population for four years in a row, from 47.4% in the June quarter of 2015, to 44.2% as of June 2019. In the same period, the number of people holding private hospital coverage with hospital treatment products fell from 11.3 million to 11.2 million.</p> <p>The AMA\u2019s concerns come despite reforms introduced by the federal government in April aimed at making the system more sustainable and consumer-friendly. The new rules meant insurance policies needed be labelled as gold, silver, bronze or basic so that consumers could more easily see which policies provide the most comprehensive cover.</p> <p>But a report published by consumer group Choice on Wednesday found far from simplifying the system, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/30/private-health-insurance\">the categories were confusing, with some silver products costing more and providing less coverage than gold ones</a>. Bartone said the tiered system had also failed to address key issues in the system including value for money and affordability of policies.</p> <p>\u201cAs the insured population continues to age, the likelihood of requiring hospital treatment rises,\u201d the AMA report said. \u201cThis generates higher claims and exerts upward pressure on premiums, exacerbating this issue further.\u201d</p> <p>The AMA report card also compared the benefits paid by insurers for common procedures and services including obstetrics and hip replacements.

      "bodyText": "The peak body representing doctors is the latest group to call for an overhaul of the private health insurance industry, as pressure mounts on the federal government to force greater transparency and better value for money from insurers. On Thursday the Australian Medical Association released its private health insurance report card which emphasised that young people especially were dropping private health insurance or never taking it up in the first place, instead favouring the public health system. \u201cWith more than 60% of elective surgery in Australia occurring in the private sector, the prospect of greater stress and demand being placed on the already overstretched public hospital system is looming large unless the drift away from private health insurance is stopped,\u201d AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone said. \u201cAustralians need and demand private health policies that are affordable, transparent, good value and appropriate for their individual or family circumstances, or they will walk away from private health insurance altogether.\u201d Private health insurance for hospital treatments has declined as a percentage of the population for four years in a row, from 47.4% in the June quarter of 2015, to 44.2% as of June 2019. In the same period, the number of people holding private hospital coverage with hospital treatment products fell from 11.3 million to 11.2 million. The AMA\u2019s concerns come despite reforms introduced by the federal government in April aimed at making the system more sustainable and consumer-friendly. The new rules meant insurance policies needed be labelled as gold, silver, bronze or basic so that consumers could more easily see which policies provide the most comprehensive cover. But a report published by consumer group Choice on Wednesday found far from simplifying the system, the categories were confusing, with some silver products costing more and providing less coverage than gold ones. Bartone said the tiered system had also failed to address key issues in the system including value for money and affordability of policies. \u201cAs the insured population continues to age, the likelihood of requiring hospital treatment rises,\u201d the AMA report said. \u201cThis generates higher claims and exerts upward pressure on premiums, exacerbating this issue further.\u201d The AMA report card also compared the benefits paid by insurers for common procedures and services including obstetrics and hip replacements. The amount paid out by the same insurer varied between states and territories, in some cases by hundreds of dollars. For example, Bupa paid out $2,064 for an uncomplicated baby delivery in Queensland compared with $2,271 in South Australia. NIB consistently paid out the lowest benefits across all common procedures when compared with other major insurers. HBF and HCF paid the highest benefits for common procedures. The consumers Health Forum and the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association (AHHA) are among the groups pushing for a comprehensive independent inquiry into private health insurance. Acting AHHA chief executive Dr Linc Thurecht said an independent Productivity Commission review of the whole healthcare system, both public and private, was needed. \u201cThis review should also investigate and clarify the public policy objectives that are being served by government support of private healthcare and private health insurance, through publicly funded subsidies and other mechanisms,\u201d he said.",

The \u201chottest\u201d title in recent times is probably their youth-targeted vertical TV show Content, which unfolds entirely from the perspective of an influencer\u2019s iPhone. On SBS there\u2019s the new season of Struggle Street and the AACTA-nominated sexting drama The Hunting. iview faves include Bluey, You Can\u2019t Ask That and Aunty ABC\u2019s infinite array of panel shows. Bingeable favourites: The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Deep State and The Last Man on Earth. Party guest: University professors who are determined to stay \u201cwith it\u201d. Foxtel Cost: Anywhere from $25 to over $100 depending on the package selected. Quick summary: The Foxtel empire includes a subscription streaming service, Foxtel Now. However nobody in the universe (other than people employed by Foxtel) knows how it works. There\u2019s also Foxtel Go and Foxtel on Demand \u2013 whatever on earth they are. The reason for this confusion is because Foxtel is a cable TV service that gives the impression of being dragged kicking and screaming into the age of streaming. Hottest content: The TV spin-off of Watchmen, based 30 years after events depicted in the beloved 1986 graphic novel, is all the rage at the moment. With good reason: it\u2019s one of the most ambitious and cerebral superhero productions in recent years. Foxtel have a solid ongoing supply of local content, most recently including Mr Inbetween season 2, from the excellent director Nash Edgerton. Bingeable favourites: Succession, Game of Thrones, Chernobyl, Big Little Lies and His Dark Materials (starts 5 November). Party guest: The older person who is initially hard to get along with but opens up after a few drinks. Disney+ Cost: $8.99 a month Quick summary: Having reduced mainstream cinema to a smouldering ruin, the top brass at Disney are presumably laughing maniacally as they ready their streaming behemoth. Disney+ will include content from the company\u2019s subsidiaries including Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Fox and National Geographic. Hottest content: Star Wars fans are desperate to get their mitts on the bounty hunter-themed space opera The Mandalorian, which will take place five years after the end of Return of the Jedi. Other Disney+ originals include the awkwardly titled High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. Bingeable favourites: If the US drop is anything to go by, Australia will be treated to some of the oddest-sounding films that have maybe ever existed \u2013 plus all 30 seasons of The Simpsons. Party guest: The rich socialite who is desperate to impress and wants to one day move the party to their place. Apple TV+ Cost: $7.99 Quick summary: All the cool kids are getting into streaming so we\u2019d better do it too, cry the suits at Apple. The company is already a giant in the home entertainment biz with its global iTunes juggernaut, and is looking to boost its coffers through a separate service with a flat monthly subscription fee. Hottest content: Apple originals currently creating the most hype include Morning Wars, elsewhere called The Morning Show, billed as a \u201ccut throat drama\u201d exploring the world of morning TV news (starring and executive produced by Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston). There\u2019s also the futuristic drama See (with Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard), the 50s-set feature film The Banker (with Anthony Mackie and Samuel L Jackson), and a new book club series spearheaded by Oprah Winfrey. Party guest: The sharply dressed but aloof person who spends a lot of time fidgeting with their smart watch.",

As of 1pm, the fire had mown through 1,300 acres and was only 5% contained. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Getty fire</strong> that broke out yesterday morning near affluent sections of west Los Angeles is still burning, though it appears firefighters have made progress holding it back. <a href=\"https://laist.com/2019/10/30/getty-fire-day-3-evacuations-closures.php\">The Laist says</a> 745 acres and 12 structures have been burned but that it\u2019s 27% contained. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Hill fire,</strong> a fire that broke out around 11 in Riverside County and quickly grew to 200 acres is still going, though news reports are emerging that <a href=\"https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/california/Jurupa-Valley-Fire-Riverside-County-564110691.html\">firefighters have halted its progress</a>. </li> \n   <li>And life is slowly returning to normal, or at least not as chaotic, for portions of <strong>Sonoma county,</strong> as the sheriff <strong>lifted evacuation orders</strong> for much of the area and allowed residents to return to their homes. Sonoma county is home to the <strong>Kincade fire,</strong> the biggest of the most recent wildfires, which firefighters have finally been able to contain.

And in the wake of a blaze, those stories abound. </p> \n  <p>But every once in a while a picture of humanity will emerge from the ashes \u2014 a kind of happy ending against a backdrop of destruction. We\u2019ve seen a few of those this week already, as fires ignited up and down the state. </p> \n  <p>Stories like that of Rachel and James Page, a Windsor couple who on Saturday was forced to evacuate their Windsor home to flee the encroaching Kincade fire. Rachel, as it happened, was 39 weeks pregnant and experiencing signs that her coming-baby wouldn\u2019t wait until Halloween, as expected.</p> \n  <p>The couple had planned to have the baby at home, but plans change. So they checked into a hotel in Napa outside of the evacuation zone, and with the help of mid-wives, Rachel gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Here\u2019s from the story in the <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/culture/article/Evacuated-from-their-home-as-Kincade-Fire-closed-14573114.php\">San Francisco Chronicle</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cShe had a really gorgeous, beautiful, straightforward birth,\u201d said Bee Lauher, a licensed midwife, who delivered the baby along with Napa Valley Midwives partners Heather Hilton and Kristina Parks, as first reported by the Napa Valley Register....</p> \n   <p>This isn\u2019t the first time the Napa Valley Midwives have worked in a hotel during a crisis. In 2017, they delivered a baby at the Westin Verasa Napa with the Wine Country fires burning close by.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sure, after the baby arrived, the couple got a call from the hotel desk informing them that guests had reported screaming, but they explained a baby had just been born and everything was fine. </p> \n  <p>Charming, too, are stories about volunteers who come together to rescue animals \u2014 like <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/easy-fire-horses-evacuated\">this piece today in the Los Angeles Times</a> about a group that banded together to rescue horses today as the Easy fire burned a path through Simi Valley, north of Los Angeles.</p> \n  <p>Wrote LAT:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The equestrian community has consistently come together during fires.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which operates the lines, said the utility recently cleared away nearby brush to reduce the risk of fire, but the the branch came from outside the clearance area. The mayor called it \u201can act of God\u201d. (The fact that the wind played a significant role in sparking the fire is a good illustration of why PG&amp;E began shutting off power to begin with).</p> \n  <p>The Los Angeles Times published video of what is believed to be the moment the Getty fire started.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h24vEiloKp4\"> \n   <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h24vEiloKp4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The eucalyptus tree isn\u2019t native to California is actually considered an invasive species. Not only can the trees alter fire patterns and soil moisture, but eucalyptus oil is highly flammable and in some places have been known to explode when they catch fire. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s why efforts have been made in California to clear away the tress in an effort to reduce fire risk.</p> \n  <p>KQED <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/science/4209/eucalyptus-california-icon-fire-hazard-and-invasive-species\">published this explainer </a>several years ago on the tree\u2019s role in fires: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Fifteen major fires roared through 9,000 acres of the East Bay Hills between 1923 and 1992, incinerating some 4,000 homes and killing 26 people. The Oakland \u201cTunnel\u201d fire, considered the worst in California history, caused an estimated $1.5 billion in damage, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and killed 25 people. Following the Oakland fire, disaster experts urged large landowners in the East Bay Hills to work together to manage vegetation to prevent another catastrophic wildfire, says Tom Klatt, who manages environmental projects for UC Berkeley and serves on the UC Fire Mitigation Committee.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In early October, when PG&amp;E started shutting off power in the area around Oakland as a way to reduce the threat of fire, I visited the Oakland Hills neighborhood and spoke with one home owner who had lived through the devastating fire in \u201892 and rebuilt her home on the same spot. She\u2019s made sure to clear away the Eucalyptus trees on her property since then, she told me. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T18:26:19.724Z\">at 6.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db9b8478f08cb84c60a1874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T16:25:49.626Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Mario Koran here, picking up the fire-watch from my colleague Joanna Walters.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a very busy day on fire-watch here in Oakland, with more than a half dozen fires igniting today alone. A notable day wasn\u2019t completely unexpected, as southern California had been under an \u201cextreme red-flag warning\u201d for historically strong winds ripping across bone-dry vegetation. Firefighters were quick to get a handle on some of the fires, but new ones continued to spring up even as responders worked to contain the last. A blaze broke out in the northern Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley early this morning, dubbed the Easy fire, which has threatened homes, forced evacuation orders, and inched closer to the Reagan Library. Sixty mph winds complicated efforts to beat back the blaze, at times scattering water aircraft tried to drop on the fire below. As of 1pm, the fire had mown through 1,300 acres and was only 5% contained. The Getty fire that broke out yesterday morning near affluent sections of west Los Angeles is still burning, though it appears firefighters have made progress holding it back. The Laist says 745 acres and 12 structures have been burned but that it\u2019s 27% contained. The Hill fire, a fire that broke out around 11 in Riverside County and quickly grew to 200 acres is still going, though news reports are emerging that firefighters have halted its progress. And life is slowly returning to normal, or at least not as chaotic, for portions of Sonoma county, as the sheriff lifted evacuation orders for much of the area and allowed residents to return to their homes. Sonoma county is home to the Kincade fire, the biggest of the most recent wildfires, which firefighters have finally been able to contain. As of this morning, almost 77,000 acres had burned but firefighters had it contained at 30%, Cal Fire reports. Early reports indicate that a new blaze has broken out in Fullerton in Orange county, one of roughly a dozen new fires that have ignited today alone. Cal Fire hasn\u2019t yet posted details on Fullerton fire, but we\u2019ll bring you new details as they emerge. The terror of a wildfire tearing through communities, consuming homes, is likely unimaginable for anyone who hasn\u2019t lived through, or fled from one. And in the wake of a blaze, those stories abound. But every once in a while a picture of humanity will emerge from the ashes \u2014 a kind of happy ending against a backdrop of destruction. We\u2019ve seen a few of those this week already, as fires ignited up and down the state. Stories like that of Rachel and James Page, a Windsor couple who on Saturday was forced to evacuate their Windsor home to flee the encroaching Kincade fire. Rachel, as it happened, was 39 weeks pregnant and experiencing signs that her coming-baby wouldn\u2019t wait until Halloween, as expected. The couple had planned to have the baby at home, but plans change. So they checked into a hotel in Napa outside of the evacuation zone, and with the help of mid-wives, Rachel gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Here\u2019s from the story in the San Francisco Chronicle: \u201cShe had a really gorgeous, beautiful, straightforward birth,\u201d said Bee Lauher, a licensed midwife, who delivered the baby along with Napa Valley Midwives partners Heather Hilton and Kristina Parks, as first reported by the Napa Valley Register.... This isn\u2019t the first time the Napa Valley Midwives have worked in a hotel during a crisis. In 2017, they delivered a baby at the Westin Verasa Napa with the Wine Country fires burning close by. Sure, after the baby arrived, the couple got a call from the hotel desk informing them that guests had reported screaming, but they explained a baby had just been born and everything was fine. Charming, too, are stories about volunteers who come together to rescue animals \u2014 like this piece today in the Los Angeles Times about a group that banded together to rescue horses today as the Easy fire burned a path through Simi Valley, north of Los Angeles. Wrote LAT: The equestrian community has consistently come together during fires. Volunteers often find people who need help through word-of-mouth or on social media, especially through a Facebook group called Southern California Equine Emergency Evacuation. \u201cPeople come from all over to help out,\u201d Perera said. Or the mysterious man who appeared unexpectly to rescue alpacas as the Kincade fire gained ground on the ranch. Finally, we saw a great story emerge out of Los Angeles this week, where laborers showed up to tend the houses or yards of the affluent because their bosses had fled and neglected to tell them the neighorhood had flames breathing down on it and was under mandatory evacuation orders. That, by itself, is a little depressing and maybe infuriating. Until you read tweets from the reporter who wrote the story and learn that after publication, a reader had reached out and offered to replentish the wages for the housekeeper who was more worried about losing a day\u2019s wages than avoiding the fire. People can be cool, sometimes. The rhythmic metallic clang of construction rang through the Santa Rosa neighborhood of Coffey Park, an area that should have been a ghost town. But despite the heavy smell of smoke wafting in from the Kincade fire buring just miles away, and a mandatory evacuation order that included much of the city, work continued as usual on Monday for many of the city\u2019s laborers yesterday morning. In a story published today, the gifted Vivian Ho and I take a look at the those who stayed behind to work while thousands fled. For laborers and domestic workers, a day\u2019s work can mean the difference between having money for food or not. \u201cWe still need to make money,\u201d landscaper Jordan Stokles told me, as he took off his hat and wiped sweat from his brow. In a sad twist, many of the construction who stayed behind worked to rebuild the houses burned down by the devastating wildfire that tore through the same area two years ago. \u201c(Santa Rosa is) an agricultural community and everything is very time-sensitive when it comes to harvesting the crops,\u201d Ariel Kelly, the chief executive of Coraz\u00f3n Healdsburg, told Vivian. \u201cWe have those visa workers on temporary agricultural visas and they\u2019ll be concluding their stay because this is the end of the season. There\u2019s this concern that \u2018if I don\u2019t finish the job, I won\u2019t get paid\u2019\u2026I know that after the first wave of evacuations happened last Wednesday night and a number of them were at our shelter, they were still leaving to go back to work.\u201d The dynamic winds are creating a high-stakes game of whack-a-mole for firefighters in California. As firefighters made progress on what\u2019s been the largest of recent fires, the Kincade fire, a growing list of blazes have kicked up in southern California, currently under an \u201cextreme red-flag\u201d warning for the gusting Santa Ana winds whipping across the region. In Riverside county, the Hill fire that started just after 11 am had consumed 200 acres by 2 pm. The Riverside county fire department reported that the blaze is currently only contained at 5%. One person with minor injuries has been transported to a local hospital. One mobile home and one residential home have been damaged. Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued. As the wind dies down and firefighters contain the Kincade fire, the Sonoma county sheriff is giving the greenlight for more county residents to return to their homes. The evacuation orders have been lifted for four separate areas of the county, including the city of Santa Rosa, much of which had been under mandatory orders to leave. The Kincade fire has been the biggest and most destructive of recent fires this season, burning nearly 77,000 acres and 206 structures over six days. Weakening winds offered a reprieve, and by this morning firefighters had been able to contain 30% of the fire. My colleague Susie Cagle talked to some Sonoma county residents, still traumatized by a fire that devastated the area two years ago, who simply refused to leave their house, vowing instead to protect it from the flames. Fire investigators meanwhile, are criss-crossing the county, assessing damaging and looking for clues as to which factors could best prevent, or at least resist, future fires. A new fire, the Yosemite fire, has ignited near the area north of Los Angeles where authorities have already been working to extinguish the Easy fire, which ignited just after 6am today. The fast-moving vegetation fire is spreading amid an \u201cextreme red-flag warning\u201d issued by the National Weather Service, an alert triggered by historic winds and bone-dry conditions. Officials are expanding evacuaion orders as the fire moves. As of 1pm, about 7,000 homes 26,000 people were under evacuation orders. Here\u2019s a striking image from Los Angeles Times photographer Gina Ferazzi in Riverside county, where firefighters are battling the Hill fire that started this morning just after 11am and had chewed up 50 acres in about an hour, according to Cal Fire. Firefighters working the Easy fire north of Los Angeles are dealing with a growing blaze, a situation frustrated by fast-moving Santa Ana winds gusting across southern California. The fire that ignited just after 6am had charred 1,300 acres by noon, threatening about 6,500, an untold number of animals, and the 125,000 square foot Ronald Reagan Presidential Library perched on a nearby hillside. Ventura County Fire Capt. Steve Kaufmann told the Los Angeles Times that high winds were complicating efforts to contain the blaze, dispersing water dropped by aircraft before it reached the fire. \u201cThe air assets are challenging at best,\u201d Kaufmann said. \u201cYou can see a lot of the water that\u2019s coming from the super scoopers is atomized because of the wind. It\u2019s definitely makes it challenging for us.\u201d By around 12:30pm, the fire had moved west was encroaching on the Classic Equestrian Center. Rounding up animals and moving them to safety has been a major component of evacuations, an effort made more difficult for large, less-mobile animals like cows. One rancher staring down the Easy fire apparently enlisted the help of a photographer to evacuate his horses, who appears to have been happy to oblige. In addition to the Mureau brush fire that kicked up this morning just north of Malibu, a count one in southern California\u2019s Riverside county and another to the north in Kern County. The fire in riverside was reported at 7am, writes the Los Angeles Times. According to Cal Fire, five acres have burned, along with two vehicles and three buildings, and the fire is contained at 10%. LA Times says 119 firefighters have been dispatched to fight a blazed fueled by Santa Ana winds gusting up to 60 mph. In Kern County, the area surrounding Bakersfield, a vegetation fire dubbed the Thief fire has burned about six to eight acres, but Kern county firefighters are holding the line. A small brushfire that officials are referring to as the Mureau fire has kicked up in Calabasas, an area just north of Malibu. It has grown to five acres and the Los Angeles fire department is telling area residents to be prepared to evacuated. The Los Angeles Times reports that aerial video shows that the fire ignited in the area where the Woolsey fire took place last year, a burn that left a scar so deep that it\u2019s visible from space. California\u2019s neighbors to the east are sending reinforcements to help the Golden State battle wildfires, reports the Associated Press. Fire agencies in Montana are sending 20 engines and 72 firefighters to California while Idaho plans to send five fire engines and 17 personnel. Currently more than 5,000 firefighters in California are working the wildfires. Fire has reached the doorstep of the Reagan library, as firefighters dig in to save the structure. The Los Angeles Times reports that the fast-moving Easy fire, burning outside the library Wednesday morning, forced a number of people inside the structure to shelter in place: Firefighters were at the facility prepared to provide structure protection. The flames were being held back by an aggressive ground and aerial attack on the ridges beyond Simi\u2019s modern residential estates. Helicopters repeatedly dropped loads of water behind the library in 60mph winds, turning the flames on the ridge 300ft below into smoke. Amid wind gusts strong enough to knock a person off balance, two super-scooper planes dipped down behind the library before unleashing such a volume of water it created its own rainbow. Photographers on the scene have captured some remarkable images. More than 1 million people in northern California were still without power on Wednesday as Pacific Gas &amp; Electric initiated a new round of blackouts in 22 counties, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Parts of northern California, including areas just east and north of San Francisco, were spared from the blackouts after weather took a favorable turn. One area spared from an additional blackout was San Rafael, in Marin county, which on Tuesday morning was just blinking to life after a shutdown that lasted several days. Residents there talked to me about the financial impact the blackouts would have on them and their families. Eddie, who works at a nearby restaurant, told me he had been out of work for four days after the lights went out at his place of business. He said the blackouts had affected the entire community and closed the grocery stores that were close enough for him to reach by foot. \u201cSchools have been closed. Nobody can go out and buy groceries. This area is really taking a hit and losing profit,\u201d Eddie said. Across the street from the transit station \u2013 where trains weren\u2019t running thanks to the blackout \u2013 Colonial Liquor had just opened its doors after two days without power. The man behind the counter, who declined to give his name, said: \u201cI\u2019m going to have to work for six months straight to make up what I lost.\u201d Bill Horton waited an extra hour for a bus to take him to his job in Petaluma because the trains weren\u2019t running. \u201cI\u2019ll be OK,\u201d Horton said. \u201cBut so many of the people you see here riding public transit, they live pay check to pay check. They fight over those hours. They can\u2019t afford to lose several days wages.\u201d The eucalyptus tree has been something of a menace in the history of California wildfires and has played a role in sparking the Getty fire in west Los Angeles, officials say. Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles mayor, said Tuesday that video footage shows a branch breaking off a eucalyptus tree and sparking the fire. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which operates the lines, said the utility recently cleared away nearby brush to reduce the risk of fire, but the the branch came from outside the clearance area. The mayor called it \u201can act of God\u201d. (The fact that the wind played a significant role in sparking the fire is a good illustration of why PG&amp;E began shutting off power to begin with). The Los Angeles Times published video of what is believed to be the moment the Getty fire started. The eucalyptus tree isn\u2019t native to California is actually considered an invasive species. Not only can the trees alter fire patterns and soil moisture, but eucalyptus oil is highly flammable and in some places have been known to explode when they catch fire. That\u2019s why efforts have been made in California to clear away the tress in an effort to reduce fire risk. KQED published this explainer several years ago on the tree\u2019s role in fires: Fifteen major fires roared through 9,000 acres of the East Bay Hills between 1923 and 1992, incinerating some 4,000 homes and killing 26 people. The Oakland \u201cTunnel\u201d fire, considered the worst in California history, caused an estimated $1.5 billion in damage, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and killed 25 people. Following the Oakland fire, disaster experts urged large landowners in the East Bay Hills to work together to manage vegetation to prevent another catastrophic wildfire, says Tom Klatt, who manages environmental projects for UC Berkeley and serves on the UC Fire Mitigation Committee. In early October, when PG&amp;E started shutting off power in the area around Oakland as a way to reduce the threat of fire, I visited the Oakland Hills neighborhood and spoke with one home owner who had lived through the devastating fire in \u201892 and rebuilt her home on the same spot. She\u2019s made sure to clear away the Eucalyptus trees on her property since then, she told me. Mario Koran here, picking up the fire-watch from my colleague Joanna Walters. I\u2019ll be bringing you the day\u2019s wildfire news. Let\u2019s get right to it... A fire burning in Simi Valley, a suburb north-west of Los Angeles, is currently burning out of control. By 9.15am, the blaze had been underway for three hours, the Los Angeles Times reports. Authorities have dubbed it the Easy fire. Portions of Simi Valley and the surrounding area are under mandatory evacuation orders and local schools have been closed for the day. Frustration and anger is building across parts of northern California as utility giant Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has undertaken its third round of sweeping blackouts in a week. The company is oping to prevent its electrical equipment from toppling or coming into contact with branches and sparking fires, amid fierce winds and bone-dry, tinderbox conditions. PG&amp;E said Tuesday\u2019s power shut-offs would affect about 1.5 million people in some 30 counties including the Sierra foothills, wine country and San Francisco Bay Area. They included 1 million still without power from a blackout over the weekend. Across the darkened neighborhoods, people worried about charging cellphones and electric vehicles, finding gasoline and cash, staying warm and keeping their food from spoiling, the Associated Press reported a little earlier today. Some ended up at centers set up by PG&amp;E where people could go to power their electronics and get free water, snacks, flashlights and solar lanterns. With no electricity for the fourth straight day, chef and caterer Jane Sykes realized she would have to throw out $1,000 worth of food, including trays of brownies, cupcakes and puff pastry. She also had little hope of getting a good night\u2019s sleep there was no way to run the machine she relies on to counter her apnea. \u201cI don\u2019t think PG&amp;E really thought this through,\u201d she lamented. PG&amp;E officials said they understood the hardships caused by the blackouts but insisted they were necessary. In Sonoma county, fire officials reported progress in their battle against the 120-square-mile Kincade fire, the largest currently burning in the state, saying it was 30% contained. More than 150,000 people were under evacuation orders. Winds are slower than southern California, but still fierce and the fire danger remains high. In southern California fire crews are busy not only dealing with the new Easy fire but also trying to snuff out fully the wildfire in the celebrity-studded hills of the Los Angeles metropolis that destroyed a dozen homes on Monday, the Getty fire. About 9,000 people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and LeBron James, were under evacuation orders from that fire. The Getty fire was caused when a dry branch from a eucalyptus tree was flung 30ft by high winds early Monday into a city department of water and power line and caused sparks, authorities told the AP. LA mayor Eric Garcetti called it an \u201cact of God.\u201d The city had cut away brush and trees from around the line. Meanwhile the National Weather Service issued an unprecedented \u201cextreme red flag warning\u201d for high winds for much of southern California through Thursday evening, indicating the acute risk of fires being started by the dry, hot, windy conditions. No deaths have been reported from the fires, but toppled trees have so far claimed three lives. In northern California, the Kincade fire continues to burn, six days after it ignited. Some images of the Easy fire burning in California this morning: NBC Los Angeles has some good aerial footage of the Easy fire burning near Simi Valley. And here are some initial details from area website LAist. Here\u2019s a brief clip of the wildfire, now dubbed the Easy fire, which broke out earlier today, burning near the Ronald Reagan presidential library. And the Guardian video team in London has gathered some footage together of the California blazes. The new wildfire that broke out near Simi Valley, in southern California this morning has now forced the evacuation of the Ronald Reagan presidential library and nearby homes. The brush fire started just before dawn in the Simi Valley area 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Ventura County officials did not immediately say how big it was or how many people were ordered to leave, the Associated Press reports. Library spokeswoman Melissa Giller said the hilltop museum in Simi Valley was safe and being protected by firefighters. She said hundreds of goats are brought in each year to eat away vegetation that could fuel wildfires on the 300-acre grounds. Harris issues warning on Simi Valley fire California Senator and 2020 candidate Kamala Harris notes in a tweet that schools are closed in districts nearest to the fire burning just outside Simi Valley in southern California, now labeled the Easy fire. In aerial shots of the Ronald Reagan presidential library, on the edge of Simi Valley, about 20 miles north-west of downtown Los Angeles, a line of flame can be seen in the vicinity \u2013 a new brush fire that ignited earlier today. Areas around the library are under mandatory evacuation order, according to local media. Simi Valley suffered a serious wildfire last fall, too. Out of control fires still have an ominous grip on several parts of California and more than 20 million people are affected in the Golden State this Wednesday morning. Firefighters \u2013 and there are more than 5,000 of them battling blazes in the northern and southern parts of the state \u2013 are worried about what the next 24 hours will bring. The seasonal Santa Ana winds blowing down over southern California could be at their strongest for years and today and tomorrow are expected to be particularly dangerous. There may be gusts up to hurricane strength (which means at least 74mph to register as Category 1 strength) and exceeding 80mph. Those who evacuated when the Getty fire broke out west of downtown LA on Monday remain stuck away from home and there are fears that that fire could reignite and that embers blowing away will spark other fires. In northern wine country, the Kincade fire in Sonoma county is burning into its sixth day today. Good morning, wildfire watchers, everyone\u2019s on edge today with the prospect of the seasonal winds being at their strongest, fanning existing fires and sparking new ones. Power blackouts continue and there are official warnings out of extreme fire danger. Here\u2019s where we are as day breaks in California. A new wildfire has erupted in southern California as strong Santa Ana winds blow down from the hills. TV images showed the fire burning before dawn today in Simi Valley, about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, the Associated Press reports this morning. The Ronald Reagan presidential library is in the vicinity. Fire danger warnings blanket a large swath of California because of gusty winds and extremely dry air. The National Weather Service says Santa Ana winds developed more slowly than expected in southern California but strong gusts are topping 50 mph. So far, the winds have stayed away from the section of Los Angeles that burned Monday in the Getty fire, where there\u2019s concern that smoldering embers could be carried away by gusts and start new fires. In Northern California, winds are beginning to decline, but forecasters warn that fire danger remains and the Kincade fire is still ablaze. Utility company Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is cutting power to about 1.5 million people in some 30 counties to prevent high winds from toppling power lines and sparking fires. It\u2019s the third shutoff in a week.",

The top Russia expert on Trump\u2019s National Security Council is expected to leave the White House \u201cimminently\u201d. Donald Trump tweeted a fake image of himself awarding a medal of honor to the military dog involved in the raid that killed the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The interior department is grounding its entire fleet of drones due to security concerns. California senator and 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris is laying off a number of staffers as she restructures her campaign. Rep. Katie Hill will have her final day in Congress on Friday. She is resigning following the publication of nude images of her. Former president Barack Obama will be visiting Silicon Valley on Nov. 21 to fundraise for the DNC in one of his first political appearances in recent memory. Former president Barack Obama will be visiting California on Nov. 21 to raise money for the Democratic Party. The event in Silicon Valley marks his first public appearance of the 2020 campaign cycle and will be the most political appearance he has made since last year\u2019s midterms. Ticket prices for the Democratic National Committee fundraiser range from $10,000 to $355,000 to attend. Katie Hill will have her final day in office on Friday of this week. The California representative announced Sunday that she would resign from Congress following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she engaged in a relationship with one of her staffers. California senator and 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris is laying off a number of staffers in her Baltimore headquarters and sending others to work from Iowa. Harris\u2019s campaign manager Juan Rodriguez announced the changes in a statement on Wednesday, saying he and all other consultants on the campaign would be taking a pay cut. \u201cThese decisions are difficult but will ensure the campaign is positioned to execute a robust Iowa ground game and a minimum 7-figure paid media campaign in the weeks leading up to caucus,\u201d the memo stated. The interior department is grounding its entire fleet of drones due to security concerns, the Wall Street Journal reported. With more than 800 aerial drones, the department has one of the largest fleets in the federal government. The drones are used to fight forest fires, survey erosion, monitor endangered species and inspect dams. They are being grounded due to increasing concerns about national security risks related to their parts being made in China. From the Journal: US officials worry that the country\u2019s reliance on Chinese drones may be putting critical US infrastructure at risk. They are concerned the drones may be sending information back to the Chinese government or hackers elsewhere to use for cyberattacks or other offenses. In September, a group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced legislation to bar federal agencies from buying drones from China and any other country deemed a national-security risk. Stopping drone use would cost the department millions, officials say. It estimates officials executed more than 10,000 drone flights as part of its job to manage more than 500m acres of US land and that using drones saved more than $14m in taxpayer dollars in 2018. Hello, Kari Paul here in San Francisco, taking over the blog for the next few hours. More news to come shortly. The top Russia expert on Trump\u2019s National Security Council is expected to leave the White House \u201cimminently\u201d, NPR reports. Tim Morrison, the official, is slated to testify in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry this Thursday, according to NPR. In Iowa earlier today, Joe Biden talked about his daughter being a social worker, and quipped that \u201cI wish I had raised one Republican, they\u2019d made some real money,\u201d CNN reported. It\u2019s an awkward joke to make as Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, remains at the heart of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. Hunter Biden, a lawyer and former lobbyist, reportedly made up to $50,000 a month for serving on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a decision that he later called \u201cpoor judgment\u201d on his part. This is Lois Beckett in the Guardian\u2019s West Coast office, taking over our live politics coverage. My colleague Kari Paul will be taking over the coverage shortly. Donald Trump tweeted a fake image of himself awarding a medal of honor to the military dog involved in the raid that killed the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The image, apparently produced by the Daily Wire, a conservative site, is an altered version of an actual photograph of Trump awarding the medal of honor in 2017 to James McCloughan, a retired Army medic who was honored for saving the lives of 10 people during the Vietnam war, the New York Times reported. In the image Trump tweeted, the McCloughan\u2019s head has been replaced with the head of the dog, reportedly named \u201cConan\u201d, with his tongue lolling out of his mouth. McCloughan laughed when a Times reporter showed him the two images. including one where his head has been replaced with the head of a dog with its tongue lolling out of its mouth. Military dogs \u201care very courageous\u201d, he said. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: John Bolton has been asked to testify in the impeachment inquiry next week, but it\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s former national security adviser will comply with the request. Two state department officials, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, testified in the impeachment inquiry. They reportedly told investigators that Trump voiced distrust of Ukraine as Bolton raised concerns about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role in US-Ukrainian relations. The House rules committee is currently marking up the resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Republicans have reportedly suggested a number of edits, but they are unlikely to be approved by the Democratic majority of the panel. Twitter announced it is banning political advertising on its platform as Facebook faces backlash over its decision to allow false statements in political ads. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is overhauling her campaign, which has seen dwindling fundraising and polling numbers in recent months. Kari will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry sent a letter to John Bolton\u2019s lawyer asking Trump\u2019s former national security adviser to voluntarily appear before the investigators. The House chairs do not appear to be subpoenaing Bolton at this time. However, the committees have previously issued subpoenas shortly before scheduled interviews due to the White House\u2019s efforts to block witnesses\u2019 testimony. Once again, Bolton seems unlikely to respond to the panels\u2019 request before a judge issues a decision on the case of Charles Kupperman, who is seeking a ruling on whether to comply with his congressional subpoena or the White House\u2019s order not to testify. It\u2019s not yet clear whether John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, will appear for his scheduled deposition in the impeachment inquiry. Bolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, is currently in the midst of a legal battle seeking guidance on whether to comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House\u2019s order not to appear. Given that Bolton and Kupperman share an attorney, Bolton may wait for that judgement before making a decision on whether to talk to impeachment investigators. Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey has announced it is ending political advertising on its platform as Facebook faces backlash over its decision to allow false statements in political ads. The Guardian\u2019s Julia Carrie Wong reports: The new policy, announced via Dorsey\u2019s Twitter account, will come into effect on 22 November and will apply globally to all electioneering ads, as well as ads related to political issues. The timing means the ban will be in place in time for the UK snap election. Twitter had previously implemented rules and restrictions for political advertising. The announcement comes as Facebook is embroiled in a controversy over its decision to exempt ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking and from a policy that bans false statements from paid advertisements. John Bolton shares a lawyer with Charles Kupperman, his former deputy at the national security council who declined to appear for his deposition in the impeachment inquiry earlier this week. Kupperman is seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether he should comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House\u2019s order not to testify. That eventual decision could determine whether Bolton appears as well. The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry reportedly intend to call John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, to sit for a deposition next Thursday. Previous witnesses have reportedly told impeachment investigators that Bolton voiced concerns about the role that Trump\u2019s external advisers, namely Rudy Giuliani, were playing in determining Ukraine policy. The panels also intend to call John Eisenberg, a lawyer at the national security council, and Michael Ellis, one of Eisenberg\u2019s deputies. The Guardian has obtained the memo outlining a massive restructuring of Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign. The memo begins: \u201cWith fewer than 100 days until the Iowa Caucus and in a competitive resources environment, we are implementing an organizational realignment to go all-in on Iowa.\u201d It goes on to say: \u201cFrom the beginning of this campaign, Kamala Harris and this team set out with one goal - to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020. This requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks.\u201d In recent weeks, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro have issued fundraising pleas to their supporters, warning that they would not be able to continue in the race without raising certain amounts of money. Harris is not issuing such a plea here; however, the restructuring may encourage her supporters to send the campaign more money as it reportedly bleeds cash. Harris\u2019 press secretary appeared to acknowledge the restructuring in a tweet, while urging the California senator\u2019s supporters to maintain faith in her prospects. The communications director for Kamala Harris appeared to confirm reports that the campaign is massively restructuring in light of dwindling fundraising and polling numbers. The California Democrat\u2019s campaign appears to be redoubling efforts to focus on Iowa, but Harris is still trailing in polling there to Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. The House rules committee has now gathered to mark up the resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. The Republican members of the committee will almost certainly make suggestions to edit the resolution, but they are unlikely to be taken up by the Democratic majority. Senior House Democrats reportedly intend to vote on the measure tomorrow morning and are confident that the overwhelming majority of their caucus will back it. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who was talked about as a top contender in the race after a strong first debate performance just four months ago, is now dramatically restructuring in light of cashflow issues and dwindling polling numbers. Politico reports: The moves come as Harris is hemorrhaging cash and in danger of lacking the resources to mount a competitive bid against better-funded rivals in Iowa. The overhaul will touch nearly every facet of Harris\u2019 operation, with layoffs or re-deployments coming at headquarters, as well as in New Hampshire, Nevada and her home state of California, a Super Tuesday prize that her advisers once viewed as a big asset. Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez will cut his own salary, according to the memo, which was just over $10,000 a month in the third quarter of the year. Harris\u2019 consultants will also have their payments reduced and the campaign plans to trim and renegotiate other contracts to slash overhead. Along with getting back in the black, a big motivation behind the cost-cutting decisions are plans to stash enough resources for a seven-figure media buy in the weeks before the Iowa caucus. Past presidential campaigns have made comebacks after pursuing extensive overhauls, but the decision to do so indicates how uncertain Harris\u2019 camp feels about a path forward in such a crowded field. A new poll has brought Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard one step closer to qualifying for the November debate. According to the USA Today/Suffolk University poll, Gabbard is receiving the support of 4% of Democratic voters, putting her above candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar. Gabbard now only needs one more poll to make the debate stage. The poll also found that Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren continue to lead the race nationally. Biden was the top choice of 26% of poll respondents, compared to Warren\u2019s 17%. Christopher Anderson has now arrived for his deposition in the impeachment inquiry after Catherine Croft talked to the House investigators for about five hours. Anderson and Croft did not have as much of a direct window into Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy, but the career diplomats were still expected to provide helpful details on how the White House navigated US-Ukrainian relations alongside the president\u2019s external advisers, like Rudy Giuliani. Catherine Croft, a Ukraine expert at the state department, has concluded her deposition in the impeachment inquiry. Christopher Anderson, a career diplomat who served under former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, will speak to the impeachment investigators next. According to reports of his opening statement, Anderson intends to tell the House committees that former national security adviser John Bolton voiced concerns about the influence of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, on Ukraine policy. House Democratic leadership intends to hold a vote on the impeachment resolution tomorrow morning, but that timing could clash with the testimony of Tim Morrison, a national security council official who reportedly listened in on Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Morrison\u2019s testimony was the most highly anticipated going into this week, but there\u2019s a bit less drama surrounding it now that Alexander Vindman has told impeachment investigators of his own firsthand account of the call. Nonetheless, Morrison could provide a crucial link between the White House and Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who said he was told Ukrainian military assistance was held up to demand public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. If senior House Democrats schedule a vote at the same time as Morrison\u2019s testimony, it could distract from any potential leaks out of his appearance, as yesterday\u2019s confusion over the resolution slightly distracted from Vindman\u2019s testimony. It appears that congressional Republicans are not granting Trump\u2019s request that they attack the \u201csubstance\u201d of the impeachment inquiry, rather than the process. Matt Gaetz, one of Trump\u2019s closest allies in the House, has just announced that he is filing an ethics complaint against Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee. Gaetz is accusing the California Democrat of violating House rules in his handling of the inquiry, particularly by exaggerating the White House memo on the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. (Schiff has argued that his remarks on the memo were meant to convey \u201cthe essence\u201d of the call.) However, even some of Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders, like Gaetz, have seemed to avoid weighing in on the president\u2019s reported efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival. That reluctance may only feed Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump\u2019s actions are indefensible. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who testified to impeachment investigators that he was told Ukrainian military assistance was held up to demand announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election, is reportedly willing to testify publicly. CNN reports: There has not been a request yet made for Taylor to testify publicly, according to [a source familiar with the diplomat\u2019s thinking]. But Democrats privately say that Taylor would be a logical choice for one of the first witnesses when the House begins public impeachment hearings. He meticulously documented how he believed the White House had linked Ukraine\u2019s announcing an investigation that could help the President politically with unfreezing of US security aide and a one-on-one meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Taylor\u2019s public testimony would not likely reveal much new information for those who have been closely following the impeachment inquiry. However, it would be a striking visual to have this longtime diplomat, who has served under Republican administrations, publicly detailing the White House\u2019s demands for a foreign power to investigate the president\u2019s political rival. For the millions of Americans who have not been following every update from the investigation, it could make the public hearings a turning point in the impeachment saga. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has officially filed with the New Hampshire secretary of state to appear on the state\u2019s February primary ballot. The filing period begins today and continues through 15 November, so all of the Democratic candidates will be making the trek up to New Hampshire over the next couple of weeks. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump is urging Republicans to attack the \u201csubstance\u201d of the impeachment inquiry, but Mitch McConnell continues to target the process of the investigation without weighing in on the allegations facing the president. Two career diplomats, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, are testifying today in the impeachment inquiry. The two reportedly plan to tell investigators about Trump\u2019s distrust of Ukraine and concerns about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role in US-Ukrainian relations. John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state who has been nominated to become the next US ambassador to Russia, told senators at his confirmation hearing that the former US ambassador to Ukraine was recalled early because Trump lost confidence in her even though she had not done anything wrong. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Alex Padilla, the California secretary of state, has ruled out a bid for Katie Hill\u2019s House seat in the wake of the freshman congresswoman\u2019s resignation. Hill announced Sunday that she would resign from Congress following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she engaged in a relationship with one of her staffers. During his confirmation hearing to become the next US ambassador to Russia, the deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, told senators that the state department has tried to block interview requests tied to the impeachment inquiry \u201con advice\u201d of the department and \u201cdirection from the White House\u201d. Reports have previously indicated that the state department has tried to block some of its employees, including Maria Yovanovitch, from testifying after conferring with the White House. However, the House committees leading the inquiry have responded to those efforts by issuing subpoenas to witnesses, which several administration employees have now complied with. The White House said in a statement that Trump still intended to finalize the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with China in the near future, even though Chile has canceled the summit where it was originally supposed to be signed. White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said: \u201cAs of now, it appears APEC will not occur in Chile, and it\u2019s our understanding the organization does not currently have a secondary site prepared.\u201d But Gidley added: \u201cWe look forward to finalizing Phase One of the historic trade deal with China within the same time frame, and when we have an announcement, we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Trump celebrated the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter, although the annualized rate of 1.9 percent is still down from the 2 percent seen between April and June. The president cheered the \u201cGreatest Economy in American History.\u201d However, many journalists were quick to note that Trump warned the economy was in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d in 2012, even though the economy was then growing at a rate of ... 1.9 percent. Christopher Wray is now testifying alongside other senior officials before the House homeland security committee on domestic terrorism. The FBI director told the House members that he considered domestic terrorism to be \u201ca persistent, evolving threat.\u201d Wray also described a growing, troubling trend of \u201cracially motivated extremists\u201d traveling to Eastern Europe to train. Touching on intellectual property theft, Wray told lawmakers that the FBI has about 1,000 open investigations involving allegations of China stealing US technology. John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state who has been nominated to become the next US ambassador to Russia, affirmed Maria Yovanovitch\u2019s account of her removal as ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch testified to impeachment investigators earlier this month that Sullivan told her she was being recalled early, even though she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d During his confirmation hearing this morning, Sullivan verified those details. The senate confirmation hearing for John Sullivan, deputy secretary of state and nominee to be the next ambassador to Moscow, is underway and Ukraine and impeachment have quickly come to centre stage. It was Sullivan\u2019s job to tell the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, that she was being recalled early. Sullivan said he believed she had served admirably but that Donald Trump had lost confidence in her. He asked Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, for clarification but was told only that the president had lost confidence in her. He said he was aware that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was involved \u201cin a campaign against our ambassador to Ukraine\u201d. He confirmed he had been shown a dossier of material attacking Yovanovitch, saying it had come from the White House to the state department counselor, but he was not aware it had been put together by Giuliani. He said the dossier \u201cdidn\u2019t provide to me a basis for taking action against our ambassador.\u201d He said that the confidence of the president was \u201cthe coin of the realm\u201d for an ambassador, without which it was impossible to function properly. He noted his uncle had to leave his post as ambassador to Iran and subsequently resign because he lost the confidence of President Jimmy Carter. The filing period for the New Hampshire presidential primary begins today and will run through Nov. 15. Over the next couple weeks, all the Democratic presidential candidates will make the journey to the New Hampshire secretary of state\u2019s office to ensure they appear on the February ballot. Mitch McConnell once again criticized the \u201cbizarre\u201d process of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, but the Senate majority leader declined to comment on the allegations against Trump. McConnell\u2019s apparent reluctance to weigh in on the Ukraine allegations is particularly notable given that, just this morning, Trump called on congressional Republicans to attack the \u201csubstance\u201d of the impeachment inquiry, rather than the process. It seems that many GOP lawmakers, including McConnell, are hesitant to defend the president\u2019s alleged actions \u2013 hence their focus on the specific procedures of the inquiry. The Chilean president also announced that he was calling off the UN climate change conference, known as COP25, that was set to be held in Santiago. The announcement shocked many, given that the Chilean foreign minister said just six days ago that there was \u201cno chance\u201d of the global meetings being cancelled due to the escalating protests. The announcement that Chile was cancelling next month\u2019s APEC summit comes amid intensifying protests in the country. CNN reported earlier this week: Chilean President Sebastian Pinera replaced his Cabinet Monday following days of violent protests that have paralyzed the country, seen the military return to the streets, and led to the deaths of at least 20 people. ... Despite the reshuffle, thousands of protesters returned to the streets of the Chilean capital Monday, calling for Pinera\u2019s resignation and clashing with security forces in violent street battles. A fire broke out on the corner of a main street in Santiago, engulfing clothing stores, a McDonald\u2019s and a medical center, according to CNN Chile. Police have responded by firing tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons. Chile has just announced that it is pulling out of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which was scheduled to take place next month. The announcement could jeopardize Trump\u2019s \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with China, given that the president intended to sign the agreement at the summit. Asked about the cancelled summit, White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley told reporters: \u201cWe don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to get to the bottom of it.\u201d The Senate foreign relations committee is holding a confirmation hearing for deputy secretary of state John Sullivan\u2019s nomination as the next US ambassador to Russia. As the deputy to secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Sullivan will certainly be asked by the panel\u2019s Democrats about how the department navigated Ukraine policy with some of Trump\u2019s external advisers, namely Rudy Giuliani, trying to influence decisions. Sullivan was also the official tasked with informing Maria Yovanovitch that she was being recalled from her post. Yovanovitch testified earlier this month that Sullivan told her she had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d and that the president had pressured officials to remove her, an account Sullivan reportedly does not intend to dispute. House Democrats discussed their resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry during a morning meeting, and members reportedly had no questions for the chairman of the rules committee. Christopher Anderson, one of the career diplomats testifying in the impeachment inquiry today, will reportedly tell House investigators that John Bolton voiced concern about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role in deciding Ukraine policy. Anderson worked for two years as an assistant to Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s former special envoy for Ukraine. CNN reports: According to Anderson\u2019s prepared statements, he helped in May to develop \u2018key deliverables\u2019 to show newly-elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s \u2018commitment to reform. 1) demonstrating Zelenskyy\u2019s independence from powerful vested interests and pursuing anticorruption reform as well as antitrust reform; 2) strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian energy cooperation; and 3) improving our bilateral security relationship which included Ukraine increasing its purchases of key U.S. military equipment.\u2019 In the mid-June meeting, \u2018Bolton stated that he agreed with our three lines of effort and that he also supported increased senior White House engagement,\u201d according to the prepared statement. \u2018However, he cautioned that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the President on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement,\u2019 Anderson is expected to tell the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees. Catherine Croft, a Ukraine expert at the state department, has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment inquiry. The career diplomat reportedly intends to tell the House committees leading the inquiry that she repeatedly heard Trump voice distrust of Ukraine, despite the state department\u2019s official position of support for the country. Trump has a fairly light public schedule today, which is leaving him plenty of time this morning to attack House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry over Twitter. The president is urging congressional Republicans to attack the \u201csubstance\u201d of the impeachment inquiry rather than the process. Many of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill have criticized the inquiry for being too secretive, claiming Democrats are wrong to conduct closed-door interviews and not allow Republicans to call witnesses. However, it seems like those complaints may now be moot. If the resolution that House Democrats released yesterday is approved, the inquiry will probably soon move to public hearings and Republicans will be allowed to request witnesses \u2013 although the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee is allowed to deny those requests. The resolution\u2019s release is surely at least partly why Trump is urging his allies to cast doubt on the specific allegations against him. The president also dismissed Alexander Vindman, a national security council official and Purple Heart recipient, as a \u201cNever Trumper witness\u201d. Vindman reportedly told impeachment investigators yesterday that he heard Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and was so alarmed by it he notified his superior of his concerns. Vindman also reportedly testified that the White House omitted key words and phrases about Joe Biden from its memo on the call, which Trump is incorrectly referring to here as a \u201ctranscript\u201d. Vindman\u2019s testimony will probably cast more doubt on the memo and redouble Democrats\u2019 demands to see a full readout of the call. Good morning, live blog readers! House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump continues today with the testimony of two career diplomats, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson. Croft and Anderson will reportedly testify that Trump and some of his advisers voiced distrust of Ukraine in a manner that did not align with the official position of the state department. According to her opening statement, Croft will tell impeachment investigators that she heard Trump \u201cdescribe Ukraine as a corrupt country\u201d, both \u201cdirectly and indirectly\u201d. Their testimony is not expected to create as many waves as that of Alexander Vindman, the national security council official who reportedly told the House committees yesterday that he was concerned after hearing Trump\u2019s Ukraine call and reported it to his superiors. However, each witness seems to be helping to build a larger picture of a president using foreign policy to try to advance his re-election prospects \u2013 and a team of advisers who largely let him do it. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will present the medal of honor to Master Sgt Matthew Williams for \u201cgallantry in Afghanistan\u201d at 5pm ET. The FBI director, Christopher Wray, will testify before Congress at 10am ET. Bill and Hillary Clinton will speak at Georgetown University this evening. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Los Angeles international airport (LAX) has apologized for \u201cunacceptable\u201d wait times after a new policy banning Uber and Lyft from picking up passengers at the curb led to major traffic jams and delays. The new system at the country\u2019s second-busiest airport requires travelers to take a shuttle to a separate area to meet their rideshare drivers, and a bumpy rollout on Tuesday resulted in gridlock and overcrowded shuttles, as well as some passengers waiting more than an hour for their rides. LAX apologized late on Tuesday night for \u201cunacceptable level of service\u201d, admitting there were long waits for shuttles, congestion on the buses, and then long waits for Ubers and Lyfts at the lot. \u201cIt was carmageddon,\u201d Nicole Moore, a Lyft driver in LA, said. Moore, who is also a volunteer organizer with Rideshare Drivers United, wasn\u2019t at LAX herself but said she had heard from drivers who waited 40 or 50 minutes to pick up passengers: \u201cWe\u2019re not paid for those minutes \u2026 This is not good for anyone right now.\u201d The changes in the airport were aimed at addressing congestion in the terminal area of LAX, which has been a growing problem and is expected to get worse due to upcoming construction projects. The airport said shuttles were supposed to arrive every three to five minutes to take travelers to a lot it has called LAXit, where they can then get their Uber or Lyft ride. Authorities previously said that even during congested periods, travelers would be able to catch their ride within half an hour of exiting the terminal. Day one of the new system, however, quickly became chaotic. Some travelers said the time it took to catch an Uber was longer than their flight to LAX, the LA Times reported. The new policy did lead to an increase in business for traditional taxis, which continue to operate on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis, leading some riders who were waiting for Ubers and Lyfts to give up and take a cab, according to the LA Times. LAX also told the paper it was making changes to road stripping, signage and routes to speed up the system. Uber previously criticized the policy, warning that the new lot did not have enough capacity and saying the system would lead to long waits and more traffic. The airport began the new system on a Tuesday, which is typically a light day of travel. That means bigger problems could emerge this weekend. \u201cImagine what it\u2019s going to be like on a Friday. Imagine what it\u2019s going to be like on the holidays,\u201d said Moore, adding that she wished drivers had been more involved in the process of creating the new system: \u201cThere was no real input of the people who do the work \u2026 Drivers count on the airports. This is our bread and butter.\u201d A Lyft spokesperson said the company was trying to decrease wait times, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working closely with LAX airport leadership, and we have an experienced team on the ground making real-time adjustments to improve our operations for both riders and drivers.\u201d Uber and LAX spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

Things will never go right for us until we address those issues and politicians sit down and listen to Aboriginal people. An acknowledgment of country is about recognising the people who look after the country. As a cultural immersion trainer at Charles Sturt University, I teach the Wiradyuri concept of Yindyamarra. It\u2019s a way of life for us that we follow. It means to have respect, to do slowly, to be polite, to be honourable and to be gentle. Everything we do comes back to Yindyamarra. Aboriginal people have still got the knowledge about our country and politicians need to listen to us. Soldiers protect us from invaders but they don\u2019t protect the land. Protecting the land is all of our responsibility. The only person you can put above the land is the creator. As a Christian, Morrison should know that.

The review followed complaints to the commission by former employees about the culture and management at the organisation, including one woman who had suffered a serious sexual assault at a working residential away day.The perpetrator was not a Kick It Out employee or official, and although the charity\u2019s management believed they tried to support the woman as well as they could, the victim felt they lacked adequate expertise and procedures. The Charity Commission opened a \u201cregulatory compliance case\u201d a year ago, and in response Kick It Out, which is funded by the Football Association, Premier League, EFL and Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, commissioned an independent review, led by a QC.

      "bodyText": "The prison system in England and Wales is in an \u201cappalling\u201d state of crisis, lacking decency or security and no clear plan for desperately needed change, MPs have warned in a report that raises questions over the government\u2019s pledges on prisons ahead of an election. The justice committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Bob Neill, condemned Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cpolicy by press notice\u201d approach to prisons following a raft of announcements widely seen as electioneering tactics. The committee condemned the lack of a clear plan for reform and a long-term strategy to \u201creverse the fortunes\u201d of the prison estate and called for detailed plans of how the government would meet a series of pledges it has made to increase funding. Neill said: \u201cThe prison system in England and Wales is enduring a crisis of safety and decency. \u201cToo often we have seen what might be called \u2018policy by press notice\u2019 without any clear or coherent vision for the future of the prison system. \u201cNew prison places might be welcome, but they do nothing to improve the appalling condition of much of the current prison estate, nor the prospect of offering a safe environment in which to rehabilitate offenders.\u201d The report added: \u201cToo often, prisons are identified as needing extra support, but their performance continues to decline. \u201cThere is little point in identifying poor performance if the necessary resources are not then provided to drive improvement.\u201d Amid estimations that reoffending costs \u00a318bn, Neill said violence would not reduce in prisons without proper investment into rehabilitation and activities for inmates. \u201cAt any rate, given government\u2019s poor track record in building prisons, we now want to see the detailed plans for the promised \u00a32.5bn for 10,000 more places, what they\u2019ll look like and when they\u2019ll be up and running,\u201d Neill added. The report also said the latest government announcements had \u201crefreshed concerns over the near \u00a31bn maintenance backlog on the appalling state of existing prison estate\u201d. There were no guarantees that \u201cnecessary infrastructure\u201d would be put in place to avoid overcrowding of prisons in the future, the committee said. It found that the government\u2019s recent announcements on longer sentences for some offenders may over time result in a significantly increased prison population, without any guarantees that the necessary infrastructure will be put in place to avoid further overcrowding. Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \u201cThis report is a scathing indictment of a political failure. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t hesitate to promise more jail time for more people, but it has no plan for how to deliver a decent, safe or effective prison system to accommodate them. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives and public safety are at stake, and making \u2018policy by press notice\u2019 isn\u2019t good enough. \u201cThe people who live and work in prison deserve to be told when overcrowding will end.\u201d Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cNow that we are heading into a volatile election period, it is important that all policy announcements are tempered with the use of evidence \u2013 and it starts with this vital report by the justice committee, which lays bare many of the problems in the prison system.\u201d She accused politicians of too often using plans for prisons for \u201cpersonal political gain\u201d or to come up with \u201csuperficial quick-fix answers when, clearly, a more fundamental solution is needed\u201d. She added: \u201cThe idea of constantly expanding the number of people in prison is simply untenable and at the root of the problem.\u201d The Ministry of Justice said: \u201cWe know that many prisons face challenges but we have been confronting those head-on by recruiting over 4,400 extra officers in the last three years. \u201cThis government is investing tens of millions in security and improving conditions \u2013 an extra \u00a3156m for maintenance, \u00a3100m to ramp up security and tackle drugs issues, and \u00a32.5bn to create 10,000 additional prison places. \u201cWe also fully recognise the value of purposeful activity to reduce reoffending and cut crime, which is why we launched our Education and Employment Strategy which has led to hundreds of new businesses signing up to work with prisoners and help their rehabilitation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of Boris Johnson keeping the keys to No 10 and signing a deal to leave the EU by 31 January was welcomed by many City institutions on Wednesday. Currency traders were also among those to view a fresh Tory mandate as positive news for the UK, sending the value of the pound to $1.287, making a rise of 6% over the last four weeks. Analysts at the financial broker Think Markets said the pound had been boosted by the likelihood of a Johnson victory, which meant \u201cthe threat of no-deal Brexit has receded.\u201d Echoing much of the City\u2019s view on the election outcome, they added: \u201cLooking at the polls, it is highly likely that Boris Johnson would win the election and this means the current deal that he holds with the EU is going to be the basis for divorce with some minor alterations.\u201d Analysts at Berenberg bank said a \u201cBoris Bounce\u201d could also be expected once the prime minister adds tax cuts to his prospectus of higher public spending. The firm\u2019s chief economist, Kallum Pickering, was blunt in his view that a Johnson administration, which he said appeared the most likely outcome at the moment, would cheer investors. \u201cIt would put the UK on the path to an orderly Brexit on 31 January 2020 and it would do away with the risk that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could ever become prime minister and damage the UK with left-wing economic policies,\u201d he said. The Tory and Labour parties are not expected to publish their manifestos for two weeks. Corbyn said Labour would prepare \u201cthe most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen\u201d, while Johnson claimed his would occupy the centre ground with extra spending on the police, schools and infrastructure. There were, however, dissenters in the City who said a Labour victory or a hung parliament offered clear benefits for the business community. The consultancy Capital Economics said a Tory government would deter business investment by continuing to keep a no-deal Brexit on the table until 2020, while a Labour government would exclude a no-deal Brexit and offer the hope to exporters of remaining inside the EU following a second referendum. Trevor Greetham, a respected analyst at Royal London Asset Management, said that while sterling had become less volatile since the election was called, both a Tory or Labour victory would send the pound into reverse. \u201cA hung parliament with the Liberal Democrats as kingmakers would temper some of [Labour and Tory] extremes and it would mean a confirmatory referendum in 2020, with remaining in the EU as an option,\u201d he said. Most analysts said parliament\u2019s decision to hold an election during the crucial three-month shopping period before Christmas \u2013 often referred to as the golden quarter \u2013 could make the current tough trading conditions on the high street even worse for retailers. Graham Bushby, head of restructuring at accounting firm RSM, said retail insolvencies were already high and could increase as creditors, who usually keep faith with shops until at least after Christmas, throw in the towel early. \u201cA general election is likely to make life pretty tough for retailers who rely on the golden quarter in the lead-up to Christmas to boost revenues and profits,\u201d he said. Adding to retailers\u2019 woes, the latest GfK consumer confidence survey reported a sharp decline in respondents saying their personal finances would improve over the next year. Olivier Konzeoue, a currency trader at stock broker Saxo Markets, said large businesses, and especially retailers, needed the election to deliver a clear outcome. \u201cFTSE companies such as retailers and exporters could come under pressure. These businesses need the withdrawal agreement to be put in place as any extension proves costly \u2013 impairing their profitability,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestment plans would have to be delayed yet again and export contracts put on hold while retailers could see their revenues hit during the crucial Christmas sales period.\u201d Three key issues: Utility companies immediately came under pressure following the election announcement as the prospect of nationalisation by Labour hit their values. The shadow chancellor has hinted that he will purchase the shares of water companies at a discount price. A Tory victory would see a dramatic recovery. Banks have secured temporary access to European markets and are largely insulated from a no-deal Brexit. But they will be looking for a comprehensive trade deal to give them longer term access and a long wait for a trade agreement would knock their shares. \u201cThe banking and insurance sectors will welcome any progress [towards a deal],\u201d said Konzeoue. The health service will be a crucial battleground as Johnson seeks to defend himself against accusations that he plans to outsource large parts to private companies, possibly following a trade deal with the US. Private health companies have increased their share of NHS work in recent years and a Tory victory is likely to give them greater leverage in the race for more contracts.",

      "bodyText": "The Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) has withdrawn campaigning support for Labour in the upcoming general election in protest at its handling of antisemitism cases. As one of the oldest socialist societies affiliated to Labour, the group regularly sent out activists to support candidates across the country before voters went to the polls. However, for what is believed to be the first time in its 100-year history, it will not organise members to head out to constituencies and instead only support \u201cexceptional candidates\u201d, such as its parliamentary chair, Ruth Smeeth, and other MPs it views as having been supportive. A statement released by the organisation said: \u201cWe will not be campaigning unless in exceptional circumstances and for exceptional candidates, like our parliamentary chair Ruth Smeeth, and members of the parliamentary Labour party who\u2019ve been unwavering in their support of us. We will not be giving endorsements to candidates in non-Labour-held seats.\u201d JLM credits its campaigning work as securing Labour wins in Bury South in 2017 and 2015, Leeds North West in 2017, holding Hampstead and Kilburn in 2015 and winning Hornsey back in 2015 from the Liberal Democrat minister Lynne Featherstone. The organisation, which has 2,500 members, blames the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for allowing a \u201cculture of antisemitism to emerge and fester\u201d within the party. The JLM\u2019s stand comes after the organisation\u2019s honorary president, Dame Louise Ellman, along with the former parliamentary chair, Luciana Berger, left the party citing antisemitic abuse and bullying. Its statement added: \u201cWhen two accomplished and dedicated Jewish Labour MPs no longer see a place for themselves in the Labour party, it\u2019s clear that the party has lost its way.\u201d It said the effective strike does not mean the group no longer supports Labour\u2019s policies and historic values, or that they want to see Boris Johnson or the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, as prime minister. \u201cThe Jewish Labour Movement has a long and proud history of activism in the Labour party and the wider Labour movement and 2020 marks our 100th anniversary of affiliation to the Labour party,\u201d it said. \u201cThis crisis of antisemitism in the Labour party stems from a failure of leadership from Jeremy Corbyn. When the answer has been to take swift, decisive action, the reality has been equivocation and token gestures.\u201d At JLM\u2019s annual general meeting in April, its members unanimously adopted a policy that declared Corbyn to be \u201cunfit to be prime minister\u201d. There had been a discussion about disaffiliation but this was voted down in meetings held in London and Manchester. Labour has said it is taking decisive and robust action against antisemitism and Corbyn has said it has no place in society.",
