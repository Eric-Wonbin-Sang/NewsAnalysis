      "bodyText": "Paul Doyle was at the King Power Stadium to see Liverpool record their latest victory. Here\u2019s how he saw it all unfold. Jurgen Klopp speaks: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be less interested to be honest,\u201d he tells Amazon\u2019s Gaby Logan, when asked how he\u2019s going to cope with people telling him his team has already won the title. \u201cI\u2019ve faced that question a couple of times already tonight. On the match: \u201cIt was a good game,\u201d he says. \u201cThe start was good and the finish was really good and in between we had a lot of work to do. There was a lot of good football and a lot of good defending.\u201d Kasper Schmeichel speaks: \u201cI think it was a bit tough,\u201d he tells Amazon. \u201cWe were in the game until the referee had to make himself a hero. Then we lost our composure. They are the best side in the world along with Manchester City. We strive to be like Manchester City and Liverpool but they are a lot further along in their journey.\u201d He is upset with the decision to award a penalty against Caglar Soyuncu for hand-ball. \u201cCaglar had less than a millisecond to react,\u201d he says. \u201cHe is desperate to give it, once he does they are never going to turn it over.\u201d Having seen replays of the penalty decision, I can understand his frustration. Trent Alexander-Arnold speaks: \u201cWe played really good football, especially after all the travelling we\u2019ve had to do.,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I suppose in that context it was one of our best performances of the season. To score four goals in a place like this is never easy.\u201d On his goal: \u201cI don\u2019t get on the scoresheet too often and I thought, yeah, just hit it first time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think you\u2019re going to be in this position but we\u2019re not going to take anything for granted and just keep going,\u201d he says, when asked about Liverpool\u2019s 13-point lead at the top of the table. Alongside him, James Milner concurs, saying it\u2019s only halfway through the season and \u201canything can happen\u201d. Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s goal. With so much going on, I might not have done it justice, but Michael from Birmingham has been in touch to put it in a bit of context. It was, he says, \u201creminiscent of Carlos Alberto in 1970.\u201d Praise indeed and he\u2019s not wrong. The player himself looked extremely pleased with himself after scoring it. Liverpool\u2019s players are beaming: And so is their manager, as they all go to applaud their exceedingly pleased travelling fans. They were excellent tonight and could scarcely have been more efficient against a team that didn\u2019t give \u2013 or simply weren\u2019t let give \u2013 a very good account of themselves. Jamie Vardy barely got a sniff of the ball, while James Maddison was anonymous, anything but his usual creative self. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at the King Power Stadium, where Liverpool have cruised to victory with an imperious performance. Trent Alexander-Arnold was the stand-out performer, providing two assists, winning his side a penalty and getting amongst the goals as his side romped to victory. Liverpool are 13 points clear of second placed Leicester in the race for the title and have a game in hand on their closest rivals. 90 min: The game enters its knockings, with Liverpool about to stretch their lead at the top of the table to 13 points. It would take a collapse of comically epic proportions for them to lose the title from here. They are unquestionably the best team in the league and look stone wall certainties to win it for the first time since 1990. 87 min: On Amazon Prime Video, Ally McCoist is on co-comms alongside Jon Champion. He\u2019s asked who his man of the match is and says, without hesitation: \u201cTrent Alexander-Arnold, over and out. End of discussion.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. The young Liverpool right-back has been sensational tonight, scoring one goal, providing two assists and more or less winning them a penalty with a beautifully delivered corner which caused panic in the Leicester defensive ranks. 84 min: Jamie Vardy shoots into the side-netting from a tight angle after being teed up by a reverse pass from Caglar Soyuncu. The jig is very much up for Leicester, but they continue to plug away as their fans stream out of the stadium to find some Boxing Day succour in the pub. 81 min: Henderson limps to the touchline and is replaced by Adam Lallana. It doesn\u2019t look like too serious an injury for the Liverpool captain, who might have a bruised shin in the morning. While leaving the pitch, he had a few choice words for Ayoze Perez, whose scything tackle was not appreciated. 80 min: Jordan Henderson goes to ground following a challenge from Perez, grimacing with pain and clutching his left calf or shin. Now Alexander-Arnold gets on the scoresheet, firing into the bottom left-hand corner from distance, with a fine first-time shot after being teed up by Sadio Mane. He let the ball roll across his body onto his left foot and could scarcely have struck a sweeter shot. 77 min: Leicester substitution: James Maddison, who has had an absolute shocker tonight, makes way for Hamza Choudhury. Yet another assist from Alexander-Arnold, who has been outstanding tonight. He drills a low cross into the penalty area and it\u2019s converted by Roberto Firmino, who fires into the top corner. 73 min: While he won\u2019t get one, Trent Alexander-Arnold deserves another tick in the assist column for his part in the build-up to Liverpool\u2019s second goal. His corner was sublime and Soyuncu was in an awful dither as he tried to clear it. 73 min: Leicester substitution: Ayoze Perez on for Dennis Praet. Liverpool double their lead, with James Milner scoring with his first kick of the ball. Schemiechel dived to his left, but Milner slotted the ball low and down the middle. The corner comes in and Soyuncu handles the ball with his left arm. He protests his innocence, but he looks bang to rights to me. Just on the field, James Milner prepares to take the spot-kick. 69 min: A Salah shot is put out for a corner by Caglar Soyuncu. Before it\u2019s taken, Jurgen Klopp replaces Mo Salah and Naby Keita with Divock Origi and James Milner. 67 min: Alisson dawdles over a kick-out and is castigated by Jamie Vardy and booed by the crowd for time-wasting. On the touchline, Liverpool are preparing to make a double-substitution. 65 min: Leicester have upped the tempo and are giving Liverpool a better run for their money than at any point previously in this game. Their fans are enthused by these signs of life and are roaring their team on. 64 min: Much better from Leicester, for whom Ricardo wriggles in behind the Liverpool defence and tries to pull the ball back from the byline towards Vardy, who\u2019d stolen a yard of space. The pass is intercepted by Virgil van Dijk. 63 min: Maddison overcooks his free-kick and sends the ball wide of the far post, when he almost certainly meant to cross it. Or did he? 62 min: Jamie Vardy finally gets to cut loose, sprinting downfield on a counter-attack from a Liverpool corner that should have been a goal kick. Joe Gomez hacks down Vardy just outside the penalty area, almost in line with the left edge of it. A free-kick for Leicester and a booking for the Liverpool centre-half. Leicester substitution: Harvey Barnes has just been replaced by Marc Albrighton. 59 min: Incredible stuff from Alexander Arnold, who catches a through ball down the inside left on the half volley, sending another sublime cross into the Leicester penalty area. Schmeichel has his wits about him and comes off his line to get down and cut it out. 57 min: Alexander-Arnold is making hay down the right flank this evening and sends another cross towards the far post. Robertson heads it across the face of goal, where a clearly offside Firmino brings a smart save out of Schmeichel with a header. The flag goes up, so it wouldn\u2019t have counted if he\u2019d scored. 56 min: This time Robertson turns provider, whipping a glorious gross from the buyline towards the near post. The ball\u2019s on a plate for Firmino, who somehow skims it across the face of goal and wide. 54 min: A chipped cross from Alexander-Arnold stands the ballup nicely for Mane, but he\u2019s unable to divert it goalwards. 53 min: Alexander-Arnold swing the corner into the penalty area, where Schmeichel goes to ground under a challenge from Virgil van Dijk.The ball ricochets towards Salah, who sends it high over the bar. 51 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold tries to pick out Andy Robertson with a floated cross towards the far post. Running back towards his own goal, Ricardo leaps to put the ball out for a corner before it meets its target. 50 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold tries to send in a cross from the right flank, but his delivery is blocked and put out for a throw-in by Ben Chilwell. 49 min: James Maddison, who has struggled to make any sort of impact on this game, fails to clear the first defender with a terrible corner-kick. 48 min: Youri Tielemens wins a corner, his long-range effort taking a deflection off the heel of Joe Gomez. 47 min: Kasper Schmeichel leathers the ball out of play for a Liverpool throw-in. I have no idea what he was trying to do there, but there wasn\u2019t a team-mate within 20 yards of that clearance. 46 min: Liverpool immediaterly go on the attack again, with Gini Wijnaldum, on the ball. He attempts to pick out Mo Salah, but his pass is intercepted. 46 min: Leicester get the second half underway, with no changes in personnel on either side. Peep! The teams go in for the break with Liverpool leading courtesy of Roberto Firmino\u2019s downward header after he leapt to get on the end of Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s long diagonal cross. Liverpool have spurned several easier chances, with Sadio Mane and Mo Salah both guilty of uncharacteristically sloppy efforts to finish. 45 min: Half-time can\u2019t come quick enough for Leicester, who desperately need to regroup and will consider themselves lucky to be only one down at the break. 43 min: The quality of Liverpool\u2019s cross-field passing, a play-switching tactic they employ with monotonous regularity but is terribly difficult to defend against, has been outstanding tonight. Henderson, Alexander-Arnold, Robertson and Van Dijk, among others, have all played inch-perfect passes from one side of the pitch to the other at various points in this first half. 41 min: Liverpool win another corner, but nothing comes of it and Leicester clear. 38 min: From being very loud and boisterous before the game and in it\u2019s early stages, the Leicester City supporters have been silenced, for the time being at least. Liverpool have been vastly superior to their team and would be further ahead but for some profligacy in front of goal. They\u2019ve registered seven shots on target, compared to none by the home side. Leicester have been uncharacteristically sloppy and will be getting a rocket from their manager at half-time. 36 min: Replays show that Ben Chilwell was more than a little culpable for that Liverpool goal. With Liverpool players queuing up at the back post, waiting for Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross, he dropped back and played them all onside. 34 min: Sadio Mane shakes his head after missing a gilt-edged chance to double Liverpool\u2019s lead. With the goal at his mercy, he shoots straight at Schmeichel, who got down, spread his arms and legs, then saved with his chest. 32 min: It was another sublime delivery from Alexander-Arnnold, who sent a raking diagonal ball towards the far post, where both Firmino and Salah were waiting. Firmino got the jump on Ben Chilwell, to head Liverpool into a one-goal lead. Roberto Firmino heads Liverpool into the lead, leaping highest at the far post to convert a wonderful cross from assist-merchant Trent Alexander-Arnold. His downward header sneaks in at the bottom corner. 29 min: Liverpool string together a long sequence of passes, over and back from side to side of the pitch a few yards either side of the halfway line. They eventually get the ball forward and win a corner, when the ball goes out of play off Roberto Pereira. 27 min: Dennis Praet pulls the ball back to Vardy in the Liverpool penalty area and the striker\u2019s shot towards goal is blocked. Had he scored it wouldn\u2019t have counted, as Praet was correctly flagged for offside in the build-up. 26 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold floats the ball towards Salah in a good position on the left side of the Leicester penalty area, but Jonny Evans leaps to intercept the pass with his head. 22 min: Something of a lull in what has been an intriguing contest so far. It ends with Mo Salah going to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Ben Chilwell after getting goalside of the full-back to pick up a cross from midfield. Any debate over whether or not he deserves a penalty or free-kick is rendered redundant by Salah being flagged for offside. 19 min: Liverpool corner. The ball\u2019s sent into the penalty area and Leicester find themselves attacking on the counter. Harvey Barnes finds himself haring towards the Liverpool penalty area with the ball at his feet, but Alisson is quick off his line to put a stop to his gallop., with the help of Joe Gomez 17 min: Dennis Praet sends a decent delivery into the Liverpool penalty area, where Andy Robertson clears. 15 min: Another defensive error from Leicester gifts possession to Jordan Henderson on the outskirts of the Leicester penalty area. He advances towards goal and unleashes a shot. Wilfred Ndidi half-blocks and sends the ball looping ominously in the direction of his own goal. With Schmeichel beaten, it drops just wide of the upright. But for Ndidi\\\u2019s intervention, I suspect that would have gone in. 14 min: Salah plays the ball into the Leicester penalty area, trying to pick out Roberto Firmino. Jonny Evans sticks out a leg to make an important interception. 11 min: Leicester win a corner, when Andy Robertson puts a Maddison cross towards Vardy out of play. They take it and Liverpool attack on the counter. Sadio Mane plays a long pass towards Salah, who is through on goal in a one-on-one with Schmeichel. A heavy touch from the Egyptian takes him away from goal and he finds himself attempting to shoot from a ridiculously narrow angle. He hits the side-netting, when he should have crossed for Mane and Firmino, who were up in support. 9 min: After a very shaky start, Leicester finally appear to be settling into their stride. They get forward courtesy of good work from Wilfred Ndidi and Tielemans, who try to play Vardy in behind the Liverpool defence. Alexander-Arnold is back to cover. 8 min: James Maddison wins a free-kick halfway inside their own half when James Maddison is felled by a kick on the ankle from Trent Alexander-Arnold. 8 min: Andy Robertson tries to drill a cross into the Leicester penalty area from the inside left channel, but his delivery is blocked. 7 min: Harvey Barnes is flagged for offside while chasing a pass from Youri Tielemans down the right flank. 5 min: Kasper Schmeichel is quick off his line to collect a Sadio Mane through-ball which Salah was chasing. It\u2019s been a very strong start by Liverpool. 4 min: That was a poor miss from Mane, who perhaps wasn\u2019t expecting the ball to come his way. He\u2019s shinned it wide, when you\u2019d have put the farm on him to open the scoring from inside the six-yard box. 2 min: Sadio Mane misses an excellent opportunity to put Liverpool ahead, getting in behind Jonny Evans to get on the end of a cross from the right from Mo Salah, the flight of which the defender misjudged. From a couple of yards out, he fails to make clean contact with the ball and somehow contrives to put it high and wide. 1 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold tries his luck with an early shot from outside the penalty area, forcing Kasper Schmeichel to make an early save. 1 min: Liverpool get the ball rolling, their players wearing red shirts, shorts and socks. The players of Leicester wear their customary home strip of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. Out they go ... Kasper Schmeichel and Jordan Henderson lead their respective teams out on to the pitch, where a bugler is playing the Post Horn Gallop to herald their arrival. Not long now: The King Power Stadium is briefly shrouded in darkness, but it\u2019s not because somebody forgot to put 50p in the meter, but merely a precursor to a pre-match light show. Kick-off is less than 10 minutes away. Brendan Rodgers speaks: \u201cHe\u2019s right up there,\u201d Leicester\u2019s manager says, when asked where Jamie Vardy ranks among the players he\u2019s managed. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant player for us, he sets the tone for everything. He\u2019s a real talisman, and a great striker, but for us it\u2019s all about the team.\u201d On Leicester\u2019s chances of reeling in Liverpool: \u201cThere\u2019s 10 points in it and that seems a lot but over a period of games it\u2019s not a huge amount,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we need a performance tonight, to forget about the title race and just perform well.\u201d Jurgen Klopp speaks. \u201cI don\u2019t have to think about things like this, because I am the one who has to prepare after this for [all our next games],\u201d the Liverpool manager tells Amazon Prime Video, upon being asked if victory tonight would take Liverpool a significant step closer to winning the title. \u201cYou can win all those games but you can also lose them. I have never understood this talk [about winning the league] when we are less than halfway through the season. You can ask, but I can\u2019t really answer because I don\u2019t want to think about these things.\u201d Those line-ups: Leicester City make one change from the team that lost against Manchester City last weekend, with Ayoze Perez making way for Dennis Praet. In the only change from the Liverpool team that started the World Club Cup final in Qatar, Gini Wijnaldum has recovered from his hamstring injury and starts in place of the injured Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Leicester (4-1-4-1): Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell, Ndidi, Barnes, Praet, Tielemans, Maddison, Vardy. Subs: Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Ward, Perez, Choudhury. Liverpool (4-3-3): Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson, Keita, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Milner, Adrian, Lallana, Shaqiri, Origi, Jones, Williams. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) Early team news With the possible exception of Harvey Barnes, who was due to undergo a fitness test today, Brendan Rodgers has a full Leicester squad to choose from, but his opposite number is not so lucky. Jurgen Klopp must make do without Fabinho, who remains sidelined with the ankle ligament injury he suffered against Napoli and is a big loss in midfield. He is joined on the sidelines by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren, while Gini Wijnaldum is a slight doubt but expected to feature in some capacity after recovering from a hamstring injury. When last they met ... A late, late James Milner winner from the penalty spot deep in added time earned Liverpool the points when these sides met at Anfield in early October. Sadio Mane had given Liverpool a first half lead, only for James Maddison to equalise with 10 minutes remaining. With four minutes of added time behind them, a Marc Albrighton foul on Mane resulted in a penalty for Liverpool, which Milner dispatched with a minimum of fuss. Season\u2019s greetings everyone and welcome to our minute-by-minute coverage of the Boxing Day clash between Leicester City and Liverpool. With a ten point lead at the top of the table, the newly crowned Club World Cup champions already look a shoo-in to win their first title since 1990 and a win tonight over their nearest rivals would give them a 13 point lead, having played one game fewer than tonight\u2019s opponents. Manchester City, in third place, have today off ahead of their own potentially tough assignment at Wolves tomorrow. Should Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers mastermind victory over his former side, Liverpool will remain in the box-seat as far as the title race is concerned, albeit having shown rare signs of fallibility. Kick-off is at 8pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Bye! By way of parting gift, here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report from Old Trafford: Manchester United again illustrated their Jekyll and Hyde character by rebounding from Sunday\u2019s dismal defeat at Watford with this smooth-geared, canter of a victory. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side even gave Newcastle United the advantage of a goal lead during a dire few first-half minutes before upping quality and control to pull away and display a ruthlessness they sometimes lack. Much more here: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is happy: We\u2019ve done well today. At 1-0 down obviously you\u2019re not sure, but then all season we\u2019ve had one defeat and we haven\u2019t lost the next one, so the reaction was really good. Today was 10-15 minutes of everything going right. Of course we made mistakes. Today was a good day for us. We made it comfortable. Second half I think both teams were looking at the game in two days\u2019 time. I think we\u2019re moulding the group together. We\u2019re finding our identity. We need to know our identity. We can\u2019t wait until next season. We\u2019re not going to win the league this year, but we need to think about winning trophies this year. Burnley will be a different kind of game, you need to roll your sleeves up and take the fight. Steve Bruce is not happy. We\u2019ve had a horrible 20 minutes before half-time, and just after half-time as well, when we\u2019ve made too many mistakes, and one thing about individual error, you can\u2019t account for [it]. You come here, the one thing you can\u2019t do is gift Manchester United and unfortunately, I know it\u2019s Christmas, but we\u2019ve given away more goals in half an hour than we have done in three months. It\u2019s a harsh lesson for us, but at this level you can\u2019t make the mistakes that we\u2019ve just made, and you get punished. I thought for half an hour were were as good as we get, and then we\u2019ve gifted them. We\u2019ve gifted them a goal to start with, and two or three goals we should be doing better. And all of a sudden the game\u2019s away from you. You can\u2019t go chasing it, otherwise they\u2019ll rip you to bits. They\u2019ve stuck at it in the last half-hour, but it was a difficult afternoon for us. For half an hour we gave as good as we got, and we\u2019ve made bad mistakes. And at any level when you give bad mistakes away then you get punished, especially when you come here. It was a strange game. Newcastle started with a predictable but decent plan, and when they took the lead all seemed good. But they created two of the Manchester United goals with terrible defensive passes, the goalkeeper should have kept out the first, and they were all-round abysmal in the second half. Harry Maguire has a chat. The first 20 minutes they had a good chance, and then we gave a sloppy goal away. We were too open, too wide as a back four. We learn from it. We showed great mentality to come back into the game after a bad result in our last game, and shows the boys have good spirit. Four great goals. We know we can score goals. We\u2019ve got to make sure our mentality\u2019s right. We\u2019ve been a bit inconsistent this season and that\u2019s something we need to work on. Against Watford we weren\u2019t at it, but the boys showed great intensity today, all through the game, and we deserved the three points. We\u2019ve now got a big game in two days\u2019 time [at Burnley]. We remain focused. The story of our season up to now is we put in a good performance, and then follow that up with a not so good one. We need to find that consistency. We\u2019ve got to keep pushing, keep working, and make sure our mentality\u2019s right for that one. Today\u2019s final Premier League game sees the top two face off at the King Power Stadium. Join Barry Glendenning for that one: 90+4 mins: It\u2019s all over! A match the home side started very awkwardly turned into a procession long before the end. Manchester United go seventh, a point behind Spurs in fifth with identical goal difference. 90+2 mins: There will be about three minutes of stoppage time, incidentally. 90+1 mins: Manchester United are toying with Newcastle as the game enters stoppage time, passing the ball around the edge of the area, trying to work another opportunity for a hopeless long-range shot. Pogba gives the ball away, but they have it back within a few seconds. 88 mins: Fred is the latest player to put a coin in the shot-from-distance slot machine. His effort is dismal. Goal kick. 88 mins: The final substitution of the game sees Emil Krafth replace Schar. 84 mins: Now Shaw has a shot from distance, which deflects into Dubravka\u2019s arms. This game has really been petering out for half an hour or more and, like a fox in a fence, could do with being put out of its misery. 81 mins: Yedlin is booked for, er, something that happened at some point. The \u201cfoul\u201d shown by Amazon to illustrate his booking couldn\u2019t possibly have actually been the cause of it. 80 mins: Chance for Pogba! Mata plays a lovely pass infield from the left wing, and Pogba attempts a difficult first-time left-foot finish as the ball bounces across him and gets nothing on it at all. 79 mins: Save! After all that pointless passing Maguire gets the ball, bursts forward, and has a 30-yard shot that Dubravka tips wide! 78 mins: Man Utd pass the ball about. Newcastle don\u2019t do much to stop them, and the home side don\u2019t seem that bothered about moving it into dangerous areas. 75 mins: Newcastle do a thing! Sean Longstaff nutmegs Fred and then blasts a 35-yarder over the bar. 72 mins: They\u2019re showing off now. Pereira does a spinning backheel flick to Mata, who crosses to Greenwood, who can\u2019t finish. 69 mins: Lingard chips a pass into the area for Mata to run on to. Dubravka reaches it first but forgets how to catch, and for a moment it looks like Mata will get an easy goal before the goalkeeper finally claims it. 68 mins: Martial is off, and Mata is on. Greenwood, presumably, will move infield from the right. 65 mins: Man Utd are in full and complete control of this game, with what suspense their remains surrounding quite how big the scoreline is going to get. 63 mins: Further substitutional news: DeAndre Yedlin replaces Almiron for Newcastle, and Jesse Lingard replaces Rashford for Man Utd. 61 mins: Martial tries to beat Dubravka at his near post again, with a low 20-yarder. This time the post itself gets in the way! 60 mins: Gayle goes off having missed his only decent chance, and Atsu comes on. 59 mins: Rashford is played through. The linesman raises his flag but the referee allows the move to progress. Rashford teases Dubravka for a while, takes his time, waits until the goal is genuinely gaping and then misses it completely. Replays confirm it was indeed offside. 57 mins: Pogba resists the temptation to shoot from long-range, carries the ball forward for 10 yards or so and then caves in to the temptation to shoot. Dubravka makes an easy save, and Martial is a bit annoyed that his run into the area wasn\u2019t rewarded. 57 mins: Schar is back on, and celebrates by thumping a shot well over the goal from way out. 55 mins: It looks like Martial accidentally trod on Schar\u2019s hand as he tried to get to the ball there. The Newcastle defender is bleeding, and in some discomfort. He gets some treatment on the pitch, and then leaves it for a bit more. 53 mins: Pereira tries to play in Martial, rather than the unmarked Greenwood to his right, and Schar covers the Frenchman\u2019s run and cuts out the ball. Newcastle are in danger of letting this get embarrassing. Another Christmas present from Newcastle! Sean Longstaff spins on the ball, just inside his own half, and plays a delightful if unintentional pass to Martial, who runs clear, looks to have given Dubravka a chance with a poor touch but catches up with the ball in time to dink it over the keeper! 50 mins: Ooof! The ball rolls to Pogba, 30 yards from goal, and he hits a first-time shot that sets off in the right direction but then curls away. 49 mins: Manchester United appear in full control now. They continue to massively dominate possession, though with this team that isn\u2019t necessarily a positive, while Newcastle struggle to string two passes together. 46 mins: Peeeeep! The second half is happening. The players come back out, and Pogba will indeed replace McTominay. Paul Pogba is warming up and presumably coming on at the break. You\u2019d expect McTominay to be the one to make way, given that he was booked after 20 seconds and has repeatedly flirted with disciplinary disaster. 45+3 mins: Peeeeep! A game that appeared to be following Newcastle\u2019s script for the first half-a-half turned rapidly in the other direction in the second half-a-half. Martial\u2019s shot shouldn\u2019t really have gone in, but Greenwood\u2019s was irresistible if deflection-assisted, the third was all about Wan-Bissaka\u2019s excellent delivery, and the home side are now in control. 45+2 mins: Joelinton has a shot from wide on the left, which De Gea saves easily. 45+1 mins: Into the first of two additional minutes, and another excellent Wan-Bissaka cross is headed away. 44 mins: Martial spins on the halfway line. To his right two red shirts are moving, and for a while unmarked. But instead of passing to either of them, he runs forward, gets into the penalty area and falls over. The referee is unimpressed. 42 mins: The goal stands! McTominay\u2019s hand had brushed Matty Longstaff\u2019s face, but it certainly wasn\u2019t a foul and you couldn\u2019t possibly classify the result as a head injury. And another! Wan-Bissaka\u2019s right-wing cross is headed in by Rashford at the far post! Newcastle aren\u2019t happy, because they had a player down and apparently injured as the move progressed... 40 mins: Now Greenwood crosses low from the right, but Martial can\u2019t turn it in. These last few minutes have been full of aggression and attacking intent from the home side. 39 mins: Now United cross from the left, and Lindelof, beyond the far post, hits a wild left-foot volley way high of goal. 38 mins: Rashford is taken out on the left wing, and from the free-kick Pereira curls the ball towards the near post, and Dubravka makes the save! Oh, hello! Shar foolishly gives the ball to Greenwood, 35 yards from goal, who carries it towards the edge of the box and then hits a ferocious shot, which clips off Fernandez on its way into the roof of the net! 34 mins: This is a bit of a strange game, full of lulls and longeurs. Pereira gets himself booked for an untidy challenge. 30 mins: Another shot from distance by Manchester United, Pereira this time sending the ball skimming wide. 27 mins: McTominay has his latest attempt at getting a second yellow card, pulling back Almiron, but having been so very keen on booking him the first time, Kevin Friend is really not at all interested in doing it again. 26 mins: Now Man Utd are stretching the visitors on both flanks and looking more dangerous, though their delivery from wide isn\u2019t reliably good. United equalise with their first decent shot! They work the ball down the left and pull back to Pereira, who taps it straight to Martial, whose shots towards the near post is well struck but should have forced Dubravka into a regulation save - instead he gets two hands on it and lets it slip through them. 21 mins: What a strangely fallible side this Manchester United team is. They win a fourth corner, from which Greenwood eventually does that Greenwood thing of jinking onto his left foot and shooting. It looks like it would have nestled inside the far post had a defender not been in the way. 18 mins: There\u2019s a delay while VAR checks to see if the bouncing ball hit Joelinton\u2019s arm in the build-up, but they decide it didn\u2019t. Now they do take the lead! Almiron finds Longstaff with a fine infield pass and he chips the ball through to Joelinton, who holds off Maguire, turns and lays back to Longstaff, who controls and then passes into the corner of the net! 16 mins: What a chance for Newcastle, and what a miss from Gayle! Joelinton plays him through, and as United hesitate in search of an offside flag Gayle homes in on goal but with De Gea exposed blasts his shot over the bar! 14 mins: Newcastle break; Willems\u2019 pass is cut out but the visitors win it straight back and move it to Almiron, on the left-hand corner of the area, whose shot flies wide of the near post. 12 mins: Manchester United win a free-kick, 10 yards or so outside the area and left of central. Rashford takes it, and his shot flicks off the wall on its way behind. 10 mins: And McTominay continues to hog my updates by having the game\u2019s first shot. It was from quite a distance, and was pretty useless. 7 mins: McTominay appears to have recovered from whatever was making him limp earlier, and is thus free to throw himself into more challenges. United are dominating these early exchanges, without really worrying the Newcastle defence. 4 mins: Now McTominay is hobbling, after chucking himself into another couple of clumsy challenges, neither of which seemed particularly wise in the circumstances. 1 min: Scott McTominay gets booked innside 20 seconds, for fouling Sean Longstaff. It\u2019s extremely harsh in my opinion: there was very little contact, and you never get booked for that kind of challenge in the opening minute of a game. Well, not never, obviously, but close enough. 1 min: Peeeeeep! The home side get the game started. And out they come! The players are busily handshaking as I type, kick-off just moments away. The players are in the tunnel! Seven Boxing Day Premier League games down, two to go, and the next a couple of minutes away. Steve Bruce has a chat: To ask Big Andy to play three games in six days, we erred on caution then, and the same goes for Jonjo. It was a case of maybe having to patch up, but we\u2019re quietly confident that we can make a good account of ourselves. They [the Longstaffs] will come in and throw lots of effort and endeavour, two brothers coming to take on Man Utd at Old Trafford, how fantastic for them. We\u2019ve done OK of late. It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t get away. We\u2019ve shown a bit of consistency, been difficult to beat, and we\u2019re going to have to show those traits today. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a chat: It\u2019s still early days for Paul and we still feel he needs to be drip-fed into this, and play more and more and gradually. Andreas and Mason will freshen us up. Scott McTominay has been fantastic all season, he\u2019s been one of the big, big pluses all season. He\u2019s a leader, he knows what it means, and for us it\u2019s about a good reaction now. We need a reaction after last week, and I hope we win. I\u2019ve said to the boys, you\u2019ve got to go out and prove to everyone what we\u2019re about. Life\u2019s not in one straight line. It\u2019s ups and downs, you win some and you lose some, and you\u2019ve just got to deal with it. So Paul Pogba remains on the Manchester United bench, while Solskjaer brings in Andreas Pereira and Mason Greenwood. The Longstaff brothers come back in for Newcastle having both starred against the same opponents earlier this season, while Dwight Gayle starts for the first time in a long time. Youll be wondering who\u2019s going to be playing in this game, no doubt. Well, here\u2019s your answer: Man Utd: De Gea, Wan Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, McTominay, Andreas Pereira, Fred, Greenwood, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Jones, Pogba, Mata, Lingard, Young, James, Romero. Newcastle: Dubravka, Schar, Fernandez, Lejeune, Manquillo, Sean Longstaff, Matthew Longstaff, Almiron, Willems, Gayle, Joelinton. Subs: Carroll, Shelvey, Hayden, Krafth, Yedlin, Darlow, Atsu. Referee: Kevin Friend. \u201cGiven that both teams have the same number of points why does one count as having been surprisingly good and the other as surprisingly bad?\u201d wonders David Wall. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they both be considered equally so-so, or sometimes good, sometimes bad (which is actually what they have been, both pretty inconsistent). Describing them otherwise is really measuring them against expectations that might not be based on how each clubs actually stands (in all respects) right now.\u201d There\u2019s no room for that kind of logic here. Half the season played, and the Uniteds of Newcastle and Manchester are level-pegging with 25 points apiece, thanks in part to the riproaring Newcastle win at St James\u2019 Park in October, when Matty Longstaff scored the only goal of the game on his debut. Steve Bruce says nobody should get carried away by how good Newcastle have been. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves a nice platform, but we\u2019re only halfway there, so we\u2019ve got to show the same resilience and spirit that we\u2019ve shown over the last few months and see where it takes us.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says nobody should get carried away by how bad Manchester United have been. \u201cWe\u2019re halfway through this season and we knew this season was going to be a season of some ups and downs,\u201d he insists. \u201cThis season will be used to find a team and a squad for next season, but hopefully we can speed this process up by getting more results. Expect us to be more consistent, definitely more experienced and learning from these setbacks, but at the moment we\u2019re a little bit further behind than what I was hoping for, yeah.\u201d Newcastle head to Old Trafford in fine fettle having won five of their last eight games, all but one of them by a single goal, while Manchester United lost their last match to bottom-of-the-table Watford. The only positive aspect of that game was the performance off the bench of Paul Pogba, who was United\u2019s most creative player by a distance despite only playing the final half-hour, and the Frenchman might be fit enough to start this one. Welcome! Especially those of you who are settling in for a third full televised match of Boxing Day. That\u2019s some good festive stamina. Well played.",

I was never worried about reaction [after Watford].

That was not in evidence this time, though after a Marcus Rashford free-kick that was deflected led to three successive corners, then came United\u2019s blip.</p> <p>The last of the three was won back by Newcastle and suddenly Dwight Gayle and Jetro Willems were involved in a breakaway that Aaron Wan-Bissaka was relieved to halt just outside his area.</p> <p>There was similar emotion when Mason Greenwood lost the ball inside the Newcastle half and again they charged through. This move ended with Joelinton feeding Gayle and he should have scored from close range.</p> <p>There was no escape the third time as Matty Longstaff repeated his feat of two months ago, when scoring in the reverse fixture. Yet again the home side were slipshod: Fred was dispossessed and black\u2011and\u2011white shirts flooded forward.

This came after Rashford and Luke Shaw combined along the left before the latter found Andreas Pereira. His layoff was smart and allowed Martial to shoot.</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r has spoken recently of the difficulty of leaving out Mason Greenwood and the young forward was about to remind us why. When Fabian Sch\u00e4r passed loosely the 18-year-old pounced on the ball, advanced, then fired a shot that deflected off Federico Fern\u00e1ndez and went in off the bar.</p> <p>United threatened further with a Pereira shot and a Greenwood cross before striking again. This time Wan-Bissaka stood the ball up and Rashford hung high, outmuscling Sch\u00e4r to power in a magnificent header. VAR checked for a McTominay hand on Matty Longstaff but the goal \u2013 correctly \u2013 stood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/26/manchester-united-v-newcastle-united-premier-league-live\">Manchester United 4-1 Newcastle United: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the second half Paul Pogba \u2013 who asked his teammates to wear \u201cWe are one\u201d\u2019 and \u201cNo to racism\u201d wrist bands during (and solely for) the warm-up \u2013 was sent on in place of McTominay. His opening action was a crafty dummy that allowed the ball to roll to Martial in the area. Next, a 20-yard shot that just missed the outside of Dubravka\u2019s right post solidified the sense Pogba could help wrap up the result quickly, and moments later United had a fourth goal for only the second time in the league this term.</p> <p>Again this was self-inflicted by Newcastle: Sean Longstaff swivelled near halfway and hit the ball back but only into Martial\u2019s path. He sprinted in and despite a heavy touch still dinked the ball over the advancing Dubravka. United were now rampant. Pogba\u2019s balletic feet created space but his left-foot shot was too close to the Newcastle goalkeeper. Next, he threaded the ball to Martial and his effort hit the left-hand post.</p> <p>Next up is Burnley and who knows which of their two incarnations \u2013 poor or convincing \u2013 will turn up.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United again illustrated their ambiguous character by rebounding from Sunday\u2019s dismal defeat at Watford with this smooth-geared, canter of a victory. They even gave Newcastle the advantage of a goal start during a dire few first\u2011half minutes before upping quality and control to pull away and display a ruthlessness they can sometimes lack. It meant only a second league win when enjoying more possession than opponents in the 18 matches since Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was made permanent manager in March. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cYou saw the intent straight away and the attitude was to win the ball and go forward. I was never worried about reaction [after Watford]. It\u2019s always been one loss \u2013 we lost one in August, in September, November, December \u2013 not two in a row in the league.\u201d The one sour note was Scott McTominay failing to emerge for the second half owing to injury. Solskj\u00e6r added. \u201cHe\u2019s done his ligament in the knee probably \u2013 we\u2019ll find out [Friday] how bad. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s going to be ready for Saturday [at Burnley] but we\u2019ve seen him heal quickly before.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r entered the match talking of how the defeat at Watford was down to his team\u2019s callowness. That was not in evidence this time, though after a Marcus Rashford free-kick that was deflected led to three successive corners, then came United\u2019s blip. The last of the three was won back by Newcastle and suddenly Dwight Gayle and Jetro Willems were involved in a breakaway that Aaron Wan-Bissaka was relieved to halt just outside his area. There was similar emotion when Mason Greenwood lost the ball inside the Newcastle half and again they charged through. This move ended with Joelinton feeding Gayle and he should have scored from close range. There was no escape the third time as Matty Longstaff repeated his feat of two months ago, when scoring in the reverse fixture. Yet again the home side were slipshod: Fred was dispossessed and black\u2011and\u2011white shirts flooded forward. Gayle fed Longstaff and he chipped sweetly into Joelinton who returned the ball \u2013 under extreme pressure \u2013 for his teammate to slide home. United woke up quickly as they had to, though Newcastle\u2019s Martin Dubravka will not wish to see replays of how Anthony Martial\u2019s equaliser squeezed in at his near post. This came after Rashford and Luke Shaw combined along the left before the latter found Andreas Pereira. His layoff was smart and allowed Martial to shoot. Solskj\u00e6r has spoken recently of the difficulty of leaving out Mason Greenwood and the young forward was about to remind us why. When Fabian Sch\u00e4r passed loosely the 18-year-old pounced on the ball, advanced, then fired a shot that deflected off Federico Fern\u00e1ndez and went in off the bar. United threatened further with a Pereira shot and a Greenwood cross before striking again. This time Wan-Bissaka stood the ball up and Rashford hung high, outmuscling Sch\u00e4r to power in a magnificent header. VAR checked for a McTominay hand on Matty Longstaff but the goal \u2013 correctly \u2013 stood. For the second half Paul Pogba \u2013 who asked his teammates to wear \u201cWe are one\u201d\u2019 and \u201cNo to racism\u201d wrist bands during (and solely for) the warm-up \u2013 was sent on in place of McTominay. His opening action was a crafty dummy that allowed the ball to roll to Martial in the area. Next, a 20-yard shot that just missed the outside of Dubravka\u2019s right post solidified the sense Pogba could help wrap up the result quickly, and moments later United had a fourth goal for only the second time in the league this term. Again this was self-inflicted by Newcastle: Sean Longstaff swivelled near halfway and hit the ball back but only into Martial\u2019s path. He sprinted in and despite a heavy touch still dinked the ball over the advancing Dubravka. United were now rampant. Pogba\u2019s balletic feet created space but his left-foot shot was too close to the Newcastle goalkeeper. Next, he threaded the ball to Martial and his effort hit the left-hand post. Next up is Burnley and who knows which of their two incarnations \u2013 poor or convincing \u2013 will turn up. Steve Bruce, the Newcastle manager and a former Manchester United captain, said: \u201cResults-wise this place is bloody awful for me [as a No 1].\u201d",

It was like the city had been anointed head prefect. He loved us! And we loved him, gleefully gobbling the signature steamed pork buns after winning a reservation lottery that made TattsLotto look easy. It wasn\u2019t only the glitter of The Chang that made the decade sparkle, but a broader culinary cultural cringe thing that saw massive queues outside Melbourne\u2019s Tim Ho Wan when it opened in 2016 \u2013 not to mention the hysteria over imports such as Krispy Kreme (first opened in Sydney in 2003) and the new, end-of-decade excitement (ahem) about the imminent rollout of US chain Taco Bell.</p> <h2>Ms.G\u2019s Stoner\u2019s Delight</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe60d90df9a50052c87d440fb12633b37ce79dbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe60d90df9a50052c87d440fb12633b37ce79dbe/0_1011_2362_1416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ms G\u2019s Stoner\u2019s delight in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stoner\u2019s Delight: so much more than type-2 diabetes in a bowl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merivale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a moment of pure OTT at 2011 newcomer Ms.G\u2019s when a young gun chef named Dan Hong floated his explosion-in-a-lolly-shop phantasmagoria of banana ice-cream, rice bubbles, chocolate, pretzels, peanut brittle and marshmallow. But it was much more than type-2 diabetes in a bowl; the Stoner\u2019s Delight was a floating signifier for a new generation of cheeky young chefs breaking out their best share-house moves and making food that spoke to their fun-loving contemporaries. A thousand imitative flowers bloomed in the unabashed pursuit of the millennial discretionary dollar; in a not-unrelated trend, swearing on menus (including a plethora of \u201creally f***ing hot\u201d curries) became de rigueur.</p> <h2>The Chur Burger</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A full sized Chur Burger and sliders.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Why, start a burger bar, of course. Little did Warren Turnbull know in 2013 when he started Chur Burger as a pop-up out of the ashes of Sydney\u2019s Albion Street Kitchen that he\u2019d have queues down the street and spark a bona fide burger bar trend. High went low when \u201cname\u201d chefs opened their own diffusion lines, from Neil Perry and Shannon Bennett following suit with burgers to George Calombaris and Shane Delia doing the same for souvlaki and kebabs, respectively. As the saying goes, feed the rich, go home poor; feed the poor, go home rich.</p> <h2>The Freakshake</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Freakshakes from Patissez in Canberra.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Figures are rubbery \u2013 best estimates say around half a million Australians now follow a plant-based diet \u2013 but the unavoidable environmental and ethical implications have seen all-vegan cafes and restaurants evolve from cheesecloth redoubts to hip havens in a tight embrace with the shiny-haired \u201cwellness\u201d movement. Cue Melbourne\u2019s Matcha Mylkbar which launched to insta-acclaim in 2016 with its poached eggs with whites made from coconut and almond milk and yolks of linseed protein and sweet potato. They\u2019re similar in texture to a real poached egg.

      "bodyText": "In gustatory terms it was the best of decades, it was the worst of decades, but one thing\u2019s for sure: the 2010s were anything but boring. They came in with sous-vide and left smoking up a storm, and in between offered evolution and devolution in equal measures. Here are the 10 dishes that best defined the decade in Australian food. Attica\u2019s potato cooked in the earth in which it was grown This was the decade in which the veg became hero, and the charge was led by Attica, the 20 teens\u2019 hero Australian restaurant. Making its debut in 2009 and becoming the breakout star of 2010, the \u201cpotato cooked in the earth in which it was grown\u201d, didn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue. But this was a special spud, one that arrived asking the hard questions. Had we ever looked at a potato before \u2013 ever really took the time to stare one unflinchingly in the face, to appreciate it beyond its quotidian chipping capacity? Chefs everywhere followed suit and let vegetables don their super-capes, including Dan Hunter of Brae, whose fried parsnip skin with an apple and parsnip mousse led the veg-as-dessert splinter-trend. Quay\u2019s snow egg For a certain well-heeled diner, eating at Quay and enjoying its show-stopper snow egg finale was already a Sydney must-do, like visiting Bondi Beach or climbing the Harbour Bridge. But after it featured on the second season finale of MasterChef in the show\u2019s 2010 glory days (one of the most-watched moments in Australian television with 3.9 million viewers), it became the snow egg of the people, with the phone ringing off the hook and the restaurant fielding requests for takeaways. As many cult dishes do, it became something of an albatross for chef Peter Gilmore, who iced the snow egg when Quay was rebooted in 2018. Momofuku Sei\u014dbo\u2019s pork bun In 2011 Sydney became the first location outside New York for super-chef David Chang to plant his flag. It was like the city had been anointed head prefect. He loved us! And we loved him, gleefully gobbling the signature steamed pork buns after winning a reservation lottery that made TattsLotto look easy. It wasn\u2019t only the glitter of The Chang that made the decade sparkle, but a broader culinary cultural cringe thing that saw massive queues outside Melbourne\u2019s Tim Ho Wan when it opened in 2016 \u2013 not to mention the hysteria over imports such as Krispy Kreme (first opened in Sydney in 2003) and the new, end-of-decade excitement (ahem) about the imminent rollout of US chain Taco Bell. Ms.G\u2019s Stoner\u2019s Delight It was a moment of pure OTT at 2011 newcomer Ms.G\u2019s when a young gun chef named Dan Hong floated his explosion-in-a-lolly-shop phantasmagoria of banana ice-cream, rice bubbles, chocolate, pretzels, peanut brittle and marshmallow. But it was much more than type-2 diabetes in a bowl; the Stoner\u2019s Delight was a floating signifier for a new generation of cheeky young chefs breaking out their best share-house moves and making food that spoke to their fun-loving contemporaries. A thousand imitative flowers bloomed in the unabashed pursuit of the millennial discretionary dollar; in a not-unrelated trend, swearing on menus (including a plethora of \u201creally f***ing hot\u201d curries) became de rigueur. The Chur Burger What\u2019s a chef to do when fire guts his aspirational fine diner? Why, start a burger bar, of course. Little did Warren Turnbull know in 2013 when he started Chur Burger as a pop-up out of the ashes of Sydney\u2019s Albion Street Kitchen that he\u2019d have queues down the street and spark a bona fide burger bar trend. High went low when \u201cname\u201d chefs opened their own diffusion lines, from Neil Perry and Shannon Bennett following suit with burgers to George Calombaris and Shane Delia doing the same for souvlaki and kebabs, respectively. As the saying goes, feed the rich, go home poor; feed the poor, go home rich. The Freakshake Could anyone standing on the precipice of the new decade have predicted something like the Freakshake? The product of the hospitality industry\u2019s horizontal lambada with social media, this aptly-named abomination invented by Canberra cafe Patissez in 2015 was a milkshake with added artillery in the form of pretzels, chocolate bits, marshmallow and whatever else happened to be close to hand in the kitchen. It went viral, and global, then sputtered out, but not without spawning endless imitators gurning for their close-up on Instagram. The only conclusion to draw from this sorry episode is that a Freakshake is much like a tree falling in a forest: if no one saw you drink it, you didn\u2019t drink one. Matcha Mylkbar\u2019s vegan poached eggs It was a decade in which vegans went from punchline to a food force to be reckoned with. Figures are rubbery \u2013 best estimates say around half a million Australians now follow a plant-based diet \u2013 but the unavoidable environmental and ethical implications have seen all-vegan cafes and restaurants evolve from cheesecloth redoubts to hip havens in a tight embrace with the shiny-haired \u201cwellness\u201d movement. Cue Melbourne\u2019s Matcha Mylkbar which launched to insta-acclaim in 2016 with its poached eggs with whites made from coconut and almond milk and yolks of linseed protein and sweet potato. They\u2019re similar in texture to a real poached egg. As for taste: close your eyes and think of Matcha Mylkbar fan Liam Hemsworth. Saint Peter\u2019s albacore eye chip We\u2019re calling it: Josh Niland was the 2010\u2019s most important chef, an achievement made all the more remarkable by the fact he debuted his Sydney restaurant Saint Peter in 2016. The epoch-changing nature of the waste-not philosophy, transplanted to an all-seafood menu, is difficult to underplay. Niland\u2019s fin-to-gill ethos, epitomising the new approach to sustainability, saw wonders such as the albacore eye chip, the sea urchin on crumpet and deep-fried mulloway scales on salt-baked pumpkin. No flash in the pan, the \u201cJosh Niland effect\u201d is the new normal. Avocado on toast Has a breakfast staple ever sparked macro-economic debate like the humble avo on toast? Battle lines were drawn between boomers and millennials in 2016 when demographer Bernard Salt used smashed avo as a symbol of all that was wrong with young people\u2019s (alleged) spendthrift culture. The smashed avocado generation \u2013 like the lost generation, only with more vitamin C \u2013 were essentially eating their home deposits, he lectured, prompting a plethora of retaliatory think pieces pointing out that the wholesale inequities of house prices transcended the retail cost of breakfasting out. In cafes across the nation, avocado on toast simply shrugged and got on with being the brunch item du jour. Sunda\u2019s roti with Vegemite curry The cheeky-proud Aussie-fication of cuisine was a decade-long nostalgia trip, kicking off with the widescale pimping of the Streets ice-cream back-catalogue (the Golden Gaytime, Viennetta, Magnum and Splice were all gussied up for their restaurant debuts). Then along came the Vegemite reclamation movement, with chefs such as Attica\u2019s Ben Shewry and Anchovy\u2019s Thi Li taking the breakfast spread of champions as their inspiration. The best in show arrived in 2018, when Khanh Nguyen at Melbourne\u2019s hot-stuff new arrival Sunda teamed a Vegemite-infused curry sauce with buttery pull-apart roti, kicking hackneyed notions of \u201cfusion\u201d to the kerb.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government is poised to privatise the state\u2019s plantation forests as part of a fresh round of sale and lease arrangements in 2020 to fund ambitious infrastructure projects. The second half of Ausgrid, the second half of WestConnex and some water assets are also in the government\u2019s sights. The long-term lease of Forestry Corporation\u2019s 230,000 hectares of softwood plantations is expected to be one of the first assets off the block in the new year. The state forests produce about 14% of Australia\u2019s timber, including much of the supply for the housing industry. The transaction, expected to raise $1bn, is likely to be announced early in the new year and will involve a long-term lease of land and the right to grow timber, rather than the sale of land. The bank and financial services company UBS has undertaken a scoping study in the past three months while the accountancy firm KPMG has worked on the tax implications and the law firm Minter Ellison on the legal structures. The sale will be controversial in regional areas such as Bathurst, Oberon, Bega, Tumut and the north-west, where large softwood plantations are important employers. Forestry Corporation also manages 34,000 hectares of hardwood timber plantations and has stewardship of about 2m hectares of coastal native forests, cypress forests and red gum forests. These are not proposed to be part of the deal. But their future could be uncertain once the money-making softwood division is sold or leased. Green groups want greater protections for native state forests, particularly after this summer\u2019s fires, which have put pressure on habitats for koalas and other native animals. It is understood the government would also like to sell its remaining half of NSW\u2019s electricity distributor Ausgrid \u2013 the company which owns the poles and wires carrying power around the state \u2013 but the proposal is on hold. This follows controversy over the sale of the initial 50% of Ausgrid in 2016, when the then federal treasurer, Scott Morrison, cited national security concerns to block a winning bid from a consortium made up of Chinese government-owned State Grid and Hong Kong\u2019s Cheung Kong Infrastructure. The stake was then sold for $16bn to an Australian consortium made up of the industry super investment vehicle IFM Investors and the nation\u2019s biggest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper. The investors are said to have sounded out the government about a further sale, but Morrison\u2019s rhetoric on Chinese influence in Australia has caused investors to hit the pause button on a proposal for the remaining half. Investors are looking to pay about $10bn to $11bn for the second part, because the grid is considered a wasting asset that is losing value, due in part to the uptake of solar panels. There is also speculation that the government will move to sell the remaining 49% of the giant WestConnex road project during 2020. The 2018 sale of the first half to Transurban, the state\u2019s largest private road operator, raised $9.3bn but sparked criticism about the risks of having one major operator controlling so many roads in the state. Other holdings being sized up by the private sector include some of Sydney Water\u2019s assets and the opportunity to build the extension to Sydney\u2019s desalination plant and other new projects. The existing plant was turned on last January and is operating at 100% capacity, providing 15% of the city\u2019s water needs. An options paper has recommended 30% capacity of the dam system as the critical threshold on which to base planning for an extension. The Greater Sydney dam system is now at 44.3% capacity and falling. Although investors are angling for Sydney Water\u2019s assets to be considered for privatisation, the proposition is considered too politically contentious in a drought. The most likely outcome will be to involve the private sector in new projects, which could include dams combined with pumped hydrogeneration opportunities.

      "bodyText": "The Melbourne Boxing Day Test may have to be played at night or moved away from Christmas to November or March as the number of extreme heat days rises over coming decades, a new report says. The analysis by the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub says the climate crisis is already disrupting Australian cricket, citing the cancellation of club matches on hot days and the abandonment of a Big Bash game in Canberra after bushfire smoke reduced air quality and visibility. The report, commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation, says the impact is expected to grow along with the number of days of extreme heat in Melbourne through the 2020s and beyond. Paul Sinclair, the ACF\u2019s campaigns director, said climate change loomed over this cricket season. There were calls for the starting time of the Perth Test match between Australia and New Zealand to be delayed due to a run of 40C-plus days and New South Wales and Queensland players were blanketed in smoke in a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground that prompted former Test player Steve O\u2019Keefe to say Cricket Australia should intervene in future. New Zealand\u2019s preparation for the second Test starting in Melbourne on Boxing Day was curtailed when the first day of a scratch match against a Victorian XI was cancelled last Friday as the temperature reached 43.5C. The report says continuing to play the Boxing Day Test in its current format will expose players and fans to unprecedented levels of extreme heat and, if effective action to limit climate change is not taken, consideration should be given to moving the Test to the shoulder season. \u201cMoving the event isn\u2019t the only option, but alternatives come with their own risks,\u201d the report says. \u201cBecause radiant heat is a significant factor in heat stress, night Tests could lower the heat stress risk to players and others, but there may be logistical, cultural or safety challenges involved in this.\u201d Asked for its response to the suggestion the Boxing Day Test might be rescheduled, Cricket Australia said cricket was played in different climates and countries around the world and it was committed to both addressing the impact of climate change and ensuring cricket continued to be played in Australia on December 26 for many years to come. Sinclair said cricket depended on the weather in a way few other sports did as changes in temperature and rainfall affect pitch condition and ball movement. He called on cricket authorities to \u201cchampion the national and international action needed to combat the root causes of climate change\u201d. \u201cCricketers from grassroots clubs across the country to those in the national squad need Cricket Australia to speak up for climate solutions that match the scale of the problem facing the game we love,\u201d Sinclair said. The report suggests the conversation about cricket and heat is starting to change, giving the example of the hospitalisation of England captain Joe Root with dehydration and viral gastroenteritis in January 2018 as temperatures hit 42C. It prompted former Australian cricketer Dean Jones to say extreme heat was a workplace issue, and games should be called off on days that reached 41C. It says extreme heat is a major health hazard for cricketers as it disrupts the body\u2019s thermoregulation. Heat stress can initially cause muscle cramps, profuse sweat, thirst and fatigue. As players move towards heat stroke, people could feel chills and have nervous system problems that impair coordination and decision making. The report applauds Cricket Australia for last year publishing the cricket world\u2019s first heat stress management policy, but says the organisation declined to say how often it had been used or whether it supported Australia moving to net zero greenhouse gas emissions or 100% renewable energy. A Cricket Australia spokesman said it had been closely monitoring temperatures, air quality and visibility this summer and found it had \u201ccertainly brought about new challenges\u201d. It said the executive team was in the early stages of developing a \u201cstrategy for sustainability\u201d, and the organisation was conducting and had published research into best practice in dealing with a changing climate. \u201cArmed with this evidence, CA will continue to lobby the International Cricket Council to adopt these approaches for international tournaments,\u201d it said. \u201cPlayers\u2019 and officials\u2019 health at all levels of cricket is the absolute priority of Cricket Australia.\u201d At a community level, it said it had recommended matches be postponed or cancelled if temperatures reached a maximum designated by local authorities. The report mentions in passing the bushfires that have recently smothered Sydney and other centres in smoke up to 11 times the hazardous level. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s Sydney grade matches have been called off in recent weeks, with paramedics called to at least one game. Cricket Australia has said it is preparing for smoke to affect play during the Test match starting at the SCG on 3 January. Its head of operations, Peter Roach, said International Cricket Council regulations allowed officials to stop play due to smoke as they would due to rain. Scientists say the scale and impact of the fires is unprecedented, and that the climate crisis is exacerbating the risk and lengthening the bushfire season. More than 5m hectares has burned across the country. At a grassroots level, the report gives the example of Red Cliffs Cricket Association in Mildura, north-west Victoria, where the average daytime January temperature has increased 2.7C over the past 40 years. On average, 5.5 more January days are hotter than 38C than in 1980. Peter Kelly, the Red Cliffs Association secretary, said over the past four years there have been about four days when cricket has been called off due to heat. \u201cWe now play shorter games in January and have taken one of the Saturdays out because of the hot temperatures we\u2019ve had for the past few years. It\u2019s getting that consistent,\u201d he said. Australia last week recorded its three hottest days, averaged across the continent, on record. Scientists said the strongest Indian Ocean dipole event on record, atmospheric warming above Antarctica and average global heating of more than 1C due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas all contributed. Temperatures in Melbourne this Boxing Day Test are forecast to range from 20.5C recorded on the first day to 41C on Monday, should it last that long.",

It may sound like a nativity scene, but for an increasing number of farmers it\u2019s a daily occurrence \u2013 and that celestial being is a drone.</p> <p>Corey Lambeth, a New Zealand farmer, originally purchased a drone for photography, but he quickly realised the device had more practical applications. \u201cI thought \u2018I\u2019ll just give it a nudge on the sheep and see what that goes like\u2019 and it actually worked out quite well,\u201d he says.

Rentoul purchased his first drone after watching a video of another farmer using one to muster deer on YouTube. In the early days, he lost drones to water damage and once, memorably, while trying to transport a bottle of wine. He tied the bottle to the drone with fishing line, but it would \u201cswing side to side\u201d. The drone would try and correct for the wine\u2019s movement \u201cand the bottle would swing one way and the drone would try to balance\u201d making the wine swing faster and faster, until he eventually lost control altogether.</p> <p>\u201cI [now] try and keep it fairly simple and low cost,\u201d he says. Rentoul finds the drone particularly helpful when herding deer. Unlike a sheepdog, a drone can outpace a bolting doe.

      "body": "<p>Dozens of police forces have made out-of-court settlements totalling more than \u00a330m in the past four years, according to recent figures, which were described as \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d in terms of people on the receiving end of unlawful police behaviour.</p> <p>Payments range from small sums for loss of property, or the \u00a3100 paid by Sussex police for \u201cembarrassment and humiliation\u201d, through to hundreds of thousands of pounds paid for wrongful arrest, records revealed under the Freedom of Information Act show.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police were responsible for the lion\u2019s share (\u00a319.6m) of the settlements. Of that, the force paid \u00a37.9m to settle 479 claims categorised as being for \u201cmalfeasance\u201d.</p> <p>The FoI figures did not include the large amount of legal costs that police forces had to also cover, pushing the figures still higher.</p> <p>In a climate of increased scrutiny of police conduct, experts said the disclosures indicated inconsistent standards and inadequate accountability mechanisms.</p> <p>Mark Stephens, the lawyer for the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/29/harvey-proctor-lawyer-questions-remain-bungled-investigation\">awarded \u00a3500,000 in compensation by the Met</a> after their bungled investigation into allegations of a VIP paedophile ring, warned that the figures revealed wildly differing standards in how police forces dealt with complaints and that some forces appeared to fight even difficult cases \u201cto the bitter end\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Metropolitan police is known for picking the fights that they are going to win and settling the cases they know they will lose, with a little margin in between,\u201d said Stephens, of the firm Howard Kennedy LLP.</p> <p>\u201cThen if you take a force like Sussex, they fight everything to the bitter end, incur huge legal costs \u2013 which are a complete waste of money because the victim wants compensation and a settlement, while the only people who gain are the lawyers.</p> <p>\u201cYou tell the client going in this is what they are going to do in response, and we know that this particular police force behaves in this ridiculous way \u2026 as a consequence we are likely to issue a writ, which is likely to cost up to \u00a310,000 just for the fee.</p> <p>\u201cSo there is \u00a310,000 for every writ that is issued, because they have not entered into sensible and meaningful negotiations, nor do they enter into mediation or dispute resolution, which might obviate the need to incur legal costs.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Waqas Tufail, a senior lecturer in criminology at Leeds Beckett University and co-founder of the Northern Police Monitoring Project (NPMP), said that existing accountability mechanisms, whether internally within police forces or those of the <a href=\"https://www.policeconduct.gov.uk/\">Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)</a>, were clearly not effective or robust enough.</p> <p>\u201cQuestions should now be raised as to the extent to which police forces are using compensation in order to protect both their reputations and to protect officers who who may have abused police powers,\u201d he added.</p> <p>As well as the Met and Sussex, 32 other UK police forces provided figures, including additional detail on payouts. More than \u00a3800,000 in payments have been made in the past four years by Thames Valley police, which included more than \u00a3300,000 for 60 cases categorised as being for \u201cinjury/loss liberty/reputation\u201d following arrests. The largest payouts in that category were one for \u00a330,000 and three for \u00a320,000 each.</p> <p>Like other forces, dog bites led to five payouts by Thames Valley, which included two of \u00a310,000 each last year. Sussex police paid out \u00a3878,777 in the past four years, including one payment of \u00a3128,349 for negligence and one for \u00a35,500 for data protection failures. Others included seven for false imprisonment, with one for \u00a315,000 and another for \u00a313,500.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the \u00a363,000 paid by Gwent police in the past four years included a \u00a310,000 payment following a breach of the Data Protection Act. The \u00a346,440 figure for Police Scotland included cases such as \u00a32,000 for \u201calleged failure to investigate\u201d and \u00a312,000 for \u201calleged used of excessive force\u201d. </p> <p>Some forces refused to reveal their out-of-court settlement figures in response to the Guardian\u2019s request by saying it would be too costly or, in the case of Greater Manchester police, failing to provide any reason why they could not. Cambridgeshire constabulary said they could not do so because they had \u201coutsourced\u201d their legal team.</p> <p>Dr Joanna Gilmore, an academic at the University of York\u2019s Law school and a co-founder of the NPMP, said the overall figures \u201cwere likely to be the tip of the iceberg in terms of those who have been on the receiving end of unlawful police behaviour\u201d.</p> <p>She added that it was increasingly difficult to access legal aid to bring a civil action against the police, and that access to specialist legal advice could be difficult to obtain, particularly outside London.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that most people who experience unlawful police behaviour do not bring a civil action against the police,\u201d said Gilmore, whose own research on protest-related cases had shown it could take years to settle claims.</p> <p>The Met did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Sussex police said: \u201cEvery claim that is received by Sussex police, whatever its value and circumstances, is fully and objectively investigated by a dedicated civil claims team. <br><br>\u201cWhere any liability exists, we work with claimants to ensure a fair and as swift as possible resolution to their claim, also ensuring that the public purse is protected from disproportionate, unreasonable and sometimes false claims. More often than not, this does not require the intervention of the courts, as shown in the figures for 2016-2019 \u2013 21 cases settled in court, compared to 332 outside. <br><br>\u201cIf no liability exists, it is right and correct that it should be defended robustly to ensure only claims that have merit are settled at the cost of the taxpayer.\u201d</p> <p>Among other forces who have spent significantly on out-of-court settlements since the beginning of 2016 were Lancashire constabulary (\u00a31.96m), West Midlands police (\u00a31.7m) and Warwickshire police (\u00a31.19m).</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 December 2019. An earlier version stated incorrectly that Police Scotland had paid out \u00a3420,000 in four years. This has been corrected.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dozens of police forces have made out-of-court settlements totalling more than \u00a330m in the past four years, according to recent figures, which were described as \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d in terms of people on the receiving end of unlawful police behaviour. Payments range from small sums for loss of property, or the \u00a3100 paid by Sussex police for \u201cembarrassment and humiliation\u201d, through to hundreds of thousands of pounds paid for wrongful arrest, records revealed under the Freedom of Information Act show. The Metropolitan police were responsible for the lion\u2019s share (\u00a319.6m) of the settlements. Of that, the force paid \u00a37.9m to settle 479 claims categorised as being for \u201cmalfeasance\u201d. The FoI figures did not include the large amount of legal costs that police forces had to also cover, pushing the figures still higher. In a climate of increased scrutiny of police conduct, experts said the disclosures indicated inconsistent standards and inadequate accountability mechanisms. Mark Stephens, the lawyer for the former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who has been awarded \u00a3500,000 in compensation by the Met after their bungled investigation into allegations of a VIP paedophile ring, warned that the figures revealed wildly differing standards in how police forces dealt with complaints and that some forces appeared to fight even difficult cases \u201cto the bitter end\u201d. \u201cThe Metropolitan police is known for picking the fights that they are going to win and settling the cases they know they will lose, with a little margin in between,\u201d said Stephens, of the firm Howard Kennedy LLP. \u201cThen if you take a force like Sussex, they fight everything to the bitter end, incur huge legal costs \u2013 which are a complete waste of money because the victim wants compensation and a settlement, while the only people who gain are the lawyers. \u201cYou tell the client going in this is what they are going to do in response, and we know that this particular police force behaves in this ridiculous way \u2026 as a consequence we are likely to issue a writ, which is likely to cost up to \u00a310,000 just for the fee. \u201cSo there is \u00a310,000 for every writ that is issued, because they have not entered into sensible and meaningful negotiations, nor do they enter into mediation or dispute resolution, which might obviate the need to incur legal costs.\u201d Dr Waqas Tufail, a senior lecturer in criminology at Leeds Beckett University and co-founder of the Northern Police Monitoring Project (NPMP), said that existing accountability mechanisms, whether internally within police forces or those of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), were clearly not effective or robust enough. \u201cQuestions should now be raised as to the extent to which police forces are using compensation in order to protect both their reputations and to protect officers who who may have abused police powers,\u201d he added. As well as the Met and Sussex, 32 other UK police forces provided figures, including additional detail on payouts. More than \u00a3800,000 in payments have been made in the past four years by Thames Valley police, which included more than \u00a3300,000 for 60 cases categorised as being for \u201cinjury/loss liberty/reputation\u201d following arrests. The largest payouts in that category were one for \u00a330,000 and three for \u00a320,000 each. Like other forces, dog bites led to five payouts by Thames Valley, which included two of \u00a310,000 each last year. Sussex police paid out \u00a3878,777 in the past four years, including one payment of \u00a3128,349 for negligence and one for \u00a35,500 for data protection failures. Others included seven for false imprisonment, with one for \u00a315,000 and another for \u00a313,500. Elsewhere, the \u00a363,000 paid by Gwent police in the past four years included a \u00a310,000 payment following a breach of the Data Protection Act. The \u00a346,440 figure for Police Scotland included cases such as \u00a32,000 for \u201calleged failure to investigate\u201d and \u00a312,000 for \u201calleged used of excessive force\u201d. Some forces refused to reveal their out-of-court settlement figures in response to the Guardian\u2019s request by saying it would be too costly or, in the case of Greater Manchester police, failing to provide any reason why they could not. Cambridgeshire constabulary said they could not do so because they had \u201coutsourced\u201d their legal team. Dr Joanna Gilmore, an academic at the University of York\u2019s Law school and a co-founder of the NPMP, said the overall figures \u201cwere likely to be the tip of the iceberg in terms of those who have been on the receiving end of unlawful police behaviour\u201d. She added that it was increasingly difficult to access legal aid to bring a civil action against the police, and that access to specialist legal advice could be difficult to obtain, particularly outside London. \u201cThe reality is that most people who experience unlawful police behaviour do not bring a civil action against the police,\u201d said Gilmore, whose own research on protest-related cases had shown it could take years to settle claims. The Met did not respond to a request for comment. Sussex police said: \u201cEvery claim that is received by Sussex police, whatever its value and circumstances, is fully and objectively investigated by a dedicated civil claims team. \u201cWhere any liability exists, we work with claimants to ensure a fair and as swift as possible resolution to their claim, also ensuring that the public purse is protected from disproportionate, unreasonable and sometimes false claims. More often than not, this does not require the intervention of the courts, as shown in the figures for 2016-2019 \u2013 21 cases settled in court, compared to 332 outside. \u201cIf no liability exists, it is right and correct that it should be defended robustly to ensure only claims that have merit are settled at the cost of the taxpayer.\u201d Among other forces who have spent significantly on out-of-court settlements since the beginning of 2016 were Lancashire constabulary (\u00a31.96m), West Midlands police (\u00a31.7m) and Warwickshire police (\u00a31.19m). \u2022 This article was amended on 27 December 2019. An earlier version stated incorrectly that Police Scotland had paid out \u00a3420,000 in four years. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for joining me. You can get back to your cold turkey now. Aaron Bower reports from the delayed game at Bramall Lane. That\u2019s not the end of the action today! You can join Simon Burnton for Manchester United v Newcastle. Another bad day at the office for Stamford Bridge. Everton the club in the right place at the right time. A good day for Carlo Ancelotti. Ed Aarons witnessed a fine winner at Selhurst Park. Paul MacInnes was our man at Villa Park. A point each. Here is Ben Fisher\u2019s report from the Vitality Stadium: David Wall asks: \u201cHow long until the calls to replace Arteta start appearing on phone-ins and Arsenal TV?\u201d The main man. Even the Macclesfield scoreboard wants the owner to quit. Aston Villa 1-0 Norwich Bournemouth 1-1 Arsenal Chelsea 0-2 Southampton Crystal Palace 2-1 West Ham Everton 1-0 Burnley Sheffield United 1-1 Watford (kicked off 10 mins late) A huge win for Dean Smith. A winning start for Carlo Ancelotti. A fine comeback from the Eagles. Another dreadful Chelsea display. Arteta gets a point in his first game in charge. Harry Wilson whips in a free-kick from 25 yards but it lands in Leno\u2019s arms. We\u2019re heading for a draw in Bournemouth. That is an excellent goal. Lacazette breaks away, then picks out Willock on the edge of the box in space but he hits a very tame shot which Ramsdale drops on top off. Ayew gets the ball on the wing and dribbles through the entire defence before sending the ball into the back of the net. It\u2019s a cracker! WHAT A SAVE! Heaton reacts superbly to a Hernandez volley from just nine yards to keep Villa ahead. STRIKER! Wigan are beating Derby, who are really struggling. Could Wayne Rooney be player-manager soon? Lewis Cook goes into the book for Bournemouth after going through the back of Pepe. It was a pretty poor challenge and Pepe is yet to get up. Ben Foster is a fine chap. Sidibe sends in a wonderful cross, then Calvert-Lewin flings himself at the ball to send a diving header beyond Pope. Disallowed goal for Bournemouth. Wilson is first to react after Leno palms a weak Fraser shot back into a dangerous area - the striker taps home but the flag is up and VAR confirms the decision. Ben Foster is the hero once more for Watford with a fantastic save to repel a Fleck effort. Mason Greenwood starts for Man United today, while Pogba is left on the bench. Newcastle start Dwight Gayle. The hero we all deserve. Arsenal have been on top since equalising at Bournemouth but they have suffered a blow as it looks like Sokratis needs to go off. A shock on the cards at Stamford Bridge. The ball deflects into the path of Redmond who beats Kepa to it and sends a shot into the back of the net. Burnley have been superb at the back against Everton. Tarkowski and friend of the show Mee have not given the opposition strikers a sniff. Aaron Wilbraham has now scored an own goal! Rochdale 2-2 Fleetwood. Does it count as a hat-trick? Lacazette fails to take advantage of a perfect pass through the middle as the Frenchman hits his shot straight at the feet of Ramsdale who diverts the ball wide. McArthur lifts a ball to the back post from the left, Kouyate sprints into the box to volley home the knockdown for his first Palace goal, ironically against his former club. The weather at the Vitality Stadium is apocalyptic. Absolutely hammering it down. Grealish does superbly well on the edge of the box to find space for a pass to Hourihane who curls the ball into the corner. A tad unfair on Norwich who have dominated. Aaron Wilbraham has scored again!!! Rochdale 2-1 Fleetwood. Now Arsenal are level. Aubameyang takes it into the box and it comes back to him a few seconds later after Nelson sends it to the back post from where Aubameyang taps the ball into the corner. Byram almost opens the scoring for Norwich after combining with his fellow full-back, Aarons, who flings the ball across the box for the left-back but he can only head the ball wide. Arsenal should be level! Ozil slips a delightful ball through the defence to Aubameyang who takes a poor first touch and ends up jabbing a shot at Ramsdale which the goalkeeper blocks. From fighting to celebrations in the West Ham ranks. Antonio does well on the wing, sends a cross into the box where Snodgrass sweeps it into the net. Maitland-Niles goes into the book. The full-back first fell over and then pulled down King as he went down. No Christmas spirit in the West Ham dressing room. Heaton gets down to stop a Zimmerman header to keep things level at Villa Park. Norwich have been on top throughout and are unlucky to not be ahead. A few teams could do with this man leading the line ... but he is off back to Milan. Macclesfield are leading against Grimsby thanks to a Joe Ironside penalty. Let\u2019s hope they sort out their financial issues. The game\u2019s gone: It will be interesting to see how Arteta reacts when it comes to substitutions. He does have Pepe at his disposal. Aubameyang goes close! The Gabonese striker gets the ball inside the box, opens his body up and looks to curl the ball into the top corner but he sends it inches wide. Chelsea have replaced Zouma with Mount which is an exciting substitution. Everyone else is back underway, too. Deulofeu has just whacked a free-kick from 35 yards over the bar! Sheffield United and Watford go in level at at the break. They\u2019ve add five minutes on at Bramall Lane. No rest for me. Charles Antaki offers to save us all a job: \u201cA generous gift from the Arsenal team to all journalists, who can now recycle the \u2018at least the new manager now knows the scale of the problem\u2019 from Emery\u2019s and Ljungberg\u2019s debuts. Who says that the players don\u2019t care?\u201d Chelsea are set to make a change at the break, with Mason Mount going through a vigorous warmup routine on the pitch. They have failed to create anything of note. Aaron Wilbraham is 40! You have to admire his longevity. It is chucking it down at Bramall Lane where Sarr is down and looks very groggy after clashing with O\u2019Connell. Aston Villa 0-0 Norwich Bournemouth 1-0 Arsenal Chelsea 0-1 Southampton Crystal Palace 0-0 West Ham Everton 0-0 Burnley Sheffield United 1-1 Watford (kicked off 10 mins late) Baldock gets into the box and is taken down by Hughes. Norwood steps up to equalise for the Blades. Aaron Wilbraham has scored for Rochdale! Aaron Wilbraham is still playing football. Who knew? King almost doubles the lead for Bournemouth. The forward gets the ball on the halfway line and sprints past Sokratis, bulldozes Nelson out of the way on the byline only to toe poke his shot straight at Leno who forces it behind. And he is Deulofeu scoring. Amazon really are helping me today. I might order a new frying pan to thank them. Speaking of cracking goals. Here is Obafemi\u2019s for Southampton. No operational issues for Deulofeu. The Spanish winger collects a flick on, cuts inside and calmly passes the ball into the back of the net. What a cracking finish! Bournemouth push forward with Stacey overlapping down the right wing, allowing him to pull the ball back from the byline for the onrushing Gosling to poke home. Bad news for Villa as El Ghazi has been forced off with an injury. He is replaced by Jota. Palace should be ahead against West Ham but Jordan Ayew has missed twice in quick succession. I think he is the least clinical striker in the Premier League. Southampton with a sucker punch. Obafemi gets the ball in the final third, dribbles into the box and curls a shot into the top corner with his left foot for his first Premier League goal! RYAN BERTRAND BOOKED IN 28TH MINUTE FOR TIME WASTING!! Is this a new record? A stunning Arsenal move from their own area ends with Saka firing a low cross across the six-yard box which finds it way to Nelson at the back post but he panics and ends up sending a tame shot straight into a defender\u2019s chest. Roberto update: Lacazette turns in the both and whacks a shot a goal but Lerma gets into between the striker and the net to deflect the ball over. The Frenchman has had a couple of chances but is yet to threaten Ramsdale. If you\u2019re into goals, Hibs scored two earlier. Read all about it: Not a single goal in the Premier League thus far. One assumes all the players ate too much goose yesterday or some other cliched line I am too lazy to think of. David Luiz has just had a go from 30 odd yards with his left foot. Needless to say, it went nowhere near the goal. Bournemouth and Arsenal are playing some good football but each side keep giving the ball away needlessly. There should be goals though. Norwich hit the bar! A corner lands on Byram\u2019s head, the full-back directs it into the ground but it bounces up and onto the bar. A let-off for Villa. Chelsea are unsurprisingly in charge of proceedings at Stamford Bridge but no one has actually had a shot on goal. Southampton do not look like they have much ambition in the capital. They would take a goalless draw now. Sheffield United v Watford is underway, which is a relief. Bournemouth almost take the lead when a cross from Fraser lands on Wilson\u2019s left foot and he whacks a volley from 18 yards just over the bar. It would have been a cracker. Leno considers a short pass to a defender from a goal kick but after about 15 seconds of threatening to do so just whacks it long. Arteta has a bit of work to do here. I must say Ozil looks pretty lively for Arsenal, he has the freedom to roam and is finding lots of space. Eoin Doyle has scored from the spot for Swindon against Cambridge. That\u2019s his 22nd of the season already. A Fulham defender was dispossessed in his own area, allowing LuaLua to score the opening for Luton. A wonderful feat of incompetence. What are operational issues? Have they been unable to find a match ball? Referee lost his whistle? Absolutely nothing happening at Bramall Lane ... Burnley whip a free-kick into the box which Mina clears over his own bar rather than allow Mee a free header to open the scoring. Ancelotti will not be pleased that his return to England starts against Burnley as they\u2019re such a tough side to face. All quiet in the early stages. Arsenal are knocking the ball around the back. Many would say in a manner similar to Manchester City. Where did Arteta learn that? The whistles are sounding all over the country! From our man in south east London ... I bought my brother a William Prunier cushion for Christmas. I assume no one got anything better. Spurs have already seen off Brighton today. Feel free to send me photos of your Boxing Day meals, as this is normal. Andy Gray back on Sky Sports being interviewed about a new film on Everton in the 1980s. JR emails in: \u201cIf I had known Roberto was starting I never would have traded Zaha out of my fantasy team. I mean I knew Zaha was likely going to be up against the 73 year old Zabaleta but I never considered Roberto would see a Premier League game again. Surely there can\u2019t be any worse options than Roberto, can there be?\u201d Is Palace v West Ham the must watch game of the day? Re Ozil starting, Arteta says: \u201cHe has been training really good, so let\u2019s see how he can perform and what he can produce.\u201d Amazon have sent a very beardy Marcus Buckland to Bournemouth where he is joined by Tony Pulis and Karen Carney. Buckland\u2019s facial really is quite impressive, pirate-esque. Roberto is starting for West Ham! Very much the gift that keeps on giving. My mother bought me a Manchester City annual as a present yesterday. I am 32 years old! Boxing Days stats! There are going to be six games on simultaneously on Amazon. How many games can I physically watch and enjoy? Southampton have decided to rest Danny Ings. One assumes this is on the basis that they do not think they can beat Chelsea and have more important games coming up. So ... that\u2019s all the team news. Arteta has gone for an attacking lineup with Ozil in the side, with both Aubameyang and Lacazette starting.

Subs: Martinez, Pepe, Mustafi, Mavropanos, Willock, Guendouzi, Smith Rowe. And here is a list for you to argue with your loved ones about over turkey sandwiches. Arteta is cool. Granit Xhaka is terrific. You\u2019re all very welcome to email in to tell me about your Christmases and how football is making it better. What will we learn about Arteta\u2019s Arsenal today? Will he stick with the kids? Will he get Ozil back into the team? Will the defence be less awful? This sums up today: Here are today\u2019s 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League: Aston Villa v Norwich Bournemouth v Arsenal Chelsea v Southampton Crystal Palace v West Ham Everton v Burnley Sheffield United v Watford Good afternoon! I assume we all feel absolutely dreadful after a day of indulging ourselves. What better way to bring yourself back to reality than watching dozens of millionaires running around a bit of grass. It\u2019s even more special this year as you can watch every single game on Amazon; you\u2019ve probably bought all your Christmas presents from them, so it\u2019s fitting you can continue your relationship with them on Boxing Day. In terms of actual football, the intrigue comes at Bournemouth who host Arsenal for Mikel Arteta\u2019s first game in charge, so we can all see if he has orchestrated a revolution of if they\u2019re just bad. Elsewhere, Carlo Ancelotti leads Everton against Burnley in order to remind himself how ruddy bloody hard the Premier League is. Last on Match of the Day will be Aston Villa v Norwich. It\u2019s very much a relegation SIX-POINTER, so it\u2019s got that in its favour, at least. Anyway ... let\u2019s pour another glass of wine and enjoy non-stop football.",

Performed by <a href=\"https://www.therembrandts.net/\" title=\"\">the Rembrandts</a>, it was the instantly grabbing theme from the TV sitcom Friends during the show\u2019s 10-year run from 1994.

In 1995 it brought Willis an Emmy nomination.</p> <p>But this was just one of the household-name tunes to flow from her pen. In the late 1970s she struck up a priceless professional rapport with <a href=\"http://www.earthwindandfire.com/history/biography/\" title=\"\">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</a>, co-writing the indelible funk singalong <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Gs069dndIYk\" title=\"\">September</a> (1978), which reached the US No 8 and UK No 3, and became an all-time party classic.

No promoted side have been fifth on Christmas Day since Ipswich in 2000 and Chris Wilder\u2019s team \u2013 while not hitting their finest form \u2013 rarely looked in danger of a surprise defeat. \u201cWe weren\u2019t at our best, we didn\u2019t do enough as the home team,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find that bit of quality and when we did, the goalkeeper has made an incredible save. We didn\u2019t do enough.\u201d There was a sign of what was to come when Foster produced a superb save to deny Oli McBurnie, before he turned provider for the opening goal. His direct ball downfield was flicked on by Nathaniel Chalobah and Deulofeu kept his nerve to beat Dean Henderson at his near post after the goalkeeper stalled when the Spaniard was set free. Nine minutes later, though, a needless challenge from Will Hughes brought down George Baldock inside the area and Norwood made no mistake from the spot to level. As Pearson acknowledged, Watford spent most of the second half keeping United at bay but when they were opened up shortly after the hour they were again grateful for Foster. Barely seconds after coming on for McBurnie, Lys Mousset played a crossfield ball that was met by Fleck, who looked certain to score. Foster turned the ball wide. \u201cIt was an unbelievable save,\u201d Pearson said of the moment that ultimately earned Watford a point. You could not argue with that.",

      "bodyText": "Councils are placing children in care homes that inspectors say do not provide a good standard of care at a cost of millions of pounds, an investigation has found. The Guardian asked councils across England for information on the number of children being sent to homes run by 78 providers, all of whose properties were listed by Ofsted as being inadequate or in need of improvement to be good at the end of March. Fifty-eight children were placed in such homes by at least 23 local authorities in the following three-month period, handing more than \u00a32.3m to failing providers, according to freedom of information responses and analysis of councils\u2019 published expenditure. The figures could be much higher as a substantial number of councils did not respond, some would not say how many children on the grounds of data protection, and some would not say how much money was spent on providers citing commercial sensitivity. The Guardian interviewed staff at some of these failing homes, with one former employee accusing bosses of not giving staff appropriate training and only caring about \u201cmoney through the door\u201d. At another company, a staff member said he had \u00a340 a child to spend on breakfast, lunch and dinner for an entire week. Critics have described the findings as worrying but said there were not enough homes and councils were in a \u201cstraitjacket\u201d, with nowhere to place vulnerable children. The children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Longfield, said it was not acceptable that young people in care \u201care being asked to pay the price of system failures \u2026 and ultimately put at risk\u201d. Ann Coffey, the former MP who chaired the all-parliamentary group for runaway and missing children until she stood down at the last election, said children should not be placed in homes where the care is consistently inadequate. She added: \u201cLocal authorities are in a straitjacket really \u2026 They have a statutory responsibility for these kids and have to place them somewhere and can only place them somewhere where there is an available home. No social worker would willingly place a child at a home that is inadequate.\u201d In some instances children were sent to homes run by providers that have repeatedly been deemed inadequate by Ofsted, which as well as inspecting schools, appraises services that care for children and young people. The regulator rates children\u2019s homes as either outstanding, good, requires improvement to be good or inadequate. Ofsted inspects homes that were judged in the latter two categories at least twice in each year-long inspection period. Homes that are judged as outstanding or good get one full inspection. Yvette Stanley, Ofsted\u2019s national director for social care, said: \u201cWe would expect a council to think long and hard about that [sending a child to a home rated inadequate] and whether it was meeting a child\u2019s needs. When we rate a home as inadequate we are saying it needs to improve radically and with pace, but if we found it unsafe we\u2019d take regulatory action \u2026 so it is possible to place a child in an inadequate setting but we would expect them to want to talk to us to reassure themselves about reasons for inadequacy.\u201d She added that the issues raised were indicative of a lack of capacity in the system to provide for children with complex needs. A source who works at one care home run by Sherico Care Services was critical of management at the firm\u2019s children\u2019s homes. He said staff were given just \u00a340 a child to do a week\u2019s worth of food shopping. \u201cThat is crazy, and makes it challenging for us to manage that. You have to find ways to make pounds stretch, that\u2019s \u00a340 for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day for a week,\u201d the staff member said. The worker said staff earned about \u00a38.50 an hour and the working hours were \u201cridiculous\u201d. \u201cYou would not be surprised if someone had to work 24 hours, which is crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are no benefits of sleep-ins, you do not get extra pay for staying overnight.\u201d They added that there had been times when homes were understaffed. \u201cI was in a situation where there was myself and another colleague and three children there. A fight broke out and we had to try to stop that. But what if a third child wanted to get involved? There\u2019s no one there to intervene. Situations like that can get quite dangerous,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for Sherico said: \u201cWe do not recognise the allegations that have been made by the Guardian. No member of staff has made any such complaints to us. We currently operate three homes; one of which is rated good, one requiring improvement and one inadequate. The company took the decision to close two other registered homes. The quality of care provided to our service users is our top priority and we are working hard to bring it up to the required standard where it falls short.\u201d Another company, Parkview Care, which operates in south-east England, had its facilities rated as \u201crequires improvement to be good\u201d. Former staff alleged that children were brought in \u2013 regardless of whether staff had suitable training to manage them \u2013 to get \u201cmoney through the door\u201d. One worker claimed: \u201cThe home [I worked in] was advertised as a therapeutic establishment but none of the staff were trained therapeutically and did not have the right training to deal with the level of need.\u201d Parkview said it had a history of providing good quality care to vulnerable children but in June 2018 Ofsted inspections took place that identified issues with the standard of care. The company said improvements were made. The company added that in February 2019, despite progress being made it was acknowledged that this was \u201cslower than anticipated and they restructured and streamlined the business\u201d, which had a positive effect. \u201cWe continually review all of our operational processes in an effort to exceed the standards with which we must comply,\u201d it said. The chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, Judith Blake, said: \u201cThe vast majority of children\u2019s homes are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, but year-on-year increases in the number of children entering the care system mean services are under significant and increasing pressure. Demand for children\u2019s home places can often outweigh supply. \u201cMeanwhile, financial pressures on children services are limiting council\u2019s efforts to develop and maintain the right provision locally. This can mean they are forced to place children in placements that are not best suited to their needs. \u201cIt is important that the government works with councils to urgently improve the availability of high-quality homes that meet the needs of children in care.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea had been flying after their win at Tottenham on Sunday, which felt like a defining moment for Frank Lampard and the evolution of his young team. This was a crash back down to earth, further evidence of the west London club\u2019s maddening inconsistency. Perhaps it is the price to pay for having a young manager and a smattering of academy products. Whatever the reason, Lampard knows he has to find a more even keel and soon. Southampton\u2019s win was perfectly judged and entirely merited, ignited by a special first-half goal from the 19-year-old Michael Obafemi and driven by their second-half threat on the break. Nathan Redmond scored the goal that made the points safe \u2013 he was a thorn in Chelsea\u2019s side \u2013 but this was a team triumph, built on the no\u2011nonsense central defensive contributions of Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek. The midfielders Pierre\u2011Emile H\u00f8jbjerg and James Ward-Prowse were also excellent. Chelsea have lost three of the last four Premier League games at home, this one following those against Bournemouth and West Ham \u2013 and they have drawn a blank on each occasion. They dominated the possession against Southampton yet their inability to prise them apart was a huge concern. It was one of those days when they could have played on and on and still not scored \u2013 once again, they lacked personality on the ball \u2013 and it was difficult to isolate a clear-cut chance that they created. Southampton\u2019s first clean sheet in the league since mid-September came with a degree of comfort and Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl could revel in what he described as the best performance of his tenure, one that was characterised by bravery on and off the ball. When Ward-Prowse said that Southampton had \u201cplayed Chelsea off the park\u201d, it was hard to disagree.

      "bodyText": "Low-polling billionaire presidential candidates Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer have spent a collective $200m on political advertising in the 2020 election race \u2013 with the first state votes for the Democratic nomination still six weeks away. Of the two, the financial data mogul Bloomberg is firmly ahead, with the former New York mayor spending a record $120m since he formally joined the contest. The San Francisco billionaire Steyer hasn\u2019t matched Bloomberg with his campaign\u2019s $83m in ad buys, but that is still more than four times Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $19m, the next big spender. Put together the $200m spend is more than double the spending of the rest of the entire Democratic field this year. But the larger question for the billionaire duo is whether their ability to spend so much on media advertising is effective; both remain in the single digits among registered Democrats nationally. And as the 2016 primary and national contests showed, deep pockets only go so far; Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton\u2019s impressive financial backing proved no match for the current president\u2019s cost-free, direct-to-voter Twitter assaults. Still, according to a Quinnipiac poll, Steyer\u2019s spending in South Carolina is beginning to slowly move the polls: he is now placed fifth with 5% of projected Democratic voters. And he is at 4% among black voters \u2013 ahead of Buttigieg and Cory Booker. Bloomberg, too, is starting to see modest polling gains. In the latest Quinnipiac national poll published on Monday, he came in fifth nationally with 7% of the vote. Steyer, however, is at 1.5% nationally, according to RealClearPolitics. But Bloomberg and Steyer are running fundamentally different campaigns with a common objective. Steyer is spending heavily in early voting states \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2013 while Bloomberg is hoping to harvest support in delegate-heavy, Super Tuesday states. According to Politico, Bloomberg has already spent more than $13m in California, with 416 delegates, Texas, with 228 delegates, and Florida, which carries 219 delegates. The former New York mayor isn\u2019t stopping there: he\u2019s spending across the nation, even in states like New Hampshire, with just 24 delegates, which he is not contesting. Other states that are receiving massive TV advertising include North Carolina, according to data from TV ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of ways to describe [the ad expenditures] at this point,\u201d the company\u2019s Nick Stapleton told Politico. But others warned that an overplayed ad brings in diminishing returns. \u201cAfter you see the same TV ad 10 times, it\u2019s not going to have as big an impact,\u201d Saber Communications\u2019 Christian Heiens told the site, pointing to Jeb Bush\u2019s $55m ad spend on his 2016 Republican nomination bid.

Silver Streak was second, Ballyandy was third and Verdana Blue finished fourth.</p> <p>Trainer Nicky Henderson said: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say I was a Fusil Raffles fan, but she [Epatante] was impressive. I\u2019ve even got to admit it myself \u2013 she was very good. We\u2019ve come straight from the Gerry Feilden at Newbury, which was a handicap. I wanted to go to Ascot last weekend, but JP wanted to come here and he was absolutely dead right.</p> <p>\u201cGoing into Cheltenham last season I thought she was our best chance in the mares\u2019 novice, but she didn\u2019t run her race. She had done everything right up until then and has done everything right since.\u201d</p> <p>Paddy Power make Epatante their 7-2 favourite (from 16-1) for the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham in March. Henderson added: \u201cShe is lovely and has a great temperament with a lovely attitude and she is a great jumper. I saw Barry for 30 seconds after the race and I said, \u2018what next?\u2019. He said \u2018win the Champion Hurdle\u2019, so I suppose that is what I better do! \u201cDoes she need to do any more before then? I don\u2019t know.

Nine times victorious at the top level over the smaller obstacles, the 2015 Champion Hurdle hero showed he was still a formidable force \u2013 just days short of turning 12 years old \u2013 to lower the colours of another star name in Samcro. </p> <p>Faugheen enjoyed himself out in front in the hands of Patrick Mullins, but his market rival was never too far away. Tintangle tried to keep tabs on the big two, but fell five fences from the finish, leaving the market principals to fight it out. </p> <p>There was little between the pair until the second-last fence, where Samcro was put under pressure but could not respond. Faugheen, trained by Willie Mullins, jumped the last two obstacles in great style and pulled clear to win by 10 lengths. Castlebrook Lad was 22 lengths back in third place. </p> <p>Mullins was at Kempton to see Footpad finish third in the King George VI Chase - and nominated the Flogas Novice Chase at Leopardstown in early February as the likely next target for Faugheen.</p> <p>He said: \u201cTo go toe-to-toe with Samcro over the last six furlongs was very good. He did what he always does, in that he gallops and jumps. It is special to win a Grade One over fences with an 11-year-old as very few horses attempt it, but he hasn\u2019t much mileage on the clock and to me it is about mileage rather than age. He is well up to it as he is fresh and well, more so than last season.</p> <p>\u201cThree-mile hurdling is just very hard on horses. Chasing is much easier on him and he is enjoying himself. I\u2019ve not had chance to talk to Patrick yet, but they seemed to get on like a house on fire.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe are delighted to get as far as we have with him. We will look forward to the Dublin Racing Festival now, where I\u2019d imagine he will go for the two-mile-five novice chase. That will be the race for him and we will just keep it simple.\u201d <strong>PA Media</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"412f6e315796501d1e073aa504f72e70ba5b757a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/412f6e315796501d1e073aa504f72e70ba5b757a/120_264_4234_2542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Mullins return to a hero\u2019s welcome after winning on Faugheen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Mullins return to a hero\u2019s welcome after winning on Faugheen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Healy Racing/racingfotos.com/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T16:35:50.239Z\">at 4.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e04c6668f087e8308e64471\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T14:43:24.630Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King George VI Chase (3.05) betting</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <ul> <li>11-8 Cyrname</li> <li>2-1 Lostintranslation</li> <li>6-1 Clan Des Obeaux</li> <li>15-2 Footpad</li> <li>33-1 Aso</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e04c6238f08c3972264093d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T14:40:32.144Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">King George VI Chase (3.05) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The King George VI Chase, more than any other major jumps race, achieves an impressive balance in demanding both speed and stamina from its contenders, making it tricky to choose between the claims of Cyrname and Lostintranslation, both tackling the race for the first time. But the impression remains that Cyrname did not want to go much further when he triumphed over Altior last month and the extra three furlongs he faces at Kempton will be a serious test for a headstrong animal.</p> <p>Some have questioned whether <strong>Lostintranslation (3.05)</strong> has the pace to cope well with a strongly run King George but he regularly ran well at shorter trips last season, against a horse who is now a top-class two-miler. His superb fencing will help him and it is easy to imagine him outstaying most of these rivals in the straight. Thistlecrack, his stablemate at Colin Tizzard\u2019s yard, can also go well. Clan Des Obeaux has something to prove after three consecutive defeats but these conditions certainly showed him to advantage a year ago.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e04c5e78f08c3972264093a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T14:39:24.852Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Christmas Hurdle (2.30) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Epatante</strong> (B J Geraghty) 2-1 Jt Fav <br>2 <strong>Silver Streak</strong> (Adam Wedge) 11-1 <br>3 <strong>Ballyandy</strong> (Sam Twiston-Davies) 14-1 <br>10 ran <br>Also: 2-1 Jt Fav Fusil Raffles, 7-1 Verdana Blue 4th</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"936bc12acfea1c3713e3daad0e6d2c1ec9fb1a4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/936bc12acfea1c3713e3daad0e6d2c1ec9fb1a4e/0_6_2478_1487/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Epatante ridden by jockey Barry Geraghty goes onto win the Ladbrokes Christmas Hurdle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Epatante ridden by jockey Barry Geraghty goes onto win the Ladbrokes Christmas Hurdle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3af322b985bd51b3a9aeabf1c3a2e0a4775b08bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3af322b985bd51b3a9aeabf1c3a2e0a4775b08bb/0_0_3491_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Over in Leopardstown, Epatante\u2019s owner JP McManus reacts as he watches his horse winning from Kempton on the big screen with Charlie Swan alongside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Over in Leopardstown, Epatante\u2019s owner JP McManus reacts as he watches his horse winning from Kempton on the big screen with Charlie Swan alongside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pat Healy/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T15:16:29.566Z\">at 3.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e04c43a8f087e8308e64452\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T14:32:02.976Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Christmas Hurdle (2.30)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elixir De Nutz leads ...

Having won twice at Punchestown, Notebook had no trouble stepping up to Grade One company, in the process taking the scalp of Fakir D\u2019oudairies and Laurina.</p> <p>Given a confident ride by Rachael Blackmore, Notebook (7-1) travelled well throughout the race as Djingle set the pace. Making her move after the third-last fence, Blackmore sent Henry de Bromhead\u2019s six-year-old to the front at two out, from Royal Rendezvous and Fakir D\u2019oudairies. Those two got close, which resulted in Mark Walsh briefly losing an iron on the latter.</p> <p>Notebook was gone and went on to score by a length and a half from Fakir D\u2019oudairies, while Laurina never got into it and was a big disappointment. It was a big-race double for Blackmore and De Bromhead following the success of Aspire Tower in the Knight Frank Juvenile Hurdle. Notebook was slashed in price to 5-1 for the Arkle Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival with Betfair and RaceBets. <strong>PA Media</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"537bfe51b9cce3caa75c935af4b8fd01cd5f5c44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537bfe51b9cce3caa75c935af4b8fd01cd5f5c44/0_42_5365_3223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Notebook, with Rachael Blackmore up, on their way to winning the Racing Post Novice Steeplechase at Leopardstown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Notebook, with Rachael Blackmore up, on their way to winning the Racing Post Novice Steeplechase at Leopardstown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Browne/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T15:18:13.740Z\">at 3.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e04c18e8f08c397226408fc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T14:20:31.398Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Christmas Hurdle (2.30) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fusil Raffles has been the talking horse at Seven Barrows but the form of his Wincanton win last month is not the strongest on offer here.

And then there\u2019s Footpad, an outstanding two-mile novice in 2017-18 but a disappointment since until a return to something like his old form in a weak race at Thurles last time.</p> <p>All that remains now is to see how much of the forecast rain actually arrives at the track. All the predictions are that this year\u2019s King George will be a wet one, with around 5mm expected between midday and six o\u2019clock. The going is currently soft, good-to-soft in places but if the forecast is anywhere close to correct, it is unlikely to be any better than soft all over by the time of the big race. But it\u2019s a winter sport, and a festive crowd of around 20,000 will no doubt be well insulated against the cold and rain when the five runners to go post just after 3pm.</p> </div>   </div>",

I\u2019ve even got to admit it myself \u2013 she was very good. We\u2019ve come straight from the Gerry Feilden at Newbury, which was a handicap. I wanted to go to Ascot last weekend, but JP wanted to come here and he was absolutely dead right. \u201cGoing into Cheltenham last season I thought she was our best chance in the mares\u2019 novice, but she didn\u2019t run her race. She had done everything right up until then and has done everything right since.\u201d Paddy Power make Epatante their 7-2 favourite (from 16-1) for the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham in March. Henderson added: \u201cShe is lovely and has a great temperament with a lovely attitude and she is a great jumper. I saw Barry for 30 seconds after the race and I said, \u2018what next?\u2019. He said \u2018win the Champion Hurdle\u2019, so I suppose that is what I better do! \u201cDoes she need to do any more before then? I don\u2019t know. We will think about it.\u201d PA Media Faugheen rolled back the years to add a Grade One triumph over fences to his list of major achievements when winning the Matchbook Betting Exchange Novice Chase at Limerick. Nine times victorious at the top level over the smaller obstacles, the 2015 Champion Hurdle hero showed he was still a formidable force \u2013 just days short of turning 12 years old \u2013 to lower the colours of another star name in Samcro. Faugheen enjoyed himself out in front in the hands of Patrick Mullins, but his market rival was never too far away. Tintangle tried to keep tabs on the big two, but fell five fences from the finish, leaving the market principals to fight it out. There was little between the pair until the second-last fence, where Samcro was put under pressure but could not respond. Faugheen, trained by Willie Mullins, jumped the last two obstacles in great style and pulled clear to win by 10 lengths. Castlebrook Lad was 22 lengths back in third place. Mullins was at Kempton to see Footpad finish third in the King George VI Chase - and nominated the Flogas Novice Chase at Leopardstown in early February as the likely next target for Faugheen. He said: \u201cTo go toe-to-toe with Samcro over the last six furlongs was very good. He did what he always does, in that he gallops and jumps. It is special to win a Grade One over fences with an 11-year-old as very few horses attempt it, but he hasn\u2019t much mileage on the clock and to me it is about mileage rather than age. He is well up to it as he is fresh and well, more so than last season. \u201cThree-mile hurdling is just very hard on horses. Chasing is much easier on him and he is enjoying himself. I\u2019ve not had chance to talk to Patrick yet, but they seemed to get on like a house on fire.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are delighted to get as far as we have with him. We will look forward to the Dublin Racing Festival now, where I\u2019d imagine he will go for the two-mile-five novice chase. That will be the race for him and we will just keep it simple.\u201d PA Media 11-8 Cyrname 2-1 Lostintranslation 6-1 Clan Des Obeaux 15-2 Footpad 33-1 Aso The King George VI Chase, more than any other major jumps race, achieves an impressive balance in demanding both speed and stamina from its contenders, making it tricky to choose between the claims of Cyrname and Lostintranslation, both tackling the race for the first time. But the impression remains that Cyrname did not want to go much further when he triumphed over Altior last month and the extra three furlongs he faces at Kempton will be a serious test for a headstrong animal. Some have questioned whether Lostintranslation (3.05) has the pace to cope well with a strongly run King George but he regularly ran well at shorter trips last season, against a horse who is now a top-class two-miler. His superb fencing will help him and it is easy to imagine him outstaying most of these rivals in the straight. Thistlecrack, his stablemate at Colin Tizzard\u2019s yard, can also go well. Clan Des Obeaux has something to prove after three consecutive defeats but these conditions certainly showed him to advantage a year ago. 1 Epatante (B J Geraghty) 2-1 Jt Fav 2 Silver Streak (Adam Wedge) 11-1 3 Ballyandy (Sam Twiston-Davies) 14-1 10 ran Also: 2-1 Jt Fav Fusil Raffles, 7-1 Verdana Blue 4th Elixir De Nutz leads ... Ballyandy is close up with Fusil Raffles just behind ... Epatante is making good progress ... Verdana Blue makes her challenge ... Epatante has quickened up extreme,y well and is the most impressive winner of the day. That puts her bang in the Champion Hurdle picture. Notebook continued his unbeaten record over fences with a convincing victory in the Racing Post Novice Chase at Leopardstown. Having won twice at Punchestown, Notebook had no trouble stepping up to Grade One company, in the process taking the scalp of Fakir D\u2019oudairies and Laurina. Given a confident ride by Rachael Blackmore, Notebook (7-1) travelled well throughout the race as Djingle set the pace. Making her move after the third-last fence, Blackmore sent Henry de Bromhead\u2019s six-year-old to the front at two out, from Royal Rendezvous and Fakir D\u2019oudairies. Those two got close, which resulted in Mark Walsh briefly losing an iron on the latter. Notebook was gone and went on to score by a length and a half from Fakir D\u2019oudairies, while Laurina never got into it and was a big disappointment. It was a big-race double for Blackmore and De Bromhead following the success of Aspire Tower in the Knight Frank Juvenile Hurdle. Notebook was slashed in price to 5-1 for the Arkle Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival with Betfair and RaceBets. PA Media Fusil Raffles has been the talking horse at Seven Barrows but the form of his Wincanton win last month is not the strongest on offer here. He will face a stern challenge from his stablemate Epatante, so impressive in landing the Gerry Feilden and disappointing only at Cheltenham since arriving from France. 1 Top Ville Ben (Thomas Dowson) 3-1 Fav 2 Didero Vallis (Miss L M Turner) 5-1 3 Lake View Lad (Henry Brooke) 6-1 10 ran Also: 20-1 Wakanda 4th Lachlan Bridge hardly got going and doesn\u2019t look interested ... and is pulled up for fourth time running ... Didero Vallis has the lead up front ... Rocco has been jumping sketchily ... Jonniesofa takes a prominent position and now leads ... Top Ville Ben is in second ... and now goes up to take the lead ... Guitar Pete makes a mistake ... Top Ville Ben still leads on the home turn ... Bennys King is being pushed along ... Top Ville Ben jumps well over the fences in the home straight and kicks clear to win in good style. An 11lb rise is not to be sneered at but Bennys King impressed in pulling clear of a packed field for the Peter O\u2019Sullevan Memorial last time. He was short of peak fitness on his only defeat since joining Dan Skelton and can improve again for this step up in distance. Skelton won this race two years ago. 1 Slate House (R M Power) 3-1 2 Black Op (J J Burke) 9-4 Fav 3 Danny Whizzbang (Sam Twiston-Davies) 6-1 7 ran Also: 10-1 Jarveys Plate 4th Master Tommytucker leads in the early stages from Black Op ... The Mighty Don is third ... Slate House is towards the rear ... A circuit to go ... no big mistakes or change in the order ... slight mistake by Black Op .... Redzor now in trouble and The Mighty Don has fallen ... Master Tommytucker still jumps well in the lead ... Redzor is pulled up ... Slate House goes well ... Now Master Tommytucker has fallen ... Black Op and Slate House turn into the home straight ... Slate House takes the lead ... Black Op fights back and they get close in the closing stages but Slate House passes the line in the lead. Over at Leopardstown, Aspire Tower moved towards the head of ante-post lists for the JCB Triumph Hurdle following a dominant front-running display at Leopardstown imn the Grade Two Knight Frank Juvenile Hurdle. Paddy Power cut Henry De Bromhead\u2019s youngster to 7-1 from 20-1 for the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival in March, making him the joint-favourite with Gary Moore\u2019s Goshen. De Bromhead said: \u201cI thought he did it really impressively. He went a really good gallop and jumped great. The Grade One back here in February is an obvious race to go for, but we\u2019ll talk to the owners and see what they want to do.\u201d Paul Nicholls fields two hugely promising youngsters for this renewal of the Kauto Star, but Master Tommytucker and Danny Whizzbang lack the experience of a couple of their rivals and that may tell. Black Op gave Champ a run for his money at Newbury and is respected but Tizzard\u2019s Slate House is hard to get away from. He seemed on the point of winning Cheltenham\u2019s BetVictor Gold Cup Chase when knuckling over two-out last month and that is classy form in this context. 1 Commanche Red (P J Brennan) 4-1 2 Simply The Betts (G Sheehan) 5-1 3 On The Slopes (Adam Wedge) 9-1 11 ran Also: 3-1 Fav Roll Again, 20-1 Mr Mcgo 4th Front-runner Roll Again takes an early lead ... Doctor Dex (!) is being pushed along already between the first two fences ... Hold The Note is in second ... Doctor Dex still struggling ... Mile House is doing even worse ... Envoye Special has moved up closer ... Roll Again is down and Hold The Note is badly hampered and has no chance ... and has now been pulled up ... Mr Mcgo takes the lead ... Envoye Special is now going backwards ... On The Slopes is catching up but Comanche Red now flies through to take a clear lead and is going well clear. Comanche Red wins easily with Simply The Betts runnin gon for second. It has been a quiet start to the season for Tom George, at least until Saturday\u2019s Grade One triumph, but Doctor Dex has been serving him well and can do so again here. He bumped into a rival running the race of their life when second here last month, a race in which he was the only hold-up runner to make much impact. This hotter contest may work out better for him. They\u2019re off for the first race at Kempton and you will be glad you\u2019re on the sofa! Sad news in northern racing circles that the jockey Colin Hawkins has passed away. He was on board the first horse past the post in the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup NOT trained by Michael Dickinson, who famously sent out the first five home. Hawkins\u2019 best-known success was on Fighting Fit in the 1970 Scottish National. Proceedings get underway at Kempton in a quarter of an hour and you\u2019ll want to know what to back in the big TV races today. Chris Cook thinks Lostintranslation can triumph in the King George, and you can ready why in his guide to the televised contests here. The racing is now underway and there are ten meetings in total today, as well as the rest of the holiday action to follow starting with the Welsh National tomorrow. Let Chris Cook be your guide to the thrills and spills expected over the next week. It\u2019s started persisting down at Kempton. Barney Clifford, the clerk of course at the track, has just told Racing TV that there could be another 3-5mm between now and the big race. The King George is the best jumps race of the year and the contest which almost always decides who is the supreme staying chaser. Since the 1960s the roll call of winners has been littered with the names of champions and multiple winners. I argued here at the start of the century about its superiority over the Gold Cup in revealing the best chasers. Analysis by betting comparison site Bookmakers.TV has revealed that that trend is till the same and you should definitely be looking to the fancied horses in the today\u2019s Kempton highlight. \u201cThe King George has been a far kinder race to favourites over the years bringing the average SP down to around half that of Cheltenham\u2019s showpiece. While there have been plenty of more interesting results in the Cotswolds of late \u2013 excluding last year\u2019s Boxing Day upset \u2013 the data suggests punters should focus squarely on the top of the market in a bid to find the winner today.\u201d It\u2019s doubtful that may of the racegoers packing into Kempton Park today know the track is still under threat from the developers. Greg Wood wrote about the situation in November. As he pointed out: \u201con 10 January [2020], we will reach the second anniversary of the announcement by Jockey Club Racecourses (JCR) that it plans to sell Kempton for housing, switch the King George to Sandown Park and build a new all-weather track on the Club\u2019s home turf in Newmarket.\u201d And it is still in fdanger. You can read the full story here: There will be a big name missing from tomorrow\u2019s Kempton card too as Altior, whose unbeaten record over fences finally came to an end when he was beaten by Cyrname at Ascot in November, will miss his intended run in the Desert Orchid Chase due to a foot abscess. Altior would have been sure to start at long odds-on for his return to racing at around two miles, the trip at which he compiled a 19-race winning streak over hurdles and fences. \u201cUnfortunately, Altior will NOT run tomorrow due to an abscess,\u201d Nicky Henderson, his trainer, said on Twitter. \u201cThe timing is awful so we may look at the Silviniaco Conti Chase [over two-and-a-half miles] back at Kempton on 11 January.\u201d It has been a damp start to the day in south-east London and a somewhat disappointing one too following the news that Thistlecrack, last year\u2019s runner-up, has been scratched from the King George VI Chase due to a bruised foot, reducing the big-race field from six to just five. Thistlecrack was a 16-1 shot and no forlorn hope to add a second King George to his memorable success during his novice season in 2016, but even in his absence, this still promises to be a fascinating renewal of the Christmas showpiece with four of the five remaining runners priced up in single figures. It is not even possible to say with any certainty whether Cyrname or Lostintranslation will set off as the favourite, and the rain that is forecast for the Sunbury area later in the day could well see punters swinging behind Lostintranslation, currently the 2-1 second-favourite, as Cyrname (11-8) has yet to prove his stamina at today\u2019s three-mile trip. Clan Des Obeaux is also going to attract plenty of support, not least from those who still have warm memories of backing the 20-1 winner last year, even though Harry Cobden, his rider 12 months ago, has opted to ride Cyrname instead. And then there\u2019s Footpad, an outstanding two-mile novice in 2017-18 but a disappointment since until a return to something like his old form in a weak race at Thurles last time. All that remains now is to see how much of the forecast rain actually arrives at the track. All the predictions are that this year\u2019s King George will be a wet one, with around 5mm expected between midday and six o\u2019clock. The going is currently soft, good-to-soft in places but if the forecast is anywhere close to correct, it is unlikely to be any better than soft all over by the time of the big race. But it\u2019s a winter sport, and a festive crowd of around 20,000 will no doubt be well insulated against the cold and rain when the five runners to go post just after 3pm.",

      "body": "<p>It was a day of baby-faced aggressors at Centurion. An innings of joyous abandon and 95 runs from South Africa\u2019s Quinton de Kock did little for the health of England\u2019s bowling attack. It was as if De Kock, who seldom looks as if he has been on the planet for 27 years, had been so thrilled with a brand new bat for Christmas he was going to play every shot in the book with it \u2013 as well as one or two never seen in the manuals.</p> <p>For England Sam Curran, cherubic in appearance yet fiercely competitive in action, was invaluable to Joe Root. On his best day as an international bowler he finished with career-best figures of four for 57.There was enough zip in the wicket and in Curran\u2019s bowling for the edges to carry. The notional fourth seamer became Root\u2019s main man. As a consequence England were able to restrict South Africa to 277 for nine after sending them in to bat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/dec/26/south-africa-v-england-first-test-day-one-live\">South Africa v England: first Test, day one \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The situation is promising for England but could have been much better without that gem of a knock from De Kock. He came to the crease with South Africa ailing at 97 for four but he did not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation; there was no thought of a grim rescue operation. He flicked or glided or stroked the ball away from his presence; initially the runs flowed from various parts of his bat at a rate of a run a ball. He seemed to be having fun, something which has not been much in evidence in South African cricket for the last six months.</p> <p>It was not much fun for England as the heat intensified and their attack, two of whom have been laid low by flu, began to wilt. Among those struggling was Ben Stokes. To everyone\u2019s relief his father\u2019s condition had improved a little and Root was able to name Stokes in the side but it soon became apparent he was suffering. Stokes left the field in the afternoon and he did not reappear until the middle of the final session as the medical team \u201ctried to rehydrate him\u201d. So Root was always one bowling option down.</p> <p>Jofra Archer also hinted he had not completely recovered from his illness, though he was cheered by the wicket of Keshav Maharaj late in the day.</p> <p>The senior citizens, back in harness for the first time since the first Test against Australia, were rock-solid reliable. Jimmy Anderson\u2019s return to the fray might have been scripted by Hans Christian, who just may be a distant, misspelt Danish relative. After a five-minute delay at the start owing to a photographer collapsing in front of the sightscreen, Anderson gingerly returned to Test cricket.

      "bodyText": "It was a day of baby-faced aggressors at Centurion. An innings of joyous abandon and 95 runs from South Africa\u2019s Quinton de Kock did little for the health of England\u2019s bowling attack. It was as if De Kock, who seldom looks as if he has been on the planet for 27 years, had been so thrilled with a brand new bat for Christmas he was going to play every shot in the book with it \u2013 as well as one or two never seen in the manuals. For England Sam Curran, cherubic in appearance yet fiercely competitive in action, was invaluable to Joe Root. On his best day as an international bowler he finished with career-best figures of four for 57.There was enough zip in the wicket and in Curran\u2019s bowling for the edges to carry. The notional fourth seamer became Root\u2019s main man. As a consequence England were able to restrict South Africa to 277 for nine after sending them in to bat. The situation is promising for England but could have been much better without that gem of a knock from De Kock. He came to the crease with South Africa ailing at 97 for four but he did not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation; there was no thought of a grim rescue operation. He flicked or glided or stroked the ball away from his presence; initially the runs flowed from various parts of his bat at a rate of a run a ball. He seemed to be having fun, something which has not been much in evidence in South African cricket for the last six months. It was not much fun for England as the heat intensified and their attack, two of whom have been laid low by flu, began to wilt. Among those struggling was Ben Stokes. To everyone\u2019s relief his father\u2019s condition had improved a little and Root was able to name Stokes in the side but it soon became apparent he was suffering. Stokes left the field in the afternoon and he did not reappear until the middle of the final session as the medical team \u201ctried to rehydrate him\u201d. So Root was always one bowling option down. Jofra Archer also hinted he had not completely recovered from his illness, though he was cheered by the wicket of Keshav Maharaj late in the day. The senior citizens, back in harness for the first time since the first Test against Australia, were rock-solid reliable. Jimmy Anderson\u2019s return to the fray might have been scripted by Hans Christian, who just may be a distant, misspelt Danish relative. After a five-minute delay at the start owing to a photographer collapsing in front of the sightscreen, Anderson gingerly returned to Test cricket. His first delivery was a poor one, short and outside leg-stump but Dean Elgar contrived to feather it to Jos Buttler. Stuart Broad would keep going valiantly. Aiden Markram, the palindromic opener, and Zubayr Hamza recovered from a shocking start until the introduction of Curran. Markram drove his first ball from the left-armer in the air wide of mid-off; he missed the next one, edged the third and then clipped the fourth into the alert hands of Jonny Bairstow at square-leg. Throughout the morning Root rotated his pacemen like a latter-day Clive Lloyd, though he wisely restricted them to short spells. Archer\u2019s first four overs cost 25, 14 of which came from a single over when Faf du Plessis cashed in, but just before the break Broad struck. Hamza had impressed with his simple technique and an easy swing of the bat but now his forward prod edged a catch to Stokes at second slip. After lunch Archer yielded runs too quickly for comfort but Curran was able to intervene once more. Rassie van der Dussen, one of two South Africa debutants, pushed hard and Root, who would have a busy and fruitful day at first slip, pocketed the catch. Du Plessis, after batting discreetly for 26 overs, departed in similar fashion. De Kock trusted his instincts and counterattacked. Soon he took three silky boundaries off an over from Curran, who had until then been commendably miserly. Root introduced himself and conceded 26 from his four overs yet it was understandable he should keep himself on for so long. De Kock sliced a lofted drive just beyond the grasp of Anderson running back at mid-off; then the impish left-hander tried three ridiculous paddle sweeps, one of which flew over Stokes\u2019 head at slip; a more conventional edge bounced just in front of Stokes. Briefly the other debutant, Dwaine Pretorius, joined in the fun with an agricultural thump over the mid-wicket boundary against Root.

She could have just bought them online, she said, but she prefers to buy in the flesh. And anyway, Boxing Day shopping has become a tradition: \u201cMe and my daughter come and have a day out. We go for a nice lunch as well as do some shopping.\u201d Michelle Dawson had just refused to follow her daughters into River Island on the grounds that it looked \u201clike a nightmare\u201d. She gestured inside, where the floor was covered in sequinned crop tops and spray-on jeggings. The girls, Rhianna, 20, and Eleanor, 17, soon emerged empty handed. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible in there,\u201d shuddered Rhianna. \u201cToo messy. We didn\u2019t buy anything.\u201d Her sister still had Christmas money burning a hole in her handbag. \u201cEleanor hardly had anything to open yesterday because she asked for money for clothes,\u201d explained her mum. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the mistake in earlier years of buying things before Christmas and then seeing them half price on Boxing Day, so it was always the plan to wait until now.\u201d The view from London Shoppers braving showers and the busy streets of central London for the Boxing Day sales admitted they were torn between increasing concern over the climate emergency and having new outfits to display on social media. The final Christmas sale of the decade had been forecast to see swathes of consumers make fewer purchases of cheap clothes due to worries over the environmental impact of their production, as growing scrutiny is placed on fast fashion\u2019s carbon footprint. And as the drizzle turned into showers on Oxford Street on Thursday, people spoke of an increasing awareness about the ecological consequences of consumer choices. \u201cI work in H&amp;M and they\u2019re very conscious of recycling clothes,\u201d said 24-year-old Aatikah Abouath from Birmingham, referring to the outlet\u2019s plans to offer repair services. However, she said social media puts pressure on young people to look a certain way. \u201cYou\u2019ll see influencers and bloggers wearing so many new outfits and just automatically you want to buy what they\u2019re wearing.\u201d Two tourists from America shopping with their mother said a greater knowledge about global heating, spearheaded by news coverage of environmental movements, was sparking a greater consciousness. However, for the younger of the two sisters, there was concern about keeping up with appearances on social media. \u201cI feel like I should look trendy and look the way most people look like on social media,\u201d said 15-year-old high school student Deema Ali. \u201cI see all the fashionistas and beauty bloggers look a certain way, dress a certain way and have certain things.\u201d Amelia Burton, a 26-year-old dentist laden with shopping bags containing new boots, a coat, a jumper and two bags, said she would like to be more environmentally conscious but confessed that she liked shopping too much. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not to shop,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd obviously if you go for more eco-friendly brands, the prices often triple and there is no noticeable change in quality.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019ve reduced my meat intake because of climate change but I think it\u2019s harder to stop shopping due to social media.\u201d Others, however, told of how they rarely buy brand new clothes. \u201cFor us, we are vegan and ecologically conscious,\u201d said Regine Ganot, 62, from Auvergne, France. \u201cThere is a change of mentalities [across the UK and France]. It has evolved fast over the past year, more people are buying second-hand clothes.\u201d She has been vegan for six months, along with her daughter, Done, who has been plant-based for a year; while her husband, Patrice, has been vegetarian for eight months, and they were anxious to use their purchasing power for good. \u201cI don\u2019t buy anything new,\u201d said 23-year-old Done. \u201cI only buy second hand.\u201d But as the rain formed puddles across the pavements next to the bus and taxi-only high street, many others were frank about their shopping habits and conceded they did not really need the things they had bought. \u201cWe just buy things to go out at night,\u201d said 26-year-old Dutchman Tim van der Zee, who works in advertising. \u201cI buy them if I like it.\u201d",

For authorities struggling with high levels of air pollution as well as emissions targets, there is no doubt that electric vehicles represent an improvement, especially when they replace older vehicles and SUVs. For decades, petrol pumps have been the most direct point of contact between people and the oil industry. To anyone who seeks to weaken the hold of these powerful businesses, breaking these bonds feels like progress.</p> <p>But is it enough to wean drivers off petrol and diesel? Or could 21st-century transport be more radically reconfigured in such a way as to reduce our dependence on private cars? Automobiles were the creation of the age of oil, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/23/cars-accelerating-the-modern-world-review-v-and-a-victoria-albert-museum\" title=\"\">timely new exhibition</a> about their history at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum makes clear. As nations across the globe get set for the decade of emissions cuts that is mandatory if we are to avoid the catastrophe of global heating of 2C or more, what should be our attitude to driving?</p> <p>Transport is the fastest-growing contributor to global emissions, accounting for around a third of the total in Europe and the US. One recent study found that between 2010 and 2018, SUVs were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/25/suvs-second-biggest-cause-of-emissions-rise-figures-reveal\" title=\"\">second-largest contributor to rises</a>. In the UK, the government is considering a proposal by its climate advisers to <a href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-7524161/Ban-petrol-diesel-cars-brought-forward-FIVE-YEARS-2035.html\" title=\"\">bring forward to 2035 a ban</a> on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.</p> <p>But if the environmental case against the combustion engine is clearcut, arguments about electric vehicles are more complicated. While environmentalists argue for a fundamental shift away from private cars, other sceptics borrow their arguments about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/yes-electric-vehicles-really-are-better-than-fossil-fuel-burners\" title=\"\">damaging impact</a> of electric vehicle manufacturing and batteries to defend the status quo. These are partly technical questions about the way that emissions are calculated, and how other harms \u2013 such as that caused by the mining and disposal of cobalt and lithium used in batteries \u2013 are balanced against the danger of continued global heating. But their political importance can hardly be overstated. That is because what is at stake, when we talk about the future of the car, is not only a crucially important industrial sector, particularly in Germany, the US and Japan, but also the way that societies are organised.</p> <p>In the 20th century, the car became part of who we are. While this is perhaps truer in the US than anywhere else, car culture as well as technology has made deep inroads in almost every corner of the world. The economic and social aspects of our relationship with motor transport are so bound up together that they are difficult to unwind. But the V&amp;A exhibition, drawing on work by cultural historians, illustrates the extent to which cars have shaped the world we know. Exhibits include a useful introduction to the mode of industrial production known as Fordism (after Henry Ford), a depiction of the role of motorways in 20th-century nation-building, and sections on safety, gender, and the future \u2013 as well as a vast screen showing video of an oilfield.</p> <p><strong>The alternatives</strong><br>There is no getting away from the politics of transport. Arguments over the division of space and resources between roads and public transportation, and between drivers and other travellers \u2013 walkers, cyclists, bus passengers \u2013 are generally played out as culture wars between rival tribes.</p> <p>Different political philosophies, as well as lifestyles and needs, push people in opposite directions. Broadly speaking, cars appeal most strongly to people (and political parties) who are more invested in private ownership and individual freedom, while public and low-carbon transport are championed by those who value public space and collective modes of living. All of these issues are even more fraught in the developing world, where investment in public transport is urgently needed if there are to be viable alternatives to further increases in car ownership rates.</p> <p>At a time of dangerous political polarisation, it is important to recognise that beliefs about cars, as about most things, are contingent on experience. Bear in mind the faultlines between cities and towns that have recently attracted notice in countries including France, the US and UK. Attitudes to transport, as to much else, will vary according to geography. A rise in fuel duty was the initial grievance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\" title=\"\"><em>gilets jaunes</em></a>.</p> <p>Climate science dictates that the use of petrol and diesel cars and trucks must be drastically reduced. Electric vehicles are part of the solution, but car culture as a whole also needs an overhaul. This will not be easy. As well as their utility, motor vehicles have come to symbolise powerful human longings for privacy, autonomy, speed, mobility and freedom. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/24/lewis-hamilton-brushes-off-enivronmental-critics\" title=\"\">Lewis Hamilton</a> is not alone.

One recent study found that between 2010 and 2018, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to rises. In the UK, the government is considering a proposal by its climate advisers to bring forward to 2035 a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. But if the environmental case against the combustion engine is clearcut, arguments about electric vehicles are more complicated. While environmentalists argue for a fundamental shift away from private cars, other sceptics borrow their arguments about the damaging impact of electric vehicle manufacturing and batteries to defend the status quo. These are partly technical questions about the way that emissions are calculated, and how other harms \u2013 such as that caused by the mining and disposal of cobalt and lithium used in batteries \u2013 are balanced against the danger of continued global heating. But their political importance can hardly be overstated. That is because what is at stake, when we talk about the future of the car, is not only a crucially important industrial sector, particularly in Germany, the US and Japan, but also the way that societies are organised. In the 20th century, the car became part of who we are. While this is perhaps truer in the US than anywhere else, car culture as well as technology has made deep inroads in almost every corner of the world. The economic and social aspects of our relationship with motor transport are so bound up together that they are difficult to unwind. But the V&amp;A exhibition, drawing on work by cultural historians, illustrates the extent to which cars have shaped the world we know. Exhibits include a useful introduction to the mode of industrial production known as Fordism (after Henry Ford), a depiction of the role of motorways in 20th-century nation-building, and sections on safety, gender, and the future \u2013 as well as a vast screen showing video of an oilfield. The alternatives There is no getting away from the politics of transport. Arguments over the division of space and resources between roads and public transportation, and between drivers and other travellers \u2013 walkers, cyclists, bus passengers \u2013 are generally played out as culture wars between rival tribes. Different political philosophies, as well as lifestyles and needs, push people in opposite directions. Broadly speaking, cars appeal most strongly to people (and political parties) who are more invested in private ownership and individual freedom, while public and low-carbon transport are championed by those who value public space and collective modes of living. All of these issues are even more fraught in the developing world, where investment in public transport is urgently needed if there are to be viable alternatives to further increases in car ownership rates. At a time of dangerous political polarisation, it is important to recognise that beliefs about cars, as about most things, are contingent on experience. Bear in mind the faultlines between cities and towns that have recently attracted notice in countries including France, the US and UK. Attitudes to transport, as to much else, will vary according to geography. A rise in fuel duty was the initial grievance of the gilets jaunes. Climate science dictates that the use of petrol and diesel cars and trucks must be drastically reduced. Electric vehicles are part of the solution, but car culture as a whole also needs an overhaul. This will not be easy. As well as their utility, motor vehicles have come to symbolise powerful human longings for privacy, autonomy, speed, mobility and freedom. Lewis Hamilton is not alone. The rest of us need to do some thinking too.",

The question that should be asked around Archer is not how he is performing, but the standards invented by the media (Guardian included) who feel an incessant need to hype any player with any promise - when that has been corrected, Archer can be viewed as a promising player and his performances assessed accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>Merry Christmas!

      "bodyText": "Vic Marks has filed his report from Centurion, which is my cue to get back to celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. Thanks for your company and emails. Please join Tanya in the morning for day two of what could be a fascinating match. Bye! Here\u2019s Sam Curran \u201cIt\u2019s pretty even, I think. Quinton de Kock probably got away from us a little bit too quickly but to get him out so that he couldn\u2019t bat with the tail was pretty good. Fair play to him, he rode his luck and got a good score. \u201cI started cramping towards the end and Stokesy was dehydrated. It was so hot out there and there wasn\u2019t much breeze. It\u2019s my first time playing in South Africa and it was enjoyable. \u201cThe ball swung beautifully all day and there was a lot of carry in the wicket. We\u2019re pretty pleased. We want to take the last wicket as quickly as possible, then bat as big as we can and put some overs in their legs.\u201d Stumps Honours are pretty even after an interesting, topsy-turvy day of Test cricket. England\u2019s decision to bowl first looked a very good one when they reduced South Africa to 111 for five, but Quinton de Kock\u2019s thrilling, hazardous 95 changed the moodand hurried the home side towards a useful score. Sam Curran picked up deserved, Test-best figures of four for 57, while Stuart Broad (three for 52) also played an important part. There were lots of useful batting contributions for South Africa, including 39 from Zubayr Hamza and a composed 33 from the debutant Dwaine Pretorius. Broad ends a mixed day for England on a high, nipping one back to bowl Kagiso Rabada through the gate. That was a beautiful delivery, and the wicket means it will be the last ball of the day. 82nd over: South Africa 275-8 (Philander 28, Rabada 12) Rabada edges Anderson all along the ground for yet another boundary to third man, and then rifles a drive through Broad at mid-off for four more. An exasperated Anderson has a pop at everyone and no-one. 81st over: South Africa 267-8 (Philander 28, Rabada 4) A red-faced Stuart Broad takes the second new ball and is unfortunate not to pick up Philander with a beauty that jags back past the inside edge. Philander responds with a punishing drive through extra cover for four. I think this is a really useful score for South Africa. 80th over: South Africa 263-8 (Philander 24, Rabada 4) Joe Denly hurries through the 80th over, thus allowing England a few extra minutes with the second new ball. 79th over: South Africa 262-8 (Philander 22, Rabada 4) Archer has been better since tea, with figures of 8-2-14-1. In the first two sessions they were 11-2-51-0. \u201cYour all being to pedantic,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cA mussel is a mussel.\u201d And if that email is anything to go by, Boxing Day eggnog is Boxing Day eggnog. 78th over: South Africa 261-8 (Philander 22, Rabada 4) Rabada edges Curran through the vacant third slip area for four. I\u2019d love to know how many runs England have conceded to third man today. 77th over: South Africa 257-8 (Philander 22, Rabada 0) A short ball from Archer is slapped to the point boundary by Philander. His impertinence is punished with another short delivery that kicks to hit him in the ribs. There are 13 overs still be bowled today, though we\u2019ll probably only get five or six as play will end in 25 minutes. \u201cDoes that mean that the triceps connect three parts of the body?\u201d asks Jim Bax. \u201cArf!\u201d 76th over: South Africa 252-8 (Philander 17, Rabada 0) \u201cSimon Mesner is correct,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cI too looked up the dictionary definition of biceps but thought a simplified version would be more OBO-acceptable. It just goes to show one shouldn\u2019t try to second-guess things.\u201d So what\u2019s a forcep? 75th over: South Africa 252-8 (Philander 17, Rabada 0) \u201cBiceps,\u201d says James Debens. \u201cIt\u2019s all Latin. How can you comment on Curran without a basic grasp of Latin? This country!\u201d Jofra Archer gets his first wicket of the match, with Maharaj edging an awkward delivery to Stokes at second slip. It was another low catch but this time Stokes was confident he had taken it cleanly. The umpires went upstairs, with a soft signal of out, and replays showed it was a lovely take at ankle height. There was not a flicker of celebration from Archer, a reflection of the day he has had. 74th over: South Africa 247-7 (Philander 17, Maharaj 2) If England are serious about selecting on merit rather than continuing to homage the glorious Gerrard-Lampard era of English football, Sam Curran will play the next Test. That will make things interesting if England decide they need a full-time spinner. Sam Curran gets his first Test five-for, and by flip does he deserve it. He has bowled beautifully all day. Maharaj is trapped in front by another textbook inswinger... and there was an inside edge, so balls to all the above. 73rd over: South Africa 246-7 (Philander 16, Maharaj 1) Jofra Archer replaces Joe Denly. One of the many jobs England have pencilled him in for over the next decade is cleaning up the tail. His first over doesn\u2019t really threaten any hoovering, with Maharaj ignoring a series of deliveries just outside off stump. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Simon Mesner. \u201cIt pains me to correct a pedant but the biceps muscles (biceps brachii in the arm and biceps femoris in the thigh - part of the \u2018hamstrings\u2019 group) are so called as they have two heads not because they connect two parts of the body. John Starbuck, oh dear.\u201d I\u2019m staying out of this from now on. It\u2019s all going to kick off, I can sense it. 72nd over: South Africa 246-7 (Philander 15, Maharaj 1) The new batsman Maharaj just manages to get a bat on his first delivery, an inswinger that would otherwise have trapped him plumb LBW. Curran is one wicket away from his first Test five-for. This is brilliant bowling from Sam Curran. He returns to the attack, at the end of a long day, and dismisses de Kock five short of a century with a lovely outswinger. It shaved the edge as de Kock pushed forward defensively, and Jos Buttler took a simple catch. That\u2019s Curran\u2019s fourth wicket of the day, and I\u2019m not sure he has bowled better in his burgeoning Test career. 71st over: South Africa 244-6 (de Kock 95, Philander 15) de Kock has played a decreasingly irresponsible innings. You might even call it an increasingly responsible one. He has even resisted the considerable temptation to reach his century by smashing Joe Denly for six, instead dealing in no-risk singles and dot balls. 70th over: South Africa 242-6 (de Kock 94, Philander 14) Philander is beaten by Anderson, and thick edges the next ball for four. Though England haven\u2019t been at their best today, they\u2019ve also been pretty unfortunate. The upshot of all that is that South Africa are in a strong position on an awkward pitch. \u201cYep, that\u2019s not so bad at all, Mac Millings,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cWell done. However, when it comes to verse I am very difficult to satisfy. You also need to try it on a couple of pre-teen girls to see if they can come up with appropriate actions to perform it in the playground. Thus lies immortality.\u201d Sometimes I doubt Millings\u2019 commitment to Sparkle Motion. 69th over: South Africa 237-6 (de Kock 93, Philander 10) The part-time legspinner Joe Denly comes into the attack. His first over is a good one, with a bit of bounce and a couple of unsuccessful hacks from Philander. \u201cThere are people in the basement bar I\u2019m in watching the Brighton Spurs game wondering why I\u2019m on my feet applauding my smartphone,\u201d says Tom Atkins. \u201cChapeau, Mac Millings.\u201d 68th over: South Africa 236-6 (de Kock 92, Philander 10) Ah, Ben Stokes is back on the field, so perhaps he doesn\u2019t have the team bug. Anderson\u2019s 18th over the day is a quiet affair, save for one delivery that pops from a length to beat Philander. \u201cPedantry Corner: the singular of biceps is biceps,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cNo such word as bicep (it could, almost, be an unusual mushroom), as biceps refers to a muscle connecting two major parts of a body.\u201d Well, I\u2019ll be dipped in Deep Heat. I didn\u2019t know that at all. 67th over: South Africa 235-6 (de Kock 91, Philander 10) Philander is defending solidly, bicep-endangering balls notwithstanding, and England\u2019s bowlers are starting to look drained. I think South africa are in an excellent position now. That\u2019s drinks. Oh lordy, he did it. \u201cYour wish came true, John Starbuck,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d On the first day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, A Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the second day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve.

On the fifth day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the sith day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Hick, Priest, Alleyne, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the seventh day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Bevan, Swann, Ashwinning, Hick, Priest, Alleyne, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the eighth day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Speight, Hayden, Wilkin(son), Bevan, Swann, Ashwinning, Hick, Priest, Alleyne, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the ninth day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Narine, Wade, a-Lance Cairns, Speight, Hayden, Wilkin(son), Bevan, Swann, Ashwinning, Hick, Priest, Alleyne, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the tenth day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Len, Lord\u2019s, Duleeping, Narine, Wade, a-Lance Cairns, Speight, Hayden, Wilkin(son), Bevan, Swann, Ashwinning, Hick, Priest, Alleyne, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the eleventh day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, XI, Piper, Pycroft, Len, Lord\u2019s, Duleeping Narine, Wade, a-Lance Cairns, Speight, Hayden, Wilkin(son), Bevan, Swann, Ashwinning, Hick, Priest, Alleyne, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. On the twelfth day of Christmas, John Starbuck gave to me, Selve, Johnners, Cummins, XI, Piper, Pycroft, Len, Lord\u2019s, Duleeping, Narine, Wade, a-Lance Cairns, Speight, Hayden, Wilkin(son), Bevan, Swann, Ashwinning, Hick, Priest, Alleyne, Faf, Old, Singh, Moores, Collie, Bird, Sri, French, Ben, Twose, Kirtley, Love, Pandya, Parfitt, Binny, Blair, Reeve. 66th over: South Africa 234-6 (de Kock 90, Philander 10) de Kock clubs Anderson down the ground for four, a shot of vague contempt, and flicks a single to move into the nineties. England, on top for most of the first two sessions, are now struggling. 65th over: South Africa 228-6 (de Kock 85, Philander 9) Yet another streaky but effective shot from de Kock, who kitchen-sinks Broad over the slips for four more. England have conceded so many runs to third man today. de Kock is one away from equalling his highest Test score at No6. His five hundreds to date all came at No7. 64th over: South Africa 222-6 (de Kock 79, Philander 9) Philander is hit on the right bicep by a vicious lifter from Anderson. That kicked spectacularly from a length. Philander must have been tempted to smile once the pain subsided, because it suggests batting fourth will not much fun - particularly against a wicket-to-wicket bowler like Philander. Philander edges wide of second slip for four to end another exasperating over for England, whose Christmas cheer is starting to evaporate. Since slipping to 111 for five, South Africa have doubled their score for the loss of only one more wicket. 63rd over: South Africa 217-6 (de Kock 78, Philander 5) Ben Stokes is suffering from dehydration and has felt unwell since tea, which suggests he has caught the bug. If so, you\u2019d think England would want him nowhere near the dressing-room for the next couple of days at least. de Kock carries on merrily, slicing the new bowler Broad up and over the cordon for four. This has the feel of one of those matchwinning counter-attacks from Sam Curran against India in 2018 - specifically the 78 at the Ageas Bowl. England appeal optimistically for LBW with de Kock on 78. It pitched a million miles outside leg, literphorically. 62nd over: South Africa 212-6 (de Kock 74, Philander 5) Archer off, Anderson on. It looks like he wants to bore de Kock out by bowling wide of off stump, a tactic that almost works when de Kock inside edges wide of leg stump. 61st over: South Africa 211-6 (de Kock 73, Philander 5) Sam Curran goes around the wicket and almost knocks Philander off his feet with a terrific yorker. Philander just managed to dig it out before nodding respectfully at Curran. Excellent stuff from Curran, who has been comfortably the pick of the England attack. His figures are 15-5-48-3. 60th over: South Africa 208-6 (de Kock 70, Philander 5) Another accurate over from Archer, a maiden to Philander. Apparently Ben Stokes is off the field, and may be the latest man to have caught the bug that ruled Ollie Pope, Chris Woakes and Jack Leach out of this game. 59th over: South Africa 208-6 (de Kock 70, Philander 5) An accurate over from Curran to de Kock, who almost drags an attempted pull back onto the stumps. de Kock has lost a bit of rhythm. He reached fifty off 45 balls; since then he has scored 20 from 47 deliveries. 58th over: South Africa 207-6 (de Kock 70, Philander 5) de Kock is beaten, trying to uppercut a trampolining bouncer. This is a better spell from Archer, with decent intensity and nothing particularly loose; since tea he has conceded five from three overs. \u201cMerry post-Christmas, Rob and everyone,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cI\u2019m with Matt Dony on this one. As an equal fan of rugby and cricket (umbrella term: disappointment) I do think of Dan Lucas when we\u2019ve been knee-deep in some recent sporting uber-moments. I wonder, of course, what he\u2019d have done with both of Stokes\u2019 fairytales at Headingley and Lord\u2019s this summer, and Cook\u2019s retirement ton. But also to have seen not only his euphoria of England\u2019s hammering of the All Blacks and even more so, the capitulation in the final, which surely would\u2019ve been replete with 90s, angst-ridden music references. Which brings us back nicely to here. Are we going to be The Bends or Idioteque by close tonight? It\u2019s all poorer without him.\u201d 57th over: South Africa 204-6 (de Kock 69, Philander 4) de Kock, who has played with greater sobriety since tea, works Curran for a single to bring up the 200. Philander waves a drive for four to get off the mark and then survives a biggish LBW appeal from a Curran inswinger. That looked slightly better than the previous two, but not good enough for England to risk their last review. Ah, replays show it was pitching outside leg. 56th over: South Africa 199-6 (de Kock 68, Philander 0) A beautiful lifter from Archer hits de Kock on the glove and loops to safety on the off side. It\u2019s abundantly clear to anyone who has watched him this year that Jofra Archer has the potential to be the greatest sportsman of all time. Talking of which... \u201cArcher, yet another English sportsman the media has blown up into a superstar before he has done anything,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cI live in France, a country that has 3 rugby players with much more potential and performances in the bank than Archer - yet - no bluster, no getting ahead of themselves, they are simply regarded as promising players and there is no need felt by any section of the media to go further. The question that should be asked around Archer is not how he is performing, but the standards invented by the media (Guardian included) who feel an incessant need to hype any player with any promise - when that has been corrected, Archer can be viewed as a promising player and his performances assessed accordingly.\u201d Merry Christmas! (I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, by the way. For example Sam Curran\u2019s figures and achievements are almost unprecedented for an English 21-year-old, yet he has been received with caution, even suspicion, as well as the inevitable enthusiasm.) 55th over: South Africa 198-6 (de Kock 67, Philander 0) The new batsman is Vernon Philander. He\u2019s an excellent N08, as England know from that famous Test at Lord\u2019s in 2012. Sam Curran gets his third wicket! Pretorious, who survived a ludicrous LBW review from England off the previous delivery, fenced at a length ball and edged to Root at second slip. That\u2019s another good catch from Root. It was almost a no-ball, but Curran had a little bit behind the line. The debutant Pretorius has gone for an assured 33. 54th over: South Africa 191-5 (de Kock 65, Pretorius 27) Archer continues after tea, and jags one back to cut Pretorius in half. Archer has bowled in short spells today, which makes sense in almost every way. But it was noticeable that, particularly during the Ashes, he would often only hit 95mph+ in the seventh or eighth over of a spell. England haven\u2019t yet worked out the best way to use him. \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Kevin Davey. \u201cI\u2019m currently cycling from Land\u2019s End to (*appropriateness alert*) Cape Town to raise money for Let the Children Hear, an amazing charity that does exactly what you\u2019d imagine given the name - helping kids with hearing issues in Uganda. At the moment I\u2019m in Ethiopia, so a little over halfway there. By the time I arrive de Kock will probably have counterattacked his way to a score in the low hundred-thousands. If any of the OBO readers would like to put some festive coppers in the virtual tin, my JustGiving page can be found here.\u201d Please look at Kevin\u2019s page. It\u2019s a great cause, and he will be cycling approximately 10,000 (T-E-N-T-H-O-U-etc.) miles. And there I was feeling virtuous because I played walking football twice last week. 53rd over: South Africa 189-5 (de Kock 65, Pretorius 26) This should be a two-and-a-half hour evening session, with 38 overs still to bowl. The first of those, from the returning Sam Curran, passes without incident. Teatime reading \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Malcolm Ferguson. \u201cCould you tell us TMS fans why they are not broadcasting. Or have they changed channels?\u201d I think Talksport have the rights for this series. Marmite Millings \u201cPlease inform Mr Millings that I don\u2019t rate his version of \u2018Good King Wenceslas\u2019 very highly as the scanning falters a bit too much,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cHow about the \u2018Twelve days of Christmas\u2019? But you have to have the actions too.\u201d \u201cThis should not be construed as criticism of the esteemed John Starbuck, but surely there should be a BBC4 documentary commissioned about the making of Mac Millings seasonal verse masterpieces,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cThe man is clearly a genius and presumably recites Wisden in his sleep.\u201d 52nd over: South Africa 187-5 (de Kock 64, Pretorius 25) de Kock times Archer deliciously down the ground for four. Archer is going at almost five an over today, which is very unusual. Even in New Zealand, when he couldn\u2019t buy a wicket for all the Flat Whites in Oceania, he only went at 2.5 per over. He\u2019s having a tough time right now. Anyhow, that\u2019s tea. South Africa were in big trouble at 111 for five, but a lively counter-attack from Quinton de Kock, who rode his luck, and the impressive debutant Dwaine Pretorius has brought them right back into the game. It\u2019s a very hot day in Centurion, and South Africa have a chance to punish a tiring England attack in the final session. 51st over: South Africa 181-5 (de Kock 59, Pretorius 25) Pretorius flicks Broad between midwicket and mid-on for four. It was in the air, and teased both fielders, but the placement was good. Though England have been unlucky in this last hour, they have also bowled too many four-balls. \u201cAfternoon Rob, and season\u2019s greetings to everyone,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cWhere did the last 10 years go? In a blur of Guardian live blogs, that\u2019s where. You\u2019d have got good odds on 26 March 2011 that England would end the decade as 50-over world champions. Though maybe not quite as good as Donald Trump becoming US president. And who\u2019d have predicted that Brexit would go so smoothly? After all that, what can possibly happen by 2030 that could surprise us now\u2026?\u201d Well, who\u2019d have thought Mac Millings would be the man to make America great again? 50th over: South Africa 177-5 (de Kock 59, Pretorius 21) Jofra Archer returns in place of Jimmy Anderson (14-4-43-1). Joe Root is using his seamers in shorter spells than usual, such is the punishing heat in Centurion. His first ball is a beauty that beats de Kock\u2019s outside edge; his second is filth and flicked to fine leg for four. An eventful over concludes with a jaffa that lifts past the outside edge, and an inside-edge from de Kock that just misses the stumps. He has had all kinds of fortune today. 49th over: South Africa 173-5 (de Kock 55, Pretorius 21) Broad, on for Root, is flicked through midwicket for three by de Kock. This has been a vital innings from de Kock; even at this stage, it has the potential to be matchwinning. After typing the above, I went straight to my inbox to find this from Andy Bradshaw. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d he says. \u201cI love Test series in South Africa. Superb Christmas holiday timings. Anyway, \u202ade Kock\u2019s Brad Haddining his way to a matchwinning score here.\u201d If South Africa get to 300, I think they\u2019ll be in a fine position. 48th over: South Africa 167-5 (de Kock 52, Pretorius 20) \u201cRecently, someone wrote an email to the Fiver that included a number of Manic Street Preachers references,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cIt instantly reminded me of how often I sent Manics-based jokes to Dan Lucas when he was masterfully covering Wales rugby matches. At a time of year when many people are obligated to spend time with family (whether they want to or not), it\u2019s a nice reminder of the old cliche; \u2018Friends are family we choose for ourselves.\u2019 Now, as trite as it sounds, the thing with cliches is that they are usually cliched for a reason. They\u2019re generally accurate. And, \u2018friends\u2019 can happily include people you\u2019ve never met, but correspond with occasionally (even if it\u2019s only with sports/music related puns, sarcasm, observations etc). A friend still missed.\u201d Amen to that. I want to hear his enthusiasm/contempt for so much in the last few years, from Slowthai to this year\u2019s World Cup finals to the state of almost everything in the real world. 47th over: South Africa 167-5 (de Kock 51, Pretorius 19) Pretorius drives Root elegantly over mid-off for a one-bounce four. He has played nicely on debut so far, though we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. His first-class numbers are extremely impressive: 39 with the bat, 24 with the ball. 46th over: South Africa 162-5 (de Kock 50, Pretorius 15) Pretorius heaves at a wide ball from Anderson, thick-edging it to third man for four. It feels like England, under Joe Root, concede a lot of runs down there. A single for Pretorius brings up a frantic, frisky fifty partnership in just 9.1 overs; and then a single for de Kock brings up a frantic, frisky fifty from just 45 balls. Discretion isn\u2019t always the better part of valour. \u201cBad verse, John Starbuck?\u201d sniffs Mac Millings. \u201cYou are obviously as yet unacquainted with the first two stanzas of my \u2018Good King Wenceslas\u2019. Goodwin, Benson, Vaas, Cook, Grout, Hondo, Priest of Steve Finn, Fender, Snow, La Roux, Don, Grout, Dipak, Pant, Finn (Steven). Bright, Lee, Shaun Tait, Munaf, Knight, Botham, Foster, Udal, Fender, Pooran, Amiss, Wright, Gatt, Ravindra, Sewell. 45th over: South Africa 156-5 (de Kock 49, Pretorius 10) Another lucky escape for de Kock! He tries to lap-sweep Root and contrives to toe-end the ball over the head of Stokes at slip. \u201cThirty years ago, we used to have to wait until 3pm for Boxing Day to start,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cBut in recent years, it starts at 11.30pm on Christmas Day with the diamond bright sun of Melbourne. If we can just pull it forward to 7pm (dinner digested and brandy in hand) I\u2019ll be even happier.\u201d Gary Naylor has created a petition for Tonga to be granted Test status. Signatures so far: 1. 44th over: South Africa 152-5 (de Kock 45, Pretorius 10) The more you see replays of that Stokes catch, the more it looks like it might have bounced straight into the fingers. Mike Atherton makes the point that the soft signal is king - had that been out, it would have been hard for the third umpire to overrule the on-field decision. By saying he wasn\u2019t sure, Stokes probably cost England a wicket. Anderson replaces Curran, meanwhile, and de Kock edges him twice to the third-man boundary. The first went over the slips, the second all along the floor. He is starting to wind England up. He\u2019s had plenty of fortune, that much is true, but his 37-ball 45 has brought South Africa back into the game. 43rd over: South Africa 143-5 (de Kock 36, Pretorius 10) Ben Stokes has not bowled yet, which is interesting in the context of Root\u2019s introduction. Pretorius lifts Root handsomely over wide long-on for six, the first boundary of his Test career. Root continues to threaten, however, and de Kock edges him a fraction short of Stokes at slip. Stokes said he wasn\u2019t sure it had carried, so the umpires went upstairs to check with a soft signal of not out. Replays showed that it was seriously close, but not out. Anderson, by the way, is back on the field. 42nd over: South Africa 133-5 (de Kock 34, Pretorius 2) de Kock is not going to change his approach, lucky escape or no lucky escape. He pulls Curran for four, and then inside-edges another boundary to move to 34 from 28 balls. He is living very dangerously, but that usually makes for great entertainment. \u201cMorning (GMT) Rob,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cAs you\u2019ll have seen, today\u2019s OBO has covered comestibles, in-laws, socks and bad verse. All pretty routine but, on a day when The Guardian has been going on about \u2018best of the decade\u2019 features, which is the best OBO since 2010, and why?\u201d Well, now, that\u2019s a good question. The most euphoric, as a writer, were Kevin Pietersen\u2019s various JFK innings, especially the 149 against South Africa in 2012. It was like being on Class A drugs, only they were legal and made entirely of cricket. As a reader, I really enjoyed the late Dan Lucas\u2019s on the worst night of the decade. The late Dan Lucas. That\u2019ll never look right. 41st over: South Africa 125-5 (de Kock 26, Pretorius 2) Joe Root turns for the first time to England\u2019s spinner, Joe Root. His first ball is rubbish and toe-ended for four by de Kock - bit this third ball nearly brought the vital wicket! He played a seriously loose drive, clouting it back over the bowler\u2019s head, and the ball landed this far in front of the diving Anderson as he ran back from mid-off. Anderson leaves the field at the end of the over, though I\u2019m not sure what the problem might be. 40th over: South Africa 118-5 (de Kock 20, Pretorius 1) Oof. Curran beats Pretorius with two of the first three balls after drinks. The first was a loose stroke, the second a lovely delivery. There\u2019s an unsuccessful LBW appeal later in the over, when Pretorius whips around an inswinger. It was missing leg. A splendid maiden from Curran nonetheless; he has been superb today. Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. Season\u2019s greetings to you all! Isn\u2019t it nice to have some Test cricket to take the edge off the peculiar comedown that is Boxing Day. England have had a good day so far, though they should not feel comfortable in the box seat until they end Quinton de Kock\u2019s counter-attack. 39th over: South Africa 116-5 (de Kock 18, Pretorius 1) Broad to de Kock, de Kock watches the ball go by, bat horizontal. We wait for the flow of the bat, it comes, a drive, but is nicely saved by a diving, sunglassed, long-sleeved Denly at sweeper. And that\u2019s drinks, advantage England. I\u2019m handing over now to OBO guru Rob Smyth, who will guide you through to the close. Thanks for all the emails and tweets. Happy Boxing Day everyone! 38th over: South Africa 116-5 (de Kock 18, Pretorius 1) Beautiful bowling from Sam Curran, another maiden. 37th over: South Africa 116-5 (de Kock 18, Pretorius 1) Broad has found his mojo, part temptation, part puritanical restraint. Not that de Kock cares, he smashes his last ball through the covers for four more. Watch and learn young Pretorius. Morning Tanya, writes Damian Clark, seasons felicitations. I\u2019ve just got in from ferrying a bus load of in-laws back to ours, and now I\u2019m hiding in the kitchen until it\u2019s time to ferry them all home again later. Just read your fluorescent socks comment, and oh blimey! I bought loads of them at a time from probably the same stall as you in \u201885. They were so crap, I wore through them in days, but so de rigeur for any young student at the zenith of his sartorial elegance. Kitchen hiding is a dark art. The ball after a moment of fast-bowling perfection, that missed du Plessis\u2019s bat by an envelope, Broad gets his edge! 36th over: South Africa 109-4 (du Plessis 29, de Kock 14) du Kock tucks into Sam Curran in the spirit of Boxing Day. A silky-snooth drive through the covers for one four, then turned off his toes through mid-wicket for a second, and a slash n burn through backward point for a third. Incidentally... 35th over: South Africa 97-4 (du Plessis 29, de Kock 0) Archer is pulled after a short spell again by Root, who seems to have had a re-think after the New Zealand strategy. du Plessis plays out a maiden from Broad. 34th over: South Africa 97-4 (du Plessis 29, de Kock 0) A wicket-maiden for Sam Curran. Is it because of his size. Do opposition continually under-estimate him? Breathe a sigh of relief when he comes on and subconciously relax? This is a work of genius Mac Millings, but apologies if my line returns don\u2019t scan. I did one of these on a football theme for the MBM, but I wouldn\u2019t want the OBOers to miss out on the festive \u2018fun\u2019. And don\u2019t forget to sing along...

Brought back from the River End, his second ball pitches just in the kitchen of worry, and van der Dussen spatulates an edge to first slip. 33rd over: South Africa 97-3 (du Plessis 29, van der Dussen 6) Archer; disappointed. His walk back to his mark is so leisurely as to be almost hobbling. He tests Faf again with a wide one, but du Plessis turns up his nose this time, and that\u2019s the third maiden in a row. du Plessis reviews immediately after being given out caught behind off Archer... ...not out, despite ultra edge spiking, the pictures show the ball well past the bat by then. 32nd over: South Africa 97-3 (du Plessis 29, van der Dussen 6) Anderson has found his rhythm after lunch, here he has van der Dussen hopelessly at sea, pushing at one he shouldn\u2019t have, that misses by a breath. 31st over: South Africa 97-3 (du Plessis 29, van der Dussen 6) All smooth in the good ship Jofra until the final ball which was a rotten sprout, leafy, odorous, and thrashed through the covers by du Plessis. 30th over: South Africa 93-3 (du Plessis 25, van der Dussen 6) Anderson tightens the screw on van der Dussen, who pats him away with angled bat and tidy leaves. Just noticed that du Plessis\u2019s pink gloves match his bat. On point, reminds me of the florescent socks they used to sell at Woking market in 1985. I had them in florescent yellow, but didnt\u2019 them off with as much flair as Faf. 29th over: South Africa 92-3 (du Plessis 25, van der Dussen 4 ) Archer and Root have a chat as Archer drifts towards du Plessis and van der Dussen\u2019s hips. According to the Sky graphics, Archer has bowled only 2 of 38 balls this innings at the batsmen\u2019s stumps. But, as Mark Nicholas points out, that isn\u2019t necessarily the way he works. 28th over: South Africa 90-3 (du Plessis 25, van der Dussen 4 ) Anderson is back, beginning with a loosener - but without the crackerjack result that started the first session. He gradually tightens the line, some fine-tuning of the old piano, keys worn bare but it still knows the best tunes. \u201cHi Tanya and merry Christmas to you and the OBO faithful,\u201d writes John Withington. Merry Christmas John! I see brother Brian is off the mark already in this test. For my own part I\u2019m doing all the driving, as was always the way in our opening partnerships in the badlands of Essex league cricket. So I\u2019m taking the opportunity of my own drinks break, half way through a 6 hour innings behind the wheel to catch up. I hope the goose I\u2019ll be cooking tonight for his family and mine will provide more festive food puns to describe the South African innings. 27th over: South Africa 89-3 (du Plessis 24, van der Dussen 4 ) A sloppy post-prandial over from Archer, as du Plessis dumps him for two fours through mid-wicket on the leg side. As England and South Africa march out after lunch, Ian Sparling wonders why Ollie Pope isn\u2019t playing. Hi Ian, Pope, as well as Jack Leach and Chris Woakes, are picking over the turkey bones in quarantine in the team hotel suffering from flu. Thank you very much OBOers! We now have the answer to Matt Wilson\u2019s Faf conundrum. (over 24) Louwrens Botha: Faf is indeed a common nickname for Francois (see also their World Cup-winning scrumhalf). The \u2018five/two plus three\u2019 idea would be pretty far-fetched even if Faf had grown up speaking English.. Andy Buddery: Hi Tanya. Can confirm Faf is a common nickname of Francois (see also Faf De Klerk). Can also confirm that as a child in South Africa, our grade one class of six year old comedians used to call our teacher, Mrs du Plessis, Mrs Two Plus Three. So in a way, Matt\u2019s friends are both right and can both be happy. Merry Christmas. Jon Leiper: Just to confirm that Faf has nothing to do with 5. It is very definitely a popular short form of Francois. Rendel Harris: To answer Matt Wilson\u2019s question about du Plessis\u2019 nickname, neither of the reasons suggested are correct; here\u2019s the man himself from a Facebook Q&amp;A:Got the nickname Faf when I was young. There was a rugby player who was called Faffa Knoetze - as a baby, I kept repeating his name. And off they trot for a lot of liquid, and a lie down. A wicket each for Anderson, Broad, and Sam Curran, with skiddy Curran, 5-2-8-1 the pick of the bowlers. England were a bit creaky with the ball, understandably after sickness and injury, but will be happy enough with three wickets at lunch. Hamza played beautifully but he, like Elgar and Markram, played some loose shots. I\u2019m going to grab a coffee and open a present, see you back here in half an hour! 26th over: South Africa 79-3 (du Plessis 14, van der Dussen 4 ) On Sky they\u2019re talking Brexit. \u201cI\u2019m just getting over it, says Nasser. A maiden from Broad, nicely played out by van der Dussen, and that\u2019s lunch. Oh Gary, that\u2019s harsh. 25th over: South Africa 79-3 (du Plessis 14, van der Dussen 4 ) Joe Root whips off Anderson to give Archer a couple before lunch. He sends in a couple of nip-backers, and appeals, with increasing vibrancy, for a couple of lbws. Turned down, rightly. du Plessis plays out the maiden. 24th over: South Africa 79-3 (du Plessis 14, van der Dussen 4 ) A four for van der Dussen - a forthright dispatch to the rope of an over-pitched Christmas pudding from Broad. That\u2019ll settle the nerves. Merry Christmas! writes Matt Wilson. \u201cI was hoping you could settle a long standing argument between two of my friends. One claims that Francois du Plessis got his nickname of \u2018Faf\u2019 because it sounds a bit like five, and du Plessis sounds a bit like \u2018two plus three\u2019. The other says Faf is a common nickname for Francois. Do you know which is correct? Matt, I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t know. But I bet there\u2019s an OBO reader out there with the answers at their fingertips... 23rd over: South Africa 75-3 (du Plessis 14, van der Dussen 0 ) Ah that Centurion Sky! Pure forget-me-not blue. du Plessis kisses Anderson through gully for four, the debutant van der Dussen at the other end. 22nd over: South Africa 71-3 (du Plessis 10) So Broad grabs a wicket and England chip away, despite not dominating in the way the scoreboard might suggest. Some reckless shots from South Africa this morning. Apparently Broad had not bowled a ball this tour because of sickness, and was this morning taking his kit out its plastic packaging as he hadn\u2019t yet opened it. The ball after a pitch-perfect, head over knee, cover drive, Hamza pushes outside off stump and is caught shin-high by Stokes at second slip. What a shame, he was batting beautifully, showing, as Michael Holding had just pointed out, until that moment, perfect judgement outside off-stump. 21st over: South Africa 64-2 (du Plessis 10, Hamza 33) The pitch is mottled beige and mossy green and looks dry. Just two from Anderson\u2019s over, as Hamza casually turns the last ball off his hip. Sam Hey wonders why England are wearing black armbands. It\u2019s in memory of Bob Willis, Sam, who died just over three weeks ago. 20th over: South Africa 62-2 (du Plessis 9, Hamza 32) A double change, as Broad takes the ball back from Sam Curran. He\u2019s on the money, just short, just wide of Hamza, twice on a crack, and Hamza two balls in a row flirts in cheap lace. He does well to survive. Leon Wylie wins email of the session. \u201c1st ball in a boxing day test. It has to be a \u201cTurkey\u201d. 19th over: South Africa 62-2 (du Plessis 9, Hamza 32) Ah, Anderson is back, somewhat surprisingly, as Archer was producing the occasional gem against du Plessis. Perhaps Root didn\u2019t like the run leakage. Anderson varies his length nicely, and that\u2019s a maiden. 18th over: South Africa 61-2 (du Plessis 9, Hamza 31) Just a couple for du Plessis as Curran keeps it tight. There\u2019s a good crowd at Centurion, lots of shade, lots of short-sleeves, lots of ice-creams. John Westwell drops us a note before heading off for a bracing walk on the beach. \u201c I\u2019d suggest that Angel Delight is much more deserving of the term \u2018devil\u2019s food\u2019 than Christmas pudding. Only a fallen angel (ie Lucifer himself) could find that powdery triumph of marketing palatable.\u201d Very true, though butterscotch instant whip had its place in the 1980s kitchen. 17th over: South Africa 59-2 (du Plessis 7, Hamza 31) An eventful over. Two heavenly drives from Hamza as Archer goes full, through the covers, then back down the ground. Then he shrugs up some extra bounce from nowhere and du Plessis is up on his toes fending the ball away past slip for another four. 16th over: South Africa 45-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 22) A maiden from Curran, varying the length, varying the line, but du Plessis is equal to it, his bright pink bat handle flashing in the sun. Dave Seare is back from the kitchen I did a quick sweep of the kitchen and it\u2019s a vitamin c-free zone this morning. Still undecided, I\u2019ve had a bit of cheese to help the thought process. It\u2019s a good sign that South Africa are keen to help England out with some gift wickets. Curran is the kind of player that always seems greater than the sum of his parts and makes the team feel better. Your mention of mince pies has given me an idea...... 15th over: South Africa 45-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 22) Shot of the day from Hamza as Archer drifts short and wide, he throws the bat, and cuts with his Sabatier for four. A finely cut steak, an expensive bitter mint. But Archer in on his case, and Hamza is tempted, so tempted, by one that zips past the edge of his bat. One all. 14th over: South Africa 41-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 18) It\u2019s Curran again after drinks. A short one lobs over du Plessis\u2019 head and is called a wide. No runs off the bat from the over. Brian Withington makes a tinselly appearance: \u201cIn reply to Martin Laidler (over 4) I\u2019m not sure about the universally approved technical term for a first ball dismissal in a series, but am reminded of yesterday\u2019s dinner (aka very late lunch) that included a stuffed, deboned duck with spiced plum glaze. Hence I offer \u2018Plum(b) Duck\u2019 (if only it had been lbw)?\u201d Very good! 13th over: South Africa 40-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 18) du Plessis negociates another awkward over, this time from Archer. His best ball is a rising rocket, which du Plessis tickles just past Bairstow diving at short leg. And that\u2019s drinks. Advantage England, with Archer-Curran looking more dangerous than Broad-Anderson. Indeed, Guy Hornsby is reaching for the valediction pills. Jofra and Curran (S) on first change. Two contrasting propositions, both able to make something happen. Just like that! Sam seems so inocuous, but has that edge about him. It feels like a bit of a changing of the guard. I don\u2019t want to deepen those post-Christmas blues but how much longer until we don\u2019t have Anderson and Broad\u2019s mastery to call upon? Even though I\u2019m in my 40s, it almost feels as if they\u2019ve been leading the attack for ever. Will they both make the Ashes? Who knows, but we\u2019ve been honoured to have them. 12th over: South Africa 36-2 (du Plessis 0, Hamza 16) Curran is trouble this morning, giving du Plessis a Boxing Day work out. He starts the over wide, then has him poking to slip and finally beats du Plessis with a 138 kph screamer. A heavy-weight, booze-laden mince pie disguised as angel delight. 11th over: South Africa 36-2 (du Plessis 0, Hamza 16) A double change, as Archer replaces Anderson. His loosener is 143 kph, the fastest ball of the day, and Hamza decides to leave it on a length. It laughs as it brushes over the stumps. Hamza clips the last ball of the over through square leg for four. Pudding for breakfast? writes James Debens. What fresh hell is this? A black coffee to kickstart the metabolism, followed by a satsuma or three to cleanse the palate. A satsuma/an orange should always be offered to anyone who crosses your threshold, rolled across your table if the guest is South African, of course. The offer of a satsuma rather than a biscuit or, ye gods, a slice of Christmas pudding, shows that you care about your guest\u2019s wellbeing and any potential gluten intolerance they may have.\u201d 10th over: South Africa 32-2 (du Plessis 0, Hamza 12) Joe Root has had enough of his elder statesmen and throws the ball to Sam Curran. Immediately, he makes things happen. First Markram thrashes him, wildly, through the covers. Then he edges him just short of slip, Then the wicket, to his fourth ball. Curran\u2019s bowling at 137 kph - faster than Broad, and the same speed as Anderson. Off his hips, straight to Bairstow at short midwicket! What a bowling change by Root. Top marks for field placings too. 9th over: South Africa 28-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 12) Anderson has had quite a severe haircut for his return. A maiden, if without quite the zip of vintage JA. 8th over: South Africa 28-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 12) The South Africans have very jaunty green numbers on their backs. A not particularly special over from Broad, and Markram and Hamza bat them away without too many problems Morning Tanya, Morning Dave! \u201cCame downstairs and saw South Africa batting. Thought \u2018poor Root, not much luck at the toss.\u2019 But it seems he forgot about winning the toss, thinking about bowling before having a bat. Brave. Should I have Christmas pudding (the breakfast of champions), a plate of biscuits from a fancy box or get stuck into the Tower \u2018o\u2019 Pringles that\u2019s taunting me from the other side of the room? Might just go straight to the Rennies, Cleanse your palate with a satsuma, then perhaps a shortbread or three? Christmas pudding, arghghghg! The devil\u2019s food. 7th over: South Africa 25-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 9) Anderson is probing away at Hamza. Atherton points out that you can see a lot of his stumps. It\u2019s hot out there by the way, up in the early thirties, and humid. 6th over: South Africa 24-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 8) Broad reasserts some control with a maiden. Hamza is one to watch. 5th over: South Africa 24-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 8) A flurry of runs as Anderson goes for a most uncharacteristic 11 from the over. Markram dispatches two fours in a row, a wristy swish before throwing himself at a short wide one which flies over the outstretched hand of Root at slip. For dessert, a back foot drive for three. 4rd over: South Africa 13-1 (Markram 5, Hamza 8) Broad is experimenting, wide of off stump, short and a good length. Hamza gets him away for two, punching him down the ground. 3rd over: South Africa 10-1 (Markram 4, Hamza 6) The only bowler with 150 caps runs in, joints as oiled as a seal. A maiden. It\u2019s the time of year, to contemplate the divine on earth. Matt Dony has spotted him, at Centurion. \u201cAt what point do we have have to admit that Anderson probably isn\u2019t human, and face the ethical problems arising from that realisation? 37 years old. Fast bowler. Leading the line and Taking Test wickets regularly. It\u2019s not right... 2nd over: South Africa 10-1 (Markram 4, Hamza 6) At the other end, Joe Root throws the new ball to Broad, so in their first match together, Anderson and Archer won\u2019t share the new ball. Ah, that\u2019s a lovely shot from Markram, straight down the ground for four, a gentle caress. Markram has been out with a broken wrist sustained punching a wall after being given out for a duck in Pune. 1st over: South Africa 5-1 (Markram (RHB) 0, Hamza 5)Hamza walks out to a gob-struck Centurion, in only his third Test. That was a bit of a shocker from Elgar to an Anderson loosener, a gloved aside to Buttler, the dud joke in the Christmas cracker A typically probing over from Anderson follows. And Jeremy, we have an answer from Anthony Noel (thanks, Anthony) - the coverage of this series is on TalkSport not TMS. Elgar tries half-heartedly to clip Anderson off his hip and Anderson has a wicket with the very first ball of the series! There\u2019s a bit of a delay as someone, a photographer perhaps, seems to have fallen over on the boundary. Anderson waits at the top of his run. Does anyone please have the TMS overseas link for Jeremy Dresner? Something to mull over... but a tasty seam attack for England: Broad, Anderson, Archer, Stokes, Curran. In Hong Kong, Tim Maitland is uneasy. \u201cI\u2019m 100% sure Joe Root has done the right thing bowling first. This way the agony will be dosed out over three sessions and into the second day. I don\u2019t have enough booze or chocolate in the house to deal with the clatter of 10 wickets before lunch, because we all know this winter has all the hallmarks of an English cricketing disaster don\u2019t we?!\u201d The players walk out for the anthems, and England are wearing black arm bands in memory of dear Bob Willis, RIP. Flu-gate: South Africa: Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Zubayr Hamza, Faf du Plessis, Rassie van der Dussen, Quinton de Kock, Dwaine Pretorius, Vernon Philnder, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortie. England: Rory Burns, Dom Sibley, Joe Denly, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Sam Curran, Jofra Archer, James Anderson, Stuart Broad. Mike Atherton on the toss. \u201cAll the chat is that this pitch deteriorates at the back end of the game, fine to bowl first but you better damn well make sure you get a first-innings lead.\u201d And a straight-talkin Christmas to you too Mike! Ah, brilliant! We have an expert. Thanks Adrian Goldman. \u201dAs a biological scientist, no, flu jabs are not country specific. They are manufactured against what scientists believe is the most likely collection of H (haemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase) antigens present on the influenza virus of that season. These two proteins are the most abundant on the surface of an influenza virus. Most of the time we get it pretty correct; and I agree with Gary: once you\u2019ve had a flu jab, you never, ever, go without. Especially if you\u2019ve had the flu in an earlier season. But having the flu jab doesn\u2019t provide 100% protection, especially if the variants are slightly unusual. So the party may have had them, but people may nonetheless get a little sick - and obviously that isn\u2019t OK for a professional athlete, whereas it would be OK for an office job.\u201d Joe Root has won the toss and will bowl. \u201cIt is quite a tricky decision to make but we think it is a great opportunity on this track.\u201d Jack Leach isn\u2019t fit, Ben Stokes is playing, they go in with a five-man attack. Faf du Plessis says he\u2019d have batted first anyway, \u201cOn day one the wicket is generally quite slow here, on days two and three it is decent, and then the cracks start to open.\u201d In the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, Australia are on top, thanks to fifties from Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith, despite Trent Boult dispatching Joe Burns\u2019s stumps with the first ball of the game. As it happened, here. Gary Naylor is up bright and early. Happy Christmas! That\u2019s a good question. Though I don\u2019t think the jab protects you from every strain of flu - perhaps it is country specific?! Any expertise welcome. Something to digest with your Boxing Day coffee. Since 2010 Vernon Philander has been the best bowler with the Kookobura ball. The second? Kagiso Rabada A couple of stats as Sky warms up - in the last decade, Centurion has been the worst Test ground for spin bowlers. And, this morning, Jimmy Anderson becomes the first bowler to play 150 Tests. Ever. He and Stuart Broad are playing darts with Ian Ward. They talk about bowling with the kookaburra ball. \u201cThe balls are different here,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a slightly different seam, it feels harder, you might get ten overs of decent swing. The atmospheric conditions here are good, so are the pitches, you get carry. We\u2019re thinking it is going to be different to how it was in New Zealand.\u201d I hope yesterday was full of good cheer and good people. To those who were unhappy, a virtual hug: come, there\u2019s plenty of space on the OBO sofa. The chocolate orange is on me. Over in Centurion, they\u2019re preparing for the big one - the face off between the bottom and sixth placed sides in the World Test Championship, the first of four Tests between South Africa and England. England gather together their walking wounded after a bout of flu has rampaged through the camp - we wait to see what team they cobble together for the seam friendly Centurion pitch. Early sufferers Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad trained yesterday, but Ollie Pope and Chris Woakes were both missing and showing signs of the lurgy. James Anderson, who missed both the summer\u2019s Ashes series and the tour of New Zealand with a calf injury, is raring to go. Thankfully, Ben Stokes\u2019s father Ged has showed signs of improvement in intensive care and his condition has stabilised, Stokes trained on Christmas Day and was due to make a decision on whether to play overnight. England have lost five of their last six away series, but their last Test series defeat in South Africa was under Nasser Hussain in 1999-2000. South Africa are not in the greatest health. They\u2019ve have a tumultuous six months - off-field boardroom shenanigans, disputes with players, loss of a sponsor, revoking of journalists accreditation, whitewashed in a Test series in India - but now sit with a formidable new top table team: (interim) director of cricket Graeme Smith, coach Mark Boucher and batting coach Jacques Kallis. Team-wise, Temba Bavuma is out with injury, and South Africa are likely to play two Test newbies, batsman Rassie van der Dussen, South Africa\u2019s second-highest run-scorer in the World Cup, and allrounder Dwaine Pretorius. Meanwhile, all-rounder Vernon Philander has announced his retirement at the end of the series Hope that\u2019s wet your whistle. See you here soon, play starts at 8am GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Millions of homes can look forward to lower energy bills in 2020 after the market price for gas fell by half in the last year to reach lows not seen in a decade. Suppliers are expected to cut their dual-fuel tariffs as energy market prices continue to tumble in the new year because of a growing glut of gas in the global market. The market price for gas has plummeted across Europe as a record number of cargoes from the US, Russia and Qatar have flooded into the continent. In the UK the market price for gas hit 10-year lows of 24.75p per therm in September, compared with an average price of 55.63p in the same month last year as imports of liquified natural gas (LNG) reached new highs. The record number of seabound cargoes arriving on UK shores has kept gas market prices below 40p per therm, even as temperatures fall, and experts believe the price will drop further in the months ahead. Energy analysts at Cornwall Insight have predicted that the record high gas imports could mean falling energy bills for millions of homes covered by the government\u2019s energy price cap this summer. Ofgem lowered winter energy bills for 15 million households earlier this year after a steady decline in energy market prices. The energy regulator is expected to cut bills even further when it updates the cap in April. James Brabben, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said gas market prices have fallen by a fifth since the regulator\u2019s last energy price cut after a mild start to winter and a deluge of gas supplies in the European market. \u201cA significant fall in gas prices is likely to result in lower tariffs for customers,\u201d Brabben said. Octopus Energy became the first supplier to announce a 2020 energy price drop after promising to cut an average of \u00a3160 a year for almost 250,000 customers on standard variable tariffs. The renewable energy company said it would pass on the benefit of falling wholesale prices from 15 January. James Huckstepp, an analyst at S&amp;P Global Platts, said gas contracts are expected to fall by a further 30% to an average of 27p per therm in 2020 because more LNG is predicted to make its way to Europe\u2019s gas storage surplus at record levels. \u201cThis trend is set to endure into 2020 as the US continues to ramp up its LNG export capacity while Russia, which is Europe\u2019s largest gas supplier, refuses to reduce flows to Europe as it seeks to protect market share despite low gas prices,\u201d he said. The UK has imported a record number of LNG cargoes in the last year as the US and Russia compete for dominance in the growing market. Ed Cox, an LNG expert at ICIS, said the number of cargoes has been \u201cthe most we\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 and the outlook is for the same again next year\u201d. LNG deliveries more than doubled from 5m metric tonnes last year to more than 12m tonnes of LNG in 2019. Qatar has supplied the UK with LNG cargoes for years and remains the UK\u2019s largest source of LNG, followed by Russia and the US.",

      "body": "<p>A week ago, Alex Pettyfer had all four wisdom teeth out. It is only after a sometimes fractious interview (over the phone, after he cancelled a face-to-face meeting) that it strikes me as an appropriate note on which to open. Questions of the wisdom that comes with age crop up more than once for the actor, who was widely reported to be a \u201cbad boy\u201d at his breakout moment early in the 2010s and is now four months shy of 30.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3eda4e9ad69a5a953b690b05e33242e30fde8a63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3eda4e9ad69a5a953b690b05e33242e30fde8a63/782_323_1293_1616/800.jpg\" alt=\"Creating work for himself \u2026 Alex Pettyfer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creating work for himself \u2026 Pettyfer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Stevenage into an acting family, Pettyfer rose to fame aged 15 in the title role of a TV film of Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays, then as the teen spy Alex Rider in the big-screen adaptation of Anthony Horowitz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/21/family.comedy\" title=\"\">Stormbreaker</a>. Although the film bombed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/jul/16/features.magazine37\" title=\"\">Pettyfer\u2019s good looks, athleticism and talent</a> meant that he was tipped as an incoming leading man \u2013 promise on which he seemed to be making good when, in 2012, he was cast as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/12/magic-mike-review\" title=\"\">Channing Tatum\u2019s protege in Magic Mike</a>.</p> <p>But by then, at 22, Pettyfer had developed a reputation for arrogance, mostly from <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-a-list-how-bad-784166\" title=\"\">reports</a> from the set of the teen sci-fi flick I Am Number Four. Relations between Pettyfer and the film\u2019s director broke down: the CEO of DreamWorks had to intervene. Then Magic Mike was dogged by reports of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/alex-pettyfer-channing-tatum-feud-magic-mike\" title=\"\">feud with Tatum \u2013 by Pettyfer\u2019s admission</a>, over rent he owed Tatum\u2019s friend and refused to pay \u201cbecause life is so much more\u201d than money.</p> <p>Pettyfer denies his bad reputation was deserved, saying that he was afraid to be himself on an unfriendly set. He did not return for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/29/magic-mike-xxl-review-strippers-channing-tatum\" title=\"\">Magic Mike: XXL</a>; Hollywood Reporter took this to mean that the \u201cbad boy got sidelined\u201d by the film industry.

He struggled with anxiety as a young man, he says. When I ask how he managed that, growing up in the spotlight, he responds as though I have implied he didn\u2019t manage it. \u201cMy mum said to me: \u2018You can\u2019t put an old head on young shoulders.\u2019\u201d He adds, as though an afterthought: \u201cI think \u2013 meditation, you know.\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201cAs humans, we can only evolve. I think that the times that I had that were difficult as a young man, I grew from those experiences. The only thing you can ever do from any experience, positive or negative, is to grow from it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"999b2491c4d002d81eb5ad11227c65047d016da0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/999b2491c4d002d81eb5ad11227c65047d016da0/334_587_5778_3466/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Pettyfer in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Magic Mike, 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the raw \u2026 Pettyfer in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Magic Mike, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What difficult times are you talking about, I ask? Pettyfer shies away from specifics, later seeming to read bad faith into the attempt to clarify his meaning. \u201cWell \u2013 any difficult time! I\u2019m not just talking about difficult, I\u2019m talking about the positive times as well.\u201d</p> <p>When he was younger, Pettyfer says, he sometimes misunderstood \u201cwhat the business side of our industry is expecting\u201d. Acting is inherently a \u201cvery selfish\u201d discipline, he says; he has greater appreciation for the hard work and collaboration that goes into a film now that he has made his own.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had the experience that I had today back then, I probably would have done things differently. But the reason that I\u2019m the man I am today is because of the experiences I endured [when working as an actor] as a young boy.\u201d</p> <p>Back Roads, which Pettyfer stars in, directed and produced, is a harrowing drama about a family in rural Pennsylvania struggling with the aftermath of violence and abuse. Pettyfer\u2019s character is left to care for his three younger sisters after their mother (played with gusto by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/15/juliette-lewis-august-osage-county\" title=\"\">Juliette Lewis</a>) is imprisoned for their father\u2019s murder. When he begins an affair with a married neighbour, family secrets start to emerge and the slow burn picks up pace \u2013 explosively. It is challenging material, more gritty and nuanced than anything Pettyfer has been thrown in the past, and as a director he is assured, even potentially stylish.</p> <p>\u201cI think you have to do a couple more movies before you have a style,\u201d Pettyfer says good-humouredly, and I dare to hope that we are out of the woods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"743290417ccb071a37f65faefc7202bbfd14a4f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/743290417ccb071a37f65faefc7202bbfd14a4f4/0_79_1572_943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pettyfer in I Am Number Four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unusual power \u2026 Pettyfer in I Am Number Four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dream Works/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had been attached to the project for years before being given the opportunity to direct it. Going behind the camera gave him a new perspective on the industry. To make that point (and after earlier describing the two of us enjoying a hypothetical trip around an art gallery to illustrate his point that \u201cart is for interpretation\u201d), Pettyfer takes me on another thought exercise.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a journalist, you sit here and you ask me the difficult questions in a very polite way, and I\u2019m trying to be polite back. I know that you read the past newspapers, whatever you want, to do your research. But imagine then I make the roles reverse, and I\u2019m asking you questions, and you\u2019re put on the spot. It then gives you a different perspective of how you would do your job next.\u201d</p> <p>My perspective is that we have different ideas of difficult questions \u2013 we still have not discussed directly the controversies surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/24/i-am-number-four-review\" title=\"\">I Am Number Four</a>, Tatum or his reputation.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/08/anthony-bourdain-chef-found-dead-61\" title=\"\">Anthony Bourdain [the late chef and TV host]</a> was an amazing journalist,\u201d says Pettyfer. \u201cHe was humble and gracious and he was intrigued by people\u2019s lives, but didn\u2019t look for a negative spin.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3f2536575bfb6731bd56c799d5abbf247cb4234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3f2536575bfb6731bd56c799d5abbf247cb4234/0_87_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Dayo Okeniyi in Endless Love, from 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Dayo Okeniyi in Endless Love, from 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seeing the trust that Lewis, Jennifer Morrison and other actors in Back Roads put in him as director led Pettyfer to realise that, as an actor, he had not always done the same. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, as a young boy, to put your full emotional trust into another person who is trying to guide you creatively.\u201d</p> <p>He felt vulnerable then, he says. More recently, he has experienced working on Back Roads and other films with a predominantly female cast and crew \u2013 where production goes \u201cso smoothly \u2026 with trust and love\u201d \u2013 as a revelation. I ask if I am right to infer from that that he has not felt supported by men in the past. He starts to rail against the <a href=\"%0A\" title=\"\">Golden Globes overlooking Greta Gerwig</a> and other female directors. I steer him back to the specifics of his experience, which seems to annoy him.</p> <p>\u201cWith a male-dominant crew, you have the energy of alpha males, \u2018we\u2019re men, working hard\u2019 \u2013 which is fine, and I don\u2019t want you to put this in a different spin because I\u2019ve had amazing experiences with men as well. It\u2019s just a different energy on set, and you have to be really secure in who you are as a human being.\u201d</p> <p>Is he talking about Magic Mike? \u201cActually, that was one of my favourite experiences making a movie,\u201d Pettyfer says. Steven Soderbergh was \u201clike a father figure\u201d. \u201cI was more talking about I Am Number Four.\u201d The difficulty there, he says, was that they were trying to build a young adult franchise in the vein of The Hunger Games and Divergent without an already popular book to build on (the book, a bestseller, was released shortly before the movie).</p> <p>\u201cWhen I talk about the male dominance on that film it\u2019s that I feel like, with a little bit more of a feminine energy around, there would have been more nurturing and nursing towards me as a young man carrying the weight of pressures that I didn\u2019t understand fully.\u201d</p> <p>Does he feel he has been treated fairly by the industry or the media? That\u2019s not his concern, he says. \u201cWhether you write something positive or negative, it lays with you. It doesn\u2019t lay with me \u2026 If I was to try and control that, then I wouldn\u2019t be doing any interviews. It\u2019s a Catch-22. You know, Adam Sandler <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/magazine/adam-sandler-movies-uncut-gems.html\" title=\"\">refuses to do written interviews</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The tension we\u2019ve been circling around is now very much at hand. I decide to make a final play for Pettyfer, the man. If you don\u2019t feel what has been publicly written about you is a fair representation, I say, that must be frustrating for you as a human being, if not as an actor.</p> <p>\u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s reports that me and Channing don\u2019t get along, or that I don\u2019t like Channing. That is not true.\u201d You said he didn\u2019t like you, I say. On the <a href=\"https://podtail.com/en/podcast/bret-easton-ellis-podcast/b-e-e-alex-pettyfer-11-30-15/\" title=\"\">Bret Easton Ellis podcast</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMy point is that I had the utmost respect for those two men that put together\u201d [I assume he means Soderbergh] \u201ca life-changing piece for me. What I said is that I <em>presume</em> that the man [Tatum] didn\u2019t like me, but I don\u2019t know.

      "bodyText": "A week ago, Alex Pettyfer had all four wisdom teeth out. It is only after a sometimes fractious interview (over the phone, after he cancelled a face-to-face meeting) that it strikes me as an appropriate note on which to open. Questions of the wisdom that comes with age crop up more than once for the actor, who was widely reported to be a \u201cbad boy\u201d at his breakout moment early in the 2010s and is now four months shy of 30. Born in Stevenage into an acting family, Pettyfer rose to fame aged 15 in the title role of a TV film of Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays, then as the teen spy Alex Rider in the big-screen adaptation of Anthony Horowitz\u2019s Stormbreaker. Although the film bombed, Pettyfer\u2019s good looks, athleticism and talent meant that he was tipped as an incoming leading man \u2013 promise on which he seemed to be making good when, in 2012, he was cast as Channing Tatum\u2019s protege in Magic Mike. But by then, at 22, Pettyfer had developed a reputation for arrogance, mostly from reports from the set of the teen sci-fi flick I Am Number Four. Relations between Pettyfer and the film\u2019s director broke down: the CEO of DreamWorks had to intervene. Then Magic Mike was dogged by reports of a feud with Tatum \u2013 by Pettyfer\u2019s admission, over rent he owed Tatum\u2019s friend and refused to pay \u201cbecause life is so much more\u201d than money. Pettyfer denies his bad reputation was deserved, saying that he was afraid to be himself on an unfriendly set. He did not return for Magic Mike: XXL; Hollywood Reporter took this to mean that the \u201cbad boy got sidelined\u201d by the film industry. In fact, the work has remained fairly steady, not least because Pettyfer has created it himself. Today, promoting his directorial debut, Back Roads, Pettyfer seems to want to convey a new perspective and maturity. He struggled with anxiety as a young man, he says. When I ask how he managed that, growing up in the spotlight, he responds as though I have implied he didn\u2019t manage it. \u201cMy mum said to me: \u2018You can\u2019t put an old head on young shoulders.\u2019\u201d He adds, as though an afterthought: \u201cI think \u2013 meditation, you know.\u201d He continues: \u201cAs humans, we can only evolve. I think that the times that I had that were difficult as a young man, I grew from those experiences. The only thing you can ever do from any experience, positive or negative, is to grow from it.\u201d What difficult times are you talking about, I ask? Pettyfer shies away from specifics, later seeming to read bad faith into the attempt to clarify his meaning. \u201cWell \u2013 any difficult time! I\u2019m not just talking about difficult, I\u2019m talking about the positive times as well.\u201d When he was younger, Pettyfer says, he sometimes misunderstood \u201cwhat the business side of our industry is expecting\u201d. Acting is inherently a \u201cvery selfish\u201d discipline, he says; he has greater appreciation for the hard work and collaboration that goes into a film now that he has made his own. \u201cIf I had the experience that I had today back then, I probably would have done things differently. But the reason that I\u2019m the man I am today is because of the experiences I endured [when working as an actor] as a young boy.\u201d Back Roads, which Pettyfer stars in, directed and produced, is a harrowing drama about a family in rural Pennsylvania struggling with the aftermath of violence and abuse. Pettyfer\u2019s character is left to care for his three younger sisters after their mother (played with gusto by Juliette Lewis) is imprisoned for their father\u2019s murder. When he begins an affair with a married neighbour, family secrets start to emerge and the slow burn picks up pace \u2013 explosively. It is challenging material, more gritty and nuanced than anything Pettyfer has been thrown in the past, and as a director he is assured, even potentially stylish. \u201cI think you have to do a couple more movies before you have a style,\u201d Pettyfer says good-humouredly, and I dare to hope that we are out of the woods. He had been attached to the project for years before being given the opportunity to direct it. Going behind the camera gave him a new perspective on the industry. To make that point (and after earlier describing the two of us enjoying a hypothetical trip around an art gallery to illustrate his point that \u201cart is for interpretation\u201d), Pettyfer takes me on another thought exercise. \u201cYou\u2019re a journalist, you sit here and you ask me the difficult questions in a very polite way, and I\u2019m trying to be polite back. I know that you read the past newspapers, whatever you want, to do your research. But imagine then I make the roles reverse, and I\u2019m asking you questions, and you\u2019re put on the spot. It then gives you a different perspective of how you would do your job next.\u201d My perspective is that we have different ideas of difficult questions \u2013 we still have not discussed directly the controversies surrounding I Am Number Four, Tatum or his reputation. \u201cYou know, Anthony Bourdain [the late chef and TV host] was an amazing journalist,\u201d says Pettyfer. \u201cHe was humble and gracious and he was intrigued by people\u2019s lives, but didn\u2019t look for a negative spin.\u201d Seeing the trust that Lewis, Jennifer Morrison and other actors in Back Roads put in him as director led Pettyfer to realise that, as an actor, he had not always done the same. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, as a young boy, to put your full emotional trust into another person who is trying to guide you creatively.\u201d He felt vulnerable then, he says. More recently, he has experienced working on Back Roads and other films with a predominantly female cast and crew \u2013 where production goes \u201cso smoothly \u2026 with trust and love\u201d \u2013 as a revelation. I ask if I am right to infer from that that he has not felt supported by men in the past. He starts to rail against the Golden Globes overlooking Greta Gerwig and other female directors. I steer him back to the specifics of his experience, which seems to annoy him. \u201cWith a male-dominant crew, you have the energy of alpha males, \u2018we\u2019re men, working hard\u2019 \u2013 which is fine, and I don\u2019t want you to put this in a different spin because I\u2019ve had amazing experiences with men as well. It\u2019s just a different energy on set, and you have to be really secure in who you are as a human being.\u201d Is he talking about Magic Mike? \u201cActually, that was one of my favourite experiences making a movie,\u201d Pettyfer says. Steven Soderbergh was \u201clike a father figure\u201d. \u201cI was more talking about I Am Number Four.\u201d The difficulty there, he says, was that they were trying to build a young adult franchise in the vein of The Hunger Games and Divergent without an already popular book to build on (the book, a bestseller, was released shortly before the movie). \u201cWhen I talk about the male dominance on that film it\u2019s that I feel like, with a little bit more of a feminine energy around, there would have been more nurturing and nursing towards me as a young man carrying the weight of pressures that I didn\u2019t understand fully.\u201d Does he feel he has been treated fairly by the industry or the media? That\u2019s not his concern, he says. \u201cWhether you write something positive or negative, it lays with you. It doesn\u2019t lay with me \u2026 If I was to try and control that, then I wouldn\u2019t be doing any interviews. It\u2019s a Catch-22. You know, Adam Sandler refuses to do written interviews.\u201d The tension we\u2019ve been circling around is now very much at hand. I decide to make a final play for Pettyfer, the man. If you don\u2019t feel what has been publicly written about you is a fair representation, I say, that must be frustrating for you as a human being, if not as an actor. \u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s reports that me and Channing don\u2019t get along, or that I don\u2019t like Channing. That is not true.\u201d You said he didn\u2019t like you, I say. On the Bret Easton Ellis podcast. \u201cMy point is that I had the utmost respect for those two men that put together\u201d [I assume he means Soderbergh] \u201ca life-changing piece for me. What I said is that I presume that the man [Tatum] didn\u2019t like me, but I don\u2019t know. When you make a movie, you don\u2019t come off the movie being best friends \u2026 you\u2019re going into business with someone.\u201d Pettyfer re-emphasises that enjoyed his experience of Magic Mike, he says. \u201cWhatever the negative connotation of what happened after that in the media, I can\u2019t control.\u201d I point out that Pettyfer himself, rather than the media, said it was over unpaid rent for Tatum\u2019s friends\u2019 apartment. Pettyfer makes a noise as though in agreement \u2013 but then I realise it\u2019s to the PR on the other line, who suggests we move on. We talk for a further five minutes with determined cheer about his dream project (\u201cSomething that would raise the consciousness\u201d), his experience of being an Englishman in New York, and whether his goal is still to \u201ctry to replicate Johnny Depp\u2019s career and then move to Paris\u201d, as he said in 2011. \u201cMmm, yeah. Quite obviously, at 21, I was saying some interesting things.\u201d An older, wiser Pettyfer thanks me for listening, and I again express sympathy for his wisdom teeth operation and wish him all the best with his recovery. \u2022 Back Roads is released in the UK in January",

Plans such as a walking and cycling bridge, the rebuilding of Camden station, and the Piccadilly line signalling upgrades have been paused. Tony Travers, the director of LSE London, says: \u201cEvery day it takes longer, it costs more money \u2013 and every day it denies TfL the fare income. So they\u2019re losing twice.\u201d In TfL\u2019s business plan, updated last week, \u201cyou can start to see the true horror of the losses\u201d, Travers says \u2013 some \u00a31.35bn over four years. As well as upgrades, cherished policies will disappear, he predicts. \u201cIt\u2019s almost inconceivable that Sadiq Khan [the mayor of London] will extend the fares freeze ... TfL needs every farthing it can get.\u201d Despite the pressure, and whatever the delays and cost overruns, Wild and the managers\u2019 focus is clearly on getting it completely right before delivery. At the station level, much of the work remaining underground is \u201csnagging\u201d. At Whitechapel, we stumble on a member of the assurance team angrily grappling with an imperfect door, whose handles and locks are in the wrong place. At Tottenham Court Road, cladding has been removed to readjust the bolts on a screen: tight enough to hold all in place but not at the optimal specification for the part. \u201cIt\u2019s that level of assurance and attention to detail to make sure everything is absolutely right,\u201d Highe says. Crossrail has fallen from grace after the boastful overconfidence of previous executives \u2013 but optimism remains. Highe shows a secret bit of extra tunnel between the platforms of Tottenham Court Road, needed in construction but redundant for now. Rather than fill it in, they kept it behind closed doors: it may well, she says, prove useful in the construction of Crossrail 2.",

After defeats it\u2019s never easy and when you don\u2019t start well after a defeat it always affects self-esteem. When you are exposed in free-kicks and corners it\u2019s really hard. These guys, in a real good football team, they have three or four giants, really very strong in the air. They\u2019re not a team that plays direct, but in the last 10 minutes Burn was striker and he\u2019s a 2m target. They have monsters in the air and that affected the team. </p> </blockquote> <p>On Dele Alli:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Alli, another goal and another incredible effort, from first to last minute.

Here\u2019s his match report:</p> <blockquote> <p>A lucky bounce and a flash of class made the difference for Tottenham. It was a messy, uneven display for the most part and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ended grateful to have a finisher as ruthless as Harry Kane in his ranks. Kane\u2019s equaliser arrived when a loose clearance fell his way, giving him the chance to puncture the frustration in the stands, and the points belonged to Spurs when Dele Alli elevated an otherwise ineffective showing with a beautiful winning goal.</p> <p>It felt harsh on Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who will look back on the moment when Aaron Connolly missed a glorious chance to double their lead at the start of the second half. Yet Graham Potter\u2019s side have one win in their past nine games for a reason. Spurs had greater quality in the final third. Alli\u2019s inspiration defined the game and there was also an impressive cameo from Christian Eriksen, reminding everyone that Spurs will not find it easy to replace his creativity if he leaves during the January transfer window.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/26/tottenham-hotspur-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">Dele Alli\u2019s flash of class seals home win for Tottenham over Brighton</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e04c38d8f08c39722640911\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T14:28:47.108Z\">2.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The action\u2019s over at White Hart Lane, </strong>but elsewhere it\u2019s just getting started.

Mauricio Pochettino was sacked the following month, without winning another league game. Results have improved since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s appointment, but Tottenham\u2019s most recent game \u2013 against Chelsea on Sunday \u2013 was another trial, and Son Heung-min will miss this match as a result of his red card in that one.<br></p> <p>Brighton\u2019s record on their travels is poor, and it gets worse the further they travel. It\u2019s the 16<sup>th</sup>-best away record in the Premier League overall, but they have only won one point when forced to go further north than Watford (that\u2019s 0.2 points per game) compared with seven points garnered in London and its environs (at 1.75 points per game). As such, the omens are good of further glory here but the long-term prognosis is bad (with only the trips to West Ham and Southampton to come within their approximately-65-mile comfort zone). But there is also a question of priorities: they are hosting Bournemouth in a couple of days and could perhaps decide that focusing on that match might mean they win one of the two fixtures where a full-on commitment to this one could end with them winning neither.</p> <p>Anyway, welcome.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Once again, your key links follow, to a report on this game and the 3pm clockwatch: Jose Mourinho has a quick chat: Very happy with the second half. We changed bits, it was not about players it was about bits, but sometimes they can make a difference. The first half was not a disaster, it was a difficult game against a good team. After defeats it\u2019s never easy and when you don\u2019t start well after a defeat it always affects self-esteem. When you are exposed in free-kicks and corners it\u2019s really hard. These guys, in a real good football team, they have three or four giants, really very strong in the air. They\u2019re not a team that plays direct, but in the last 10 minutes Burn was striker and he\u2019s a 2m target. They have monsters in the air and that affected the team. On Dele Alli: Alli, another goal and another incredible effort, from first to last minute. The work rate, absolutely incredible. For me, these little big details are more important than what is in the eyes of the people. Amazing goal, but I go to other details and his fighting spirit was amazing also. Jacob Steinberg was our man at White Hart Lane. Here\u2019s his match report: A lucky bounce and a flash of class made the difference for Tottenham. It was a messy, uneven display for the most part and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ended grateful to have a finisher as ruthless as Harry Kane in his ranks. Kane\u2019s equaliser arrived when a loose clearance fell his way, giving him the chance to puncture the frustration in the stands, and the points belonged to Spurs when Dele Alli elevated an otherwise ineffective showing with a beautiful winning goal. It felt harsh on Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who will look back on the moment when Aaron Connolly missed a glorious chance to double their lead at the start of the second half. Yet Graham Potter\u2019s side have one win in their past nine games for a reason. Spurs had greater quality in the final third. Alli\u2019s inspiration defined the game and there was also an impressive cameo from Christian Eriksen, reminding everyone that Spurs will not find it easy to replace his creativity if he leaves during the January transfer window. Much more here: The action\u2019s over at White Hart Lane, but elsewhere it\u2019s just getting started. Follow the 3pm games with Will Unwin here: 90+5 mins: It\u2019s all over, and Tottenham have held on! 90+3 mins: Trossard has the ball in a good crossing position, but Sanchez closes him down excellently, forces him back and away, and eventually Spurs win it and break. A few seconds later the ball is played to Kane, whose shot is splendidly blocked by Alzate. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be four minutes or so. 90 mins: Save! Kane\u2019s excellent pass finds Alli, whose first touch is phenomenal and opens up a great shooting chance. He slams it goalwards with his left boot, but Ryan tips it over! 90 mins: They do break, and Kane carries the ball into the area before shooting way wide. 89 mins: Now it\u2019s Tottenham\u2019s turn to sit back, defend in numbers and try to break. 88 mins: Half a chance for Brighton! Well, a chance to make a chance. A half-chance once removed. Trossard crosses, Burn meets it beyond the far post but his volleyed centre is cut out. 84 mins: Sissoko pushes Burn to the ground, and then kicks him a bit, and after Burn gets up and gives him a bit of a shove Sissoko pushes him again a couple of times. All a bit silly, but Sissoko is booked and like Winks will miss Tottenham\u2019s next game, at Norwich. 83 mins: The game\u2019s last substitution sees Yves Bissouma replaces Schelotto. Brighton\u2019s two starting full-backs both played well, I thought, but both are now off the pitch. 82 mins: A Brighton attack ends with Gross, outside the penalty area and left of central, with absolutely no passing options, so he has a shot that Gazzaniga saves unconvincingly. 77 mins: Brighton take of Bernardo and bring on Trossard. \u201cCan we talk about that Alli challenge?\u201d asks Philip Reilly. \u201cHis eyes were on the man, and he only left the ground after the ball was gone. It was a deliberate, cynical attempt to take Webster out. That kind of challenge is far, far more dangerous than any slide-tackle. Worst that can happen with a two-footer is a broken leg. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that Alli could have given Webster a concussion, or even broken his neck.\u201d I\u2019m not convinced that it was more dangerous than any slide tackle, but I do think it\u2019s absolutely bonkers that he wasn\u2019t at the very least booked for it. 76 mins: Mooy blasts a shot over the bar, given very little space and time outside the area. Spurs take off another booked player, replacing Lucas Moura with Dier. 75 mins: Lucas, who has attacked the second half with uncommon relish, is booked for a mistimed challenge. 72 mins: Spurs keep the ball for an absolute age, before Eriksen finally lifts a crossfield pass to Aurier, bursting into the right-hand side of the area. He volleys a cushioned pass to Dele Alli, whose first-time shot goes over Ryan and dips under the bar at the far post. That was the best move of the game by either side and by a million miles, and the finish was sensational. That\u2019s an absolutely great goal! 68 mins: A couple of substitutions, Spurs bringing Christian Eriksen on for the disciplinarily-challenged Winks, and Brighton bringing Neal Maupay on for Connolly. 67 mins: Saved! Gross thumps a shot goalwards, but it\u2019s straight at the keeper and is pushed away. 66 mins: Brighton do manage to break, and after Schelotto\u2019s low cross to Connolly is cut out Winks brings down Gross just outside the area. Again there\u2019s very little contact, which is presumably why the referee doesn\u2019t book him again. 65 mins: A couple of minutes of sustained Spurs pressure, and it hasn\u2019t ended yet. Brighton\u2019s deep 5-4-1 leaves just Connolly up front and makes it hard for them to clear their lines. 61 mins: Kane gets brushed in the chin by Burn\u2019s hand and goes down clutching his face. Not only that, he stays there as Brighton try to break as if genuinely hurt, with the crowd baying and howling, distracting the visitors and forcing them to put the ball into touch. Whereupon he just gets up. That is pure shithousery from the England captain. 58 mins: Dele Alli could easily have been sent off for a head-high arse-charge there. He has absolutely no chance of getting the ball but goes leaping in anyway, and after Webster heads it and lands he arrives and smacks him around the chops with his flying buttocks. Somehow he isn\u2019t even booked. That\u2019s just bizarre. 57 mins: Almost a near-total repeat of the goal! This time Sissoko\u2019s heavy touch runs to a defender, the clearance rebounds straight to Kane in space and inside the area, but it\u2019s going too fast for him to control. 56 mins: Mourinho was preparing a substitution before the goal, and he goes ahead with it, taking Sessegnon off and bringing Lo Celso on. A lucky break, and Spurs are level! Moura battles for the ball outside Brighton\u2019s area, keeps it for a while, but then a poor touch sends it to Webster. Instead of blootering it clear he tries to chip a gentle pass to a team-mate, it rebounds off a random leg to Kane - who Webster had been marking a moment earlier - and he turns into the box, has one shot that is saved and then hits the rebound inside the near post! 49 mins: Chance for Brighton! Webster does great to get to the byline on the right, and though his cross is overhit they keep the ball and work it back to Bernardo, whose excellent first-time cross finds Connolly jumping on the edge of the six-yard box, completely unmarked, but he fluffs his header and shoulder it weakly to Gazzaniga! 46 mins: It\u2019s crossed in, and Brighton win another header. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! Play restarts, and Spurs win a corner within 30 seconds. The players are back out. More action imminent. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the \u2018we wuz robbed\u2019 cry of Spurs faithful,\u201d insists Mary Waltz. \u201cBrighton took advantage of their corners and have defended well. Fair score.\u201d It was a free-kick, but still, fair enough. Meanwhile, a Guardian journalist writes: 45+3 mins: Spurs have a corner, which is sent into the area, headed out again, and that\u2019s the end of the half. \u201cI\u2019m no Spurs fan but what a horrible 10 minutes for them,\u201d groans Duncan Edwards. \u201cVARce yet again overturning decades of giving the attacker the benefit of the doubt, a blatant obstruction for a dangerous indirect free kick completely ignored, then conceding from a dead ball. Horror. Good header though.\u201d I do think Kane was offside, and that the VAR photo made it look closer than it was. I also think that Brighton have been excellent, have won most of the loose and second balls, and though they haven\u2019t created very much are not really flattered by the scoreline. 45+2 mins: A deflected pass drops to Sessegnon in the penalty area, but Schelotto hooks round a boot to get rid of it. 45+1 mins: There\u2019ll be about two minutes of stoppage time. 43 mins: So nearly a chance for Spurs! Sissoko gets to the byline and pulls back towards Alli at the near post, but Duffy does well to track his run and slide in to reach the ball first. 42 mins: Gross wants to pass to Schelotto on the right, but his team-mate falls over at the vital moment and Gross instead has to turn back, is dispossessed by Kane and ends up bringing him down and getting booked. 40 mins: Brighton again win the header, but Bernardo\u2019s effort is saved. 39 mins: Now Sanchez is booked, for holding onto Connolly. There wasn\u2019t much in it, and Connolly only went to ground after Sanchez had let go, but the Spurs centre-back is booked all the same. Gross sends in another fine cross from the free-kick, but Spurs clear it behind for a corner. Gross curls the ball into the box and Webster emphatically outjumps Alderweireld and thumps his header into the corner! 37 mins: Brighton break, and Schelotto barrels down the right. He eventually falls over Winks\u2019 challenge. There was very little contact, but Winks is booked and Brighton can cross. 36 mins: Vertonghen chips the free-kick into the box, where several Spurs players are offside but for a moment it seems Sissoko is not. He gets to the ball but his finish is feeble and saved, and the flag is up anyway. 34 mins: Now Duffy fouls Moura, and Spurs have another free-kick from a very similar position, perhaps a couple of yards back. It\u2019s funny how a gentle tug of a shirt (as executed by Burn a couple of minutes back) is a guaranteed booking, but a sliding trip from behind is not. 32 mins: Kane eventually takes the free-kick, and smacks it into the wall. 30 mins: Burn pulls Moura, gets booked and gives Spurs a free-kick, just outside the Brighton box. Here\u2019s proof of Kane\u2019s offsideness. It looks close, but suspect that a picture taken from a straighter angle would be much more conclusive. 29 mins: Ryan tries to shepherd the ball out of play, and Duffy assists him by blocking Kane\u2019s attempt to pressure him. This is as clear a case of obstruction as you could ever hope to see, but the referee doesn\u2019t see it. 25 mins: Kane looked fractionally offside in the replays, but when the VAR got their freezeframe sorted there was very little in it. They draw some lines and decide that there was an offending bit of shoulder. Brighton have been the better team for the last 10 minutes or so, but then Winks lifts the ball over their defence, Kane runs onto it and, with Ryan having sprinted from his line but got nowhere near the ball, has a straightforward finish which he completes with ease! But this\u2019ll be checked for offside and looks close. 22 mins: Mooy\u2019s shot from the edge of the area curls just wide of the left-hand post. The referee spots a slight deflection and gives Brighton a corner. 19 mins: It has been an encouraging start for Brighton, though Kane has looked in worryingly good touch when he has got on the ball, which has been very occasionally. \u201cTottenham seem to be playing a bagel like formation today,\u201d writes Jeremy Dresner, There is a hole in the middle. The flavour of this particular bagel it is too early to tell.\u201d 15 mins: Alli surges down the left, turns and plays the ball back, retreats to the edge of the area and then sprints into it. All the while Webster tracks him very well, stopping him from crossing and then shadowing his run into the box. He heads the through-ball away from the Spurs player\u2019s path, and though Alli manages to change direction and get to it, he is swiftly closed down again. 13 mins: Save! Brighton work the ball across the edge of Tottenham\u2019s penalty area, and Alzate\u2019s shot from 25 yards is pushed to safety by Gazzaniga. 11 mins: Bernardo, who has been rather good so far, gets another crossing chance, but his low centre isn\u2019t great and is cleared. Brighton win the ball back swiftly, and have hogged it for a couple of minutes now. 8 mins: Alderweireld pops the ball over the entire Brighton team to Sessegnon, who like Kane to his right is offside, but plays on, draws Ryan from his line and hits the post with a shot before the whistle blows. 5 mins: Now Kane crosses from the right towards Sessegnon at the far post, but he can\u2019t turn it in! Instead he miscues his shot into Schelotto, which at least means Spurs have a corner. 4 mins: The first shot of the day comes off a Brighton boot. It\u2019s a lovely cross from Bernardo on the left, which is headed out to Alzate, who takes two lovely touches to get space and set himself but then mishits his shot wide. 3 mins: Aurier rampages down the right and is picked out by a fine crossfield pass, but he had rampaged a bit too far and is offside. 1 min: Spurs get the game started, and instead of the more common post-kick-off hump forward and straight out of play they pass it around their backline for a while before humping it forward and straight out of play. 1 min: Peeeeeeeep! Brighton are huddling. \u201cMourinho prefers time to players?\u201d muses Matt Dony. \u201cSpecifically, about two and a half seasons, usually.\u201d Out they come! The wait is over! They\u2019re still in the tunnel. It appears to be bucketing it down in Tottenham, so perhaps they\u2019re not inclined to leave. The players are in the tunnel, and Boxing Day action is just minutes away now. Graham Potter has a chat with Amazon. I basically waited for him to say something interesting (or, indeed, for him to be asked something interesting) but it never happened. Here\u2019s a sample paragraph: We lost Lewis yesterday with a bit of sickness, so that\u2019s one we have to adjust around. Few players coming in, but at this time of year we try to use the squad as best we can. We\u2019ll carry on with what we\u2019ve been working with and see how the game goes. Overall, our performance levels have been quite good. Everybody wants to win, but it\u2019s sport. Someone has to win, somebody has to lose, and we have to just respond to that. Amazon, broadcasting every Premier League game today as you may have heard, do the rounds of the grounds, with the presenting teams already in place for all the afternoon games, and Gabby Logan broadcasting live from her car as she drives towards Anfield for the evening kick-off. In Brighton news, Lewis Dunk is unwell, hence his absence from today\u2019s squad. Mourinho is also asked about his ambitions for the January transfer window: I like the players very much. I like them as players, I like them as the human group they are, and I\u2019m really happy with them, and I want to give them all I have to give them and I want to improve them, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair arriving five weeks ago to look to windows. I need time. After the 2nd of January we have a couple of weeks where we can work. Since I arrived, it has been really difficult to work with the intensity and the dynamic that you want. I prefer time to players. Also, on the subject of festive football: If you love football your heart is full of joy. It is one of the things I didn\u2019t like in my Italian adventure, in my Spanish adventure, it was not to play football in this period. It is something I really love. I understand that families have to love us and they have to understand us, to cope with it. But for everybody who goes to this stadium it is amazing and it is our job and our responsibility to give them what they love. You give people what they love, and you are the only country that gives them that. Jose Mourinho is asked how his Christmas Day went. To be honest it was very sad, because my dog died and my dog is my family, so very difficult. But we have to move on. Apparently Tanguy Ndombele is not injured, he simply has not been picked for today\u2019s squad. \u201cIt seems Jose has leaned his lesson with regards to Dier, but still can\u2019t see that continuing to play Aurier is costing us,\u201d writes Steve Porter. \u201cHe\u2019s a red card/penalty waiting to happen and he indirectly depletes our midfield by forcing Sissoko to drop back to cover.\u201d I don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely fair: as Willian showed at the weekend, he\u2019s also an easy goalscoring change waiting to happen. Also making his first (league) start of the season is Ryan Sessegnon, who replaces Son in the Spurs side. Harry Winks is also in, replacing Eric Dier. Brighton do indeed ring the changes, with Ezequiel Schelotto making his first start of the season (there have been only three substitute appearances), Lewis Dunk out of the squad altogether, and Shane Duffy, Bernardo, Steven Alzate and Aaron Connolly also coming in. Team sheets have been handed in, and these were the names upon them: Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Sissoko, Winks, Lucas Moura, Alli, Sessegnon, Kane. Subs: Lamela, Vorm, Dier, Lo Celso, Foyth, Eriksen, Tanganga. Brighton: Ryan, Webster, Duffy, Burn, Stephens, Bernardo, Gross, Mooy, Schelotto, Alzate, Connolly. Subs: Maupay, Bissouma, Trossard, Murray, Montoya, Propper, Button. Referee: Graham Scott. Brighton bring bad memories to Tottenham, primarily of a 3-0 thwacking at the AmEx Stadium in October, a match full of unfortunate incidents from a Spurs perspective including the dislocation of Hugo Lloris\u2019s elbow, an injury from which he is yet to return. Mauricio Pochettino was sacked the following month, without winning another league game. Results have improved since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s appointment, but Tottenham\u2019s most recent game \u2013 against Chelsea on Sunday \u2013 was another trial, and Son Heung-min will miss this match as a result of his red card in that one. Brighton\u2019s record on their travels is poor, and it gets worse the further they travel. It\u2019s the 16th-best away record in the Premier League overall, but they have only won one point when forced to go further north than Watford (that\u2019s 0.2 points per game) compared with seven points garnered in London and its environs (at 1.75 points per game). As such, the omens are good of further glory here but the long-term prognosis is bad (with only the trips to West Ham and Southampton to come within their approximately-65-mile comfort zone). But there is also a question of priorities: they are hosting Bournemouth in a couple of days and could perhaps decide that focusing on that match might mean they win one of the two fixtures where a full-on commitment to this one could end with them winning neither. Anyway, welcome. It\u2019s Boxing Day. How are we all feeling?",

      "bodyText": "The Turkish government\u2019s block on Wikipedia is a violation of freedom of expression, the country\u2019s high court has ruled, paving the way for the two-year-old ban to be lifted. The justices of the Turkish constitutional court voted 10-6 in favour of Wikipedia, state-run news agency Anadolu reported on Thursday, ordering the ban to be lifted with immediate effect. The ruling was welcomed by Jimmy Wales, the site\u2019s founder, who tweeted a picture of himself on a previous trip to Istanbul along with the message: \u201cWelcome back, Turkey!\u201d There was no immediate comment from the government and it was not immediately clear when access to the online encyclopedia would be restored. The Turkish ban on all the various language editions of Wikipedia has been in place since April 2017 after entries on the website claimed government officials were involved in oil trading with Islamic State and accused Turkey of sponsoring Isis and other terrorist organisations. After Wikipedia refused to remove the content from the community-maintained site, citing its opposition to censorship, Ankara said Wikipedia was part of a smear campaign against the country. Officials said at the time that \u201can administrative measure\u201d had been taken against the site, under a wide-reaching law that allows the government to censor internet content it believes poses a national security threat. Ankara gave no reason for the ban. Wales himself was also \u201cdisinvited\u201d from a World Cities Expo event held in Istanbul in May 2017. The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organisation that runs the site, petitioned the constitutional court in May 2017 after talks with Turkish officials and a challenge in lower courts failed. In May this year, the foundation took Turkey to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg over the ban. A statement from the foundation said at the time that the decision to file a petition with the ECHR was taken \u201conly after continued and exhaustive attempts to lift the block through legal action in the Turkish courts, good faith conversations with the Turkish authorities, and campaigns to raise awareness of the block and its impact on Turkey and the rest of the world\u201d. The ECHR has ruled against Turkey more than any other country. Ankara routinely ignores verdicts, choosing instead to pay court-ordered fines. The ECHR expedited the case, giving Turkey until the end of the year to justify the ban on Wikipedia, calling the block \u201cunacceptable in a democratic society and not compatible with article 10 of the European convention on human rights, which protects freedom of expression\u201d. The Turkish constitutional court\u2019s new decision should avert another ECHR ruling against Ankara. While many Turkish people use methods such as VPNs and mirror sites to circumvent blocked internet content, online censorship remains a stubborn problem for the country. At least 127,000 websites have been banned as well as 95,000 individual web pages, and social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are frequently temporarily blocked, usually just after protests or terrorist attacks. Media freedoms in Turkey have steadily deteriorated during the last decade, but the crackdown has escalated since the failed 2016 coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, after which dozens of media outlets were closed or taken over. Turkey is now among the world\u2019s leading jailers of journalists, second only to China, with an estimated 175 journalists and media workers in pretrial detention or serving sentences for terrorism offences and hundreds more on trial but at liberty, according to Human Rights Watch.",

LeBron James, who finished with 23 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, aggravated a nagging groin injury after a first-quarter collision with Patrick Beverley and could miss game time moving forward. According to ESPN, several members of the Lakers organization have already approached James about the urgency to sit out and rehab his groin injury until he feels fully recovered. \u201cI felt healthy going into the game,\u201d James told the network. \u201cI got kneed in the groin taking a charge from Pat Bev, and it kind of set me right back to where I was five days ago.\u201d Montrezl Harrell had 18 points off the bench, Paul George added 17 and the Clippers improved to 2-0 against the Lakers this season. Kyle Kuzma led the Lakers with 25 points while Anthony Davis had 24. The Lakers have lost a season-worst four straight games. Los Angeles had a chance to tie in the final seconds, but video review showed James touched the ball last after Beverly knocked it away as James went up for a three. George hit two free throws for the final margin. James, who turns 35 this week, suffered a torn left groin against the Golden State Warriors last Christmas that derailed the Lakers\u2019 season. Milwaukee Bucks 109-121 Philadelphia 76ers Joel Embiid outplayed Giannis Antetokounmpo in Philadelphia\u2019s first home Christmas game in 31 years, finishing with 31 points and 11 rebounds to help the three-point happy 76ers beat Milwaukee. Tobias Harris sank five threes, Josh Richardson and Furkan Korkmaz each had four and even Embiid hit three as part of Philly\u2019s season-high 21 threes (on 44 attempts) against a Bucks team that had the best record in the NBA. Harris and Al Horford hit threes over the final 90 seconds to push back a late Bucks run, and the Sixers improved to 16-2 at home. Khris Middleton scored 31 points for Milwaukee, and Antetokounmpo had 18 points and 14 rebounds. Antetokounmpo got flustered over a perceived missed call and was whistled for a technical in the fourth. New Orleans Pelicans 112-100 Denver Nuggets Brandon Ingram scored 31 points, Derrick Favors grabbed 13 rebounds and the Pelicans surprised Denver to halt the Nuggets\u2019 seven-game winning streak. The 9-23 Pelicans are now 2-0 against the Nuggets this season. They spoiled the festive mood at the Pepsi Center as the Nuggets played at home on Christmas for the first time in 25 years. New Orleans sprang the upset despite committing 19 turnovers. The Pelicans pulled away late courtesy of the long-range shooting of Lonzo Ball and Ingram. They also out-rebounded the Nuggets, including 14 offensive boards. New Orleans finished a four-game trip with a 3-1 mark, which includes consecutive wins for the first time in a month. Jrue Holiday had 20 points in the last of five Christmas games where the home teams went 2-3. Boston Celtics 118-102 Toronto Raptors Jaylen Brown scored 30 points, Kemba Walker had 22 and Boston beat Toronto in the first Christmas Day NBA game played in Canada. Enes Kanter had 12 points and 11 rebounds as the Celtics snapped an eight-game losing streak north of the border and became the first Atlantic Division opponent to win in Toronto in more than four years. Boston\u2019s Gordon Hayward returned to the starting lineup after missing the past three games because of a sore left foot. He scored 14 points in 26 minutes. Fred VanVleet scored 27 points in the Raptors\u2019 second straight loss, and Chris Boucher had a career-high 24. Toronto had gone an NBA-record 34 games between home losses to division foes. The Raptors\u2019 last home loss to an Atlantic team was a 111-109 defeat to the New York Knicks on Nov. 10, 2015. Houston Rockets 104-116 Golden State Warriors Draymond Green scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half, Damion Lee had 22 points and a career-high 15 rebounds and Golden State beat Houston. D\u2019Angelo Russell added 20 points, and Glenn Robinson III had 18 to help the Warriors win their third straight and end the Rockets\u2019 four-game winning streak. Injury-ravaged Golden State improved to 7-24. Russell Westbrook had 30 points and 12 rebounds for Houston. James Harden had 24 points and 11 assists, and Danuel House Jr. had 18 points.",

      "body": "<p>It has been common for several years now to assert that science shows the concept of race has no biological basis, and that we must see it instead as a social construct. That case was argued, for example, by Kenan Malik in his 2008 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/30/roundupreviews\" title=\"\">Strange Fruit</a>, and it is presented, too, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-saini\" title=\"\">Angela Saini</a>\u2019s Superior (which I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/03/superior-by-angela-raini-review\" title=\"\">reviewed for the Guardian</a> in July), a popular choice on many \u201cbooks of the year\u201d lists.</p> <p>I used to be sceptical about this claim. I have all the liberal lefty\u2019s revulsion at racism, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking: \u201cIf we insist that race is not biologically determined, won\u2019t that just confuse people, given that it is so blindingly obvious that characteristic markers of race are inherited?\u201d The usual argument is that genomics has identified no clusters of gene variants specific to conventional racial groupings: there is more genetic variation within such groups than between them. But doesn\u2019t that insist on a definition of race that most people simply won\u2019t recognise? Isn\u2019t it better to say that yes, race has a biological basis \u2013 but the relevant bodily features are a trivial part of what makes us us?</p> <p>I confess that I was too nervous to make this suggestion in such an incendiary area. Fortunately, after reading Saini\u2019s book I no longer need to, for Superior gave me the perspective I needed to see what is wrong with it. Our concept of race is not really about skin colour or eye shape, and never has been. It has baked into it beliefs that can\u2019t be dispelled merely by reducing its biological correlates to trivialities. For in our assumptions about race, those features have always been rather irrelevant in themselves. Rather, they serve to activate prejudices stemming from deeply ingrained cognitive habits.</p> <p>Saini shows that what we have understood by race encodes the belief that literally superficial aspects of our appearance act as markers for innate differences we can\u2019t see. And here\u2019s the problem: it does so for good reason. In times past, and sometimes still today, the strong correlation between your appearance and your culture meant that visual differences really could act as proxies for certain differences in attitudes, traditions and beliefs.</p> <p>Our brains are exquisitely adapted to pick up on such correlations \u2013 and, unfortunately in this case, to conclude that they are causative. We instinctively assume that differences in behaviour that are in fact due to culture must be linked to \u2013 even caused by \u2013 characteristics of appearance. That is what the traditional notion of race is all about. But genetics has found no such innate origins of behavioural differences between \u201craces\u201d \u2013 and it is highly unlikely, given what we know about genetic variation, that it would.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03c990a4610b9d8fcdcb82581e54a9f08a4427f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03c990a4610b9d8fcdcb82581e54a9f08a4427f5/0_398_6210_3726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Saini\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Angela Saini shows that what we have understood by race inherently encodes the belief that literally superficial aspects of our appearance act as markers for innate differences we can\u2019t see.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u270e Gareth Phillips/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the notion of race depends on cultural difference \u2013 yes, it is a social construct \u2013 yet our brains intuitively insist that biology must play a role. In short, we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves that it\u2019s easy to realign our perceptions here. To confuse us further, while Saini points out that not all the medical correlations of disease and susceptibility with race are as robust as often assumed (not least because race can become entrained with socioeconomic status), some are undeniable. For example, people from Asia are much more likely to be lactose-intolerant than people of European heritage. But what our brains find so hard to process is that no one is lactose-intolerant because they are Chinese. We\u2019re not cognitively well equipped to develop the right intuitions here.</p> <p>It is probably showing white supremacists (from whom I heard a little after my review) more charity than they deserve to say that they\u2019re caught up in the same confusion. There\u2019s more to their delusions than that, however. Their brains are exercising another of its perilous adaptations: the tendency to find ways of rationalising what it suits us to believe.</p> <p>This confusion persists, however, even among geneticists, biologists and doctors who we might expect to be better informed on such matters, for whom the use of \u201crace\u201d as a crude predictive tool can distort expectations and reinforce false assumptions about what it really means. We all have those corner-cutting brains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/18/race-science-on-the-rise-angela-saini\">Why race science is on the rise again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I always knew at some level that race is an inference about traits based on appearance.

      "bodyText": "It has been common for several years now to assert that science shows the concept of race has no biological basis, and that we must see it instead as a social construct. That case was argued, for example, by Kenan Malik in his 2008 book Strange Fruit, and it is presented, too, in Angela Saini\u2019s Superior (which I reviewed for the Guardian in July), a popular choice on many \u201cbooks of the year\u201d lists. I used to be sceptical about this claim. I have all the liberal lefty\u2019s revulsion at racism, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking: \u201cIf we insist that race is not biologically determined, won\u2019t that just confuse people, given that it is so blindingly obvious that characteristic markers of race are inherited?\u201d The usual argument is that genomics has identified no clusters of gene variants specific to conventional racial groupings: there is more genetic variation within such groups than between them. But doesn\u2019t that insist on a definition of race that most people simply won\u2019t recognise? Isn\u2019t it better to say that yes, race has a biological basis \u2013 but the relevant bodily features are a trivial part of what makes us us? I confess that I was too nervous to make this suggestion in such an incendiary area. Fortunately, after reading Saini\u2019s book I no longer need to, for Superior gave me the perspective I needed to see what is wrong with it. Our concept of race is not really about skin colour or eye shape, and never has been. It has baked into it beliefs that can\u2019t be dispelled merely by reducing its biological correlates to trivialities. For in our assumptions about race, those features have always been rather irrelevant in themselves. Rather, they serve to activate prejudices stemming from deeply ingrained cognitive habits. Saini shows that what we have understood by race encodes the belief that literally superficial aspects of our appearance act as markers for innate differences we can\u2019t see. And here\u2019s the problem: it does so for good reason. In times past, and sometimes still today, the strong correlation between your appearance and your culture meant that visual differences really could act as proxies for certain differences in attitudes, traditions and beliefs. Our brains are exquisitely adapted to pick up on such correlations \u2013 and, unfortunately in this case, to conclude that they are causative. We instinctively assume that differences in behaviour that are in fact due to culture must be linked to \u2013 even caused by \u2013 characteristics of appearance. That is what the traditional notion of race is all about. But genetics has found no such innate origins of behavioural differences between \u201craces\u201d \u2013 and it is highly unlikely, given what we know about genetic variation, that it would. So the notion of race depends on cultural difference \u2013 yes, it is a social construct \u2013 yet our brains intuitively insist that biology must play a role. In short, we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves that it\u2019s easy to realign our perceptions here. To confuse us further, while Saini points out that not all the medical correlations of disease and susceptibility with race are as robust as often assumed (not least because race can become entrained with socioeconomic status), some are undeniable. For example, people from Asia are much more likely to be lactose-intolerant than people of European heritage. But what our brains find so hard to process is that no one is lactose-intolerant because they are Chinese. We\u2019re not cognitively well equipped to develop the right intuitions here. It is probably showing white supremacists (from whom I heard a little after my review) more charity than they deserve to say that they\u2019re caught up in the same confusion. There\u2019s more to their delusions than that, however. Their brains are exercising another of its perilous adaptations: the tendency to find ways of rationalising what it suits us to believe. This confusion persists, however, even among geneticists, biologists and doctors who we might expect to be better informed on such matters, for whom the use of \u201crace\u201d as a crude predictive tool can distort expectations and reinforce false assumptions about what it really means. We all have those corner-cutting brains. I always knew at some level that race is an inference about traits based on appearance. But finding the right way to articulate it has made me appreciate that it is much harder to \u201csee beyond\u201d at the subconscious level. Rationalising and good intentions aren\u2019t enough; this is about undoing a habit of mind. Still, my own experience in a multiracial family persuades me it can be done. It\u2019s a bit painful and embarrassing to admit my past misconception, not least because it could expose me to the understandably exasperated response: duh, white dude finally gets it.

A lot of people get lost in that space and they just don\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d says Omar Abdo, a Saudi Arabian senior playing college tennis at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut.</p> <p>\u201cCollege tennis is like another chance for us. It\u2019s another entry way to pro life or to continue playing the sport at a high level. Because if you stay in your country and go to college there, you\u2019re going to play with the same two people \u2013 at least that\u2019s the case in my situation in Saudi.\u201d</p> <p>For Sherif, college tennis was the only option for her after finishing high school in Cairo. After cracking the top 50 in the world junior rankings at the age of 16, she stopped competing in junior events because she couldn\u2019t afford the travel and had to cut short her stay at an academy in Alicante, Spain for similar financial constraints. She ended up joining her sister in Fresno State University, before transferring to Pepperdine.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoyed team competition, I learnt a lot about tactics because your coach is sitting with you on court the whole time, which doesn\u2019t happen on the ITF circuit,\u201d says the 23-year-old Sherif.</p> <p>\u201cBut the biggest difference is you get to learn maturity, responsibility, time management \u2013 especially that my major was a tough major and Pepperdine is a tough school. I studied sports medicine so I was taking the base of medicine classes and it wasn\u2019t easy at all.</p> <p>\u201cIn college, the best things you learn are personal things, how to deal with people, when things are going bad, how to put on a good face and deal with people in a good way. When things aren\u2019t going well you still go to practice, when you\u2019re struggling every day and you have exams, you still go to practice and give 100%. These things help you evolve as a person. When you eventually get to the WTA, where all you have to do is focus on tennis, it feels so easy.\u201d</p> <p>Mansouri also considers time management to be one of the most important things he learned during his time at Wake Forest, as well as \u201caccountability\u201d which he says has now come in handy while he\u2019s grinding on the professional circuit, flying solo and taking care of every aspect of his career himself. The North African believes a huge advantage of playing for a school like Wake was that \u201cevery resource is provided to you in college to make it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI mean my coach was there in college and I promise you I could go practice at any time I\u2019d like. I could go for a team practice and then if I wanted to do individual practice from midnight to 3am, he\u2019ll be there with me from midnight to 3am,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only challenge is obviously not to lose sight of your goals when you go there because you have a lot of things to worry about, so obviously you can get lost. But if you\u2019re determined, you have every resource for you to make it. And I think it\u2019s a beautiful experience whether you make it or not and I think it increases your chances of making it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce21f94135f6501e0b3a979f10b25608a736fbc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce21f94135f6501e0b3a979f10b25608a736fbc1/0_188_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tunisian Skander Mansouri\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tunisian Skander Mansouri captained the Wake Forest Demon Deacons to the NCAA team championship last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Schwaberow/NCAA Photos via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the average age of tennis players at the top of the professional game increasing each year \u2013 the world\u2019s top three are aged 33, 32 and 38 respectively \u2013 there is no longer a sense of urgency among teenagers to leap onto the professional tour immediately.</p> <p>\u201cI look at it in a way where I think tennis now is becoming a sport where maturity is very important and you can see it in the top 100, the average age is close to 30 and I think you have plenty of time to go mature in college, face a lot of different situations, know yourself better, learn how to manage your time, learn a lot of things about yourself and then go on the tour; I think it gets you ready for the tour. That\u2019s what my experience showed me,\u201d says Mansouri.</p> <p>Kareem Allaf, a 21-year-old Syrian who is a senior at University of Iowa, believes he wouldn\u2019t have survived the ITF tour had he turned pro straight after high school.

It\u2019s just the match play. There\u2019s a lot of great players in college. So it\u2019s just mental toughness week by week, that kind of teaches you a little bit of what it\u2019s like on tour,\u201d Allaf explains.</p> <p>Abdo, who won\u2019t pursue a professional career after graduating from Sacred Heart, also cites the constant match play as the most appealing part of his college tennis experience.</p> <p>\u201cIt extended my playing time, because I didn\u2019t want to stop and I knew I wasn\u2019t going to go pro. So that was my only way to keep playing at a level that I\u2019m happy with and keep practicing every day,\u201d said the Saudi Arabian. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing. It\u2019s a blessing.\u201d</p> <p>Of the 110 Arabs on record who have played Division I tennis in college over the past three years, 41 are Egyptian. Alexandria native, Nada Zaher, who played tennis at Columbia University and graduated in 2016, founded a company in Egypt called Pass-sport that helps connect international athletes with college coaches and guides students through the process of pursuing an athletic scholarship at universities in the US. Zaher says she owes everything to tennis, not least because it helped her get into her dream school.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect when I went to Columbia, and then I went and I found an incredible system, everything is offered to the athletes. Tutors, career counseling, physical therapy, nutritionist, mental toughness, fitness coach. I went there from Egypt feeling everything was so random, I used to get lazy sometimes, and suddenly I\u2019m in this perfect system,\u201d says Zaher.</p> <p>In her company\u2019s first year, Zaher has helped send 17 Egyptian student-athletes to colleges in the States, six of which are tennis players.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially in countries like Egypt, where there is really no system, you get to go to college that has a perfect system and offers you everything possible to put you on the right track and they\u2019ll push your career to become a pro,\u201d states Zaher. \u201cYou really mature as an athlete. A 16-year-old tennis player is not mature at all, how they\u2019re managing their behavior on court, how they deal with wins and losses, all that stuff is not something you learn when you\u2019re 16.</p> <p>\u201cI think the team aspect, even though tennis is an individual sport, playing in a team and managing all that stuff I think it really helps you mature as a player overall.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it gets you used to the habit of following a strict regimen, getting used to discipline, which is something we lack where we\u2019re from. Everything is offered to you, versus here in Egypt, if you stay, you\u2019re going to grind like crazy and you might burn out a lot earlier. And if you cannot maintain a college spot, forget maintaining your level professionally, so it\u2019s a really good test for your limits.\u201d</p> <p>With success stories like Mansouri and Sherif providing a template for aspiring players in the Arab world, receiving a college education and advancing one\u2019s tennis career are no longer mutually exclusive.

      "bodyText": "There was a time when opting to play college tennis in the US was perceived as giving up on a professional career in the sport, recalls Tunisian Skander Mansouri, who captained Wake Forest to the NCAA team title last year. But now, the college tennis route is becoming a lifeline for many promising Arab players with limited pathways to the pros back home. Mansouri, a 24-year-old from Tunis, is enjoying an encouraging first full year on the professional circuit after graduating from North Carolina\u2019s Wake Forest University with a degree in mathematical business in 2018. He recently hit a career-high ranking of 303 in the world after picking up six ITF titles within the last 12 months. Egyptian Mayar Sherif also made an impressive transition from college tennis to the pro tour this season. The Pepperdine alum \u2013 a semi-finalist in the NCAA singles championship last year \u2013 rocketed up the WTA rankings in 2019, going from being unranked to inside the top 200 within the span of 10 months (only three women have achieved that feat this season on the women\u2019s professional circuit). Both Mansouri and Sherif were talented teens ranked in the top 50 in the world junior rankings. And while they would have liked to pursue a professional tennis career at a younger age, they found the college tennis route to be the smartest option and their decision to study in the United States is now paying dividends. \u201cYou want to play tennis professionally, that\u2019s what you grow up dreaming about,\u201d Mansouri told the Guardian in a phone interview. \u201cBack in Tunisia, people saw going to college and playing tennis there as a loss or a defeat because you chose not to go on the tour. \u201cFor years, people were talking about me here like I quit playing tennis or something; like I wasn\u2019t playing tennis anymore.\u201d But with the kind of success Mansouri was having with Wake Forest, people back home began to take notice, and it encouraged more Tunisian players to follow suit. \u201cPeople started seeing it differently and I see that young people in Tunisia want to go to college way more than before and I think that should be the case, especially for us in Arab countries,\u201d explained Mansouri. According to NCAA records, 36 Arab student-athletes played Division I tennis in 2018, with an additional 18 taking part in Division II. Participation numbers have been steadily increasing over the last few years. Developing talented juniors into competitive pros has always been an achilles heel for most Arab nations that lack the resources and have no proper systems in place to guide teenagers to the next level in tennis. College tennis is now seen as a refuge for many young players from the region looking to harness their skills and gain competitive experience, all while receiving proper education. \u201cThere isn\u2019t that transition from juniors to the pros [in our Arab countries]. A lot of people get lost in that space and they just don\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d says Omar Abdo, a Saudi Arabian senior playing college tennis at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. \u201cCollege tennis is like another chance for us.

Waititi as Hitler is the attention-grabbing headline, but the story\u2019s real focus is the relationship between Jojo, a lonely boy too timid for the Hitler Youth, and a Jewish girl he discovers his mother is hiding in their attic. Inevitably, Jojo\u2019s prejudices are challenged. (\u201cWhere are your horns?\u201d Jojo asks her. \u201cI\u2019m too young. They grow when you\u2019re aged 21,\u201d she replies). The movie was adapted from a serious novel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25641300-caging-skies\" title=\"\">Caging Skies</a> by Christine Leunens \u2013 but the Hitler character was Waititi\u2019s own addition. He was initially drawn to the story\u2019s German point of view, he says. \u201cI\u2019d never really seen that before and never seen it done in my style or my sensibility.\u201d</p> <p>Portraying Hitler was never a career goal. The studio only agreed to make Jojo Rabbit if Waititi played the role himself. \u201cIt just felt uncomfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe clothes were uncomfortable, the glue-on moustache was uncomfortable, and I had to have my hair dyed and straightened, which just made me feel weird all day long.\u201d</p> <p>The cast and crew felt the same, he says. \u201cI like to be everyone\u2019s friend as a director, to have a nice familial feel on set, and I\u2019m trying to encourage sharing of ideas and a cool, creative space \u2026 but I\u2019m dressed like Hitler. It just changes things, really.\u201d It\u2019s hard to tell whether this is Waititi being serious or another deadpan punchline. He avoided going full Hitler wherever possible, he says: \u201cI would take off the moustache whenever I wasn\u2019t in the scene, and I\u2019d wear a hat, and always take off the jacket because you don\u2019t want to be walking around with a fucking swastika on your arm trying to direct kids.\u201d</p> <p>Waititi\u2019s buffoonish, immature Hitler is by no means a faithful impersonation and it is not supposed to be. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10-year-old boy\u2019s idea of what Hitler is. He can only know what a 10-year-old knows,\u201d Waititi reminds me, adding that Jojo\u2019s father is also, significantly, absent. But still he has a careful line to tread: this is Jojo\u2019s supportive ally, but he is also the most evil man in history. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make him actually likable or sympathetic, that would be too twisted.\u201d I suggest that Waititi\u2019s Hitler cannot avoid being likable, because he is being played by Waititi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fddd5524b57884c569f93aea10b3fea1509b68a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fddd5524b57884c569f93aea10b3fea1509b68a/0_124_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waititi, Jonathan Brugh and Jemaine Clement in What We Do in the Shadows, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waititi, Jonathan Brugh and Jemaine Clement in What We Do in the Shadows, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/UNISON FILMS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s OK,\u201d he replies. \u201cThat\u2019s not agreeing with the character. I think it\u2019s actually better that way because, as uncomfortable as it is, you have to understand why he [Jojo] enjoys hanging out with him. And actually, if he\u2019s horrible and evil, that makes [Jojo] evil, because he\u2019s conjured him up.\u201d</p> <p>This contradiction runs through the whole movie. The opening sequence, for example, juxtaposes actual footage of Hitler rallies with a German-language cover version of I Want to Hold Your Hand. \u201cWatching some documentaries on the Hitler Youth, people at his rallies were crying, some were fainting, and they were scrambling to try and reach him.

But Jojo Rabbit\u2019s broader message is obviously intended to chime with our present day. \u201cCut to 2016,\u201d he continues, \u201cwhen a guy was appealing to a lot of people in the US who felt like they didn\u2019t have a voice and were left out, and at the end of a depression, and it\u2019s a very similar situation. People will follow anyone if they\u2019re inspiring.\u201d</p> <p>Jojo Rabbit has had a mixed reception. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/jojo-rabbit-hitler-comedy-wins-top-toronto-award\" title=\"\">won the coveted People\u2019s Choice award at the Toronto </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/jojo-rabbit-hitler-comedy-wins-top-toronto-award\" title=\"\">film </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/jojo-rabbit-hitler-comedy-wins-top-toronto-award\" title=\"\">festival</a> earlier this year, a harbinger of future Oscar-winners such as Green Book, 12 Years a Slave and The King\u2019s Speech.

      "bodyText": "As a boy in New Zealand, Taika Waititi went through a phase of obsessively drawing swastikas all over his notebooks. He knew what Nazis were and what the symbol represented, he says. \u201cBut you tell a kid they\u2019re not allowed to do something, that it\u2019s the worst thing to do, and they automatically want to do it.\u201d The transgressive thrill was usually fleeting, he admits. \u201cI\u2019d instantly feel really guilty and turn it into a window.\u201d Ordinarily, it would be a matter of some concern if that swastika-fixated child grew up to cast himself as Adolf Hitler in his own movie. Jojo Rabbit is a comedy about a wartime German boy whose imaginary friend is, indeed, Hitler. But this is Taika Waititi: not only is he a self-identifying \u201cPolynesian Jew\u201d (his father is Maori; his mother\u2019s father was Jewish), but one of the most likable people on the planet. As with his dress sense, Waititi\u2019s comedy compass has been unerring in recent years, both in front of and behind the camera. His previous film as a director, Thor Ragnarok, broke him into the mainstream after a decade of steadily growing appeal that became too big to describe as \u201ccult\u201d. Now Waititi seems to be everywhere. Along with his compatriots on Flight of the Conchords (Jemaine Clement, Bret McKenzie and Rhys Darby), for which he has writing and directing credits, Waititi has been ambassador for a brand of comedy that seems to be quintessentially New Zealand: modest, understated, deadpan even when surreal, rooted in the essential crapness of life. \u201cRhys Darby called it the comedy of mundanity,\u201d says Waititi, \u201cfocusing on just the most boring parts of life and then trying to find the funniest aspects of that.\u201d This very local sensibility has turned out to have global appeal. Darby is to be found in the latest Jumanji movie, Clement is filming James Cameron\u2019s Avatar sequels, and Waititi is everywhere you look: Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian; Ryan Reynolds\u2019 next blockbuster, Free Guy; cult animation Rick and Morty; James Gunn\u2019s Suicide Squad; and a Time Bandits reboot. His 2014 vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows is in its second series on TV. A new Thor sequel is also in the pipeline, but currently he is in Hawaii directing Next Goal Wins, based on the true story of the world\u2019s worst national football team, and starring Michael Fassbender. \u201cI\u2019m going to drain myself, then I\u2019ll fade away and be like a dried husk, blowing in the wind,\u201d he jokes. \u201cSome would say I\u2019ve got too many things going on and I should just stop saying yes, but most of them are a little ways off being made so I\u2019ve got time to figure out how to make the schedules work. But yeah, I\u2019m busy for the next few years.\u201d Jojo Rabbit feels like Waititi\u2019s riskiest proposition so far. Waititi as Hitler is the attention-grabbing headline, but the story\u2019s real focus is the relationship between Jojo, a lonely boy too timid for the Hitler Youth, and a Jewish girl he discovers his mother is hiding in their attic.

Alice\u2019s idea sidelined all that \u2013 self-referral was fine, no requirement to sign up for a course and complete it for the statistics, and workshops were free. </p> <p>\u201cRunning on a shoestring for the past nine years, Alice has inspired people to support the charity to give their time and talents, and was offered a home for the workshops in the local Methodist Church. There is also an allotment for gardening and making up vegetable boxes for people in the area who don\u2019t have gardens but who want to grow things.<br> \u201cWhy is all this so special? Because it works. Alice was very clear from the start that the charity should be run by its members for its members. Everyone involved in the charity has to have direct experience of mental ill-health themselves, or through a family member or friend. Members can decide when to attend the workshops and how often to suit their current health condition.</p> <p>\u201cIt works well \u2013 a friendly environment, a chance to chat and socialise, and a reason for leaving the four walls of the house on a regular basis with no demands made of you. The charity offers a chance to build inner strengths and self-confidence through being with other people who understand exactly what you are feeling because they have been there, or somewhere like it, themselves.<br> \u201cMany times, Alice has wanted to stop her work due to her own health needs, but she\u2019s continued and has the love and respect of many in our community. Her story and that of the charity she set up deserve to be told.\u201d</p> <h2>John Pilger</h2> <p><em>Nominated by John Powell</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b8bcd4e878f4e7c567c46e18f57d7ff98e7d165\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b8bcd4e878f4e7c567c46e18f57d7ff98e7d165/943_444_2460_1476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Pilger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Pilger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJohn Pilger has done a huge amount of work, often at risk to his life, to expose shonky and shoddy politics and politicians.

Despite the nationalist headwinds, he has won the support of the European, Pan-African and Latin American parliaments, and over 1,600 serving and former members of parliaments from all around the world, as well as numerous other notable figures (like the Dalai Lama). \u201cWe, the people of the world, face a global environmental crisis, and [the Upside notwithstanding], we are not tackling it effectively. Our economy has globalised, our impact on the environment has globalised, but our politics remains stubbornly and even increasingly national. National sovereignty was a solution to 17th-century religious wars in Europe, it is not the solution to the 21st-century global environmental crisis. Global problems require global solutions. Solutions, to be effective, must be enforced. Enforcement, to be legitimate, must be with the consent of the people. We need more effective and accountable global governance. We need a world parliament. \u201cAndreas, in his quiet modest way, may be the person who saves the planet. He certainly deserves a knighthood for trying.\u201d Alice Webb Nominated by Hilary Day \u201cAfter losing her job with a big local company through mental ill health, Alice decided to use her talents to set up a self-help, peer-supporting, creative charity offering free workshops for anyone in and around Cambridge dealing with mental health issues. \u201cThe local services for mental health had all but collapsed due to lack of funding, and what there was required referrals from the local NHS services. Alice\u2019s idea sidelined all that \u2013 self-referral was fine, no requirement to sign up for a course and complete it for the statistics, and workshops were free. \u201cRunning on a shoestring for the past nine years, Alice has inspired people to support the charity to give their time and talents, and was offered a home for the workshops in the local Methodist Church. There is also an allotment for gardening and making up vegetable boxes for people in the area who don\u2019t have gardens but who want to grow things. \u201cWhy is all this so special? Because it works. Alice was very clear from the start that the charity should be run by its members for its members. Everyone involved in the charity has to have direct experience of mental ill-health themselves, or through a family member or friend. Members can decide when to attend the workshops and how often to suit their current health condition. \u201cIt works well \u2013 a friendly environment, a chance to chat and socialise, and a reason for leaving the four walls of the house on a regular basis with no demands made of you. The charity offers a chance to build inner strengths and self-confidence through being with other people who understand exactly what you are feeling because they have been there, or somewhere like it, themselves. \u201cMany times, Alice has wanted to stop her work due to her own health needs, but she\u2019s continued and has the love and respect of many in our community. Her story and that of the charity she set up deserve to be told.\u201d John Pilger Nominated by John Powell \u201cJohn Pilger has done a huge amount of work, often at risk to his life, to expose shonky and shoddy politics and politicians. Without his documentaries and newspaper columns we would be much less informed about corruption, including the support, by the CIA, of dictators on all continents. \u201cPilger is a strong critic of American, Australian and British foreign policy, which he considers to be driven by an imperialist agenda. Pilger has also criticised his native country\u2019s treatment of indigenous Australians. He first drew international attention for his reports on the Cambodian genocide.\u201d Max Roser Nominated by arch-optimist David Alcock How about Max Roser and his team at Our World in Data, which exists to conduct research and disseminate data to make progress against the world\u2019s largest problems? And Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling-R\u00f6nnlund, Mikael Arevius and the rest of the team at Gapminder, who are carrying on the legacy of the late Hans Rosling by promoting a fact-based and overwhelmingly positive (they would say \u2018possibilist\u2019) world view [see also their 2018 book Factfulness].\u201d Bridget Nodes Nominated by Lindsay Viljoen \u201cBridget is a volunteer dog walker at the Dogs Trust Shoreham-by-Sea. She is there every off day (she works as a nurse) walking the difficult dogs that the other walkers can\u2019t walk. This provides the staff with precious extra time to spend with the dogs who need more attention.\u201d Matty Healy Nominated by Lisa Gobin \u201cMatty Healy, singer of The 1975, sings about what matters to the youth, and what should matter for everyone: climate change. His collaboration with Greta Thunberg, the single Love It If We Made It \u2026 the world would be a better place if his message got to more people. Keep up the good work, and thank you for reporting what most media don\u2019t cover.\u201d Fadil Elamin Nominated by Christine Ro \u201cFadil Elamin is one of the few children\u2019s dentists in Sudan. He\u2019s working under very challenging circumstances, from political unrest to frequent power outages. So his and colleagues\u2019 research, showing the effectiveness of a dental hack that doesn\u2019t require electricity, is especially useful.\u201d Gina Miller Nominated by Rhiannon Pugh \u201cI would nominate Gina Miller for her brave attempt to uphold British democracy.\u201d Jess Philips Nominated by Mike Moule \u201cI would nominate Jess Phillips for her courage, her honesty and her ability to maintain calm and dignity when all around her the world falls apart. She stands apart from many of our self-serving politicians and is a tribute to those who seek social and political change without reverting to slander.\u201d Martyn Goss Nominated by Liz Vizard \u201cMy nomination is for Martyn Goss, who has recently retired after nearly 30 years working as first social responsibility officer and later director of church and society for the Exeter diocese. Unfailingly committed to justice, peace and care for the environment, he has been and still is an inspiration to Exeter people, of all faiths and none, who care about these issues. He did win a Church Times green champion award in 2017, but if knighthoods were on offer to such as he, he would be a strong contender (though no way would he accept one!). A subscription to the Upside would be great though \u2026 The Guardian Upside Legend Awards. Who would you nominate? Tell us. TheUpside@TheGuardian.com",

Miedema is a European champion and World Cup finalist and her goalscoring record has been immense but if I were forced to choose between the two I would say Kerr edges it, because of her pace, dynamic movement and her ability to frighten defenders. Miedema is supreme in the penalty area but Kerr\u2019s movement around it is a constant threat.</p> <p>Neither player was in the Ballon d\u2019Or top three but they will have been rightly disappointed not to have been in that conversation and in 2020 we will have two players in England whose ambition will be to prove themselves the world\u2019s best forward. Though I wouldn\u2019t compare them as players to the men, it could be something like the Messi v Ronaldo battle while they were at Barcelona and Real Madrid: two outstanding players at rival clubs, pushing each other to ever greater levels of performance and achievement.</p> <p>For those who have not seen much of Kerr, I would compare her to Jamie Vardy. She is especially brilliant on transitions: when a midfielder gets the ball and has the ability to pass between or over defenders, that is when she comes alive. When there is room for her to run in behind a defence, she is the best in the world by far. Her movement is very good, she is always active across the line of defence, and when she gets in behind she is deadly. She can finish with either foot and is great in the air for someone who at a shade under 5ft 6in is not exactly tall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is a bit like her compatriot Tim Cahill, in that her ability to score with her head is constantly surprising. Watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/chelsea-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea\u2019s game against Manchester City</a> this month it was striking how many counterattacking moments they had, without finding the right pass in transition. Kerr\u2019s arrival will make them so much more dangerous at these moments \u2013 so long as her teammates find the right pass. In the World Cup you also saw a player who was capable of bearing the responsibility of leading \u2013 and in many ways carrying \u2013 a team: scoring the goals, taking penalties.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see whether any of the other WSL teams feel pressured into making moves during a transfer window that tends to be very quiet in the women\u2019s game. Kerr\u2019s arrival shows not only that some WSL teams can pay big money for the right players but that in comparison with Spain \u2013 where there are some good teams but the league as a whole is struggling \u2013 or Italy \u2013 where clubs would have been unable to afford her \u2013 or France \u2013 where Lyon win every year by a mile and there is no real challenge \u2013 or Germany \u2013 which is seen as a very demanding league that can be difficult for foreign players to acclimatise to \u2013 England now has a case for being considered the ideal destination for the best players in the world.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Miedema is a European champion and World Cup finalist and her goalscoring record has been immense but if I were forced to choose between the two I would say Kerr edges it, because of her pace, dynamic movement and her ability to frighten defenders. Miedema is supreme in the penalty area but Kerr\u2019s movement around it is a constant threat. Neither player was in the Ballon d\u2019Or top three but they will have been rightly disappointed not to have been in that conversation and in 2020 we will have two players in England whose ambition will be to prove themselves the world\u2019s best forward. Though I wouldn\u2019t compare them as players to the men, it could be something like the Messi v Ronaldo battle while they were at Barcelona and Real Madrid: two outstanding players at rival clubs, pushing each other to ever greater levels of performance and achievement. For those who have not seen much of Kerr, I would compare her to Jamie Vardy. She is especially brilliant on transitions: when a midfielder gets the ball and has the ability to pass between or over defenders, that is when she comes alive. When there is room for her to run in behind a defence, she is the best in the world by far. Her movement is very good, she is always active across the line of defence, and when she gets in behind she is deadly. She can finish with either foot and is great in the air for someone who at a shade under 5ft 6in is not exactly tall. She is a bit like her compatriot Tim Cahill, in that her ability to score with her head is constantly surprising. Watching Chelsea\u2019s game against Manchester City this month it was striking how many counterattacking moments they had, without finding the right pass in transition. Kerr\u2019s arrival will make them so much more dangerous at these moments \u2013 so long as her teammates find the right pass. In the World Cup you also saw a player who was capable of bearing the responsibility of leading \u2013 and in many ways carrying \u2013 a team: scoring the goals, taking penalties. It will be interesting to see whether any of the other WSL teams feel pressured into making moves during a transfer window that tends to be very quiet in the women\u2019s game. Kerr\u2019s arrival shows not only that some WSL teams can pay big money for the right players but that in comparison with Spain \u2013 where there are some good teams but the league as a whole is struggling \u2013 or Italy \u2013 where clubs would have been unable to afford her \u2013 or France \u2013 where Lyon win every year by a mile and there is no real challenge \u2013 or Germany \u2013 which is seen as a very demanding league that can be difficult for foreign players to acclimatise to \u2013 England now has a case for being considered the ideal destination for the best players in the world. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "2010 The Big Short by Michael Lewis We entered a new decade in largely gloomy fashion, still suffering from the ramifications of the global financial crisis two years before. No surprise then that Michael Lewis\u2019s The Big Short, which explained how America\u2019s subprime mortgage crisis made a few people very rich and everyone else a lot poorer, struck a chord. Lewis is a literary whistleblower: a former Salomon Brothers employee who dished the dirt on his brash colleagues in 1989\u2019s Liar\u2019s Poker and then went on to make a career as an explainer of complex economics and organisations to mass audiences who couldn\u2019t believe people got away with this stuff. Were we feeling trapped, and in need of information and expertise to liberate ourselves? Other notable non-fiction of the year suggests so: Siddhartha Mukherjee\u2019s \u201cbiography of cancer\u201d, The Emperor of All Maladies; Sheryl WuDunn and Nicholas Kristof\u2019s Half the Sky, a rallying cry against the global oppression of women. And in fiction, too, writers were grappling with constraints: those of marriage and convention in Jonathan Franzen\u2019s Freedom; of literal incarceration in Emma Donoghue\u2019s enormously successful Room, the story of the imprisonment and release of a boy and his mother; and of form itself in Jennifer Egan\u2019s dizzying A Visit from the Goon Squad. Its final two chapters, one of which takes the shape of a PowerPoint presentation, are set in a time about 15 years from the book\u2019s present day; in other words, not too far from now, which makes it ripe for rereading. 2011 Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari Further on in the decade, a certain cadre of people questioned our need for and tolerance of experts; but at its beginning, one expert trusted the general population to absorb and make sense of the complicated story of their own origins and social systems. An unpretentious distillation of human history that mixed anthropology, sociology, politics and geography, Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s doorstopper, Sapiens, found favour with readers keen for a digestible long view. First published in Hebrew this year and in Engish in 2014, it explained human cooperation and conflict, industry, farming, science, among much else, just at the moment that the sum of the world\u2019s knowledge seemed too impossibly various and atomised to take in. Naturally, the book got up the noses of parts of the academic community, who criticised its reliance on synthesis over original research \u2013 the very thing readers loved about it. Meanwhile, the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd was rejecting the easily digestible (and, critics might say, the unpretentious). Readers in English would have to wait awhile, but his six-volume My Struggle was finally complete. By the end of the decade, this style of writing \u2013 generally called autofiction, and not invented by Knausg\u00e5rd or any of his contemporaries but undeniably expanded by them \u2013 would be a hot topic, blurring the line between the writer as creator and the writer as constructed character, the voice we are never sure whether to trust. 2012 Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn Fiction has never been short of psychopaths, and Gillian Flynn was certainly not the first writer to conceive of one who invents a crime in order to throw suspicion on an enemy. But there was something about her protagonists \u2013 a glossy New York couple who hit the financial buffers and relocate to the midwest \u2013 that smacked up against the anxiety zeitgeist by revealing the hatred and neurosis behind an apparently enviable marriage. And why have one unreliable narrator when you can have two? Gone Girl\u2019s dual perspective thrilled readers just as it did director David Fincher, who filmed it before he disappeared into the TV world of House of Cards (New Yorker writer Joshua Rothman suggested that the film \u201ctravels all the way down to the id\u201d just as Fincher\u2019s Fight Club had done). After Gone Girl, it was boom time for fractured narratives with fractured women at their centre, as publishers sought to ride the wave of psychological thrillers described as \u201cgrip lit\u201d. But in the same year, we were also knocked sideways by sex: oodles of it, courtesy of a former TV studio manager turned ringmistress of sadomasochism. EL James, having devoured Stephenie Meyer\u2019s Twilight vampire series, tried her hand at fan fiction and, before she knew it, had written Fifty Shades of Grey, making her one of Time magazine\u2019s 100 most influential people in the world. In one of those retrospective peculiarities that will delight PhD students of tomorrow, the year in which vengeful wives and submissive girlfriends laughed all the way to the bank also witnessed Hilary Mantel dispatching Anne Boleyn to her fate in Bring Up the Bodies, adding another Booker to Wolf Hall\u2019s and thereby making Mantel the first female writer to win twice; next year\u2019s The Mirror and the Light will complete the trilogy \u2013 and may even bring her the hat-trick. And the pseudonymous Elena Ferrante arrived in English translation to weave her spell of Neapolitan girlhood and the depths of female friendship in My Brilliant Friend, sparking an interest in translated fiction and setting off a wave of Ferrante fever. Ferrante too returns next year with a new book, intriguingly entitled The Lying Life of Adults. 2013 A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing by Eimear McBride \u201cEimear McBride,\u201d wrote Anne Enright in this newspaper, \u201cis that old-fashioned thing, a genius, in that she writes truth-spilling, uncompromising and brilliant prose that can be, on occasion, quite hard to read.\u201d It was the \u201cquite hard to read\u201d part that ensured it took almost a decade after finishing her story of a pain-scorched childhood and adolescence for McBride to find a publisher willing to take it on. But the power of Girl\u2019s stream-of-consciousness narrative overcame the difficulty, and A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing won both the Goldsmiths prize, which rewards experimentalism, and the Baileys women\u2019s prize for fiction, which ranges more widely between styles and genres. McBride exemplifies the breadth and depth of a group of Irish writers that includes Kevin Barry, Sara Baume, Paul Murray and Lisa McInerney; they have emerged in the last decade, each of them playing with form, and reflecting both Irish literary heritage and contemporary concerns. Also published this year were Richard Flanagan\u2019s Man Booker-winning The Narrow Road to the Deep North, the Australian writer\u2019s account of life as a Japanese prisoner of war that drew on his father\u2019s experiences; Donna Tartt\u2019s vast, madcap art heist story, The Goldfinch; and, for those who like a bit of corporate-focused self-empowerment, Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s Lean In. 2014 This Changes Everything by Naomi Klein Has everything changed? In fact, has anything changed? In terms of our grasping of the scale of climate crisis, maybe; five years ago, it might not have been possible to imagine a schoolgirl sailing across the Atlantic to address the United Nations and publishing her own book, Greta Thunberg\u2019s No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference. In terms of the action taken to address the issues, the jury hasn\u2019t yet heard closing arguments, let alone filed out. But This Changes Everything set out Naomi Klein\u2019s thinking in the years since Shock Doctrine, her attack on neoliberalism; in particular it focused on the impossibility of confronting ecological catastrophe without assessing the need to dismantle the economic systems that make it seemingly inevitable, a condition of argument that now seems strikingly obvious. Another call to action came in the form of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s We Should All Be Feminists, in which the Nigerian-born novelist expanded on a wildly popular speech to consider the need for an inclusive and intersectional feminism. 2015 The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson This was not Maggie Nelson\u2019s first book \u2013 she had also written about the murder of her aunt, a meditation on the colour blue and several volumes of poetry \u2013 but it was the first to introduce her to a wider audience in the UK. Why did a book that played so fast and loose with the concept of memoir inspire such intense admiration? It was, perhaps, a question of exposure and openness: Nelson\u2019s voyage into the heart of her relationship with the artist Harry Dodge, who is transgender, her interrogation of the arrival of sudden, unexpected romantic and maternal love into her life, and the realities of living freely amid the constrictions of governments, society and art. It is a book that travels through the mind, but refuses to divorce itself from the painful demands of the body \u2013 and it stood as a prime example of a new wave of writing, much of it coming from American writers including Eileen Myles and Chris Kraus, that incorporated the personal and political struggles of previous eras into a startlingly modern and often queer register. The biggest literary story of the year was the publication of Harper Lee\u2019s Go Set a Watchman, a first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird that had been submitted to a publisher in the 1950s and returned to Lee with instructions for how to make it better. Watchman introduced us to a grown-up Scout, returning to visit her father Atticus and being appalled to discover his attitudes towards race; publication, therefore, had the effect of challenging warm feelings towards the character the world essentially knows as Gregory Peck. The circumstances of its appearance \u2013 the year before Lee\u2019s death, with conflicting stories over her ability to grant consent to its publication \u2013 only deepened the confusion. It was an odd symmetry that 2015\u2019s Booker was won by Paul Beatty, the first ever American victor, with The Sellout, a trenchant satire on racial segregation and identity in contemporary America. 2016 Autumn by Ali Smith A character named Elisabeth Demand has her passport application rejected on the grounds that her head, as it appears in her photograph, is too large. She is sent back into the labyrinth of obscure processes, with no reason to believe she will emerge successful. Three years later, and those applications and rejections have taken on an increased charge for us, Smith\u2019s readers; not merely a tedious administrative task, but a question of who is ruled in and out of membership of the country, and how the state defines what constitutes \u201csettled\u201d. Ali Smith, who with Autumn launched her \u201cseasonal\u201d quartet of novels to be written each year against the clock, knew this: the book is shot through with references to division, to the disappearance of empathy between people, to surveillance and control. It was, as it turns out, a terrifying taste of things to come. Elsewhere in the year\u2019s fiction, history was the order of the day: in Colson Whitehead\u2019s magisterial blending of fact and fantasy The Underground Railroad, a narrative of enslavement and escape; in Sebastian Barry\u2019s Days Without End, which pictured Irishmen abroad and at war in 19th-century America; Francis Spufford\u2019s bravura piece of New York picaresque, Golden Hill; and Sarah Perry\u2019s The Essex Serpent, which conjured a gothic resurgence in a Victorian coastal town. 2017 Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge \u201cWe tell ourselves that good people can\u2019t be racist. We seem to think that true racism only exists in the hearts of evil people. We tell ourselves that racism is about moral values, when instead it is about the survival strategy of systemic power.\u201d Writing in this paper, Reni Eddo-Lodge explained how the response to a blogpost she had written three years earlier had led her to expand her analysis of structural racism, its operation and its effects, into a full-length book that went on to win the Jhalak prize and a British book award for non-fiction. The book claimed space for the increasingly pressing conversations writers of colour wanted to start; and argued that the centring of white voices and concerns \u2013 not least in the publishing industry that decided what would and wouldn\u2019t appear on shelves \u2013 had to end. Nikesh Shukla\u2019s anthology The Good Immigrant had appeared the year before, as had David Olusoga\u2019s Black and British; Afua Hirsch\u2019s Brit(ish) would follow in 2018. With these books, there began to be a sense that accounts of lived experience and marginalised histories could blend or sit alongside each other, articulate both the past and the present, and bridge a gap between writing and activism. And that people would buy them, in their droves. Elsewhere, there was a sort-of surprise at the Man Booker; not that Lincoln in the Bardo, George Saunders\u2019s critically acclaimed novel, should be thought worthy of winning, but that a writer should conceive of creating a multi-vocal narrative about Abraham Lincoln\u2019s dead son set in purgatory. One of the most surprising literary successes of the decade, it strengthened the reputation of the ever inventive Saunders even more. 2018 Normal People by Sally Rooney On 26 May 2018, the Republic of Ireland woke to the news that the previous day\u2019s referendum had resulted in an overwhelming mandate to repeal the constitution\u2019s 8th Amendment; in other words, to give women the right to terminate pregnancy. The campaign had been intergenerational and countrywide; but while the response was jubilant, there was also a sense of relief and the emergence from trauma. For Sally Rooney, whose second novel seemed at one point during that summer to be all anyone was reading, the issue was hard to talk about. \u201cAll that suffering was so pointless,\u201d she told me in an interview at the time. \u201cWhy did we do that? Why did we do any of that? Thirty years. All this anger and sadness, and all the horrible things that have happened to people ... \u201d Rooney\u2019s cool appraisals of Irish life \u2013 the giving way of a pastoral, church-led society to a more layered and divergent world \u2013 underpin fiction that appears to concern itself with a narrower world of young Dubliners (Trinity College Dubliners at that). And her apprehension of the surging emotional currents between her characters \u2013 in Normal People\u2019s case Marianne and Connell, who move to the capital from small-town Sligo \u2013 broadened her appeal. Rooney, however, was not to win that year\u2019s Man Booker \u2013 it went, instead, to Anna Burns, whose dystopian evocation of the Troubles, Milkman, written while the author battled ill health and subsisted on benefits, created a troubling and riveting picture of male coercion and female resistance during conflict. 2019 Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo The first black woman to win the Booker prize, Bernardine Evaristo is also a writer who incorporates poetic and dramatic techniques into her novels, and who has persisted in that endeavour over the course of decades. Her work has been praised by critics and enjoyed by readers for a long time, but her high-profile victory \u2013 accompanied by controversy because the award was given to both her book and Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments \u2013 has brought Evaristo before a vastly increased audience and intensified discussion of representation in contemporary British literature, and of how artists are recognised and their work promoted. Evaristo\u2019s success, which brings to the fore not only her eight novels but her determination, in her words, to \u201cput presence into absence\u201d and make visible in fiction the lives of black women, arrived in a country riven by frenzied discord. The issue of who gets to tell their story in the midst of that division, how fiction can present our complex selves and fractured communities and who is allowed the agency of self-definition has risen again to the top of the cultural agenda. When, a few weeks after the Booker prize, a BBC journalist said that it had been shared between Atwood and \u201canother writer\u201d \u2013 a hasty ad-lib, it was later explained \u2013 the sense of angry disappointment was palpable, perhaps because change, so often heralded, equally often seems to recede. But the past decade suggests that a tipping point has been reached in the opening up of the literary world to hitherto marginalised voices; the next decade will reveal whether that is indeed the case. \u2022 To buy these titles go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0203 176 3837.",

We were free to leave whenever we wanted, but in reality we were confined there by poverty and lack of other options.</p> <p>Ironically, \u201ccompanion\u201d was the moniker that the charity gave each resident, but the combination of draconian rules and insecure tenancies produced a tense atmosphere, often leaving people suspicious of one another.

We were free to leave whenever we wanted, but in reality we were confined there by poverty and lack of other options. Ironically, \u201ccompanion\u201d was the moniker that the charity gave each resident, but the combination of draconian rules and insecure tenancies produced a tense atmosphere, often leaving people suspicious of one another. It wasn\u2019t the ideal environment to form an everlasting friendship and indeed, we barely exchanged a passing glance in the first couple of months I was there. It took another \u201ccompanion\u201d to threaten me with a knife before you could stomach an interaction with me. You put your little self in the middle of that exchange, even though I so could have handled it myself. Yes, OK Dom, I suppose you might have saved my skin. Well done mate.

And very old DNA started giving up its secrets, after researchers succeeded in extracting it from ancient bodily remains and sequencing it. This threw open a huge window on our species\u2019 past, revealing that every person alive today is the product of multiple migrations and that relations between different waves of migration have always been complicated. Neanderthals and modern humans probably clobbered each other, for example, but they also interbred.</p> <p>But this was also the decade in which science was commandeered by all kinds of people with political, social and economic axes to grind. Ancient DNA researchers understood early on the potential for their discoveries to be politicised \u2013 the science of human origins always has been \u2013 but they still weren\u2019t able to fully control the message. Thus we learned about white supremacists engaging in sinister <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/white-supremacists-science-dna.html\" title=\"\">milk-chugging parties</a> in America, supposedly designed to smoke out people of non-European heritage who can\u2019t digest lactose, and baseless claims <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-46616574\" title=\"\">made</a> by some Hindu nationalists that the speakers of the original Indo-European language hailed from the Indian subcontinent.

      "bodyText": "The 2010s were the decade in which we were reminded that science is just a method, like the rhythm method. And just like the rhythm method, it can be more or less rigorously applied, sabotaged, overrated, underrated and ignored. If you don\u2019t treat it with respect, you may not get the optimal result, but that\u2019s not the method\u2019s fault. That may be where the similarities end, because when it\u2019s done well, science is very effective, and this decade furnished its fair share of breakthroughs to make us gasp. Physicists detected phenomena that were predicted decades ago \u2013 gravitational waves, the Higgs boson particle \u2013 indicating that they have been on broadly the right track in their understanding of how the universe works. Astronomers added awe-inspiring detail. Nasa probes found towering ice mountains on Pluto and organic chemistry \u2013 the stuff of life \u2013 on Mars and a moon of Saturn. And who could forget the exoplanets \u2013 those planets orbiting distant stars? Thousands of them were discovered in just the past 10 years. No wonder science fiction is booming. Biologists didn\u2019t slack either. They honed an immunological defence mechanism found in bacteria, Crispr-Cas9, into a powerful gene-editing tool that works in plants and animals \u2013 including humans. They added several new ancestors to the human family tree \u2013 and discovered ghostly traces of others as yet unseen and unnamed. And very old DNA started giving up its secrets, after researchers succeeded in extracting it from ancient bodily remains and sequencing it. This threw open a huge window on our species\u2019 past, revealing that every person alive today is the product of multiple migrations and that relations between different waves of migration have always been complicated. Neanderthals and modern humans probably clobbered each other, for example, but they also interbred. But this was also the decade in which science was commandeered by all kinds of people with political, social and economic axes to grind. Ancient DNA researchers understood early on the potential for their discoveries to be politicised \u2013 the science of human origins always has been \u2013 but they still weren\u2019t able to fully control the message. Thus we learned about white supremacists engaging in sinister milk-chugging parties in America, supposedly designed to smoke out people of non-European heritage who can\u2019t digest lactose, and baseless claims made by some Hindu nationalists that the speakers of the original Indo-European language hailed from the Indian subcontinent. Ancient DNA researchers themselves were accused of engaging in an undignified \u201cbone rush\u201d, and disrespecting indigenous remains. Dissing the dead is one thing, dissing the living quite another. The world was shocked when, in 2018, the Chinese biophysicist He Jiankui announced he had used Crispr to edit the genomes of twin girls \u2013 the first humans born with edited DNA they can pass on. Ethical concerns were raised over who\u2019s entitled to know what about private health records as genetic testing becomes mainstream, and over the prohibitive pricing of gene therapies after the first of these was approved in 2012 \u2013 then taken off the market. We welcomed the boon of artificial intelligence \u2013 the fruit of massively increased computing power, cheap memory, advances in data management and new maths and statistics \u2013 and fretted over its potential negative impact on us. The first vaccine against Ebola was approved. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Ebola continues to rage, health workers are battling not only the disease, but also hesitation about getting vaccinated. This is now a global problem, and though the reasons for it are complicated \u2013 and vary according to who is hesitating \u2013 in the UK and US Andrew Wakefield has a lot to answer for. He abused the scientific method in a previous decade, when he made false claims about a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Fear of vaccines has come home to roost \u2013 most visibly, in the form of a global resurgence of measles. It\u2019s not all down to him, though. We\u2019ve been so well served by vaccines that relatively few people alive today remember what life was like before them \u2013 how, for example, people wept with joy when Jonas Salk\u2019s polio vaccine was announced in 1955. We heard a lot in this decade about how trust in experts has waned, but it\u2019s difficult to know how much of that perception is real and how much of it comes down to minority opinions bellowed through the sousaphone of social media. In 2019, the US-based organisation Scholars at Risk reported that attacks on higher education communities had more than doubled globally over the previous three years \u2013 ranging from restrictions on academic expression to wrongful imprisonment and even violence. On the other hand, surveys suggest that trust in scientists is quite stable over the long term, and science funding has been slowly increasing in the world\u2019s richest countries. Taken together, perhaps what these indicators reflect is that, like the rhythm method, the scientific method is one we should be glad to have in our armoury, but that both have the potential to wreak havoc in the context of a toxic relationship. \u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist based in Paris.

Tyler is a graduate of the \u201cNew Weird America\u2019\u201d scene of the 00s, and the Nashville guitarist\u2019s hypnotic finger-pickings often feel unmoored from time and space altogether, evoking a dreamy, half-remembered vision of the deep south. For his latest Goes West, he\u2019s added a bit of California sun to the mix too, resulting the most absorbing \u2013 and strangely tuneful \u2013 album of his career. Its highlight is the opener, a shimmering, ever-so-slightly proggy piece of chamber folk that gets more mesmerising as it goes. It seems to convey so much, without a single word being said. <em>GM</em></p> <h2>Lou Roy \u2013 Bite</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-GetmmSaZg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4-GetmmSaZg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I stumbled into a small watering hole in Downtown LA a few months ago to see a singer-songwriter who previously spent the past five years recording under the name Huxlee, and has undergone a complete reinvention ahead of the release of a debut EP under the new guise of Lou Roy. The moment she began performing I felt that instant reassurance that comes with knowing that all it takes is walking into the wrong bar at the right time to be hit by a hopeful magic. Lou Roy\u2019s voice has the elder sophistication of a legacy recording artist but in the track Bite her intentions have a most modern of truth-speaking. Bite is the lead single from a pensive three-track EP (Your Friend) about trying so hard to be so good to the ones we love, and how sometimes that involves literally biting down on our own instinctive impulses. It\u2019s remarkable. <em>EB</em></p> <h2>Tanya Tucker \u2013 The House That Built Me</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu0GRd0fSCQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qu0GRd0fSCQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Sure, Tanya Tucker has gotten lots of attention for the title track of her stunningly raw comeback album, While I\u2019m Livin,\u2019 including three Grammy nominations. But the peak song on the singer\u2019s first album in over a decade hasn\u2019t gotten anywhere near the exposure it deserves. Tucker\u2019s recording of The House That Built Me, wipes the floor with the far better-known version of the song by Miranda Lambert, a No 1 country hit nearly a decade ago. In Lambert\u2019s case, it was the song, not the singer, that clicked. Lambert was half Tucker\u2019s age when she recorded House, too shy of experience to make a lyric about the search for lost youth stick.

      "bodyText": "Kalie Shorr \u2013 F U Forever Maine native, Nashville transplant Kalie Shorr has, as they say, bars. F U Forever is an immaculate character assassination that exposes an ex\u2019s weak tricks and reveals him for the grasping bully he really is \u2013 one who lays his hands on her while their friends are over for dinner, gaslights her into thinking she\u2019s a hysteric and makes her pay for everything then buys her \u201ca random ring\u201d with his tax return. \u201cNow I\u2019m wearing that stupid ring on my pretty little middle finger,\u201d Shorr sings in the triumphant chorus, \u201cso I can say F U forever!\u201d It\u2019s twangy and tart, with a classic Taylor Swift-style bridge, all helpless momentum until Shorr freezes on a perfect punchline: \u201cI\u2019m just a mirror reflecting,\u201d she realises, \u201cand you\u2019re just an asshole projecting.\u201d LS William Tyler \u2013 Alpine Star The self-described \u201crural new age\u201d instrumentals of William Tyler might be the best music you didn\u2019t hear in 2019, but could equally be the best music you didn\u2019t hear in any year of the last half-century too. Tyler is a graduate of the \u201cNew Weird America\u2019\u201d scene of the 00s, and the Nashville guitarist\u2019s hypnotic finger-pickings often feel unmoored from time and space altogether, evoking a dreamy, half-remembered vision of the deep south. For his latest Goes West, he\u2019s added a bit of California sun to the mix too, resulting the most absorbing \u2013 and strangely tuneful \u2013 album of his career. Its highlight is the opener, a shimmering, ever-so-slightly proggy piece of chamber folk that gets more mesmerising as it goes. It seems to convey so much, without a single word being said. GM Lou Roy \u2013 Bite I stumbled into a small watering hole in Downtown LA a few months ago to see a singer-songwriter who previously spent the past five years recording under the name Huxlee, and has undergone a complete reinvention ahead of the release of a debut EP under the new guise of Lou Roy. The moment she began performing I felt that instant reassurance that comes with knowing that all it takes is walking into the wrong bar at the right time to be hit by a hopeful magic. Lou Roy\u2019s voice has the elder sophistication of a legacy recording artist but in the track Bite her intentions have a most modern of truth-speaking. Bite is the lead single from a pensive three-track EP (Your Friend) about trying so hard to be so good to the ones we love, and how sometimes that involves literally biting down on our own instinctive impulses. It\u2019s remarkable. EB Tanya Tucker \u2013 The House That Built Me Sure, Tanya Tucker has gotten lots of attention for the title track of her stunningly raw comeback album, While I\u2019m Livin,\u2019 including three Grammy nominations. But the peak song on the singer\u2019s first album in over a decade hasn\u2019t gotten anywhere near the exposure it deserves. Tucker\u2019s recording of The House That Built Me, wipes the floor with the far better-known version of the song by Miranda Lambert, a No 1 country hit nearly a decade ago. In Lambert\u2019s case, it was the song, not the singer, that clicked. Lambert was half Tucker\u2019s age when she recorded House, too shy of experience to make a lyric about the search for lost youth stick. By contrast, Tucker brought every one of her 60 years to bear in her version, using her time-scarred voice and slyly wizened persona to create a performance that will bring you to tears.

      "body": "<h2>Film</h2> <p>At the beginning of the decade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/avatar\">Avatar</a> was at the top of the box office in the UK, the US and numerous other territories. It looked like the shape of things to come; now it\u2019s as much the shape of things that went. And not just in terms of Sam Worthington\u2019s career. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamescameron\">James Cameron</a>\u2019s futuristic epic literally changed the landscape \u2013 to that of a wondrous alien planet, unlike anything we\u2019d ever seen before. So immersive were Avatar\u2019s 3D vistas that we forgave the blue cat people and declared this to be the future of cinema. Suddenly, all big movies had to be made in 3D, and cinemas had an excuse to jack up ticket prices accordingly. For a time it worked, until we realised 2D was immersive enough, and cheaper.</p> <p>In other ways, though, Avatar really did set the bar for the 2010s. Cameron has always excelled at applying technology to action cinema, and Avatar really showed what was possible with CG rendering, performance capture, green screen and all the other tricks. Now that is what we expect every time. Scan the list of highest-grossing films of the decade and it is all CGI-heavy and/or action-driven spectacle until we get to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/joker\">Joker</a> at No 30. Avatar\u2019s $230m budget was outlandish at the time; now such gambles are routine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d74e7b31a371042b3c4fea5a7468deba8e060f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d74e7b31a371042b3c4fea5a7468deba8e060f1/132_0_2877_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana in Avatar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana in Avatar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Innovations aside, Avatar\u2019s hokey mythologising does look old-school, but the story tackled some prescient themes: ecosystems imperilled by rampant capitalism; human identity as transferable data; dissolving of boundaries between lived and virtual experience; western imperialism examining its own engagement with other cultures \u2013 albeit via a white, male saviour who turns out to be better at everything than the natives. Indeed, for all that the decade elevated women and people of colour, we would be seeing many more heroic white guys in the years that followed.</p> <p>Where Avatar arguably failed was in capitalising on its spectacular success. More than any other decade, the 2010s have been an era of familiarity: sequels, remakes, brands. The movies that really defined the decade were Marvel\u2019s cunningly interconnected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel\">Avengers</a> cycle. By contrast, Avatar has left remarkably little impact on the cultural landscape. Nobody named their babies Neytiri or Eytukan, memes of Jake Sully shouting \u201cThis is our land!\u201d remain uncirculated, and while the Force is part of the language, who remembers the name of the Na\u2019vi mother goddess?\u201d (It was Eywa \u2013 thanks Wikipedia). If the best we can say is that Avatar\u2019s giant technological leaps paved the way for more \u201cmovies where people look like animals\u201d, such as Cats, then that\u2019s not much of a legacy.</p> <p>Things could change if and when Cameron finally grinds out the multiple sequels he promised (it feels as though Avatar 2 has been coming \u201cnext year\u201d since about 2011), but 10 years on, Avatar feels like a different planet.</p> <p><em>SR</em></p> <h2>Music</h2> <p>The decade in music started with a whimper. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/joe-mcelderry\">Joe McElderry</a>, the winner of the sixth series of The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-x-factor\">X Factor</a>, then still in its ratings prime, had become the victim of a Facebook campaign (remember those?) to reinstate authenticity into the race for Christmas No 1. The resulting furore meant his cover of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a>\u2019s The Climb was kept off the top spot by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rage-against-the-machine\">Rage Against the Machine</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl-e2PM1ITM\">Killing in the Name</a>. A week later, his take on a song originally released just nine months earlier \u2013 all prophetic lyrics about struggling to overcome life\u2019s uphill battles \u2013 landed the first chart-topper of a new decade. However, it felt like a consolation prize rather than the start of something, with McElderry eventually dropped by Syco in 2011 after his third single peaked at 68.</p> <p>The muted success \u2013 an X Factor winners\u2019 single had taken the Christmas top spot every year between 2005 and 2008 \u2013 also represented a turning of the tide when it came to The X Factor\u2019s pop culture dominance, with the public growing bored of cynically being force-fed sickly sweet covers with their turkey dinners.</p> <p>You could argue, however, that McElderry did leave his mark, with his malleable, just-happy-to-be-here ordinariness ushering in the swath of bland subsequent X Factor winners such as Matt Cardle, Ben Haenow and Matt Terry; a trio of varying shades of beige that in turn also reflected a new pop landscape headlined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\">Ed Sheeran</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b37dc64a6145514701e57f7f8d98688faea30a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b37dc64a6145514701e57f7f8d98688faea30a3/0_0_3500_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Gaga.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That The Climb would subsequently be knocked off a week later by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a>\u2019s ludicrous, turbo-charged banger <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrO4YZeyl0I\">Bad Romance</a> \u2013 a song that had already spent a week at No 1 in late 2009 after a performance on the X Factor that involved her dancing in a giant bath while dressed like a bat \u2013 only serves to highlight so much of what has changed since 2010. While pop stars such as Ava Max and newcomer Alice Chater have tried to replicate the slightly trashy, kitchen sink-esque sound of Gaga\u2019s Fame Monster era, and the fantastical imagery that went with it, it is telling that even Gaga seems to have given in to the scourge of \u201crelatability\u201d that has swept through pop, introduced firstly by TV talent shows then the rise of social media.</p> <p>In fact, you could argue that Gaga has spent the majority of the latter half of the decade crafting her own variations of The Climb\u2019s country-tinged, homespun authenticity via 2016\u2019s Stetson-wearing Joanne and last year\u2019s A Star Is Born, a film that essentially punishes her character for being a pop star rather than a guitar-wielding authentic musician. Rumours are that Gaga\u2019s next album will see a return to full-throttle electropop, a move that would chime with a bubbling undercurrent of boredom at music\u2019s current streaming-era stasis. New decade, old Gaga? It\u2019s the climb.</p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>TV</h2> <p>The most-watched show at the start of 2010 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eastenders\">EastEnders</a>, barging into the new decade with the brassy confidence of an Albert Square pub matriarch. Archie Mitchell had just been bludgeoned to death with the Queen Vic bust, and Syed\u2019s secret love for Christian was set to ruin his wedding day, in a New Year\u2019s Day episode that brought in 12 million viewers. Now, EastEnders routinely pulls in less than half those numbers, and this year saw the lowest viewing figures ever. It hasn\u2019t hit the 10 million mark since 2015, and it\u2019s not the only soap to struggle. Back in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street\">Coronation Street </a>brought in nearly 15 million viewers, but now has a third of that.</p> <p>Soap operas were born out of the radio dramas that entertained housewives as they went about their chores during the day, and they boomed as they moved to TV. Back in the glory days, when there were only four channels and EastEnders was the edgy young disruptor in soapland, 30 million people watched Dirty Den serve Angie with divorce papers for Christmas. But now, with only a third of people watching soaps live, and prestige TV such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a> eating up our downtime, viewers\u2019 loyalties are torn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a558e75532ee1b2e0d2280b76f0c4d1d367c5cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a558e75532ee1b2e0d2280b76f0c4d1d367c5cdd/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cillian Murphy in Peaky Blinders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cillian Murphy in Peaky Blinders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd/Tiger Aspect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been a shift in the style of gritty reality audiences expect from TV, too.

      "bodyText": "Film At the beginning of the decade, Avatar was at the top of the box office in the UK, the US and numerous other territories. It looked like the shape of things to come; now it\u2019s as much the shape of things that went. And not just in terms of Sam Worthington\u2019s career. James Cameron\u2019s futuristic epic literally changed the landscape \u2013 to that of a wondrous alien planet, unlike anything we\u2019d ever seen before. So immersive were Avatar\u2019s 3D vistas that we forgave the blue cat people and declared this to be the future of cinema. Suddenly, all big movies had to be made in 3D, and cinemas had an excuse to jack up ticket prices accordingly. For a time it worked, until we realised 2D was immersive enough, and cheaper. In other ways, though, Avatar really did set the bar for the 2010s. Cameron has always excelled at applying technology to action cinema, and Avatar really showed what was possible with CG rendering, performance capture, green screen and all the other tricks. Now that is what we expect every time. Scan the list of highest-grossing films of the decade and it is all CGI-heavy and/or action-driven spectacle until we get to Joker at No 30. Avatar\u2019s $230m budget was outlandish at the time; now such gambles are routine. Innovations aside, Avatar\u2019s hokey mythologising does look old-school, but the story tackled some prescient themes: ecosystems imperilled by rampant capitalism; human identity as transferable data; dissolving of boundaries between lived and virtual experience; western imperialism examining its own engagement with other cultures \u2013 albeit via a white, male saviour who turns out to be better at everything than the natives. Indeed, for all that the decade elevated women and people of colour, we would be seeing many more heroic white guys in the years that followed. Where Avatar arguably failed was in capitalising on its spectacular success. More than any other decade, the 2010s have been an era of familiarity: sequels, remakes, brands. The movies that really defined the decade were Marvel\u2019s cunningly interconnected Avengers cycle. By contrast, Avatar has left remarkably little impact on the cultural landscape. Nobody named their babies Neytiri or Eytukan, memes of Jake Sully shouting \u201cThis is our land!\u201d remain uncirculated, and while the Force is part of the language, who remembers the name of the Na\u2019vi mother goddess?\u201d (It was Eywa \u2013 thanks Wikipedia). If the best we can say is that Avatar\u2019s giant technological leaps paved the way for more \u201cmovies where people look like animals\u201d, such as Cats, then that\u2019s not much of a legacy. Things could change if and when Cameron finally grinds out the multiple sequels he promised (it feels as though Avatar 2 has been coming \u201cnext year\u201d since about 2011), but 10 years on, Avatar feels like a different planet. SR Music The decade in music started with a whimper. Joe McElderry, the winner of the sixth series of The X Factor, then still in its ratings prime, had become the victim of a Facebook campaign (remember those?) to reinstate authenticity into the race for Christmas No 1. The resulting furore meant his cover of Miley Cyrus\u2019s The Climb was kept off the top spot by Rage Against the Machine\u2019s Killing in the Name. A week later, his take on a song originally released just nine months earlier \u2013 all prophetic lyrics about struggling to overcome life\u2019s uphill battles \u2013 landed the first chart-topper of a new decade. However, it felt like a consolation prize rather than the start of something, with McElderry eventually dropped by Syco in 2011 after his third single peaked at 68. The muted success \u2013 an X Factor winners\u2019 single had taken the Christmas top spot every year between 2005 and 2008 \u2013 also represented a turning of the tide when it came to The X Factor\u2019s pop culture dominance, with the public growing bored of cynically being force-fed sickly sweet covers with their turkey dinners. You could argue, however, that McElderry did leave his mark, with his malleable, just-happy-to-be-here ordinariness ushering in the swath of bland subsequent X Factor winners such as Matt Cardle, Ben Haenow and Matt Terry; a trio of varying shades of beige that in turn also reflected a new pop landscape headlined by Ed Sheeran. That The Climb would subsequently be knocked off a week later by Lady Gaga\u2019s ludicrous, turbo-charged banger Bad Romance \u2013 a song that had already spent a week at No 1 in late 2009 after a performance on the X Factor that involved her dancing in a giant bath while dressed like a bat \u2013 only serves to highlight so much of what has changed since 2010. While pop stars such as Ava Max and newcomer Alice Chater have tried to replicate the slightly trashy, kitchen sink-esque sound of Gaga\u2019s Fame Monster era, and the fantastical imagery that went with it, it is telling that even Gaga seems to have given in to the scourge of \u201crelatability\u201d that has swept through pop, introduced firstly by TV talent shows then the rise of social media. In fact, you could argue that Gaga has spent the majority of the latter half of the decade crafting her own variations of The Climb\u2019s country-tinged, homespun authenticity via 2016\u2019s Stetson-wearing Joanne and last year\u2019s A Star Is Born, a film that essentially punishes her character for being a pop star rather than a guitar-wielding authentic musician. Rumours are that Gaga\u2019s next album will see a return to full-throttle electropop, a move that would chime with a bubbling undercurrent of boredom at music\u2019s current streaming-era stasis. New decade, old Gaga? It\u2019s the climb. MC TV The most-watched show at the start of 2010 was EastEnders, barging into the new decade with the brassy confidence of an Albert Square pub matriarch. Archie Mitchell had just been bludgeoned to death with the Queen Vic bust, and Syed\u2019s secret love for Christian was set to ruin his wedding day, in a New Year\u2019s Day episode that brought in 12 million viewers. Now, EastEnders routinely pulls in less than half those numbers, and this year saw the lowest viewing figures ever. It hasn\u2019t hit the 10 million mark since 2015, and it\u2019s not the only soap to struggle. Back in 2010, Coronation Street brought in nearly 15 million viewers, but now has a third of that. Soap operas were born out of the radio dramas that entertained housewives as they went about their chores during the day, and they boomed as they moved to TV. Back in the glory days, when there were only four channels and EastEnders was the edgy young disruptor in soapland, 30 million people watched Dirty Den serve Angie with divorce papers for Christmas. But now, with only a third of people watching soaps live, and prestige TV such as Game of Thrones eating up our downtime, viewers\u2019 loyalties are torn. There has been a shift in the style of gritty reality audiences expect from TV, too. There is still a demand for \u201cnormal people\u201d on screen, but perhaps with a more aspirational filter. When constructed reality boomed in the middle of the decade, the storylines followed melodramatic soap tropes, with a feeling of watching the people\u2019s everyday lives. But against of all of the \u201creality\u201d they profess to capture, shows such as Made in Chelsea and Love Island offer escapism, as contoured characters with an endless supply of box-fresh clothes serve up an antidote to the bleakness of austerity Britain \u2013 a far cry from the kitchen-sink drama aesthetics and everyday grind of soaps. Meanwhile, home-grown 9pm dramas that compete for the same terrestrial audience as soaps are strong ratings winners, whether that\u2019s Killing Eve, Peaky Blinders or Line of Duty. These shows offer production values, name actors and time and space to tell their stories that soaps, with their weekly churn, would never be afforded. And high-quality reality TV shows with big budgets are even stronger. This year\u2019s I\u2019m a Celebrity... lineup pulled in 12 million viewers, and Strictly continues to thrive as event TV. Soaps are trying desperately to compete with watercooler TV: take EastEnders\u2019 30th-anniversary live week, or Hollyoaks\u2019 exploration of far-right extremism. Still, EastEnders starts 2020 with enough intrigue to propel it towards its 35th anniversary. As much as people complain about it, they\u2019d miss it if it was gone. Like all soaps, perhaps it\u2019s just finding its place in a changing TV landscape. HV",

In form and in looping, oblique and fragmentary content, it\u2019s a journal kept by the 30-year old narrator while her boyfriend, Jon\u00e1s, is across the Atlantic in Spain. Just before they got together, Jon\u00e1s\u2019s Madrid-born mother had died; this trip is a family pilgrimage of sorts. She wonders if their love might be his way of coping with grief, then if she should have made more space for that grief in their lives: \u201cJon\u00e1s has a photo of his mother in the study we share \u2026 Jon\u00e1s wanted to put it in the bedroom, and I suggested putting it in the study. \u201cHelp me choose a place for it in the study,\u201d Jon\u00e1s said.\u201d Now I wonder if we should have put the photo of his mother in the bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>The apartment they share is a small one in Mexico City, with paper-thin walls, but their bed, \u201cthe site of domestic ambivalence\u201d, is compared to the famous bed of Penelope and Odysseus, carved from a living tree. In a delicious stroke of self-irony, she names their cat Telemachus. The notebook is her equivalent of Penelope\u2019s loom; in it she weaves and unravels ideas until Jon\u00e1s\u2019s return, getting all her news of the outside world and her music through the wall from her neighbour\u2019s TV and stereo. \u201cWait.

As international cooperation declined, and nationalist agendas gathered strength, China, the US, Russia and Europe, and their respective allies, emulators and proxies, engaged in often dangerous competition.</p> <p>The Chinese communist regime\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour at home and abroad, reflecting the authoritarian outlook of its paramount leader-for-life, Xi Jinping, produced head-on collisions with western countries, notably over Hong Kong, trade, technology and the repression of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang.</p> <p>When the US and Britain objected to the abusive treatment of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, they were told to mind their own business.

With damaging US economic and financial sanctions, plus a global oil embargo still in place, and with Iran experiencing unprecedented levels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/01/iran-fuel-protest-crackdowns-revealed-on-social-media\" title=\"\">violent domestic political unrest</a>, the potential for explosive conflict in 2020 was high.</p> <p>In north-east Syria, Trump dismayed European allies while delighting Russia and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad by ordering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/trump-us-troops-northern-syria-turkish-assault-kurds]%0D\" title=\"\">withdrawal of US troops</a>.

In Idlib, the last populated province not under Assad\u2019s control, hundreds of civilians and aid workers were killed by Russian and Syrian forces while hundreds of thousands were displaced.</p> <p>The lack of joined-up western policy in the Middle East, and clashing US-Europe interests, were on disastrous show in Israel, where Trump took a series of unilateral steps. The US recognised Israel\u2019s sovereignty over Jerusalem and the captured Golan Heights, and claimed Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/us-israeli-settlements-no-longer-considered-illegal-palestinian-land-mike-pompeo\" title=\"\">were legal</a>.</p> <p>Under Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing leadership, Israel mounted repeated military attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, maintained the blockade of Hamas-led Gaza, and aligned with autocratic, US-allied regimes in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Instability deepened as Netanyahu failed to win successive elections and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/23/netanyahu-bibi-trump-pact-wrecked-prospects-regional-peace\" title=\"\">charged with corruption</a>. A third poll looms.</p> <p>The Syrian fiasco cast additional doubt on Nato\u2019s cohesion. Turkey further defied its allies by buying a Russian missile system. Trump continued to denigrate the alliance and flounced out of a fractious summit in London after fellow leaders mocked him. Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, who favours stronger EU defence, said Nato was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead\" title=\"\">brain dead</a>\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Russia meddles</strong></h2> <p>If the aim of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, is to divide and weaken the western democracies, 2019 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/27/simon-tisdall-putin-xi-bosom-friends-china-russia-trump-asia\" title=\"\">a golden year</a>. Russia\u2019s Middle East leverage rose sharply, notably in Turkey, Syria and Libya. Collaboration with China expanded.

The impeachment process starkly exposed divisions ahead of a 2020 presidential battle that promises to be uncommonly destructive.</p> <p>America\u2019s neuroses seemed to radiate outwards. Trump\u2019s attempts to stem the flow of migrants turned the US-Mexico border into an armed camp where shocking human rights abuses abounded.

      "bodyText": "A year of high anxiety was rendered more alarming by intensifying clashes of interest between world powers. As international cooperation declined, and nationalist agendas gathered strength, China, the US, Russia and Europe, and their respective allies, emulators and proxies, engaged in often dangerous competition. The Chinese communist regime\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour at home and abroad, reflecting the authoritarian outlook of its paramount leader-for-life, Xi Jinping, produced head-on collisions with western countries, notably over Hong Kong, trade, technology and the repression of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. When the US and Britain objected to the abusive treatment of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, they were told to mind their own business. Sweeping opposition victories in local elections delivered a stern rebuke to Beijing, which it ignored. After six months of unrest, neither side seemed ready to back down. The unauthorised release to western media of hundreds of internal party documents exposed a ruthless government policy to indoctrinate up to 1 million Uighurs illegally held in concentration camp-like detention centres. China claimed to be fighting Islamist terrorism. Xi also attracted strong criticism over his signature Belt and Road global investment and infrastructure initiative, which Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, called a debt trap for the unwary. His alarm reflected fears over declining US leverage in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Europe. This decline was further illustrated by China\u2019s mostly successful efforts to extend its sway in the South Pacific and the East and South China seas. \u201cFreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by western navies frayed tempers. Enhanced US diplomatic support and weapons sales to Taiwan, and Beijing\u2019s reported covert efforts to subvert its \u201crenegade province\u2019s\u201d presidential election next month, also fuelled tensions. In a defence white paper, China stressed its peaceful intentions but also its \u201ccombat readiness\u201d and region-wide war-fighting capabilities. Before seeming to agree a trade deal in mid-December, Donald Trump escalated US-China rivalries on another front, imposing swingeing tariffs on imports and ostracising Huawei, the state-backed telecoms company. China retaliated in kind even as national economic growth slowed. The result was increased market volatility, bad blood and fears of another global economic crash. Trump\u2019s confrontational and chaotic policies caused problems around the world. After prematurely boasting he had eliminated the North Korean nuclear threat, he failed to nail down a substantive agreement. The latter half of the year saw renewed weapons tests by Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime, which set a 31 December deadline for progress. Chaos reigns in the Middle East In the Middle East, confusion reigned as Trump pushed Iran to the brink of war, then pulled back. With damaging US economic and financial sanctions, plus a global oil embargo still in place, and with Iran experiencing unprecedented levels of violent domestic political unrest, the potential for explosive conflict in 2020 was high. In north-east Syria, Trump dismayed European allies while delighting Russia and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad by ordering the withdrawal of US troops. His decision gave the green light to a Turkish invasion that targeted the west\u2019s Kurdish allies in the fight against Isis. In Idlib, the last populated province not under Assad\u2019s control, hundreds of civilians and aid workers were killed by Russian and Syrian forces while hundreds of thousands were displaced. The lack of joined-up western policy in the Middle East, and clashing US-Europe interests, were on disastrous show in Israel, where Trump took a series of unilateral steps. The US recognised Israel\u2019s sovereignty over Jerusalem and the captured Golan Heights, and claimed Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories were legal. Under Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing leadership, Israel mounted repeated military attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, maintained the blockade of Hamas-led Gaza, and aligned with autocratic, US-allied regimes in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Instability deepened as Netanyahu failed to win successive elections and was charged with corruption. A third poll looms. The Syrian fiasco cast additional doubt on Nato\u2019s cohesion. Turkey further defied its allies by buying a Russian missile system. Trump continued to denigrate the alliance and flounced out of a fractious summit in London after fellow leaders mocked him. Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, who favours stronger EU defence, said Nato was \u201cbrain dead\u201d. Russia meddles If the aim of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, is to divide and weaken the western democracies, 2019 was a golden year. Russia\u2019s Middle East leverage rose sharply, notably in Turkey, Syria and Libya. Collaboration with China expanded. Moscow\u2019s disruptive hybrid warfare and online disinformation campaigns roiled Britain, eastern Europe and the Balkans. In the US, the Mueller report and the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions in Ukraine exposed both Russia\u2019s hidden hand and the skill with which Putin has outmanoeuvred US intelligence agencies, hoodwinked Republicans, and made a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d out of Trump. The impeachment process starkly exposed divisions ahead of a 2020 presidential battle that promises to be uncommonly destructive. America\u2019s neuroses seemed to radiate outwards. Trump\u2019s attempts to stem the flow of migrants turned the US-Mexico border into an armed camp where shocking human rights abuses abounded. His closed door policy, plus US aid cuts, aggravated economic and security problems in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. South America erupts Further south, a ham-fisted US bid to unseat Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro nearly turned a crisis into a catastrophe. Bolivia\u2019s long-serving leftwing president Evo Morales tried his hand at election-rigging and was ousted \u2013 an outcome that, for once, was not Trump\u2019s fault. In Brazil, rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro became president in January and quickly established himself as a global bogeyman \u2013 principally over attempts to exploit the Amazon rainforest by burning it down. In Canada, prime minister Justin Trudeau was his own worst enemy, narrowly winning re-election despite the so-called blackface scandal. It proved another bad year for the rule of international law, multilateral cooperation, human rights and peace-making. The geopolitical paralysis of the UN security council over issues such as Syria, Israel-Palestine, Ukraine-Crimea, and Libya, usually pitting the US and Europe against China and Russia \u2013 and sometimes Europe against the US \u2013 mostly continued unchecked. Efforts to end the Yemen conflict achieved little. The same was true in Afghanistan, where it emerged that Nato and Afghan government forces were killing more civilians than the Taliban. Myanmar rejected claims in The Hague that it committed genocide against Rohingya Muslims. International treaties fared no better. Following his rejection last year of the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, Trump formally reneged on the Paris climate accord. The US also quit the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty and signalled it would not renew the New Start strategic nuclear arms treaty that expires in 2021. Trump announced $500bn in additional spending on nuclear weapons systems \u2013 thereby speeding up a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, which both updated or expanded their arsenals. The White House backed Saudi efforts to build nuclear power plants without the usual safeguards. Critics said this could open the way to Riyadh acquiring a nuclear bomb \u2013 and provoke other countries to follow suit. The weakening of the rules-based global order had extraterrestrial impact. Trump unveiled a revamped Space Command tasked with asserting US dominance in space \u2013 which he dubbed \u201cthe next war-fighting domain\u201d. The move, ostensibly to defend intelligence satellites, ignored the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says space belongs to everyone. Terror strikes While the number of terrorist attacks in 2019 followed the downward trend of previous years, there were some horrific incidents. In New Zealand, an Australian white supremacist killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch. Weeks later, 257 people died in reportedly retaliatory Easter Day church attacks by Islamists in Sri Lanka. In London, two people died in the London Bridge attack in November. Despite recent defeats, Muslim jihadist organisations such as Isis, al-Qaida and Boko Haram were said to be regrouping. A sharp rise in racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks by white nationalists and other bigots caused deep concern in the US, Britain and Europe. Elsewhere in the world, tensions in Indian-administered Kashmir reignited after Narendra Modi, India\u2019s nationalist leader, imposed direct rule from Delhi. South Africa and Zimbabwe saw persistent unrest over economic hardship, misgovernance and human rights abuses. Old enemies Japan and South Korea spent much of the year arguing. In Lebanon, sectarian clashes raised a spectre of renewed civil war. France plunged into a \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d over public-sector reforms.

      "body": "<p>It was a year of high anxiety \u2013 but unlike the Mel Brooks movie of that name, there was not a lot to laugh about. Nerves were frayed by worries about a Middle East conflagration, the destructive antics of a narcissistic US president and an accelerating climate emergency.</p> <p>Too many rulers forgot their job was to serve the ruled, not kill, repress, rob or bamboozle them. The idea of multilateral cooperation and international law took another beating. Division, separation and isolation were recurring themes in a global landscape scarred by fear.</p> <p>Yet there were sparks of hope and positive energy. Many countries saw large-scale popular protests against corrupt, undemocratic regimes, some of which were toppled. Elsewhere, voter revolts shattered the complacency of \u201cmainstream\u201d parties, unsettling entrenched elites.</p> <p>Younger people fiercely challenged the toxic generational legacy of inequality, debt and pollution. A 16-year-old Swede, Greta Thunberg, emerged as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/26/greta-thunberg-teenager-on-a-global-mission-to-make-a-difference\" title=\"\">an inspirational leader</a>, travelling by sea to the UN in New York to confront world leaders. Extinction Rebellion emerged as controversial shock troops of a hoped-for green revolution.</p> <p>But in poorer countries, life chances were again limited by a basic lack of security; safe food and water; education; jobs; civil, religious and gender rights, and freedom to travel. These handicaps were chronically disempowering, precluding meaningful political and social advances.</p> <p>In a year when The Scream, Edvard Munch\u2019s unnerving masterpiece, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/09/scream-edvard-munch-love-and-angst-review-british-museum\" title=\"\">went on show in Brexit-stricken Britain</a>, there were reasons to be cheerful and plenty more to be fearful. For many people, 2019 was a year of jarring uncertainty \u2013 12 months spent living on edge.</p> <p>The Danes raised what was perhaps the biggest cheer of the year when they bluntly told Donald Trump where he could put his importunate bid to \u201cbuy\u201d Greenland. The US president reacted by cancelling a long-planned state visit to Copenhagen in a fit of pique, thereby saving Queen Margrethe the bother of pretending he was welcome.</p> <p>The Greenland imbroglio shone a timely light on alarming US, Russian and Chinese plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/trump-greenland-gambit-sad-sign-arctic-up-for-grabs\" title=\"\">exploit the resource-rich Arctic region</a> with scant regard for the environmental impact. After US officials objected to any mention of the climate emergency, an Arctic Council summit ended in disarray. But indigenous communities and supporters pushed back.</p> <h2><strong>Europe survives the flames</strong></h2> <p>France experienced what some believed was a miraculous national reprieve in April when the roof and spire of Notre Dame cathedral caught fire. As president Emmanuel Macron and most of Paris looked on aghast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/19/notre-dame-fire-cause-may-have-been-electrical-official\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/19/notre-dame-fire-cause-may-have-been-electrical-official\" title=\"\">famous old building appeared doomed</a>.

Immigration proved a less inflammatory issue than expected.</p> <p>What the voting showed instead was increased dissatisfaction with politics as usual, with support shifting from traditional, centrist parties of left and right to smaller parties such as the Greens. Hardline groups such as France\u2019s National Rally (National Front) and Germany\u2019s AfD did well. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/27/european-elections-far-right-surge-ends-in-a-ripple\" title=\"\">there was no breakthrough</a>.</p> <p>Political developments in Italy provided further encouragement for European progressives after Matteo Salvini, fire-breathing leader of the far-right nationalist League, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/italy-democratic-party-ready-form-government-m5s\" title=\"\">out-manoeuvred by coalition rivals</a>. Salvini lost his post as interior minister, where he had wrought havoc with the EU\u2019s policy on migrants.</p> <p>The possibly temporary eclipse of Salvini, touted as a future leader of a hypothetical united front linking far-right groups from Poland to the Netherlands, had EU-wide significance. That ugly scheme is on ice for now. Awareness of racism and sexism in sports such as football grew, and tolerance for it diminished, at least in theory. In Finland, a Social Democrat, Sanna Marin, 34, became the world\u2019s youngest serving prime minister.</p> <h2><strong>America resists Trump</strong></h2> <p>In the US, Donald Trump dominated the headlines for much of the year, using the White House bully pulpit to position himself for a 2020 re-election bid. Ranged against him was a politically diverse group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\" title=\"\">Democratic presidential hopefuls</a>, including the left-leaning Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, moderate centrist Joe Biden and the surprise Iowa front-runner, Pete Buttigieg.</p> <p>Many Americans continued to support Trump \u2013 his average approval rating hovered around 41% \u2013 but this figure was low, historically speaking, feeding optimism he could be beaten. Trump again proved his own worst enemy with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/28/trump-white-nationalism-synagogue-shooting\" title=\"\">inept and offensive responses</a> to a series of mass shooting incidents, extreme weather events and renewed accusations that he had sexually abused women.</p> <p>Federal courts intervened to stay Trump\u2019s bid to deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, known as the Dreamers, who arrived in the US as children. He also attracted criticism for the mass detention of Central American asylum-seekers on the US-Mexico border. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1567be61968d97198069c071e9d84891afc4c819\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1567be61968d97198069c071e9d84891afc4c819/0_38_4023_2415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in San Francisco play their part in a national impeachment rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in San Francisco play their part in a national impeachment rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Pacheco/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the most serious damage was inflicted in Washington. First came the highly critical, albeit inconclusive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/mueller-trump-indict-president\" title=\"\">report by Robert Mueller</a> into an alleged Trump campaign conspiracy with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Mueller refused to exonerate Trump and later testified the president had told untruths to his investigation.</p> <p>Then came Trump\u2019s December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/trump-impeachment-house-vote-nancy-pelosi-latest\">impeachment in the House of Representatives</a>, sparked by an anonymous whistleblower and witnesses who suggested Trump tried to induce a foreign state, Ukraine, to help smear Biden, a potential re-election rival. House Democrats advanced articles of impeachment alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. With the public divided and the Senate unlikely to convict, it remains unclear how badly Trump has been hurt.</p> <p>The year was encouraging for what did not happen, as well as what did. Having reneged on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to the dismay of its European partners, the US re-imposed and escalated sanctions on Tehran, including a worldwide oil embargo.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/oil-tankers-blasts-reports-gulf-of-oman-us-navy\" title=\"\">ships and an oilfield were attacked in the Gulf</a>, Washington and Saudi Arabia blamed Iranian forces. But predictions of war between Iran and its tormentors proved premature after Trump called off a retaliatory military strike with minutes to go.</p> <p>And there was an added bonus \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/10/trump-fires-john-bolton-national-security-adviser\" title=\"\">sacking of John Bolton</a>, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, whose belligerent views influenced Trump\u2019s confrontational approach. Ironically, it was Bolton\u2019s opposition to Trump\u2019s irresponsible on-off Afghanistan peace deal that proved his final undoing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The calling off of a US strike on Iran came with a bonus \u2013 the sacking of national security adviser John Bolton</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In east Asia, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/north-korea-breaks-off-nuclear-talks-blaming-us-teams-old-attitude\" title=\"\">breakdown in negotiations</a> between the US and North Korea over American demands that Pyongyang eliminate its nuclear weapons raised concerns about a war drawing in Japan, South Korea and China.

      "bodyText": "It was a year of high anxiety \u2013 but unlike the Mel Brooks movie of that name, there was not a lot to laugh about. Nerves were frayed by worries about a Middle East conflagration, the destructive antics of a narcissistic US president and an accelerating climate emergency. Too many rulers forgot their job was to serve the ruled, not kill, repress, rob or bamboozle them. The idea of multilateral cooperation and international law took another beating. Division, separation and isolation were recurring themes in a global landscape scarred by fear. Yet there were sparks of hope and positive energy. Many countries saw large-scale popular protests against corrupt, undemocratic regimes, some of which were toppled. Elsewhere, voter revolts shattered the complacency of \u201cmainstream\u201d parties, unsettling entrenched elites. Younger people fiercely challenged the toxic generational legacy of inequality, debt and pollution. A 16-year-old Swede, Greta Thunberg, emerged as an inspirational leader, travelling by sea to the UN in New York to confront world leaders. Extinction Rebellion emerged as controversial shock troops of a hoped-for green revolution. But in poorer countries, life chances were again limited by a basic lack of security; safe food and water; education; jobs; civil, religious and gender rights, and freedom to travel. These handicaps were chronically disempowering, precluding meaningful political and social advances. In a year when The Scream, Edvard Munch\u2019s unnerving masterpiece, went on show in Brexit-stricken Britain, there were reasons to be cheerful and plenty more to be fearful. For many people, 2019 was a year of jarring uncertainty \u2013 12 months spent living on edge. The Danes raised what was perhaps the biggest cheer of the year when they bluntly told Donald Trump where he could put his importunate bid to \u201cbuy\u201d Greenland. The US president reacted by cancelling a long-planned state visit to Copenhagen in a fit of pique, thereby saving Queen Margrethe the bother of pretending he was welcome. The Greenland imbroglio shone a timely light on alarming US, Russian and Chinese plans to exploit the resource-rich Arctic region with scant regard for the environmental impact. After US officials objected to any mention of the climate emergency, an Arctic Council summit ended in disarray. But indigenous communities and supporters pushed back. Europe survives the flames France experienced what some believed was a miraculous national reprieve in April when the roof and spire of Notre Dame cathedral caught fire. As president Emmanuel Macron and most of Paris looked on aghast, the famous old building appeared doomed. But firefighters, helped by an almighty slice of good luck, saved most of the medieval structure. Europe as a whole survived another symbolic conflagration when a predicted surge in backing for far-right populist, xenophobic and ultra-nationalist parties mostly failed to materialise in elections for the European parliament in 28 countries. Immigration proved a less inflammatory issue than expected. What the voting showed instead was increased dissatisfaction with politics as usual, with support shifting from traditional, centrist parties of left and right to smaller parties such as the Greens. Hardline groups such as France\u2019s National Rally (National Front) and Germany\u2019s AfD did well. But there was no breakthrough. Political developments in Italy provided further encouragement for European progressives after Matteo Salvini, fire-breathing leader of the far-right nationalist League, was out-manoeuvred by coalition rivals. Salvini lost his post as interior minister, where he had wrought havoc with the EU\u2019s policy on migrants. The possibly temporary eclipse of Salvini, touted as a future leader of a hypothetical united front linking far-right groups from Poland to the Netherlands, had EU-wide significance. That ugly scheme is on ice for now. Awareness of racism and sexism in sports such as football grew, and tolerance for it diminished, at least in theory. In Finland, a Social Democrat, Sanna Marin, 34, became the world\u2019s youngest serving prime minister. America resists Trump In the US, Donald Trump dominated the headlines for much of the year, using the White House bully pulpit to position himself for a 2020 re-election bid. Ranged against him was a politically diverse group of Democratic presidential hopefuls, including the left-leaning Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, moderate centrist Joe Biden and the surprise Iowa front-runner, Pete Buttigieg. Many Americans continued to support Trump \u2013 his average approval rating hovered around 41% \u2013 but this figure was low, historically speaking, feeding optimism he could be beaten. Trump again proved his own worst enemy with inept and offensive responses to a series of mass shooting incidents, extreme weather events and renewed accusations that he had sexually abused women. Federal courts intervened to stay Trump\u2019s bid to deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, known as the Dreamers, who arrived in the US as children. He also attracted criticism for the mass detention of Central American asylum-seekers on the US-Mexico border. But the most serious damage was inflicted in Washington. First came the highly critical, albeit inconclusive, report by Robert Mueller into an alleged Trump campaign conspiracy with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Mueller refused to exonerate Trump and later testified the president had told untruths to his investigation. Then came Trump\u2019s December impeachment in the House of Representatives, sparked by an anonymous whistleblower and witnesses who suggested Trump tried to induce a foreign state, Ukraine, to help smear Biden, a potential re-election rival. House Democrats advanced articles of impeachment alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. With the public divided and the Senate unlikely to convict, it remains unclear how badly Trump has been hurt. The year was encouraging for what did not happen, as well as what did. Having reneged on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to the dismay of its European partners, the US re-imposed and escalated sanctions on Tehran, including a worldwide oil embargo. When ships and an oilfield were attacked in the Gulf, Washington and Saudi Arabia blamed Iranian forces. But predictions of war between Iran and its tormentors proved premature after Trump called off a retaliatory military strike with minutes to go. And there was an added bonus \u2013 the sacking of John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, whose belligerent views influenced Trump\u2019s confrontational approach. Ironically, it was Bolton\u2019s opposition to Trump\u2019s irresponsible on-off Afghanistan peace deal that proved his final undoing. In east Asia, a breakdown in negotiations between the US and North Korea over American demands that Pyongyang eliminate its nuclear weapons raised concerns about a war drawing in Japan, South Korea and China. But Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s dictator, offered a temporary reprieve by suspending atomic bomb and long-range missile tests. A new crisis was brewing by year\u2019s end. Happily, the dread prospect of nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan was also avoided. After Indian troops died in a suicide bombing blamed on Pakistan-backed militants, Indian fighter jets crossed the line of control into Pakistan-administered Kashmir in March. Sporadic clashes ensued \u2013 but calm was eventually restored. The people stand up In Syria, the so-called caliphate declared by Islamic State (Isis) terrorists in 2014 was finally destroyed with the fall in February of Baghuz, their last stronghold. In October, the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a raid by US special forces, assisted by the Kurds. The year saw an overall reduction in Isis terror attacks. A growing intolerance among ordinary citizens for corrupt, oppressive and incompetent rulers around the world was another encouraging feature of 2019. But the unrest also highlighted two negative trends: the willingness of governments to use extreme force to keep control, as seen in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and Hong Kong and the frailty of democratic institutions when subverted by the powerful. Younger generations were in the forefront of protests in Chile, Peru, Haiti, Venezuela, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Tunisia and elsewhere that primarily focused on economic inequalities and political malfeasance. Some brought decisive change. Amid joyful celebrations, the people of Sudan succeeded in ousting the country\u2019s longtime dictator, Omar al-Bashir, and cutting a power-sharing deal with the army and the feared Janjaweed militia. In Algeria, another veteran president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, was toppled, although the ruling elite clung on. Even Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s modern sultan, had his wings clipped when his Truth and Justice party lost prestigious mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara. In Lebanon, the prime minister, Saad Hariri \u2013 seen as a symbol of the country\u2019s self-serving, wealthy elite \u2013 was forced to resign. Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, promised to stand down as investigators, newly energised by European pressure, appeared to close in on the killers of the investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia. And from east Africa came a story that typified how pockets of genuine light continue to permeate the gloom. Ethiopia, whose recent history has been marred by famine and conflict, provided one of the year\u2019s best \u201cgood news\u201d stories.

This is a massive chunk of my life, but it\u2019s addictive and I want to do it for ever.\u201d Fletcher was the first expert the show signed on, although he initially thought the email from the production company was a scam and almost deleted it. If Fletcher is the kindly patriarch, Will Kirk is the heart-throb \u2013 (naturally, Google\u2019s first suggested search result for his name is \u201cWill Kirk partner\u201d). The team are in the midst of repairs for the show\u2019s Christmas special and the pressure is on for Kirk, the carpentry specialist. \u201cWe put a bit of our soul into every item,\u201d he says, \u201cso much so that it\u2019s hard to let go. As you\u2019re talking now, in the back of my mind I\u2019m thinking about gluing and drying times.\u201d Is there anything they couldn\u2019t fix? \u201cNo, we can fix anything \u2013 except for a broken heart. Or Brexit.\u201d The Christmas heart-crusher will surely be 88-year-old Beryl and her teddy bear, which she was given in 1939. She gave it to her firstborn, who in turn passed it on to his baby brother. When he died of cancer this year, the family found the bear among his possessions. \u201cTeddy bears are one of the constants in people\u2019s lives,\u201d says bear repairer Middleditch. \u201cThey stay with you no matter how much you change \u2013 they haven\u2019t gotten angry or sad, so they\u2019ve stood the test of time.\u201d Blades has been through hardships of his own, too. \u201cWhen I was brought up, there weren\u2019t many positive role models,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d never see someone like me on the BBC. I was homeless only four years ago after my marriage broke down \u2013 so this is something special, and it\u2019s totally surreal. Someone just this morning wanted to take a selfie with me when I was in my trunks about to go swimming \u2013 I\u2019ll never get used to that.\u201d Ceramicist Kirsten Ramsay mentions another positive: The Repair Shop is encouraging younger fans to take up a craft. \u201cThe show cuts right across the generations,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have groups of school kids telling us how much they\u2019d love to do our work. That\u2019s so inspiring to me \u2013 that the next generation want to look after what they have, rather than just throw it away.\u201d Blades sees the show as a metaphor for society. \u201cThe Repair Shop is so brilliant because we\u2019re saying: \u2018Look at this community \u2013 we come together, we have a problem and we fix it.\u2019\u201d The sewing machine he has been working on whirs back to life and he gives me a jovial slap on the back. \u201cNow, how beautiful is that?\u201d \u2022 The Repair Shop at Christmas is on BBC One on 29 December at 7pm",

      "body": "<p>Watching the lottery on television these days may bring the minimal chance of becoming a multimillionaire, but for American men born between 1944 and 1950, the numbers that were nationally broadcast either quickened or distanced the possibility of violent death. The order in which eligible males would be conscripted to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/the-vietnam-war-review-a-complex-story-made-immediately-comprehensible\" title=\"\"> fight in the Vietnam war </a>was decided by random picking of capsules containing all 366 possible birthdays (the army had spotted the loophole through which leap year men might have escaped).</p> <p>In the bravura opening scene of Richard Russo\u2019s ninth novel, three 19-year-olds at a Connecticut arts college watch a tiny black-and-white TV in December 1969, as the first draft ballot unfolds. What steady Lincoln Moser, arty Teddy Novak and rock music-obsessed Mickey Girardi see will shape their fates.</p> <p>Readers know from the outset that none of the trio died in \u2019Nam, as the lottery scene is a flashback from the summer of 2015, when the men, now 66 and burdened with medical and financial urgencies, reunite for a weekend at a Cape Cod holiday home belonging to Lincoln\u2019s family.</p> <p>Their survival, though, is the point. Russo, born in 1949, dedicates this book to all those listed on the Vietnam Veterans memorial, and the story feels informed by a strong sense of fortune in having his name on dust-jackets rather than the long granite wall of mourning in Washington DC. The heroes\u2019 professions of real estate, academic publishing and sound engineering \u2013 sketched in with small but resonant details \u2013 might be thought boring in ordinary times, but for their generation represent a glorious escape. Russo\u2019s subject is the guilt and responsibility of having fallen on the better side of fate.</p> <p>From its title (taken from a 1950s hit single by Johnny Mathis) through recurrent references to \u201cluck\u201d, <em>Chances Are</em> examines the balance between decision and destiny, choice and providence. Lincoln, Teddy and Mickey went to their college because they failed to get the grades for fancier campuses, and became friends when they all happened to take jobs as waiters at a snooty sorority house.</p> <p>While students they also all have the bad luck to be drawn to the same young woman, Jacy Calloway. Her tragic misfortune is to go missing, in 1971, during a summer weekend at the Martha\u2019s Vineyard house with the three buddies, each of whom hopes to have a chance with her.</p> <p>Russo is known for novels about babyboomer blue-collar men, such as 1993\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/14/top10s.comic.novels\" title=\"\"><em>Nobody\u2019s Fool</em> </a>and the Pulitzer prize-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/09/news.pulitzerprize\" title=\"\"><em>Empire Falls</em> </a>in 2001. His stories are omnisciently narrated in a tone of sardonic understanding of human folly, which places him in the house of American style on a polished mezzanine between the poetic complexity of John Updike and the gentler observation of Anne Tyler. The smart, fast chat among his characters, meanwhile, reflects Russo\u2019s parallel career as a screenwriter.</p> <p>The central presence of a police chief in 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/18/interview-with-a-bookstore-bunch-of-grapes-in-marthas-vineyard\" title=\"\"><em>Everybody\u2019s Fool</em></a>, which 23 years after <em>Nobody\u2019s Fool </em>was also the author\u2019s first formal sequel, suggested an engagement with fiction publishing\u2019s hungry demand for sequences and suspense. In featuring the cold case of Jacy\u2019s disappearance, <em>Chances Are</em> includes an antagonist of the sort known, since Gillian Flynn\u2019s 2012 super-seller, as a \u201cgone girl\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Watching the lottery on television these days may bring the minimal chance of becoming a multimillionaire, but for American men born between 1944 and 1950, the numbers that were nationally broadcast either quickened or distanced the possibility of violent death. The order in which eligible males would be conscripted to fight in the Vietnam war was decided by random picking of capsules containing all 366 possible birthdays (the army had spotted the loophole through which leap year men might have escaped). In the bravura opening scene of Richard Russo\u2019s ninth novel, three 19-year-olds at a Connecticut arts college watch a tiny black-and-white TV in December 1969, as the first draft ballot unfolds. What steady Lincoln Moser, arty Teddy Novak and rock music-obsessed Mickey Girardi see will shape their fates. Readers know from the outset that none of the trio died in \u2019Nam, as the lottery scene is a flashback from the summer of 2015, when the men, now 66 and burdened with medical and financial urgencies, reunite for a weekend at a Cape Cod holiday home belonging to Lincoln\u2019s family. Their survival, though, is the point. Russo, born in 1949, dedicates this book to all those listed on the Vietnam Veterans memorial, and the story feels informed by a strong sense of fortune in having his name on dust-jackets rather than the long granite wall of mourning in Washington DC. The heroes\u2019 professions of real estate, academic publishing and sound engineering \u2013 sketched in with small but resonant details \u2013 might be thought boring in ordinary times, but for their generation represent a glorious escape. Russo\u2019s subject is the guilt and responsibility of having fallen on the better side of fate. From its title (taken from a 1950s hit single by Johnny Mathis) through recurrent references to \u201cluck\u201d, Chances Are examines the balance between decision and destiny, choice and providence. Lincoln, Teddy and Mickey went to their college because they failed to get the grades for fancier campuses, and became friends when they all happened to take jobs as waiters at a snooty sorority house. While students they also all have the bad luck to be drawn to the same young woman, Jacy Calloway. Her tragic misfortune is to go missing, in 1971, during a summer weekend at the Martha\u2019s Vineyard house with the three buddies, each of whom hopes to have a chance with her. Russo is known for novels about babyboomer blue-collar men, such as 1993\u2019s Nobody\u2019s Fool and the Pulitzer prize-winning Empire Falls in 2001. His stories are omnisciently narrated in a tone of sardonic understanding of human folly, which places him in the house of American style on a polished mezzanine between the poetic complexity of John Updike and the gentler observation of Anne Tyler. The smart, fast chat among his characters, meanwhile, reflects Russo\u2019s parallel career as a screenwriter. The central presence of a police chief in 2016\u2019s Everybody\u2019s Fool, which 23 years after Nobody\u2019s Fool was also the author\u2019s first formal sequel, suggested an engagement with fiction publishing\u2019s hungry demand for sequences and suspense. In featuring the cold case of Jacy\u2019s disappearance, Chances Are includes an antagonist of the sort known, since Gillian Flynn\u2019s 2012 super-seller, as a \u201cgone girl\u201d. Following the rules of the genre, by page 60 Russo introduces a juicy suspect who is surely too obvious to be the perpetrator, and also deftly accommodates a retired detective, a mysterious postcard and an ominous reference to the island\u2019s landfill site. However, around the shivers and guilts of a missing person story, Russo ultimately remains loyal to his previous mission to represent realistically the textures of average lives. The impeccably delayed revelation of what happened to Jacy is satisfying, but more Russo than Ian Rankin. The gone girl turns out to have been caught in the novel\u2019s twin undercurrents of Vietnam and the hands people are dealt: she has been very unlucky, but in a way that few will guess. Though the solutions lie in the 1969 and 1971 insets, the main time frame of September 2015 is politically timely.

Thereafter David Warner (43) grew into his innings before a beauty from Neil Wagner was rewarded by an even better catch from Tim Southee at second slip. </p> <p>The contest was evenly poised at lunch and continued to remain in the balance at tea, thanks largely to Colin de Grandhomme, who bowled superbly in the afternoon session for the reward of Marnus Labuschagne (63), bowled off his elbow attempting to leave a delivery outside his off stump. That was a rare moment of misfortune for Australia on a day when edge after edge missed the field or died short of a catcher, not to mention a couple of borderline LBW appeals going their way and a few run-out opportunities going begging. </p> <p>But true to form the Kiwis never gave up and deserved more than just the wicket of Matthew Wade (38) in the final session. Unfortunately for them Steve Smith was one of the batsmen they were trying to dismiss, and after a lean start to the summer the run-machine ticked beyond 7,000 in his career to end the day unbeaten on 77 and looking back to the man who tormented England over the winter.</p> <p>Credit has to go to the MCG groundstaff for preparing a surface that allowed the ball to move in the air and off the seam throughout the day, keeping the batsmen honest, and ensuring long spells of compelling cricket. The pitch slowed considerably as the day wore on and it remains to be seen if it dies completely following its next meeting with the heavy roller.</p> <p>To find out how it plays, and if Australia can turn their early ascendancy into a stranglehold, join Adam Collins and I back here tomorrow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f4b17b1758662e87433744243b421001655975d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4b17b1758662e87433744243b421001655975d/0_0_2986_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Smith held Australia\u2019s first-innings together on day one of the Boxing Day Test against New Zealand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T07:13:35.057Z\">at 7.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e045a2b8f08c397226406fc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T06:59:29.415Z\">6.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Close on day 1: Australia 257-4</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australia take the honours after an absorbing day of Test cricket. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e04594e8f08c397226406f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-26T06:58:47.643Z\">6.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90th over: Australia 257-4 (Smith 77, Head 25) </strong>The day ends exactly as it deserved to, with New Zealand engineering an edge that fails to go to hand and runs away for four.

Not too dissimilar to the middle session at Perth on day one, they have dried the runs up again, Australia adding just 13 over the last 10 overs and one single across the last 27 balls.

He might not be the most fashionable fast bowler but he\u2019s changing the way the best player in the world goes about his business - an achievement in itself. He\u2019s out of the way of a conventional bouncer then <em>just</em> keeping a ball of his hip into the turf. That\u2019s well taken by Latham at short leg, not letting him off strike. He has a more unorthodox crack at the next ball aimed in that direction, making room to swivel/pull around the corner, middling it straight to the man at the 45.

But it isn\u2019t on target. Could he had thrown to Southee instead, with sufficient time to take the bails? Quite possibly. Either way, with a ton in each of his three Tests this summer - pretty much chanceless until the second dig at Perth, where he still make it to 50 - that could hurt later today.

As a veteran of that part of the ground (which, of course, hasn\u2019t been \u2018Bay 13\u2019 since 1990), it has been a long time since it was an iconic place to engage with the players and all that. Probably when ODIs stopped bringing in bulk crowds a dozen years or so ago. But my point is that it remained a part of the \u2018G that people <em>enjoyed</em> sitting. Maybe it was history, or where people sit at the footy, or that it is a cheap place to get a ticket.

They\u2019re taking <em>another</em> look at the ball later in the over, to no avail for the tourists, who reckon it is out of shape.

Full, outside off, left by the batter. I can\u2019t remember a first ball of a test match that didn\u2019t follow that formula. I wondered, with your statistical contacts, if you could find out the likelihood of the opening ball of a test being full, outside off, left by the batter.

It\u2019s the late shift where I\u2019m coming to you from in London having tucked into a very different Boxing Day Eve. But I haven\u2019t missed many Melbourne Tests through my life, so I\u2019m very excited to be with you on the mighty OBO across the next five days. </p> <p>For the hosts, the modern history of a turgid MCG Test strip had Tim Paine talking the talk about playing five bowlers and elevating himself into the top six for the first time. That would mean a debut to one of my favourites, Michael Neser. However, with more grass than usual on the track, the XI is likely to be your more belt-and-braces variety. What\u2019s certain: James Pattinson returns. Giddy up. <br></p> <p>For the visitors, this means a lot more than the names on their teamsheet. Yes, Trent Boult is back. That\u2019s big. The Black Caps also have Tom Blundell in to open the batting after their top order misfired in Perth. But the reason why there are tens of thousands of New Zealanders in town is because today is their first appearance on this special stage for 32 years. And they\u2019ve absolutely earned it. <br></p> <p>Right, we\u2019re about 20 minutes from the toss at the \u2018G. To kick us off, one for the Kiwi fans with us today.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the match report: If your appetite for Boxing Day cricket has yet to be sated, another Test match is about to get underway - South Africa v England at Centurion. Follow all of that right here: A superb day of Test cricket ends with Australia in the box seat, but their presence there owes as much to luck as it does skill after New Zealand probed without just reward in front of 80,000 at the MCG. After winning the toss and inviting Australia to bat first in overcast conditions, New Zealand began perfectly, Trent Boult castling Joe Burns (0) with the fourth delivery of the match. Thereafter David Warner (43) grew into his innings before a beauty from Neil Wagner was rewarded by an even better catch from Tim Southee at second slip. The contest was evenly poised at lunch and continued to remain in the balance at tea, thanks largely to Colin de Grandhomme, who bowled superbly in the afternoon session for the reward of Marnus Labuschagne (63), bowled off his elbow attempting to leave a delivery outside his off stump. That was a rare moment of misfortune for Australia on a day when edge after edge missed the field or died short of a catcher, not to mention a couple of borderline LBW appeals going their way and a few run-out opportunities going begging. But true to form the Kiwis never gave up and deserved more than just the wicket of Matthew Wade (38) in the final session. Unfortunately for them Steve Smith was one of the batsmen they were trying to dismiss, and after a lean start to the summer the run-machine ticked beyond 7,000 in his career to end the day unbeaten on 77 and looking back to the man who tormented England over the winter. Credit has to go to the MCG groundstaff for preparing a surface that allowed the ball to move in the air and off the seam throughout the day, keeping the batsmen honest, and ensuring long spells of compelling cricket. The pitch slowed considerably as the day wore on and it remains to be seen if it dies completely following its next meeting with the heavy roller. To find out how it plays, and if Australia can turn their early ascendancy into a stranglehold, join Adam Collins and I back here tomorrow. Australia take the honours after an absorbing day of Test cricket. 90th over: Australia 257-4 (Smith 77, Head 25) The day ends exactly as it deserved to, with New Zealand engineering an edge that fails to go to hand and runs away for four. This time it was Southee to Head, but it has happened on numerous occasions today with most combinations of bowlers and batters. 89th over: Australia 252-4 (Smith 76, Head 21) After a couple of probing overs Boult begins his final shift of the day by allowing Head some width to free his arms and spank a four through point. There\u2019s been a hollowness to proceedings since the second new ball, New Zealand tired and weatherbeaten after a day of near misses and lacking the raw pace to rattle Australia late on. 88th over: Australia 248-4 (Smith 76, Head 17) Southee continues, now bowling to a field set for a cross-seam delivery that sticks in the pitch, more than a conventional new ball dismissal. Despite the plan, Southee does find the outside edge of Smith\u2019s bat as Plan A might have designed, but the batsman\u2019s hands were so soft the ball died well short of the cordon. Maiden. 87th over: Australia 248-4 (Smith 76, Head 17) A bit more nibble from Boult this over but Head is focussed enough to deal with it. 86th over: Australia 246-4 (Smith 76, Head 15) A very dishearteningly dull over from Southee to Smith features five nondescript dots followed by a contemptuous straight-drive for four. New Zealand are running out of puff towards the end of a day full of toil. 85th over: Australia 242-4 (Smith 72, Head 15) Boult continues, but the lack of swing on offer means his line is now just leaking across the right-handed Smith outside off stump rather than tailing back into the batsman and inducing doubt. Boult realigns by bowling from around the wicket, but that simply allows Smith to milk a single off his pads. Head, now just about in, clips a couple of his pads when he is invited to bat. Can\u2019t imagine it will be 32 years until the next trans-Tasman Boxing Day Test. 84th over: Australia 239-4 (Smith 71, Head 13) Neither Boult nor Southee have bowled with menace since the change of balls. A TV graphic indicates the amount of swing with this new ball is 1.4 (of what unit I\u2019m not sure) compared to 2.1 from earlier in the day. Even accounting for numberwang that indicates a less threatening delivery. Australia are now coasting to the close of play. 83rd over: Australia 237-4 (Smith 71, Head 11) Another over dominated by a crisply struck four from an Australian batsman playing in the V, this time Steve Smith drilling Trent Boult through long-off. The new ball still not doing what New Zealand want it to. 82nd over: Australia 233-4 (Smith 67, Head 11) Southee shares the new ball but in his quest for swing he over-pitches and Head presents the full face of the bat and collects four of the crispest runs. Southee adjust his length, and drags his line a touch wider, Head follows accordingly for a regulation play-and-miss from a right-arm over bowler to a left-hand batter. The new ball has yet to misbehave greatly either in the air or off the pitch. 81st over: Australia 229-4 (Smith 67, Head 7) Trent Boult has the new nut in his hand but 15 overs already in his legs today. He delivers four balls that keep Travis Head honest before a sharp single brings Steve Smith on strike. The final two deliveries are too wide to entice the batsman into a stroke. New Zealand need at least one more wicket today to even the ledger. They deserve at least one more. The new ball is taken immediately. 80th over: Australia 228-4 (Smith 67, Head 6) Santner\u2019s back for a token over before the new ball will be taken. How he has been used today by Williamson has been notable; the Kiwi skipper has shown little faith. Santner shows what he might have been missing by beating Smith with an unplayable delivery, the ball arcing in from around the wicket, pitching on leg stump, turning and bouncing prodigiously and beating the outside edge. Unfortunately he follows it up with a rank long-hop. 79th over: Australia 223-4 (Smith 67, Head 2) Travis Head doubles his score and does well enough riding an over of Neil Wagner deliveries arrowed at his ribcage. 78th over: Australia 222-4 (Smith 67, Head 1) Travis Head gets off the mark with a single from his 13th delivery in a de Grandhomme over that will not live long in the memory. The MCG now has that late afternoon murmur about it, although without the raucous noise of beer snakes being built and phonebooks being shredded in the now defunct Bay 13. 77th over: Australia 220-4 (Smith 66, Head 0) New Zealand resume their bodyline-lite approach to Smith and Wagner earns a bruise, if not a wicket, with the method when he gets one to climb on the batsman and strike him towards the armpit during an awkward evasive manoeuvre. Meanwhile over on Channel Seven, the host broadcaster has cut to an AFL footballer for the second time in the day. Ping Sam Perry. 76th over: Australia 219-4 (Smith 65, Head 0) Head continues to be watchful at the start of his innings, allowing CdG\u2019s hooping in-swingers to pass well outside his off stump. The South Australian has faced ten deliveries now without scoring. 75th over: Australia 218-4 (Smith 64, Head 0) Wagner\u2019s radar is off this over and he allows Head a couple of sighters by hurling down leg-side bumpers after Smith dinks a single to keep the scoreboard operators in the game. 74th over: Australia 217-4 (Smith 63, Head 0) That is the least de Grandhomme has deserved for a day-long demonstration of old-school swing bowling. And credit is due again to the MCG groundstaff for preparing a surface that has allowed the ball to move in the air and off the seam. Wade just beat his average, but he used up a lot of lives along the way. Another edge, and guess what, four more runs to Australia. Wade this time slashing hard outside off and inside-edging to fine-leg. But he\u2019s gone the next ball! De Grandhomme bowling the same teasing line, inviting another drive, this time he finds the outside edge, and this time it carries behind the wicket where Watling completes the simple dismissal. C-D-G, he\u2019s dynamite! 73rd over: Australia 212-3 (Smith 63, Wade 34) Santner\u2019s spell is again curtailed before the bowler might have expected it to be, meaning Wagner is back for his 18th over of the day. It begins with Smith driving neatly for three before Wade earns four with a guided thick edge that loops agonisingly over Taylor at first slip. Without sounding like a broken record, how have New Zealand only taken three wickets today? 72nd over: Australia 202-3 (Smith 60, Wade 27) Wade plays and misses to CdG outside off to open the 72nd over of the day. I hope someone has kept a tally of all the times the bowlers have beaten the bat today for scant reward. Wade responds to CdG\u2019s in-swing by advancing down the pitch and playing a defensive prod about two feet outside off stump. CdG then returns fire by drawing the drive and inducing a genuine edge that falls short of first slip! How unlucky have New Zealand been today!? 71st over: Australia 202-3 (Smith 60, Wade 27) Tighter from Santner, conceding just the one run. No alarms and no surprises for Australia though. 70th over: Australia 201-3 (Smith 60, Wade 26) Eeh, the pre-tea CdG turns up after a couple of nothing overs to send down a pair of massive hooping in-swingers from around the wicket that Wade struggles to deal with. But deal with them he does, and a single keeps the scoreboard ticking over. 69th over: Australia 200-3 (Smith 60, Wade 25) Speaking of Santner, Williamson has belatedly turned to his left-arm spinner for just his fifth over of the day in what is his fourth spell. That\u2019s partly a consequence of Australia targeting New Zealand\u2019s premier slow bowler, and again both batsmen rotate the strike with ease while Wade uses his feet to drive powerfully through the off-side. 68th over: Australia 194-3 (Smith 58, Wade 21) CdG has been neither as tight nor as threatening since tea, looking more like a dibbly dobbler fill-in than the medium-pace swing king of earlier in the day. Wade doesn\u2019t mind, leaning back to carve three runs through the covers. 67th over: Australia 190-3 (Smith 57, Wade 18) Boult almost cleaves Wade at his ankles but the batsman does well to dig out a searing yorker, despite ending up on the turf. He earns one for this troubles to add to a nicely clipped couple earlier on in the over. Since Labuschagne\u2019s dismissal Australia have lost their impetus. In other matches it might be possible to describe the game as drifting, but this is simply the latest engrossing phase of play in an even contest between bat and ball full of subtle changes of approach from both sides. Perhaps the most significant point of note (besides Australia\u2019s good fortune) is New Zealand\u2019s reluctance to bowl Santner. There is turn and bounce on offer but he has so far not been trusted to exploit it. 66th over: Australia 187-3 (Smith 57, Wade 15) The star of the middle session - Colin de Grandhomme - is back into the attack as New Zealand begin their planning for the second new ball. It\u2019s a nondescript over that goes for three. This is a lovely clip that highlights how much better the playing conditions have been today at the MCG compared to last year. It\u2019s also a neat example of how welcome an addition Trent Copeland is to TV Commentary; unfussy, informative and yet to be reversed into by the banter bus. 65th over: Australia 184-3 (Smith 56, Wade 13) Bowling change from the Members\u2019 End with Trent Boult replacing Neil Wagner. He beats Smith with a hooping in-swinger but alas for the Kiwis it\u2019s a familiar pattern, instead of the clattering of stumps or a feather to the keeper it\u2019s a thigh-pad deflection to fine-leg for four. 64th over: Australia 180-3 (Smith 56, Wade 13) After 19 deliveries without a run off the bat Steve Smith controls a pull down to backward square-leg for a single. Southee then induces a flash and a miss from Wade outside his off stump, another let-off in a day of let-offs for Australia\u2019s batsmen. 63rd over: Australia 179-3 (Smith 55, Wade 13) More Wagner v Wade, but this over is tame by comparison. Another maiden, the third in a row for New Zealand. 62nd over: Australia 179-3 (Smith 55, Wade 13) Southee bowls a maiden to Smith from around the wicket. Jason Alf would like to wish Matthew Wade a happy birthday. It is, after all, the Tasmanian\u2019s 32nd birthday. In his honour, here\u2019s some of his best work. 61st over: Australia 179-3 (Smith 55, Wade 13) The latest instalment of Wagner v Wade begins with another moral victory for the bowler, this time beating the batsman\u2019s edge with a conventional away swinger, catching Wade leaden-footed awaiting the bumper. And it ends with a moral victory for the bowler, Wade ducking into the eventual bouncer, the ball ricocheting away for four down to fine-leg. Australia are now in a very strong position in this match but they have benefited from an awful lot of good fortune in the process. 60th over: Australia 175-3 (Smith 55, Wade 13) Southee hasn\u2019t bowled much at Wade since tea but he begins the 60th over by beating the left-hander\u2019s outside edge from around the wicket with an absolute jaffa, then follows it up by finding a thick edge that slithers wide of the diving gully. The Tasmanian responds by punching a drive worth two runs that\u2019s hit so straight it practically nutmegs the umpire. 59th over: Australia 170-3 (Smith 55, Wade 8) More Wagner v Wade, and it\u2019s an even contest this over. The bowler has his hands on his head when an inside-edge dies just in front of leg-gully but the batsman gets off strike when he reads a slower ball and drives it just wide of mid-off. Meanwhile, another vote for cherries. I was around the Victoria/NSW border recently and they were in uncommonly short supply. Perhaps why I forgot to include them initially. 58th over: Australia 169-3 (Smith 55, Wade 7) New Zealand have toiled manfully all day but Southee is starting to show signs of tiring. His pace has dipped into the 120s-kph and he\u2019s floating the ball up to Smith rather than fizzing it in his direction. It still manages to cause the Australian problems though, from ball four the latest in a long long line of thick edges manages to scuttle to the third-man boundary and not into the mitts of a Kiwi fielder. 57th over: Australia 165-3 (Smith 51, Wade 7) Wagner continues his bouncer barrage, first at Smith, who eventually rotates strike with a single, then at Wade. The Australian keeper still looks uncertain against the Kiwi enforcer, standing his ground and accepting what\u2019s being hurled at him, rather than looking to counterattack or adjust his stance to force Wagner to rethink his plans. The pitch isn\u2019t offering a great deal at this stage so the over passes without much incident. According to this piece from a few years ago, the answer to the fruity teaser during the tea interval is mangoes and cherries. 56th over: Australia 164-3 (Smith 50, Wade 7) Tim Southee returns for his 12th over of the day to open the final session of play. Steve Smith is delighted with New Zealand\u2019s decision. He leaves a couple of gentle sighters outside off then leans elegantly into a straight drive for four to move to his highest Test score this summer. Southee almost gets his revenge next ball but the latest in a series of thick outside edges bounces just short and wide of the diving gully and skips away to the rope. A sharp single brings up Smith\u2019s first half-century in a career-threatening* three Tests. *Not career-threatening. A 35-over final session coming up, so we\u2019ll likely bleed into the additional half-hour, taking us through to a 6pm-ish close of play. During the tea interval I fisted an unattractive amount of raspberries into the big hole in my face. My in-laws live near a berry farm so raspberries are both cheap and plentiful. It got me thinking, are they the quintessential Christmas fruit? Or is it the passion fruit crowning the pav? Or the seasonal mango? Or something else? \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll receive Hawaii billeting,\u201d emails Rowan Sweeney, \u201cbut word on the street is Geoff Lemon is counting numbers and #OBOspill is trending...\u201d. Rowan, Geoff has my unconditional support, and any rumours about apparatchiks conducting internal polls are entirely false. \u201cAny stats on Wade\u2019s test average as specialist batsman v time as a keeper/batsman?\u201d asks Ian Loiterton, from his wife\u2019s phone; a detail that prompts all sorts of further enquiries. Well Ian, Wade averages 28.58 as the designated keeper, and 36.23 without the gloves. Another engrossing session of cricket, one in which Australia threatened to take a stranglehold on the game, but thanks to Colin de Grandhomme they didn\u2019t. The home side are now in the box seat but with New Zealand continuing to create chances Australia cannot rest on their laurels. Looking forward to the resumption of Wagner v Wade after the break. 55th over: Australia 155-3 (Smith 41, Wade 7) The final over before tea is Wagner v Wade round II. The Kiwi strikes a blow second ball, making the ball seam in and collide with the Australian\u2019s ribcage. Two deliveries later the ball whistles past Wade\u2019s off stump. Then the following delivery Wade looks as though he\u2019s edged between keeper and slip but nobody dives for the catch and Australia pick up four. The runs are credited to the batsman, so that has to go down as an awful missed opportunity for New Zealand, but a review probably would have saved the batsman. 54th over: Australia 151-3 (Smith 41, Wade 3) CdG\u2019s magnificent spell is ended and Mitchell Santner is back on to see if he can survive longer than one or two overs this time. He is unthreatening in the first over of his third spell but avoids the carnage that saw him removed swiftly from the attack an hour or so ago. 53rd over: Australia 149-3 (Smith 40, Wade 2) Matthew Wade\u2019s arrival at the crease meant that Neil Wagner\u2019s return to the attack wasn\u2019t going to be far behind. The rutting stags resumed their duel this over with Wagner bowling bouncer after bouncer followed by stare after stare, and Wade responding with a narrow-eyed look that signalled \u201cis that all you\u2019ve got big man?\u201d. The best part of 80,000 are now packed into the G. 52nd over: Australia 149-3 (Smith 40, Wade 2) Smith is just working the ball around the MCG now as the tea break approaches, and in the process he ascends to tenth in the list of all-time Australian Test run-makers. How high up this list will he eventually get? 51st over: Australia 147-3 (Smith 39, Wade 1) CdG\u2019s spell, by the way, is eight overs 1-15. Heck of an effort. Boult continues his work from the other end but he can\u2019t repeat the trick. 50th over: Australia 144-3 (Smith 37, Wade 0) There\u2019ll be plenty of analysis of that Labuschagne dismissal. Is it a technical glitch, or was it just bad luck? Apologies for the rhetorical ScoMo-ism in the previous over. How good would it be if I was billeted somewhere in Hawaii as punishment? Out of nowhere Labuschagne is out! That luck I was talking about - well, it\u2019s just run out for Australia\u2019s no.3. CdG was doing CdG things in a tight over and from the fifth delivery probing outside off Labuschagne tried to leave but didn\u2019t raise his arms sufficiently, allowing the ball to clip his elbow and ricochet onto his stumps. Huge and unexpected moment in this game. 49th over: Australia 144-2 (Labuschagne 63, Smith 37) Boult\u2019s still getting the ball to curve in the air, and in so doing trouble Labuschagne. But after a legbye rotates strike he drops short to Smith who swivels, and with full control, pulls for four. Apropos of nothing, how good are the plethora of Kiwi voices (including Taika Waititi) in the latest series of Rick and Morty? 48th over: Australia 139-2 (Labuschagne 63, Smith 33) Not for the first time this session an Australian mishit falls safely, this time a Smith checked drive fails to reach the catching midwicket after the batsman fails to read a delivery that sticks in the pitch. That is the only moment of note in a maiden over. 47th over: Australia 139-2 (Labuschagne 63, Smith 33) Boult continues to bend his back but Smith is now into his groove, shifting his weight forward and back in that bullet time manner of his. He eases two, then a single, through the off-side, allowing Labuschagne to tuck into a rare long hop and clack it behind point for four. This match is quickly getting away from New Zealand. 46th over: Australia 132-2 (Labuschagne 59, Smith 30) The luck is all going Australia\u2019s way at the moment. New Zealand are probing but LBW appeals are not being upheld and edges are not going to hand. The latest example is CdG forcing a genuine edge from Labuschagne but it flies through the vacant second slip region at regulation height and away to safety. I unironically love Boney M. 45th over: Australia 125-2 (Labuschagne 53, Smith 29) Boult is still finding that pleasing arc through the air (can any scientists out there explain why the human eye is drawn to those elegant parabolas?) and he uses it to get inside Labuschagne\u2019s defence and crunch into his front pad. A hearty appeal follows but Marais Erasmus continues his mime of an immovable water buffalo chewing the cud. Boult\u2019s ire is further raised the following delivery when Labuschagne reaches his fifth consecutive score of 50+ with a thick edge that runs along the ground through fourth slip all the way to the third-man fence. 44th over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 49, Smith 29) CdG manages to find a bit of movement off the pitch and square Steve Smith up, drawing a leading edge that is lucky to squirt through the gully region. The big man is doing a Matthew Hoggard-like job for New Zealand, getting through ten overs of hard work, swinging the ball away from the right-handers, and going for just 23 runs. 43rd over: Australia 119-2 (Labuschagne 49, Smith 27) Australia\u2019s contemptuous dismissal of Santner in the previous over from the Punt Road end has forced Williamson to return to Trent Boult. He finds a much tighter line and length, keeping Labuschagne to just a couple worked through the on-side. 42nd over: Australia 117-2 (Labuschagne 47, Smith 27) Just the single from an unremarkable CdG over. Major questions for New Zealand to answer now. They\u2019ve bowled with purpose for three hours - and those three hours will likely be the best of the match in which to bowl - but they\u2019ve only taken two wickets. Australia, with their best two batsmen at the crease, will now feel as though they have almost 40 overs to take a firm grip on this contest. 41st over: Australia 116-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 27) Since lunch Australia have looked much busier at the crease and that\u2019s starting to change the complexion of this match. With a much more positive mindset Labuschagne hoicks a Santner drag down for six then Smith guides the Kiwi spinner effortlessly over the sightscreen for six more! 17 in total from an over that will force a response from Williamson. This has been a splendid day\u2019s cricket so far, the bowlers finding some early swing then settling into some disciplined spells with creative fields, and in response the batsmen digging in and accepting the short-term requirement to focus on preserving their wickets. Halfway through the day the match situation is evenly poised. The weather and pitch conditions have been worth keeping an eye on. When Kane Williamson inserted Australia this morning it was overcast and the strip had a greenish hue. Now the sky is cloudless, the ball is swinging less and the pitch is flattening out. Now Adam\u2019s taken his leave remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. Thank you very much Collo, my favourite trans-Tasman cricketing Adam since Adam Parore. The Kiwi keeper was famously disliked by his Australian opponents during his stint in international cricket, leading to a few famously vicious sledges and this terrifying, merciless dismissal from Brett Lee. 40th over: Australia 99-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 21) Labuschagne gets one into the onside to start CDG\u2019s new over so he reverts straight back into that zone way outside the off-stump in order to do his bit in dotting them up. That\u2019s drinks. On the basis that they haven\u2019t lost a wicket since lunch, let\u2019s call that hour for Australia. It\u2019s not been the most convincing batting - Labuschagne was so nearly run out - and New Zealand have done plenty right with the ball, but they haven\u2019t been able to get another breakthrough. To take you through to the end of what has been an excellent first day so far, I welcome JP Howcroft. Talk to you tomorrow! 39th over: Australia 98-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 21) Santner, who went wicketless in Perth, gets a second crack in this middle session. There was nothing wrong with his over after lunch, which prompted a big lbw shout against Labuschagne. Smith is the man on strike this time and he\u2019s happy playing the waiting game until a wider full ball comes down at him, square driving it for his second all-run four. These two have now put on 38 from 107 balls. 38th over: Australia 94-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 17) CDG does his job here, whipping through a maiden at Labuschagne, all well outside the off-stump and prompting the lightsaber. Nothing wrong with showing a bit of patience. But much as it was when they picked up Warner, they have to capitalise and break this up. 37th over: Australia 94-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 17) Wagner to Smith with that silly point in again but he isn\u2019t needed here, Smith pulling from the line of his body into the gap for an all-run four. One of the only grounds in the world where you can be guaranteed that will happen a few times in every Test played there. 36th over: Australia 88-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 12) IS LABUSCHAGNE RUN OUT? Direct hit from Wagner at long leg! They go upstairs. NOT OUT! A great dive. It ended a de Grandhomme over where four were taken. Every time these two run they are looking for two and racing between the wickets. Assertive batting. It hasn\u2019t been perfect - Labuschagne could have been run out by Williamson about 20 minutes ago - but that error hasn\u2019t diminished their enthusiasm. 35th over: Australia 84-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 11) Smith defends, leaves then waits to clip past backward square, just placing wide enough to get off strike. That\u2019ll frustrate New Zealand, who want Wagner on him at every opportunity. Shane Warne explains on TV that a lot of teams try on the short attack for a few overs before giving it away as they aren\u2019t accurate enough. The contrast with the Black Caps, he says, is that they have Wagner who can do it all day. As is the custom on Boxing Day, the Mexican Wave is now doing around the \u2018G as Labuschangne finishes the over with a well-struck pull, adding three. 34th over: Australia 80-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 10) Southee is not going to let Labuschagne play the way he wants through the legside, digging a channel outside the off-stump. The No3 is up to the task, letting it all go with the lightsaber leave he\u2019s learned from the bloke up the other end - his idol. Not too dissimilar to the middle session at Perth on day one, they have dried the runs up again, Australia adding just 13 over the last 10 overs and one single across the last 27 balls. There\u2019s a shout for lbw when Labuschagne leaves a ball to hit his thigh pad but it\u2019s going way over the top. He\u2019s now faced 101 balls for his 26. Back to back maidens. 33rd over: Australia 80-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 10) Wagner now has a full crack at Smith from the start, popping a silly point in to join the short leg. He might not be the most fashionable fast bowler but he\u2019s changing the way the best player in the world goes about his business - an achievement in itself. He\u2019s out of the way of a conventional bouncer then just keeping a ball of his hip into the turf. That\u2019s well taken by Latham at short leg, not letting him off strike. He has a more unorthodox crack at the next ball aimed in that direction, making room to swivel/pull around the corner, middling it straight to the man at the 45. Top Test Match cricket. 32nd over: Australia 80-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 10) RUN OUT CHANCE! Smith BBQ\u2019d Labuschagne, giving it the Dean Jones yes, no, sorry. Williamson had the chance from mid-off to ping the stumps down, which would have left the No3 short by metres. But it isn\u2019t on target. Could he had thrown to Southee instead, with sufficient time to take the bails? Quite possibly. Either way, with a ton in each of his three Tests this summer - pretty much chanceless until the second dig at Perth, where he still make it to 50 - that could hurt later today. Southee is doing a lot right, giving neither batsmen anything from a nagging fourth stump line. 31st over: Australia 79-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 9) Men around the bat on the legside for Wagner v Labuschagne now too. He takes the pull on when it\u2019s there to be played but picks out square leg. Wagner goes straight back at the woodwork, finding an inside edge. Just as it was in Perth, he\u2019s right in the game. Maiden. 30th over: Australia 79-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 9) Southee continues to Labuschagne, who eases three through midwicket when he overpitches. Smith leaves and defends the remaining deliveries. Easier to bat now with the sun out. Those crowd facts I gave you before have been added to by CA, noting that records only go back 40 years or something like that. In short: it is the eighth highest opening day at Melbourne with more than 74,000 people in the ground. 29th over: Australia 76-2 (Labuschagne 24, Smith 9) Oh, the composer is back to replace Santner. Fair enough, I guess - mix it up after lunch to keep them thinking. It\u2019s not the match-up they won\u2019t though, Labuschagne down the business end rather than Smith. He deals with a predominantly full over from Warner around the wicket without concern, neatly pulling for one when the shorter ball arrives. 28th over: Australia 75-2 (Labuschagne 23, Smith 9) Shot. Smith gets a look at an overpitched Southee offering and makes no mistake, nailing it to the long-off rope. Southee was excellent with the new ball but why, I wonder, has Wagner been replaced? Surely this is the time to keep the pressure on? He does try to drop short to finis but there\u2019s no menace, allowing the No4 to pull it for four without risk. 27th over: Australia 67-2 (Labuschagne 23, Smith 1) SO, SO CLOSE! Santner beat Labuschagne\u2019s inside edge first ball. The appeal looked a good one but he was on the front foot with the ball still rising. Technology confirms this after Williamson elected, correctly, to hold onto their review. He\u2019s in better shape using the depth of the crease for the rest of the over. The players are back on the field. Yes, it\u2019s true. Mitch Santner has the ball in his hand to roll down a few of his left-arm orthos. Good news this summer, I should add, is that they have finally changed the music the Australian team walk out to at the start of a session, shelving - at long last - Great Southern Land. Labuschagne is the man on strike. PLAY! A lot of people are in. We\u2019re told by Channel Seven that the attendance had now gone beyond the 73,812 who were in on Boxing Day in 1997. That\u2019s the highest non-Ashes day one figure. Great day, that. SR Waugh and Ponting going after the second new ball before stumps. Punter\u2019s ton the next morning. Good times. \u201cWhatever happens,\u201d adds Yum, we have got The Maxim Gun Smiths, and they have not.\u201d True. But today, at least for now, he just hasn\u2019t earned it yet... baby. \u201cMonsieur Collins.\u201d Our man Paris Bob Wilson is with us on Christmas, pleasing me greatly. \u201cIt\u2019s cosy and strange that you\u2019re doing this from from London (also a noticeable Northern Hemispheric mellowing of that zippy, sunny prose you rock down there). Top catch, that. Too many diving catches are treated with reverential astonishment (irritating to the goalies of the world) but that was a boned fish of a thing. A crime against ergonomics. One of the rare ones that looks harder in slo-mo. Southee clearly just thought...\u2019**** it, I\u2019m having that.\u2019 A true gem.\u201d With you on the critique of diving catches. Of course, they aren\u2019t easy. But being at full stretch doesn\u2019t make it a classic. There\u2019s a reason why slippers like Smith take them all the time - when they get a good, early look they can time their jump accordingly. They have trained for it. Southee\u2019s, with the confusion of who should/would go for it and so on, was much harder to execute. That\u2019s my Ted Talk. Just Australia\u2019s session? Having been sent in, with the ball and pitch doing plenty, you could advance that argument. On the other hand, New Zealand did get rid of Warner, who looked a lock for a major contribution until Wagner found his edge - taken superbly by Southee - with 15 minutes until the interval. Their other scalp, Burns bowled first ball by Boult in the opening over of the Test, had the MCG heaving with tens of thousands of New Zealanders in the stands. Lots of fun! 26th over: Australia 67-2 (Labuschagne 23, Smith 1) Smith takes one on the arm! Wade-esque! They rotate for one but the umpires, quite rightly, call them back as a leg bye can\u2019t be added unless a shot is being offered or evasive action taken. It happens again later in the over - almost identical, albeit hitting him in the back this time. Umpire Llong waves his arms to signal dead ball and Smith doesn\u2019t like it at all, believing that his action was to get out of the way. Last ball before lunch... and it finds the edge with Smith forced to play another super short ball, landing just in front of the catchers waiting behind the wicket. A riveting final over before the break, Smith flaring up at Nigel Llong as he leaves the field. 25th over: Australia 67-2 (Labuschagne 23, Smith 1) Good from Labuschagne, taking the ball with soft hands through the cordon to frustrate Boult. He defends and leaves the rest, which is fine with the Kiwis as it means they can race through it quicker than usual to secure another Wagner v Smith stoush before lunch. 24th over: Australia 63-2 (Labuschagne 19, Smith 1) Wagner is giving it his all with his short and accurate bowling, Smith on hands and knees a couple of times ostentatiously leaving balls alone before one really spits at his gloves, played with both feet off the ground but with soft hands well away from waiting catchers. Just what we wanted on this opening morning. Probably two more overs until lunch 23rd over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 18, Smith 1) Nearing lunch, Boult gets a go at Smith - an adversary he knows well. Full and full to begin, short and short to follow. After his week in Perth, Smith wants nothing to do with either bouncer. They would do well to remember how England got themselves into a bouncer frenzy against Smith at Brisbane in 2017 and he didn\u2019t take it on for nine hours. With so much focus on this, I suspect this is exactly what will happen here. The field remains set for a mistake: a leg gully, bat pad and two men out deep. 22nd over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 18, Smith 1) Send in the crazy Smith Boxing Day Test stats, four times galloping to centuries in this fixture. On the other hand, for the first time in his career he\u2019s coming into a Test with it four matches since a half-century. Not that this means anything. Right, four to go in the over and Wagner goes upstairs! Good bowling. The crowd love it, some commentators start talking Bodyline. I\u2019ll bite my tongue. He\u2019s off the mark with a quick single to midwicket. A direct hit would have been interesting. WHAT A CATCH! I didn\u2019t do it justice in my wicket post. And they have! Wagner changes ends and finds Warner\u2019s edge second ball! Southee, jumping across from second slip, takes a sharp chance above his eyeline. A massive moment in the early exchanges of this Test Match. They\u2019re now going to get 15 minutes at Steve Smith before lunch on the opening morning. Game on. 21st over: Australia 58-1 (Warner 41, Labuschagne 15) Nasty! Boult is back and immediately whacks Warner on the arm, leaping off a length. He\u2019s spent a lot of time patting down the wicket between overs and does so again now between deliveries. Later in the over, he\u2019s into the 40s with a couple behind point, using the pace well. To really justify their decision to bowl first, the Black Caps need something to go their way in the 18 minutes before lunch. Plenty has been going their way with the moving ball and the surface. They need to make it work now. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi, Trevor Tutu. It\u2019s still very early morning in Cape Town, but woken by dreams of the Newlands Test and the victory over England. I\u2019m joining you on the OBO until I summon up the energy to watch it on the box. I wonder if I\u2019ll even bother to get up, as I am now perfectly happy to get my cricket fix from the OBO.\u201d Thanks for your company. I\u2019m bouncing between the OBOs for this Test and Cape Town later in the week. Very, very much looking forward to that. 20th over: Australia 56-1 (Warner 39, Labuschagne 15) An emphatic response from Warner to his troubles against CDG in the previous over, clobbering the first ball of this fresh set through cover for four then carving a couple behind point. He keeps going, moving through the 30s quicker than [insert name of a dictator here] with three more through cover - help yourself stuff, a long-hop. The all-rounder gets one look at Labuschange, who defends watchfully. 19th over: Australia 47-1 (Warner 30, Labuschagne 15) Singles to both behind square leg. Other than that, the approach to Wagner is to leave him well alone. 18th over: Australia 45-1 (Warner 29, Labuschagne 14) Ooh! CDG is suddenly the man most likely, twice in a row beating Warner from around the wicket with deliveries moving appreciably after pitching. The opener should have left the first one alone but the second required attention in these conditions. So close. If they don\u2019t get him soon, I predict he\u2019ll be about 162 not out overnight. 17th over: Australia 43-1 (Warner 28, Labuschagne 13) Bumper! That\u2019s what the travelling fans are there to see, Wagner hurrying Labuschagne up with one that just evades his lid. For the second time this morning he\u2019s slow on the bouncer, and he was out pulling in Perth. I\u2019m not suggesting this is necessarily a weakness, but I\u2019m sure the Kiwi quicks will be interpreting it that way. Good over. Maiden. 16th over: Australia 43-1 (Warner 28, Labuschagne 13) CDG has had a couple of polite words directed his way already in this spell about where he is landing in his follow through. An affliction for many stump-to-stump operators. He\u2019s looking more likely to Labuschagne so far, who is starting well outside the crease at him to offset the natural curve he\u2019s getting to the right hander. A quick single to finish, Boult getting a look at a direct hit but unable to nail the non-striker stumps. 15th over: Australia 40-1 (Warner 27, Labuschagne 11) Wagner is on and the Kiwi crowd are very happy, the left-armer generating so much attention in Perth for his efforts in both innings. No short stuff to begin though, Labuschagne leaving for the most part after clipping the first away for a couple. He tetains the strike with a single to midwicket as well. It\u2019s taken a while, but the No3 is into double figures. Some news from the Australian camp: Mitch Swepson, the QLD leggie, has been added to the squad for the SCG Test. He\u2019s been on a couple of Test tours without debut as yet. Has had a few big moments so far in this summer\u2019s Sheffield Shield. 14th over: Australia 37-1 (Warner 27, Labuschagne 8) Ooooi! Southee, gosh, this is outstanding swing bowling. It\u2019s going to take that in order to nick Warner off now that he\u2019s set and he\u2019s nearly pulled it off from around the wicket with one coming back at him, the opener just inside the line. But this doesn\u2019t bother Warner, who drives from the crease later in the over, creaming his cover drive through the gap for four. He finishes with two more past point, racing back in top gear to the danger end. We saw that over and over and over again in Adelaide last month. 13th over: Australia 31-1 (Warner 21, Labuschagne 8) CDG to Labuschagne, who is shuffling forward before the ball is bowled to negate a bit of the movement, but is mostly happy getting his bat out of the way. The bowler adjusts his length just a tad, prompting one of those play-and-misses where the batsman is trying to get the bat out of the way just as the ball passes. Fine work. He\u2019s such a better bowler than the speed radar alone would suggest. A couple of good drives to finish but both straight to fielders. That\u2019s drinks, bringing to a close an absorbing first hour. \u201cJust cricket things,\u201d writes Sachin Paul. \u201cDespite things being totally symmetrical, you rarely see Boult coming around the wicket to Labuschagne while it is the absolute main weapon that Southee (and other right arm fast bowlers) seem to use against lefties. Wonder why that is?\u201d Probably rhythm? But then again, Boult does come around the wicket without too much trouble in the shorter forms of the game. 12th over: Australia 31-1 (Warner 21, Labuschagne 8) Southee is still finding plenty of movement. I can\u2019t wait to see the swing/seam analysis of the first session today compared to the first stanza here in 2017 and 2018, which were both painful. 11th over: Australia 29-1 (Warner 19, Labuschagne 8) de Grandhomme - or, CDG as I\u2019m going to identify him this week - into the attack from the Smokers\u2019 Stand End. As usual, he\u2019s asking all the right questions from the get-go, finding the inside portion of Warner\u2019s blade then doing the same with Labuschagne later in the over. \u201cJust losing his shape,\u201d says Michael Vaughan. Nice start from the all-rounder. \u201cMerry Christmas @collinsadam!\u201d Gary Naylor - compliments of the season to you, my friend. \u201cI got the collected memoirs of Clive James today, having read Volume 1 a few years back. Of course, the great man has left us now, as has much of his Australia (pace Bay 13). Is this a good or bad thing?\u201d On Bay 13, I refer back to a few overs ago. On James\u2019 Australia... there\u2019s a thesis in that! Did you catch the Tourism Australia advert before the Queen\u2019s Speech today? 10th over: Australia 28-1 (Warner 18, Labuschagne 8) More runs for Warner, three of them, with a push past mid-on. I\u2019ve watched Warner enough to declare that this is exactly how he looks when he\u2019s en route to a ton. I\u2019m usually reluctant to mozz players in this way, but with Warner it\u2019s easier to tell when he\u2019s on than for most. 9th over: Australia 25-1 (Warner 15, Labuschagne 8) Warner off strike again early in the Boult over, pushing past point along the carpet. That\u2019s the way to do it when the ball is moving: get down the other end. Labuschagne deals with the rest. Might be worth giving Wagner a look from Boult\u2019s end while the Kookaburra is new. 8th over: Australia 24-1 (Warner 14, Labuschagne 8) After Boult\u2019s first over, Southee has been the more dangerous of the New Zealand seamers. Once again he\u2019s forcing Labuschagne here to play with him respect. And just as it was in the previous over, he gets another real good\u2019un that beats his outside edge. \u201cMerry Christmas Adam.\u201d It\u2019s just ticked over to Boxing Day here in the UK but I\u2019ve had a great time of it. We actually hosted lunch today - how very grown up. Merry Christmas, Shane Puxley. \u201cThe action on field is riveting, and 8 bays of Kiwi support in the Olympic Stand is equally so. The problematic aspects of Bay 13 were real and important to address. I\u2019m just not sure that ripping out the entire area and transplanting Bondi\u2019s Bucket List Bar is the answer? The active support area at Headingley seemed to drive Stokes as much as he conducted them. We need to consider retaining space for collective barracking, with impetus on self-policing the less savoury aspects.\u201d Yes to all of this. My issue isn\u2019t really Bay 13. As a veteran of that part of the ground (which, of course, hasn\u2019t been \u2018Bay 13\u2019 since 1990), it has been a long time since it was an iconic place to engage with the players and all that. Probably when ODIs stopped bringing in bulk crowds a dozen years or so ago. But my point is that it remained a part of the \u2018G that people enjoyed sitting. Maybe it was history, or where people sit at the footy, or that it is a cheap place to get a ticket. I just don\u2019t think it was necessary to take out this chunk of seats, in Melbourne of all places. 7th over: Australia 23-1 (Warner 13, Labuschagne 8) That didn\u2019t take long - Umpire Erasmus is already taking a look at the ball to put it through the rings. He gives it back to Boult, who overpitches again at Warner with his next, driven for three to long-off, Williamson denying him a boundary with an excellent sliding stop. They\u2019re taking another look at the ball later in the over, to no avail for the tourists, who reckon it is out of shape. It keeps swinging though, this time back to Labuschange who misjudges an outsinger hitting him high on the front pad flap. He\u2019s back on it straightaway though, square driving a wide half-volley for four. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Morning, Damien McLean. \u201cWhat a start by Boult, but his first ball made me think. Full, outside off, left by the batter. I can\u2019t remember a first ball of a test match that didn\u2019t follow that formula. I wondered, with your statistical contacts, if you could find out the likelihood of the opening ball of a test being full, outside off, left by the batter. If it\u2019s as common as I\u2019m assuming, should a bowler consider a well directed bouncer every now and then to catch the batter off guard, as surely it would be the last think they would expect.\u201d Great point. I\u2019ll give that to the CricViz factory to take a look at for us. \u201cPs, on the new Bay 13 at the MCG, my interpretation is that it\u2019s CA\u2019s attempt at a social commentary on the gentrification of inner city suburbs and the simultaneous exodus of traditional inhabitants, causing a diaspora of traditional bay 13 revellers to find new places in society. I think they\u2019ve nailed it.\u201d 6th over: Australia 14-1 (Warner 10, Labuschagne 4) Gosh, what a pearler from Southee to start his new over, beating Labuschagne with one that\u2019s angled in at leg and beaten off. Gorgeous new ball bowling - unplayable. Labuschagne did the right thing though, playing the line rather than following it with his hands. After those two nervous plays-and-misses to begin, after Burns lost his middle stump in the first over of the day, Marnus has been back to his normal, organised self. 5th over: Australia 14-1 (Warner 10, Labuschagne 4) Bodyline - drink! The first use of the magic word on television, Warne asking how New Zealand will go at Smith when the time comes. None of that here, Boult very much in Warner\u2019s half, the opener waiting for the overpitched delivery that comes at the end, driven carefully through the gap at cover for his first boundary. Very good batting. 4th over: Australia 10-1 (Warner 6, Labuschagne 4) Full, leave. Full, defend. Bumper! There it is, and Labuschagne is on it late. We saw plenty of this in Perth and it worked a lot better than the final margin would suggest. Clever bowling from Southee, pushing the next up on a good length to locate edge, on the bounce to third slip. He leaves the last couple. We\u2019re seeing pictures of the two Australians between overs doing plenty of gardening. It\u2019s made for a great start. Maiden. 3rd over: Australia 10-1 (Warner 6, Labuschagne 4) Boult with a 7-2 field at Warner, finding his leading edge with the first of the new set, albeit on the bounce between the two gullies for a couple. He\u2019s more convincing in that same direction later in the after, collecting two more past point. He\u2019s back on the front foot before long, Boult doing well to stop a straight drive in his follow through. Two of the best in the world going at it on Boxing Day equals very good watching. 2nd over: Australia 6-1 (Warner 2, Labuschagne 4) Tim Southee has the ball in his hand from the Great Southern Stand End, Warner clipping him to long leg for his second single. New Zealand won\u2019t mind that, getting another look at Labuschagne who wafted at his first two balls. Four slips in place. \u201cI like this,\u201d says Warne. \u201cGood move.\u201d He has the good sense the bust out his lightsaber leave this time, though. After playing the next outswinger with soft hands into the cordon, he gets a look at a long half-volley to finish and makes no mistake, stroking it safely past mid-off for the first boundary. \u201cIt\u2019s like Eden Park here!\u201d says my mate Dom Milesi from behind the bowlers\u2019 arm in the MCC. It certainly sounds it on the telly! \u201cLooks like Burns has earned himself a rare golden Boxing day duck,\u201d writes Yum in Brisbane. \u201cSomething that can never be taken away from him.\u201d The last time he batted on Boxing Day, four years back, he made a fine century in tough conditions. He now has both. 1st over: Australia 1-1 (Warner 1, Labuschagne 0) It\u2019s the stuff you dream of as a swing bowler, something Boult has done so often across his decorated international career. Burns didn\u2019t help himself, launching at a booming drive first ball; just the fourth delivery of the day. Labuschagne\u2019s turn and he\u2019s beaten first up by a ball he had no need to play. Oh, and he\u2019s beaten again to finish! Nervous batting; super bowling. The MCG is ALIVE with the Kiwi support going wild. Through the gate with a beauty! Burns bowled first ball playing all around it! Hooley dooley! The players are on the field! Boult to Warner. PLAY! Oh! And Boxing Day 2010. How can anyone ever forget? And yes, that\u2019s the last time a captain elected to bowl first at Melbourne. \u201cHi Adam, And a very merry Boxing Day.\u201d Hi, Ian Forth - to you and yours as well. \u201cI can recall the memorable insertions that went awry: Hussain in 2002 at Brisbane, Ponting 2005 at Edgbaston, even Paine 2019 at The Oval come to mind. But I haven\u2019t got the same mental map of rather unexpected insertions that were proved right. I expect others might have.\u201d Good point - we don\u2019t often discuss them when they work. Two that immediately stand out for me: Edgbaston and Trent Bridge in 2015. Before play... we all saw this, I assume? OUR KYLIE. What a star. That Williamson decision. I\u2019ll remind you of the semi-final in this year\u2019s World Cup. There, the New Zealand skipper was widely panned for how conservatively they batted. Well, it turns out an international skipper reads a track better than we all do. If he\u2019s pulled the right lever here, it really would be something. \u201cIt\u2019s a great move,\u201d says Brendon McCullum on SEN Radio. \u201cGiving their quicks an opportunity to go through them early here is their best bet.\u201d Two excellent people. Here\u2019s Ross Taylor talking to Ali Mitchell on Channel Seven about what it means for the Black Caps to be back on the MCG in a Test Match. Australia: David Warner, Joe Burns, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Matthew Wade, Travis Head, Tim Paine (c &amp; wk), James Pattinson, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon. New Zealand: Tom Latham, Tom Blundell, Kane Williamson (c), Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Colin de Grandhomme, BJ Watling (wk), Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Neil Wagner, Trent Boult. BOLD! Kane Williamson says this was the plan. His two changes were those I flagged earlier; teams to you in a sec. Tim Paine says he \u201cwasn\u2019t too sure\u201d what he would do if he won the toss. Unusual for the Cricket Ground, that\u2019s for sure, but the track is green, so here we are. Pattinson for Hazlewood confirmed as Australia\u2019s only change. Good work, MCG. Less good... the quasi corporate thing down the bottom of the Southern Stand. I\u2019m less worried about the Bay 13 history and more the fact that lots of Melburnians like sitting down there. Ah well. Confirmed from the ground, via Justin Langer on radio. Head will retain his spot; Neser to again ride the pine. Oh well. Victorian James Pattinson is in for his first home Test since his first international summer back in 2011. He\u2019ll be loving that, make no mistake. Good morning! It\u2019s the late shift where I\u2019m coming to you from in London having tucked into a very different Boxing Day Eve. But I haven\u2019t missed many Melbourne Tests through my life, so I\u2019m very excited to be with you on the mighty OBO across the next five days. For the hosts, the modern history of a turgid MCG Test strip had Tim Paine talking the talk about playing five bowlers and elevating himself into the top six for the first time. That would mean a debut to one of my favourites, Michael Neser. However, with more grass than usual on the track, the XI is likely to be your more belt-and-braces variety. What\u2019s certain: James Pattinson returns. Giddy up. For the visitors, this means a lot more than the names on their teamsheet. Yes, Trent Boult is back. That\u2019s big. The Black Caps also have Tom Blundell in to open the batting after their top order misfired in Perth. But the reason why there are tens of thousands of New Zealanders in town is because today is their first appearance on this special stage for 32 years. And they\u2019ve absolutely earned it. Right, we\u2019re about 20 minutes from the toss at the \u2018G. To kick us off, one for the Kiwi fans with us today. Welcome! Drop me a line.",

      "bodyText": "Nepalese schoolgirl Prasiddhika Shrestha is holding up a video camera at her aunt\u2019s house, filming her cousins as they devour crisps, corn puffs, soda and dalmoth, a traditional lentil-based snack. \u201cWhat is it that you like eating most?\u201d she asks them. \u201cLay\u2019s chips and Coke,\u201d says Diwani, who drinks between one and two litres of soft drink every day. Rihana includes a pack of Kurkure corn puffs in her daily diet. Prasiddhika is among 100 schoolchildren in seven countries asked by researchers from University College London to film themselves and the food they eat for a study about the exposure of children to unhealthy diets. Kiran Dahal, a Nepalese schoolboy, is filming in his school\u2019s canteen, where children are scrambling over each other to buy junk food at lunchtime. \u201cI bought two [corn puffs], a packet of dalmoth, pakoda [fried snack], chewing gum and a packet of instant noodles,\u201d he says, showing them to the camera one by one. Pupils Laxmi and Nima eat six packs of instant noodles between them each day. \u201cWe see Coke on TV during races and football matches. We also see instant noodles on advertisements,\u201d they say. An unhealthy diet is a major cause of \u201cnon-communicable diseases\u201d such as heart diseases, cancer, diabetes and strokes. Such diseases accounted for 66% of deaths in Nepal in 2017. A report this year by the UN\u2019s children agency, Unicef, found that 43% of Nepalese children are either stunted or overweight. \u201cThe situation regarding junk food is very worrisome in Nepal,\u201d says Atul Upadhyay of the global health organisation Helen Keller International, who is featured in UCL\u2019s Nepal film study, produced in collaboration with the Kathmandu-based centre for research on environment, health and population activities. \u201cChildren are eating more unhealthy food than they are eating healthy food.\u201d Professor Sarah Hawkes, director of UCL\u2019s centre for gender and global health, and the lead researcher behind the project, says the footage collected by children in Nepal was similar to those filmed in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tunisia, Vietnam and the UK. \u201cAll children we worked with shared the common experience of pervasive, powerful and, it seems, often unregulated advertising and promotion,\u201d she says. \u201cThe children\u2019s footage vividly communicates that, once they step outside schools, they, and their parents, have very little control over what they see and experience, what is on their local high street, or what is going into the food they purchase there.\u201d Alongside the films, researchers have studied how each country has implemented World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations that include ways to prevent and control non-communicable diseases at national level. In Nepal\u2019s case, researchers said, policies fell short. There is no tax on sugary drinks and no ban on trans fats in the food chain. None of the seven countries subsidised healthy foods, the findings showed. No country has taken up the WHO recommendation to ban trans fats in the food chain. Some progress has been made in Tunisia, where a law was passed in 2017 to tax sugar-sweetened drinks. Globally, obesity and diabetes are rising among young people. The UNHCR, the refugee agency, warned in October that at least one in three children under five are either undernourished or overweight, and one in two lack essential vitamins and nutrients. In south Asia, 50% of children are undernourished or overweight. From 2000 to 2016, the number of overweight children aged five to 19 has doubled, from one in 10 to one in five. Recent studies published in the Lancet medical journal showed that more than a third of low- and middle-income countries are affected by the double burden of malnutrition, meaning that children not having enough food in poor countries are also in danger of obesity, or eating too many empty calories in the form of junk food. \u201cChildren all over the world are facing major challenges to eat healthily \u2013 they are more surrounded by advertising and by opportunities to eat \u2018junk\u2019 [processed] food than any previous generation,\u201d says Dr Kent Buse, co-investigator on the study, who complains that government responses have not kept pace with fast-changing food environments. \u201cThe prevalence of poor dental health is increasing alongside rises in consumption of sugar, including in sugary drinks,\u201d adds Hawkes. \u201cThe sugary drinks industry is spending vast amounts of money advertising to populations in low- and middle-income countries. Coca-Cola plans to spend $12bn on marketing in Africa by 2020.\u201d Anna Purdie, programme manager at UCL centre for gender and global health, says there is a growing global crisis and, in many countries, a policy vacuum on tackling it. \u201cThe films showed us incredibly high levels of unhealthy food consumption and pervasive advertising \u2013 highlighting that living environments across the globe are not \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 when it comes to healthy diets.

It has been running sailing trips to Formentera out of Salinas, in a national park, for six years. For 2020 it is adding departures from San Antonio, to enjoy the west-coast beaches of Cala Bassa, Cala Comte, and Cala Tarida with sunset enjoyed by Cafe Mambo. It will also add voyages from Santa Eulalia to Cala Nova and Cala Llenya, or to Tagomago \u2013 a private island in the north with a chiringuito beach cafe. The yacht used has cabins, so there\u2019s the potential of a longer trip of a few nights. This year, the company created the first emission-free Plastic Ocean Cleanup catamaran, which collects plastic from the sea in a net. This is now operated by the iBi Foundation, but holidaymakers can join for free, spotting dolphins and cleaning the sea. Ibiza and Formentera aim to be single-use plastic free by 2023. For next year Bella Verde is building a boat from 100% recyclable and sustainable materials, to address the problem of many boats ending up in landfill, releasing toxic chemicals as they degrade.

      "body": "<p>On a dreary Tuesday morning shortly before Christmas, two passengers boarded the 9.30am 355 bus from New York\u2019s Port Authority bus terminal bound for American Dream, the most ambitious new mall to be built in the US in a generation. One was a mall worker who didn\u2019t want to talk to the media; the other was me.</p> <p>Depending on who you speak to, American Dream, the optimistically named $5bn mall-slash-entertainment center under construction in New Jersey\u2019s Meadowlands is either the future of shopping and a soon-to-be tourism mecca, or it\u2019s an environmental disaster, taxpayer ripoff and a hubristic folly gambling on a retail format that has had its day.</p> <p>Only time will tell who is right, but after 23 years of false starts, and amid a clearout of the retail sector that would make Marie Kondo shudder, Triple Five, the owner of American Dream, is confident that soon 40 million people a year \u2013 or more \u2013 will flock to the a 3m-sq-ft mall to surf in its wave pool, ski and snowboard on its indoor slopes, ride its rollercoasters, play with sting-rays in the aquarium and shop, shop, shop.</p> <p>Critics are less convinced. Meadowlands, a toxic marsh and mafia dumping ground that features in the opening credits of The Sopranos, has long proved a graveyard for other ambitious projects.</p> <p>The mall, under different ownership, was once called Xanadu and suffered so many false starts locals called it Xanadon\u2019t. The former New Jersey governor Chris Christie called the project \u201c\u2018the ugliest damn building in New Jersey and maybe America\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d55c1895178f112966a65c81ae557dc7ac6c3058\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d55c1895178f112966a65c81ae557dc7ac6c3058/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The American Dream mega entertainment and shopping complex in the Meadowlands of East Rutherford, New Jersey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The American Dream mega entertainment and shopping complex in the Meadowlands of East Rutherford, New Jersey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Environmentalists have campaigned against the building for decades, as it sits on wetlands that are still home to 125 different bird species and have suffered a century of abuse. And local residents are angry that <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/news/2019/10/more-than-1b-in-nj-taxpayer-money-has-been-committed-to-american-dream.html\">more than $1bn</a> of taxpayer money is tied up in the property.</p> <p>\u201cThey filled in wetlands to build a water park. It\u2019s almost funny,\u201d Jeff Tittel, the director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club environmental group, said bitterly. He predicts that the site will need to attract 100,000 cars a day to be successful, exacerbating the area\u2019s awful traffic and pollution issues. \u201cThis is a symbol of all that is wrong with New Jersey politics.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Ghermezian, the chief marketing strategist of Triple Five, which owns the mall, has a different vision of the American Dream. The project will create 17,000 jobs, pour back billions into the New Jersey economy in taxes, and maybe, just maybe, breathe new life into a battered retail industry that is being eaten alive by Amazon and online shopping.</p> <p>The American mall is in crisis. Once the center of retail and a magnet for young people, more and more malls are dying as shopping moves online and social media becomes the forum for youth. Credit Suisse estimates that 20% to 25% of malls will shutter between 2017 and 2022. Retailers that once anchored malls, including Toys R Us and Sears, have gone bankrupt.</p> <p>But Ghermezian, whose family control Triple Five, believes people still hunger for real experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s real experiences like ride a coaster \u2026 you know, come in and touch something, sting-rays, lace up your skates and get out there,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99f7b2d5fde75d833a51f45eceb9cde20fac35f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99f7b2d5fde75d833a51f45eceb9cde20fac35f4/216_0_5446_3270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk past uncompleted retail areas at the American Dream mall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk past uncompleted retail areas at the American Dream mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA-EFE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>About 55% of American Dream is about experiences. Cinemas, restaurants and hotels are in the works; the rest is shopping. It\u2019s a mix that Ghermezian hopes will one day make American Dream the largest single attraction in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</p> <p>The bus drops me off on the edge of a vast covered car park. It has space for 11,000 cars. Inside, the mall looks more like a swanky abandoned airport than a shopping center. Long white curving corridors open into a series of high-ceilinged atriums lit by skylights and currently dotted with tastefully minimalist Christmas trees.</p> <p>A few workers and security guards walk the shopless halls. Down one corridor I spy them working on a \u201csecret garden\u201d where live rabbits may one day frolic among the curvy Alice in Wonderland-style topiary.

      "bodyText": "On a dreary Tuesday morning shortly before Christmas, two passengers boarded the 9.30am 355 bus from New York\u2019s Port Authority bus terminal bound for American Dream, the most ambitious new mall to be built in the US in a generation. One was a mall worker who didn\u2019t want to talk to the media; the other was me. Depending on who you speak to, American Dream, the optimistically named $5bn mall-slash-entertainment center under construction in New Jersey\u2019s Meadowlands is either the future of shopping and a soon-to-be tourism mecca, or it\u2019s an environmental disaster, taxpayer ripoff and a hubristic folly gambling on a retail format that has had its day. Only time will tell who is right, but after 23 years of false starts, and amid a clearout of the retail sector that would make Marie Kondo shudder, Triple Five, the owner of American Dream, is confident that soon 40 million people a year \u2013 or more \u2013 will flock to the a 3m-sq-ft mall to surf in its wave pool, ski and snowboard on its indoor slopes, ride its rollercoasters, play with sting-rays in the aquarium and shop, shop, shop. Critics are less convinced. Meadowlands, a toxic marsh and mafia dumping ground that features in the opening credits of The Sopranos, has long proved a graveyard for other ambitious projects. The mall, under different ownership, was once called Xanadu and suffered so many false starts locals called it Xanadon\u2019t. The former New Jersey governor Chris Christie called the project \u201c\u2018the ugliest damn building in New Jersey and maybe America\u201d. Environmentalists have campaigned against the building for decades, as it sits on wetlands that are still home to 125 different bird species and have suffered a century of abuse. And local residents are angry that more than $1bn of taxpayer money is tied up in the property. \u201cThey filled in wetlands to build a water park. It\u2019s almost funny,\u201d Jeff Tittel, the director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club environmental group, said bitterly. He predicts that the site will need to attract 100,000 cars a day to be successful, exacerbating the area\u2019s awful traffic and pollution issues. \u201cThis is a symbol of all that is wrong with New Jersey politics.\u201d Paul Ghermezian, the chief marketing strategist of Triple Five, which owns the mall, has a different vision of the American Dream. The project will create 17,000 jobs, pour back billions into the New Jersey economy in taxes, and maybe, just maybe, breathe new life into a battered retail industry that is being eaten alive by Amazon and online shopping. The American mall is in crisis. Once the center of retail and a magnet for young people, more and more malls are dying as shopping moves online and social media becomes the forum for youth. Credit Suisse estimates that 20% to 25% of malls will shutter between 2017 and 2022. Retailers that once anchored malls, including Toys R Us and Sears, have gone bankrupt. But Ghermezian, whose family control Triple Five, believes people still hunger for real experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s real experiences like ride a coaster \u2026 you know, come in and touch something, sting-rays, lace up your skates and get out there,\u201d he said. About 55% of American Dream is about experiences. Cinemas, restaurants and hotels are in the works; the rest is shopping. It\u2019s a mix that Ghermezian hopes will one day make American Dream the largest single attraction in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The bus drops me off on the edge of a vast covered car park. It has space for 11,000 cars. Inside, the mall looks more like a swanky abandoned airport than a shopping center. Long white curving corridors open into a series of high-ceilinged atriums lit by skylights and currently dotted with tastefully minimalist Christmas trees. A few workers and security guards walk the shopless halls. Down one corridor I spy them working on a \u201csecret garden\u201d where live rabbits may one day frolic among the curvy Alice in Wonderland-style topiary. (However, 2,500 people have signed a petition asking the mall not to \u201cuse live animals as Instagram props\u201d.) Triple Five is a family firm and plays a long game. American Dream is opening in stages. The shops don\u2019t open until next year, hence the lack of visitors for now. Big Snow, billed as North America\u2019s first indoor, real-snow ski and snowboard center, opened earlier this month and a handful of skiers braved its massive icy hall during my visit featuring 160ft slopes and 5,500 tons of real snow. Nickelodeon Universe, the largest indoor theme park in North America, opened in November and houses some quite terrifying-looking rollercoasters and kids\u2019 rides, featuring the media company\u2019s star assets including SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats. Opposite the theme park, watched by a giant model of Shrek, workers are still putting the finishing touches to the DreamWorks Water Park, which houses a wave pool where people will one day be able to surf a 6ft wave while people lounge in cabanas, with views of Manhattan, fitted out by the New Jersey-born designer Jonathan Adler.

      "bodyText": "Rainfall over parts of eastern Australia during the Christmas break did little to extinguish some of the country\u2019s major bushfires, ahead of worsening conditions and a heatwave due to arrive in the coming days. About 70 bushfires continue to burn throughout New South Wales, despite modest rainfall in some fire-affected parts of the state, while firefighters continued to battle a large blaze in South Australia on Boxing Day. Rob Taggart, a meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, told the Guardian NSW\u2019s mid-north coast and hinterland had received the bulk of the rain since Christmas Eve, with some areas hitting totals of around 80mm. But he added that rainfall in the fire-ravaged Blue Mountains and south coast regions had been minimal. \u201cBearing in mind that some of the higher falls are from thunderstorms, which are hit and miss, some locations through the north coast and the north coast hinterland have received some fairly significant falls,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cBut not all of the areas of the mid-north coast received that much. Port Macquarie picked up 19mm. That\u2019s helpful rain, [but] I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s enough to put out a fire.\u201d Further south, small amounts of rain fell on the edge of the massive 500,000-hectare Gospers Mountain fire in the Blue Mountains, and on the South Coast, where the Rural Fire Service continues to battle blazes near Nowra. \u201cEven 5mm through the Ulladulla area [on the South Coast] or 5mm through the Blue Mountains area is not going to put out those fires. It may temporarily suppress them a little bit, but then when the hot windy dry comes through, they just flare up again,\u201d Taggart said. Nearly 30 of the fires in NSW were still burning out of control on Thursday afternoon, although more than 1,700 firefighters used the reprieve over Christmas Day to bolster containment lines and create strategic firebreaks around active blazes in NSW, as well as South Australia and Victoria. About 1,400 fire fighters continued that work on Boxing Day when the NSW Rural Fire Service confirmed the improved conditions assisted fire fighters on the ground, particularly in the state\u2019s north. NSW RFS spokesman Ben Shepherd said firefighters had done great work through Christmas while the conditions remained favourable. \u201cThe weather has been for once a little bit more in our favour but it\u2019s still going to be a potentially difficult day come next week once we start to see that bad fire danger set in,\u201d Inspector Shepherd told AAP on Thursday. Two fires, in the Deua River Valley at Eurobodalla and the Currowan fire in the Shoalhaven, were upgraded to a Watch and Act alert on Thursday. Southern parts of NSW began to warm towards heatwave temperatures on Thursday afternoon, as the state braces for another bout of extreme conditions over the weekend. Taggart said that the hot days would culminate in a cool change on Tuesday, when the conditions would likely be worst on the ground. \u201cWe are looking at increasing heat affecting fire grounds in the central [and] eastern districts and in the south east,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting heatwave conditions developing and we\u2019re expecting a change moving through on Tuesday, New Year\u2019s Eve. Usually the days when a change comes through they are windier as well. \u201cTuesday looks to be the day of the next peak in fire weather with the build up leading up to that.\u201d Forecasters expected temperatures would reach the mid-30s in the Blue Mountains town of Katoomba, which Taggart noted was one kilometre above sea level. In the Hunter Valley, temperatures are likely to reach the low-to-mid 40s, with minimal humidity. In South Australia, where a bushfire blackening Adelaide Hills has now been downgraded to the lowest warning level, temperatures are expected to reach 39C in the state\u2019s capital on Friday. Queensland, meanwhile, was hit by 620,000 bolts of lightning as a series of storms lashed the state\u2019s south-east. Eleven people were treated for minor injuries while 21,500 lost power on Christmas Eve and 25 December. The bureau said storms would bring damaging winds and large hail to inland far north Queensland on Thursday afternoon. Australian Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The West London club, who are moving out of their historic Griffin Park home after more than a century to a new \u201cPremiership-ready\u201d stadium, are taking their veteran, record-breaking, match day compere with them. Peter Gilham is the longest surviving pitchside MC in British football and he will be travelling the mile-long journey to Brentford\u2019s newly built ground next season. Gilham has introduced both teams coming through the Griffin Park tunnel for 51 years at the club he has supported since he was 10 years old. As Brentford prepare for a promotion play-off battle in the Championship in the second half of this season, the club\u2019s owners stressed that it would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d to relocate in their new 17,000-plus capacity without Gilham and his microphone. On the same day that former Blue Peter presenter Peter Purves tearfully accused the production company filming this year\u2019s Crufts dog show for dropping him over ageism, Gilham and his club are in no mood to retire the man the fans call \u201cMr Brentford\u201d. When the club asked Gilham to join them in the move to the new ground, he said: \u201cI had absolutely no hesitation at all. I have been watching this club almost all my life and introducing every home [game] for over a half century. I want to be part of the new stadium, I am excited by the move because they\u2019ve been talking about a newer, bigger ground all the way back from the mid-70s. \u201cNow our dream is coming real and this club has been part of my life.

It\u2019s just not the Brentford way to contemplate leaving people like Peter behind.\u201d After a hard fought 2-1 victory over promotion rivals Cardiff City, in one of Brentford\u2019s last games at home under the Griffin Park floodlights, Gilham entered the hospitality lounge to a barrage of comic banter from a host who had an uncanny resemblance to Donald Trump. Amid the laughter, Gilham pondered his last day as MC at Griffin Park. \u201cWhen I walk over that line on to the pitch with my microphone, every time it is special for me. I think I am the luckiest guy alive because I work for the club I love. As for what I will say at our last ever game I don\u2019t rehearse, of course, but I can tell you that whatever the words they will come from the heart,\u201d he added.",

MySpace spent time and money building local infrastructure for each new market \u2013 hiring a team on the ground, translating the site and performing outreach to local musicians and artists. Facebook simply enlisted volunteers to crowdsource the site\u2019s translation into new languages, starting with Spanish, then German, French and more.</p> <p>By 2010, Facebook had been translated into more than 80 languages by volunteers and had signed up half a billion users worldwide.Meanwhile, MySpace had begun its long decline.</p> <p>Setting up all those foreign offices had \u201cliterally wast[ed] hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d the site\u2019s former vice-president of online marketing, Sean Percival, recalled in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/06/myspace-what-went-wrong-sean-percival-spotify\">post</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/06/myspace-what-went-wrong-sean-percival-spotify\">mortem</a> in 2015. \u201cWhereas Facebook said: \u2018We don\u2019t need to set up offices that quick; this thing is gonna scale.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Scale. If there is one word that encapsulates the past decade in the tech industry, it is scale. Scale is the holy grail of the venture capital-backed tech startup, the state in which exponential growth in users \u2013 and revenues \u2013 can be achieved by linear increases in infrastructure \u2013 and costs.</p> <p>Facebook scaled. Uber scaled. YouTube scaled. Airbnb scaled. Amazon scaled.</p> <p>In achieving this state, it helped to have a business with minimal physical infrastructure (Facebook, YouTube and other software companies) \u2013 or to offload the cost of owning and maintaining that infrastructure to contractors (Uber, Airbnb). Amazon managed to scale despite requiring significant physical infrastructure; WeWork did not.</p> <p>The 2010s saw a fundamental reconfiguring of untold numbers of businesses into platform-based markets, from advertising to transportation to travel. Local businesses folded or adapted; either way, the platforms won.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c8608c7e60a1ec82061b850be9ba9e184bdbff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c8608c7e60a1ec82061b850be9ba9e184bdbff8/0_134_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uber drivers sit in their cars as they wait for passengers in Sao Paulo, Brazil on 13 February 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uber drivers sit in their cars as they wait for passengers in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil on 13 February 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The numbers associated with the size of these platforms defy comprehension.</p> <p>In 2018, YouTube said users were uploading <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/with-over-1-billion-users-heres-how-youtube-is-keeping-pace-with-change.html\">500 hours of video every minute</a>, which is 1,250 days of video per hour, or more than 82 years of video per day.

Facebook <em>deleted</em> 2.8bn fake accounts between October 2017 and November 2018. When hackers stole the personal information of 14 million Facebook users, the breach represented less than 1% of the company\u2019s users, a population greater than Tokyo. Airbnb claims to have listings in more than 100,000 cities.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible for anyone to know everything that\u2019s happening on these platforms, and it\u2019s obvious that the companies aren\u2019t even bothering to try.</p> <p>It is perhaps one of the small ironies of the 21st century that the foundations for many of the tech leviathans of the 2010s were laid just as the global economy was grappling with the consequences of the catastrophic scale of another industry \u2013 banking.</p> <p>One month after Facebook began its global conquest with minimal investment and maximum speed, the Federal Reserve bailed out Bear Stearns with a $25bn loan. Airbnb was founded that summer, just a few weeks before Lehman Brothers crashed. In March 2009, as the Dow Jones hit its nadir, Uber was founded.</p> <p>\u201cToo big to fail\u201d became the watchword of a policy of the grotesque. Banks got bailed out, homeowners got thrown out. Bankers cashed bonus checks; workers filed for unemployment. The system wobbled but did not collapse. Up close, a million minor tragedies unfolded. But from a high enough vantage point, everything was fine.</p> <p>Was it a coincidence that the years of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d birthed a generation of companies that have in the intervening decade been allowed to grow even bigger and more unmanageable?

Setting up all those foreign offices had \u201cliterally wast[ed] hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d the site\u2019s former vice-president of online marketing, Sean Percival, recalled in a postmortem in 2015. \u201cWhereas Facebook said: \u2018We don\u2019t need to set up offices that quick; this thing is gonna scale.\u2019\u201d Scale. If there is one word that encapsulates the past decade in the tech industry, it is scale. Scale is the holy grail of the venture capital-backed tech startup, the state in which exponential growth in users \u2013 and revenues \u2013 can be achieved by linear increases in infrastructure \u2013 and costs. Facebook scaled. Uber scaled. YouTube scaled. Airbnb scaled. Amazon scaled. In achieving this state, it helped to have a business with minimal physical infrastructure (Facebook, YouTube and other software companies) \u2013 or to offload the cost of owning and maintaining that infrastructure to contractors (Uber, Airbnb). Amazon managed to scale despite requiring significant physical infrastructure; WeWork did not. The 2010s saw a fundamental reconfiguring of untold numbers of businesses into platform-based markets, from advertising to transportation to travel. Local businesses folded or adapted; either way, the platforms won. The numbers associated with the size of these platforms defy comprehension. In 2018, YouTube said users were uploading 500 hours of video every minute, which is 1,250 days of video per hour, or more than 82 years of video per day. Uber says that it gives 45 rides every second \u2013 just in the US \u2013 adding up to nearly 4m rides a day \u2013 just in the US. Facebook deleted 2.8bn fake accounts between October 2017 and November 2018. When hackers stole the personal information of 14 million Facebook users, the breach represented less than 1% of the company\u2019s users, a population greater than Tokyo. Airbnb claims to have listings in more than 100,000 cities. It\u2019s impossible for anyone to know everything that\u2019s happening on these platforms, and it\u2019s obvious that the companies aren\u2019t even bothering to try. It is perhaps one of the small ironies of the 21st century that the foundations for many of the tech leviathans of the 2010s were laid just as the global economy was grappling with the consequences of the catastrophic scale of another industry \u2013 banking. One month after Facebook began its global conquest with minimal investment and maximum speed, the Federal Reserve bailed out Bear Stearns with a $25bn loan. Airbnb was founded that summer, just a few weeks before Lehman Brothers crashed. In March 2009, as the Dow Jones hit its nadir, Uber was founded. \u201cToo big to fail\u201d became the watchword of a policy of the grotesque. Banks got bailed out, homeowners got thrown out. Bankers cashed bonus checks; workers filed for unemployment. The system wobbled but did not collapse. Up close, a million minor tragedies unfolded. But from a high enough vantage point, everything was fine. Was it a coincidence that the years of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d birthed a generation of companies that have in the intervening decade been allowed to grow even bigger and more unmanageable? Or did those who warned of the moral hazard of the bailout see their predictions come true, in another industry? Because rather than taking the lesson of comic books that with great power comes great responsibility, the tech platforms have adopted the stance that with great scale comes total impunity. Take Facebook\u2019s global presence. The social network is now officially available in 111 languages. The rules that govern what users can or cannot post on the site \u2013 on crucial issues ranging from hate speech and incitement, to violence to health misinformation and self-harm \u2013 had only been translated into 41 languages as of April 2019, according to an investigation by Reuters. The company\u2019s 15,000 content moderators were fluent in just about 50 languages, and the company\u2019s much-vaunted automated tools that are supposed to detect dangerous content only worked in about 30. Facebook did not respond to a query from the Guardian asking if these numbers had changed since April. Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy, told Reuters that translating the content rulebook, which is about 9,400 words in English, was \u201ca heavy lift\u201d. Since 2010, Facebook\u2019s net profit has exceeded $69.1bn. What may have been opportunistic and strategic in 2008, when Facebook was a money-losing startup, is simply inexcusable today. The results of unchecked hate and propaganda can be deadly: Facebook\u2019s failures to adequately police hate speech have been implicated in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar and anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka. Language barriers hampered its ability to understand and respond to what was happening in both countries. And this is just one example of the multitude of areas where Facebook and other large platforms have refused to take responsibility for their own companies, with scale used as a shield for blame. When Uber released a safety report showing that more than 3,000 passengers in the US had reported sexual assaults in 2018, it cast the problem as societal. \u201cIn the United States alone, more than 45 rides on Uber happen every second,\u201d Uber\u2019s chief legal officer, Tony West, wrote in a blogpost. \u201cAt that scale, we are not immune to society\u2019s most serious safety challenges, including sexual assault.\u201d Sure, but society doesn\u2019t take a cut of every Uber ride; Uber does. YouTube launched a specialized platform for children in 2015 and, four years and innumerable scandals later, still does not pre-screen content to ensure that it is actually appropriate for children. Amazon\u2019s market dominance has been fueled by its decision to allow third-party sellers on its platform. The result has been wildly profitable for Amazon, but a Wall Street Journal investigation found thousands of unsafe items for sale on the site, including children\u2019s products. Tech companies tend to operate on the assumption that if you feed meals to 10,000 children, and only poison 10 of them, that\u2019s an acceptable rate considering the scale. On the threshold of a new decade, few things seem clear except that we will be dealing with the ramifications of a handful of tech companies\u2019 unmanageable scale for years to come. Because the beauty of scaled platforms is that, while the profits accrue just to the companies, the negative consequences accumulate for all of us.",

A severe heatwave with localised pockets of extreme heat was forecast to move across South Australia on Saturday and Sunday, reaching NSW and Victoria on Monday. Temperatures were not forecast to match the heights of last week, when Australia recorded its four hottest days ever, but will reach 45C in Penrith, 37C in Katoomba, 37C in Sydney and 35C along much of the NSW south coast on Monday. The most dangerous fire conditions would come at the tail end of the heatwave, when a cold front would bring a sudden north-westerly to south-westerly wind change, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Rose Barr said. \u201cBetween Thursday and Saturday we are starting to see severe heatwave conditions in the southern parts of the state, extending over a more significant area of NSW into the weekend and next week,\u201d she said. \u201cSome areas are forecast to reach extreme heatwave conditions. \u201cWith the increasing heat and winds, the fire danger will worsen into the new week, with Monday and Tuesday most likely to be the most significant fire weather days.\u201d The forecast for dangerous conditions overlaps with New Year\u2019s Eve, one of the busiest periods of the year for holidaymakers escaping the city for campgrounds, national parks and state forests. The NSW Rural Fire Service took advantage of milder weather on Christmas Day to undertake strategic backburning on the western edge of the 500,000 hectare Gospers Mountain megafire, to protect towns such as Bilpin and Blackheath. More than 1,700 volunteer firefighters spent Christmas Day on fire grounds in NSW and a further 700 were working on the fire effort. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were 74 active bush and grass fires in the state, almost 30 of which were not contained.

Where possible, the CFS said, volunteers were given a rest day in preparation for worse conditions early next week. \u201cIt is really hot but it is not windy,\u201d CFS spokeswoman Simone Macdonald said. \u201cThese little flare-ups will happen because it is so hot and there are so many places within the fire ground that have not been burned. \u201cOur concern is, we are looking by Saturday and Sunday and into Monday, to see a return to those dangerous conditions.\u201d Strategic burning took place along the northern sections of the fire, while a combination of bulldozers and firefighters armed with rake hoes built containment lines around unburned properties in areas closer to Adelaide.

The three-minute musical advertisement aired on televisions in the UK before the Queen\u2019s message on Christmas Day, with Minogue and another well-known Australian export, Adam Hills, addressing the nation from Sandringham \u2013 a beachside suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Minogue teased the release on social media in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Titled \u201cMatesong\u201d, the campaign is the biggest investment in promoting Australia to the UK in more than a decade, Tourism Australia said. It is part of the perplexing \u2018philAUSophy\u2019 campaign. The lyrics, written by Australian comedian and singer-songwriter Eddie Perfect, are explicitly aimed at the Brexit-and-Boris malaise. Stanzas include: \u201cNegotiating tricky trade deals is a shocker/ But look there\u2019s a quokka! / And that\u2019s what you need.\u201d Quokkas are adorable and thoroughly defenceless cat-sized marsupials that are extinct everywhere except Rottnest Island, a short boat ride from Perth in Western Australia, where they are so friendly that they happily pose for selfies with tourists and Hemsworths. The ad features a litany of Australian sports people, including world number one women\u2019s tennis player Ash Barty; former Australian cricketer Shane Warne, taunting the audience to \u201cget ready to lose\u201d at backyard cricket; and Olympic gold medal winning swimmer Ian Thorpe, who charmingly speaks his lines rather than singing them. It also shows Kylie Minogue on a beach; Kylie Minogue under a car wearing the overalls and curls of her Neighbours character Charlene Robinson; Kylie Minogue in a luxury eco-lodge; Kylie Minogue with Reggie and Cassidy Uluru, Anangu elders from Mutitjulu and traditional owners of Uluru; Kylie Minogue pulling a beer; and Kylie Minogue in a kind of cricket-themed Victor/Victoria moment wearing Australian colours on her left side and English red-and-white on her right. The holiday promised in the ad is comforting, familiar and non-threatening, highlighting the deep colonial ties between Australia and the UK. \u201cThis year\u2019s been tough and confusing / But progress is moving \u2026 At glacial pace \u201cBut all of Australia loves you/ And we\u2019ll never judge you.\u201d Australia is Briton\u2019s \u201cpal to rely on\u201d its \u201cshoulder to cry on\u201d. As the song promises: \u201cWe speak your language/ Except for the vowels.\u201d The reception has been mainly positive, particularly in the UK. It is catchy and glossy and fun. But a number of Australians \u2013 and even a few Britons \u2013 pointed out that clear blue skies and happy, healthy koalas are at odds with recent images of Sydney showing a thick layer of smoke shrouding the Sydney Opera House, and news coverage of unprecedented bushfires that have devastated large swathes of koala habitat. Although the song does say \u201cwe can turn off the news\u201d. The ad has also been criticised for presenting quite an Anglicised version of Australia, despite 30% of the population being born overseas. In Australia, reaction has also been coloured by criticism of prime minister Scott Morrison, himself a former director of Tourism Australia, whose decision to holiday in Hawaii during the bushfire crisis has led to criticism of his leadership.",

He bumped into a rival running the race of their life when second here last month, a race in which he was the only hold-up runner to make much impact. This hotter contest may work out better for him. 1.55 Kempton Paul Nicholls fields two hugely promising youngsters for this renewal of the Kauto Star, but Master Tommytucker and Danny Whizzbang lack the experience of a couple of their rivals and that may tell. Black Op gave Champ a run for his money at Newbury and is respected but Tizzard\u2019s Slate House is hard to get away from. He seemed on the point of winning Cheltenham\u2019s BetVictor Gold Cup Chase when knuckling over two-out last month and that is classy form in this context. 2.10 Wetherby An 11lb rise is not to be sneered at but Bennys King impressed in pulling clear of a packed field for the Peter O\u2019Sullevan Memorial last time. He was short of peak fitness on his only defeat since joining Dan Skelton and can improve again for this step up in distance. Skelton won this race two years ago. 2.30 Kempton Fusil Raffles has been the talking horse at Seven Barrows but the form of his Wincanton win last month is not the strongest on offer here. He will face a stern challenge from his stablemate Epatante, so impressive in landing the Gerry Feilden and disappointing only at Cheltenham since arriving from France.",
