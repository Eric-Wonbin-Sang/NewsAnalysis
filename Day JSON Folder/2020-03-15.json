The prime minister, who had been under growing pressure to start holding daily briefings amid criticism of his response to Covid-19 and the media strategy used to explain it, will personally chair many of the daily briefings, which No 10 says will continue \u201cas long as necessary\u201d. On Monday afternoon he will also chair another Cobra meeting, where ministers will discuss measures that would dramatically escalate the steps being taken by the UK to tackle the virus. They are expected to discuss a planned ban on mass gatherings, proposals to ask whole households to stay at home when someone falls ill and the move, expected within weeks, to ask the over-70s to stay at home for up to four months. They are also due to discuss the modelling used by the government to determine its overall strategy, which is due to be published soon. The daily briefings, which are intended to focus on informing the public \u201con how to protect themselves\u201d, will also routinely feature Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser. Johnson, who for most of his time in office has shown little enthusiasm for exposing himself to media scrutiny, announced the plan after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said daily briefings were needed to ensure people got \u201cmuch clearer guidance\u201d on what the government was doing and why. All three Labour leadership candidates and Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had also demanded greater clarity. On Monday, Johnson is also due to hold a conference call with British manufacturers, who will be urged to switch production to start making the ventilators required by hospitals, and he will participate in a conference call with fellow G7 leaders in which he will be calling for global action to fight the disease and its economic impact. Calls for a daily ministerial press conference intensified over the weekend, following at least three incidents of Whitehall giving out contradictory messages over coronavirus, with the uncertainty compounded by the fact that some key reporting was based on unattributable sources. On Friday morning Vallance gave an interview defending the government\u2019s decision not to ban large sporting events \u2013 only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban would soon be implemented. In his interview Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of herd immunity to coronavirus. But his comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus. On Sunday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had to distance himself from Vallance, saying \u201cherd immunity is not our goal or policy\u201d. The health secretary then found himself being contradicted by officials in Scotland. He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to \u201cstay self-isolated\u201d at home for four months, but his use of the term \u201cself-isolate\u201d was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether. Although Johnson\u2019s decision to front many of the daily press conferences himself will be seen as testimony to the seriousness with which he is approaching the crisis, former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, said it would be better for the chief medical officer to chair the daily government briefings. Burnham added that this was what happened when the government was handling swine flu during his time in office and that everything became \u201ca bit calmer\u201d when the official briefings were no longer entangled with politics. Although a poll at the weekend suggests 53% of voters trust the government to deal with the pandemic, ministers have come under pressure to explain why the UK is not matching some of the tougher measures being taken in other European countries, where bars, restaurants and non-essential shops have been closed, as well as schools. In an interview on Sunday, Hancock rejected the claim that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere. \u201cWe are similar to many countries,\u201d he claimed. \u201cFor instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others. \u201cIt is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time. We are prepared to take, if we need to, all the sorts of measures [discussed], but we will do it based on the science.\u201d On Monday the Department for Work and Pensions will also be announcing that face-to-face assessments for people claiming sickness and disability benefits will be suspended for three months.

Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will all rise in the south-east about an hour before the sun. The chart shows the view looking in that direction at 05:15 GMT on 18 March. On that morning, the planets will be joined by a waning crescent moon. Just 32% of the moon\u2019s near-side will be illuminated at that time.

Market volatility around attempts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak has shown how exposed Trump could be in November. An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed the president losing match-ups with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic contenders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-joe-biden-coronavirus\">set to debate in Washington</a>.</p> <p>The stock markets endured a tumultuous week as the Dow Jones plunged 10% on Thursday, its worst day since 1987, before rallying on Friday as Trump declared a national emergency and other measures meant to help combat the outbreak. The House then passed a sweeping relief bill, backed by Trump and negotiated by Mnuchin and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, which is expected to pass the Senate on Monday.</p> <p>But Cohn argued on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 had already \u201ccurtailed consumer demand\u201d and that it was \u201cmost likely \u2026 we are already in a recession\u201d, a view shared by experts including Barack Obama\u2019s former top economic adviser, Jason Furman. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-could-expose-the-hollowness-of-americas-boom\">On Friday</a>, he said that \u201cat this point, this feels much worse than 2008\u201d, the last global financial crisis.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">latest numbers</a> from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which have not been updated since Friday, document 1,629 confirmed US cases of Covid-19, with 41 fatalities. Other estimates are higher and most experts think thousands of cases have not been diagnosed, in part because of a slow start to testing.</p> <p>Mnuchin\u2019s confidence in the economy came in the face of state and local leaders mandating policy designed to limit exposure to the virus. Eighteen states, for example, have announced some <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/list-states-that-have-closed-all-schools-due-to-coronavirus/\">form of school closure</a>.</p> <p>In Illinois, schools will be closed from 17 March until the end of the month and St Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations over the weekend were severely curtailed.

Later in the year economic activity will pick up as we confront this virus.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will use whatever tools we need to make sure the economy and hardworking Americans get through this.\u201d But Mnuchin\u2019s upbeat assessment came at the same time as a top member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, Dr Anthony Fauci, declined to rule out a \u201cnational lockdown\u201d of restaurants and bars, key drivers of consumer spending. \u201cI would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars,\u201d Fauci told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, as he appeared to open the door to hardline measures similar to restrictions in a number of European countries. \u201cWhatever it takes to do that, that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see. \u201cFor a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to just accept that if we want to do what\u2019s best for the American public.\u201d The doctor appeared on all the main political talkshows, as the administration sought to provide public reassurance. On CNN, he was asked if it was possible that hundreds of thousands of Americans, or more, could die. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible. Our job, our challenge is to try and make that not happen.\u201d Speaking to NBC, Fauci said: \u201cAmericans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.\u201d Later on Sunday, a White House statement urged Americans not to \u201choard\u201d groceries and goods and said the president had told store and supply chain executives they should \u201chelp Americans feel calm and safe when shelves are stocked with the items they need\u201d. A booming economy is any incumbent president\u2019s trump card when up for re-election. Market volatility around attempts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak has shown how exposed Trump could be in November. An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed the president losing match-ups with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic contenders set to debate in Washington. The stock markets endured a tumultuous week as the Dow Jones plunged 10% on Thursday, its worst day since 1987, before rallying on Friday as Trump declared a national emergency and other measures meant to help combat the outbreak. The House then passed a sweeping relief bill, backed by Trump and negotiated by Mnuchin and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, which is expected to pass the Senate on Monday. But Cohn argued on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 had already \u201ccurtailed consumer demand\u201d and that it was \u201cmost likely \u2026 we are already in a recession\u201d, a view shared by experts including Barack Obama\u2019s former top economic adviser, Jason Furman. On Friday, he said that \u201cat this point, this feels much worse than 2008\u201d, the last global financial crisis. The latest numbers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which have not been updated since Friday, document 1,629 confirmed US cases of Covid-19, with 41 fatalities. Other estimates are higher and most experts think thousands of cases have not been diagnosed, in part because of a slow start to testing. Mnuchin\u2019s confidence in the economy came in the face of state and local leaders mandating policy designed to limit exposure to the virus. Eighteen states, for example, have announced some form of school closure. In Illinois, schools will be closed from 17 March until the end of the month and St Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations over the weekend were severely curtailed. On Sunday, Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, issued stinging criticism of Trump. \u201cWe [state governors] are the ones who\u2019ve had to provide the leadership because the federal government just has fallen down on this,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t advise us to shut down major events, sporting events, parades, we made those decisions on our own. They are not the ones that advised us to close schools, we made those decisions on our own. So we are on our own out here. I wish we had leadership from Washington, we are not getting it.\u201d Ohio\u2019s governor, Mike DeWine, a Republican, has closed schools until 3 April. He said he was considering closing all bars and restaurants. \u201cWe are certainly looking at that,\u201d he said, also on NBC. \u201cYou know, we started off last week closing the schools. We reduced the number of people gathered together to 100. You know, we have restricted access to our nursing homes, to our prisons. So we are taking tough steps \u2026 Every day counts so much and you just cannot wait.\u201d On Saturday Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, urged the White House to consider restricting domestic travel, after a fourth death in his state. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing cases where people clearly contracted it somewhere else and brought it here,\u201d DeSantis said. The comments came shortly after Trump \u2013 who was tested for coronavirus on Friday and found to be clear \u2013 expanded a European travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, and cautioned that the administration was considering domestic restrictions. On ABC, Fauci said: \u201cTravel restrictions within the country have not been seriously discussed. I don\u2019t see that now in the immediate future.\u201d",

Everyone in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, ordered their food online, and had it delivered. And the strategy worked. In seven weeks China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">stopped the epidemic</a> in its tracks.

In recent days both Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro and Mexico\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 nationalists from opposite ends of the political spectrum \u2013 have enraged opponents and observers by making high-profile public appearances in which they came into close physical contact with citizens. They did so in defiance of medical advice and despite growing alarm over the spread of the virus through Latin America, where at least 17 countries have confirmed cases. Bolsonaro, a far-right rabble-rouser who recently dismissed coronavirus as a media \u201cfantasy\u201d, left his presidential palace on Sunday to exchange fist bumps and mingle with supporters who turned out for highly controversial protests targeting Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions. \u201cThis is priceless. We politicians must change Brazil\u2019s destiny,\u201d Bolsonaro enthused during his hour-long jaunt, during which he used supporters\u2019 mobile phones to take selfies before handing them back into the crowd. Bolsonaro left his palace despite reportedly being placed in isolation there on Friday after members of a Brazilian delegation to the US, which he led, were found to have contracted the virus. Bolsonaro claimed he tested negative for coronavirus on Friday after initial reports that a preliminary test came back positive. The president is due to repeat the test next week and at least five senior officials have been confirmed to have coronavirus, including communications chief F\u00e1bio Wajngarten and ambassador to the US Nestor Forster. On Friday one of Bolsonaro\u2019s doctors told the conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper the president would be \u201cquarantined\u201d until early next week. Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to ignore that advice on Sunday sparked fury among critics and commentators. Gleisi Hoffmann, president of Brazil\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 party, tweeted: \u201cThe country needs a responsible and serious government that thinks first about the population. But what we have in the presidency is a loud-mouthed coward who behaves like a boor.\u201d The political commentator Vera Magalh\u00e3es tweeted: \u201cPresident Bolsonaro is promoting corona day.\u201d Major cities including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo have unveiled tough measures to fight coronavirus, including the closure of schools, creches, nightclubs and cinemas. Brazilian authorities have confirmed at least 121 cases and have advised citizens to remain at home. But on Sunday Bolsonaro used his official Twitter account to encourage controversial street protests targeting his political enemies in Congress. One prominent Bolsonarista congressman tweeted: \u201cPandemic my arse\u201d. In an editorial, the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo lamented: \u201cThe major crisis Brazil now faces isn\u2019t the stuttering economy or the threat of coronavirus. The real crisis is lacking a government when one is needed most.\u201d Mexico\u2019s leftwing president, L\u00f3pez Obrador, who some compare to Bolsonaro despite their ideological differences, is also facing criticism for what many see as his cavalier attitude to the crisis. On Saturday, as authorities announced schools would be suspended until at least 20 April, he tweeted a video of himself hugging fans, posing for photos and even kissing one child during a visit to the south-western state of Guerrero. \u201cLeaving the hotel in Ometepec, I greeted and attended to the petitions of the people,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador tweeted. The president, best known as Amlo, also suggested Mexicans read Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, calling it \u201ca balm to calm us\u201d. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Mexico continued to increase: 41 were counted on Saturday, according to the health secretariat, 15 more than the day before. Mexico has been slow to impose travel restrictions and testing has been scant. The public education secretariat, however, announced an extension of the Easter break, starting on 20 March. Not all public events have been called off, with Amlo\u2019s administration citing economic considerations. The Mexican football league continues and a massive music festival headlined by Guns N\u2019 Roses attracted 40,000 fans on Saturday. Xavier Tello, a healthcare consultant in Mexico City, said health authorities were slowly changing their position but their leader remained in \u201ctotal denial\u201d. \u201cAnd that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. On Sunday morning, L\u00f3pez Obrador briefly alluded to the global health crisis, telling reporters: \u201cI have great faith that we will move our dear Mexico forwards, that misfortunes and pandemics won\u2019t affect us.

Until now there hasn\u2019t been enough awareness among the French of their role faced with the virus.\u201d Transport ministers announced that public transport services, local and intercity, will be dramatically reduced as the week progresses. France has announced it will also be tightening controls on its border with Germany as of Monday. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, agreed to limit crossings between the two countries after talks at the weekend. \u201cWe will limit the crossings to those that are strictly necessary allowing those living either side of the border and goods vehicles to cross,\u201d a French official told AFP. On Sunday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said the country was not planning to introduce any kind of rationing on food and household products, but asked that people behave with restraint. \u201cThere will be no shortages in terms of what products people can buy; there\u2019s no problem of supplies, so there will be no rationing,\u201d Le Maire said. \u201cBut we are calling on French people to behave responsibly. We are counting on them not to rush to the shelves and panic buy. Go about your shopping as usual \u2026 buy what you need for you and your family and children, but behave as you would normally.\u201d The country\u2019s education ministry announced the cancellation of national exams and professional entrance exams for at least three weeks. \u201cSolutions will be found case by case \u2026 specific and personalised information will be sent to each candidate\u201d, the ministry said in a statement. The government has said essential public services will be maintained, including street cleaning, rubbish collection, and certain public offices, but courts and tribunals are to close \u201cexcept those dealing with essential issues\u201d. Olivier V\u00e9ran, the health minister, said pharmacies were authorised to supply French patients needing long-term medication, with enough to last until 31 May.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior NHS officials reveals. The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS. It also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population \u201care expected\u201d to contract the virus. The document says that: \u201cAs many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.\u201d The briefing sets out the latest official thinking about how severely the infection could affect both the public\u2019s health and that of personnel in critical services such as the NHS, police, the fire brigade and transport. It has been drawn up in recent days by PHE\u2019s emergency preparedness and response team and approved as accurate by Dr Susan Hopkins, PHE\u2019s lead official dealing with the outbreak. It has been shared with hospital bosses and senior doctors in the NHS in Engand. \u201cFor the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that\u201d, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. \u201cA year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn\u2019t well appreciated or understood,\u201d added Hunter, an expert in epidemiology. \u201cI think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up,\u201d he added.

However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: \u201cIt is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.\u201d Under revised health advice Boris Johnson unveiled last Thursday, anyone with a cough should self-isolate for at least seven days. The document also states that: The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are \u201cunder significant demand pressures\u201d. From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested. Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients. A senior NHS figure involved in preparing for the growing \u201csurge\u201d in patients whose lives are being put at risk by Covid-19 said an 80% infection rate could lead to more than half a million people dying. If the mortality rate turns out to be the 1% many experts are using as their working assumption then that would mean 531,100 deaths.

      "body": "<p>The Department for Education is holding a crucial meeting on Monday with school leaders over how to handle the coronavirus outbreak. As the leader of an academy trust, running 29 state schools in England, my message to the government is clear: relieve the burden on schools, pupils and parents by postponing this year\u2019s GCSEs, A-levels and Sats until 2021.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s worst-case scenario is coming into sharp focus: we will inevitably enter the state of coronavirus lockdown currently imposed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-travel-ban-italy-under-lockdown-in-pictures\">Italy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">Spain</a>. Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, speaking on 12 March, predicted the UK would reach the peak of the outbreak in about 10 to 14 weeks: between mid-May and mid-June, coinciding precisely with the GCSE and A-level examination season.</p> <p>The Department of Health advises that about 95% of infections will take place within this period. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630\">prime </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630\">minister noted</a>, \u201cthe dangerous period is not now, but some weeks away, depending on how fast it spreads\u201d. The government\u2019s strategic aim is to push the virus peak into summer, when the NHS will be under less strain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/cancel-this-years-gsce-and-a-levels\">Cancel this year's GSCE and A-levels if schools disrupted, says top academy head</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, what can we do to make the delay phase successful? How can we flatten the peak? How about doing the unthinkable and cancelling exams?</p> <p>We have four options.</p> <p>1. Maintain the status quo: persuade ourselves that the current national panic is hyperbolic and that normal pre-Covid-19 life will resume soon, so there is no imperative to change examination arrangements. Science tells us that this position is impossibly flawed.</p> <p>2. Delay examinations. This solution only works if we actually believe that the nation will have emerged from the coronavirus crisis by June. We need a full six weeks to implement the examination schedule. A delay to public examinations would need to be announced now for it to make a difference.</p> <p>3. Use previous results to establish pupils\u2019 performance and make awards. We cannot do this fairly. Modular exams are a thing of the past.</p> <p>4. Cancel the exams, repeat the season, repeat the year.</p> <p>Cancellation is the only sensible and humane option. It will go a long way to ensuring the success of the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of the government\u2019s strategy. It could save tens of thousands of lives because it will ensure good decision-making, and good decision-making by individuals is central to how we manage this crisis. We are relying on one another to make the right calls. That is how we can help make the delay phase successful, how we can flatten the peak and push it in to the summer, when the NHS will be under less strain. Without this measure, we risk students avoiding self-isolation because they are conscientious. We risk staff avoiding self-isolation because they feel under pressure to teach their examination classes.</p> <p>Imagine the scene if examinations were to proceed as normal. Would infected students arrive to sit the examinations that they have prepared so hard for? Would infected invigilators supervise them? Would all students be required to have their temperature checked before entering the exam hall, or would they simply be allowed to cross-infect their peers?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">I\u2019m an epidemiologist.

      "bodyText": "The Department for Education is holding a crucial meeting on Monday with school leaders over how to handle the coronavirus outbreak. As the leader of an academy trust, running 29 state schools in England, my message to the government is clear: relieve the burden on schools, pupils and parents by postponing this year\u2019s GCSEs, A-levels and Sats until 2021. The UK\u2019s worst-case scenario is coming into sharp focus: we will inevitably enter the state of coronavirus lockdown currently imposed in Italy and Spain. Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, speaking on 12 March, predicted the UK would reach the peak of the outbreak in about 10 to 14 weeks: between mid-May and mid-June, coinciding precisely with the GCSE and A-level examination season. The Department of Health advises that about 95% of infections will take place within this period. As the prime minister noted, \u201cthe dangerous period is not now, but some weeks away, depending on how fast it spreads\u201d. The government\u2019s strategic aim is to push the virus peak into summer, when the NHS will be under less strain. So, what can we do to make the delay phase successful? How can we flatten the peak? How about doing the unthinkable and cancelling exams? We have four options. 1. Maintain the status quo: persuade ourselves that the current national panic is hyperbolic and that normal pre-Covid-19 life will resume soon, so there is no imperative to change examination arrangements. Science tells us that this position is impossibly flawed. 2. Delay examinations. This solution only works if we actually believe that the nation will have emerged from the coronavirus crisis by June. We need a full six weeks to implement the examination schedule. A delay to public examinations would need to be announced now for it to make a difference. 3. Use previous results to establish pupils\u2019 performance and make awards. We cannot do this fairly. Modular exams are a thing of the past. 4. Cancel the exams, repeat the season, repeat the year. Cancellation is the only sensible and humane option. It will go a long way to ensuring the success of the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of the government\u2019s strategy. It could save tens of thousands of lives because it will ensure good decision-making, and good decision-making by individuals is central to how we manage this crisis. We are relying on one another to make the right calls. That is how we can help make the delay phase successful, how we can flatten the peak and push it in to the summer, when the NHS will be under less strain. Without this measure, we risk students avoiding self-isolation because they are conscientious. We risk staff avoiding self-isolation because they feel under pressure to teach their examination classes. Imagine the scene if examinations were to proceed as normal. Would infected students arrive to sit the examinations that they have prepared so hard for? Would infected invigilators supervise them? Would all students be required to have their temperature checked before entering the exam hall, or would they simply be allowed to cross-infect their peers? It goes without saying that the most vulnerable in our communities will be hardest hit by the current crisis: young people who live in temporary or overcrowded homes where self-isolation is an impossibility; young carers; students who do not have access to online learning. Coronavirus will not be restricted to those who are socially disadvantaged, but it is likely to affect them most severely. So, I want to see a decision now that all these tests and exams are deferred to summer 2021, with every year group repeating the same year again from September 2020. It will mean children currently at school, in college or at university spend an extra year in education and four-year-olds due to start reception in September doing another year in nursery and starting school a year later. If there is no appetite for such a drastic measure as repeating an entire school year, we should still cancel examinations. The national assessment system would lose its integrity if awards were made without examinations being taken \u2013 but colleges and universities could offer students places unconditionally based on their predicted grades from schools. Young people would not be externally assessed, nor would they receive their GCSE or A-level certificates: this would be disappointing but not life-threatening. What is important is that they progress to the right college and university courses. Our school leaders will wish to make accurate predictions that will set pupils up for success. There are precedents from previous years where pupils who have been ill have been offered places based on school predictions. We need to level the playing field this year. The practice of making unconditional offers has received criticism during \u201cnormal times\u201d as being potentially demotivating, or even elitist, but we are in abnormal times now: unconditional offers are preferable to avoidable fatalities. Covid-19 is a once-in-a-century pandemic and it requires once-in-a-century responses and solutions to reduce casualties. They may not be the only solutions, but they need to be seriously considered by parliament if we are to avoid students and staff putting their own and others\u2019 lives at risk because of the allure of high grades or a prestigious university place. \u2022 Hamid Patel is the chief executive of Star Academies",

      "bodyText": "Until two months ago the word \u201ccoronavirus\u201d had appeared in the Guardian just 22 times in 20 years, almost exclusively in stories by those covering health and science in the context of Sars or similar contagions. Last Friday alone, my quick review of reporting across web and print found that more than 90 Guardian journalists wrote in some way about the new coronavirus. Reflecting the impact of Covid-19, coverage went right across specialisms, including politics, business, sport, transport, culture, education and food. It even reached the chess column. Since the first death was reported in China on 11 January, teams have worked around the clock and globe to report and explain this now-pandemic disease. Through words, visuals and audio, including a new twice-weekly Science Weekly Extra podcast, they have sometimes produced upwards of 100 pieces of content a day. Five journalists at the forefront spoke in Saturday\u2019s pages about the challenges of reporting on an unknown disease, with the Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, describing it as one of \u201cthe most complicated, difficult and important stories I have covered\u201d. All talked of the high-stakes responsibility of getting it right. A sense of how much readers are relying on this journalism is seen in the extraordinary numbers. Millions are coming daily to the live blog, while a continually updated explainer from Sarah Boseley, Hannah Devlin and Martin Belam is now the Guardian\u2019s most read piece ever. I asked the Guardian\u2019s deputy editor, Owen Gibson, how Covid-19 compared with previous stories of significance. \u201cIn terms of its open-ended and fast-moving nature, the number of overlapping strands, the requirement to balance the global with the local, and the pressing need for expertise and context, it\u2019s hard to think of many other stories that have become so all-pervasive for such a long period,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019ve brought different desks \u2013 and correspondents around the world \u2013 together in new ways to be able to better inform our coverage.\u201d There are three formal news meetings on coronavirus every day in which desks liaise on stories. Issues of proportionality and tone are regularly discussed, with advice also circulated on use of language. As Nick Hopkins, executive editor of news, says, \u201csingle words can make a difference\u201d. Readers are listened to on this, and any concerns forwarded to relevant staff. Dramatic words, such as \u201csurge\u201d for example, which appeared in a 5 March headline as UK cases rose to 116, are now used advisedly. Readers are not only recipients of coverage, they also inform it \u2013 bringing leads to reporters, sharing experiences through the community team and acting as monitors of accuracy via the readers\u2019 editor office (in this last respect, my assessment is that corrections of significance have been relatively few against the scale of the coverage). Only small numbers have suggested the Guardian is doing too much, and Gibson so far believes the balance is right. But with public anxiety natural and the endpoint uncertain, he sees the explanatory journalism as ever more key: \u201cEveryone feels the responsibility to our readers keenly, and it\u2019s the depth and quality of our coverage that\u2019s as important as the speed of breaking news.\u201d This story belongs to us all, so please keep your feedback coming. \u2022 Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor.

Prof Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, has also told staff in an email: \u201cThe medical science division is cancelling all clinical teaching until further notice in order to release clinical teachers to the wards.\u201d Meanwhile, University College London has said it will release all clinical academics from their university roles if they want to help the NHS during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cMany of our clinical academics may shortly be asked to support clinical services as the NHS faces increased pressure during the coronavirus outbreak. We have taken the decision to release colleagues from their UCL responsibilities to enable them to take a decision on this,\u201d said Prof David Lomas, the university\u2019s vice provost for health. The MSC said current students should be enabled to work in the NHS during the crisis, by working as call handlers for the NHS\u2019s 111 telephone service or taking over other non-critical roles to relieve staff. \u201cWe predict that many medical students who have already passed finals will want to volunteer to work in the NHS and we encourage this. Important principles are that it must be their own decision, they should not be allowed to work beyond their competencies, they should be given full necessary personal protection and full instruction in its use, and they should be fully supervised with clear governance arrangements,\u201d the letter states. \u201cOpportunities may be available for post-finals medical students to assist in clinical services other than those dealing directly with patients with coronavirus infection. For example, helping in fracture clinics that are repurposed to deal with patients with minor injuries away from the emergency department environment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is \u201cstrongly considering a full pardon\u201d for Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. Flynn cut a deal as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. He initially cooperated with the investigation, which concluded last year without establishing criminal conspiracy but did lay out extensive evidence of contact between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president himself. Flynn, who was fired as national security adviser after only 24 days in the role, has not yet been sentenced but a number of Trump aides and associates have been convicted and jailed in cases arising from Mueller\u2019s work. Flynn faces possible prison time. He sought to withdraw his guilty plea in January, \u201cbecause of the government\u2019s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement\u201d. His change in tack came after he hired a new lawyer, Fox News pundit Sidney Powell, a longtime critic of the Mueller inquiry who has peddled numerous false conspiracy theories on the investigation and other Trump policies and issues in prime time interviews. On Sunday, Trump tweeted: \u201cSo now it is reported that, after destroying his life &amp; the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has \u2018lost\u2019 the records of General Michael Flynn.

Powell, who has also repeatedly retweeted antisemitic conspiracy theories, has contended in rambling legal filings that FBI officials altered an interview summary with Flynn and conspired to prevent him from obtaining legal counsel before he was interviewed. Trump\u2019s use of the presidential pardon power has proved vastly controversial, as he has commuted sentences or pardoned prominent supporters including former sheriff Joe Arpaio and former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik. In cases related to the Russia investigation, Trump has flirted with the notion of pardoning or granting clemency to Paul Manafort, his former campaign chair who was found guilty of financial charges, and to Roger Stone, a longtime ally who was found guilty of lying to Congress and tampering with a witness. \u201cSomebody has to stick up for the people,\u201d Trump said in February.",

They took Salvator Rosa\u2019s A Rocky Coast, With Soldiers Studying a Plan, from the late 1640s, Anthony Van Dyck\u2019s A Soldier on Horseback, circa 1616, and Annibale Carracci\u2019s A Boy Drinking, circa 1580. DCI Jon Capps appealed to the public for information. \u201cThe paintings which have been stolen are very high-value pieces dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries,\u201d Capps said. \u201cThe artwork has not yet been recovered but a thorough investigation is under way to find it and bring those responsible to justice.

In 1765, general John Guise bequeathed his collection of more than 200 paintings and almost 2,000 drawings to his former college Christ Church. Thanks to the generous donation the college, founded in 1546, was able to introduce art into Oxford education without students needing to travel to Italy or visit stately homes, where at that time the majority of art collections in the UK were to be found. The loss of the paintings was a fresh blow to the college, which had already made headlines this weekend after it discovered that cases of burgundy and Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 worth between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000 have been mysteriously disappearing from its large fine wine collection, as the Times newspaper reported on Saturday. The purpose-built gallery was designed by the architects Powell and Moya and was opened by the Queen in 1968.

      "body": "<p>It seems that our government has decided that the spread of coronavirus in the population to levels creating herd immunity is inevitable, and indeed desirable (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Why rely on nudge theory to fight a virus?</a>, Journal, 14 March). However, on the basis of China, and indeed South Korea, where by stringent measures the spread of the virus was halted in its tracks at a relatively low level, massive population spread is not inevitable.</p> <p>We have not been told why such a policy by contrast is not appropriate for the UK. Given the pitifully low level of intensive care unit facilities and trained ICU staff here, it would seem even more critical for our country that the spread of the virus is not merely managed as an epidemiological case study, but stopped before the NHS is completely overwhelmed, as it will be at the levels of infection calmly being predicted by the government and its advisers.</p> <p>The approach looks dangerously like callous complacency rather than urgent emergency intervention. If carnage unfolds, we will look to the experience of other countries, and if we have a significantly higher death rate than others, our government will not be forgiven.<br><strong>Stephen Smith</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 The UK government\u2019s strategy to minimise the impact of Covid-19 \u201cis to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity\u201d. Implicit in this is the acceptance of large numbers of deaths of vulnerable people, hence Boris Johnson saying that many families will lose loved ones. This sounds dangerously like what Malthus described in 1798 as \u201cpositive checks\u201d, which lead to premature death from disease, starvation and war, resulting in what is called a Malthusian catastrophe. In contrast, nearly every other government in Europe is pursuing a different strategy \u2013 one of containment. For once, the phrase \u201cbeing ahead of the curve\u201d, has deep meaning.<br><strong>Tom Conroy</strong><br><em>Dublin, Ireland</em></p> <p>\u2022 It has long been obvious that Boris Johnson exists in a moral vacuum, but to propose a public policy that tacitly accepts the potential death of thousands of people is beyond shameful and, equally so, to try to minimise its impact as the loss of loved ones before their time. Not only should we question the scientific validity of herd immunity, which the World Health Organization rejects, but also its morality. No wonder the rest of the world is looking with incredulity at the UK government\u2019s response to Covid-19.<br><strong>Alan Walker</strong><br><em>Professor of social policy, University of Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a reason why doctors take the Hippocratic oath. Now when key decisions on coronavirus are made by politicians, perhaps they should take it too. If herd immunity works, it will be at the cost of avoidable deaths \u2013 of patients, health workers and doctors. If it doesn\u2019t work, we will have a social experiment that failed, at the cost of many human lives. Boris Johnson said that \u201cmany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d. He should have finished his sentence with \u201cand many of those deaths are avoidable\u201d.</p> <p>Other countries aren\u2019t doing this, for good reason. If one of my friends or family die under this policy, I will seriously look at crowdfunding a judicial review. I think we should do everything possible to change this heartless and arrogant approach.<br><strong>Amanda Edwards</strong><br><em>Velindre, Llandysul</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tony Yates quotes Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, as explaining part of the reason for not embracing bans (on gatherings) is to encourage \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Surely this is a misinterpretation of what herd immunity is? Before the polio vaccine was developed people got polio. They didn\u2019t get herd immunity. Herd immunity is predicated on vaccination and it is the vaccinated who constitute the herd, not those with the disease. No vaccine just means more disease, not more immunity. This seems like a dangerous misunderstanding for one in such a pivotal role to make.<br><strong>Dr Andrew Platman</strong><br><em>GP retired, Beckenham, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your correspondents (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/this-government-must-show-us-the-evidence-behind-its-covid-19-policies\" title=\"\">Show us the evidence behind Covid-19 policies</a>, Journal, 14 March) are justified in their scepticism of the government\u2019s response to Covid-19; Boris Johnson and his colleagues haven\u2019t always been transparent on other matters. However, I do trust the chief medical officer (CMO) and chief scientific adviser (CSA) \u2013 expert clinician-scientists \u2013 and they appear to be leading decision-making at the moment.</p> <p>The CMO and CSA are wrestling with complex, contradictory, partial and rapidly-changing data, and formulating recommendations as best they can. Of course, there\u2019s a debate to be had as to why experts in other countries are initiating more severe restrictions, and more transparency on the modelling information being used would be welcome. More proscriptive actions come with significant risks of their own. For example, closing schools will potentially remove parents employed in health and social care from the workforce at this critical time and/or expose grandparents (the most vulnerable demographic) to risk of increased viral exposure if they take on childcare responsibilities.</p> <p>There is a risk that the government will start to ignore the advice of the CMO and CSA; I do not believe that these two professionals would allow their public health recommendations to be overridden for political expediency.<br><strong>Dr Miles Maxwell</strong><br><em>Hitchin, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the last 10 years of Tory control, the NHS has lost 100,000 doctors and nurses and 17,000 beds (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-outbreak-nhs-staff-shortages\" title=\"\">Journal</a>, 10 March).

      "bodyText": "It seems that our government has decided that the spread of coronavirus in the population to levels creating herd immunity is inevitable, and indeed desirable (Why rely on nudge theory to fight a virus?, Journal, 14 March). However, on the basis of China, and indeed South Korea, where by stringent measures the spread of the virus was halted in its tracks at a relatively low level, massive population spread is not inevitable. We have not been told why such a policy by contrast is not appropriate for the UK. Given the pitifully low level of intensive care unit facilities and trained ICU staff here, it would seem even more critical for our country that the spread of the virus is not merely managed as an epidemiological case study, but stopped before the NHS is completely overwhelmed, as it will be at the levels of infection calmly being predicted by the government and its advisers. The approach looks dangerously like callous complacency rather than urgent emergency intervention. If carnage unfolds, we will look to the experience of other countries, and if we have a significantly higher death rate than others, our government will not be forgiven. Stephen Smith Glasgow \u2022 The UK government\u2019s strategy to minimise the impact of Covid-19 \u201cis to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity\u201d. Implicit in this is the acceptance of large numbers of deaths of vulnerable people, hence Boris Johnson saying that many families will lose loved ones. This sounds dangerously like what Malthus described in 1798 as \u201cpositive checks\u201d, which lead to premature death from disease, starvation and war, resulting in what is called a Malthusian catastrophe. In contrast, nearly every other government in Europe is pursuing a different strategy \u2013 one of containment. For once, the phrase \u201cbeing ahead of the curve\u201d, has deep meaning. Tom Conroy Dublin, Ireland \u2022 It has long been obvious that Boris Johnson exists in a moral vacuum, but to propose a public policy that tacitly accepts the potential death of thousands of people is beyond shameful and, equally so, to try to minimise its impact as the loss of loved ones before their time. Not only should we question the scientific validity of herd immunity, which the World Health Organization rejects, but also its morality. No wonder the rest of the world is looking with incredulity at the UK government\u2019s response to Covid-19. Alan Walker Professor of social policy, University of Sheffield \u2022 There is a reason why doctors take the Hippocratic oath. Now when key decisions on coronavirus are made by politicians, perhaps they should take it too. If herd immunity works, it will be at the cost of avoidable deaths \u2013 of patients, health workers and doctors. If it doesn\u2019t work, we will have a social experiment that failed, at the cost of many human lives. Boris Johnson said that \u201cmany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d. He should have finished his sentence with \u201cand many of those deaths are avoidable\u201d. Other countries aren\u2019t doing this, for good reason. If one of my friends or family die under this policy, I will seriously look at crowdfunding a judicial review. I think we should do everything possible to change this heartless and arrogant approach. Amanda Edwards Velindre, Llandysul \u2022 Tony Yates quotes Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, as explaining part of the reason for not embracing bans (on gatherings) is to encourage \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Surely this is a misinterpretation of what herd immunity is? Before the polio vaccine was developed people got polio. They didn\u2019t get herd immunity. Herd immunity is predicated on vaccination and it is the vaccinated who constitute the herd, not those with the disease. No vaccine just means more disease, not more immunity. This seems like a dangerous misunderstanding for one in such a pivotal role to make. Dr Andrew Platman GP retired, Beckenham, Kent \u2022 Your correspondents (Show us the evidence behind Covid-19 policies, Journal, 14 March) are justified in their scepticism of the government\u2019s response to Covid-19; Boris Johnson and his colleagues haven\u2019t always been transparent on other matters. However, I do trust the chief medical officer (CMO) and chief scientific adviser (CSA) \u2013 expert clinician-scientists \u2013 and they appear to be leading decision-making at the moment. The CMO and CSA are wrestling with complex, contradictory, partial and rapidly-changing data, and formulating recommendations as best they can. Of course, there\u2019s a debate to be had as to why experts in other countries are initiating more severe restrictions, and more transparency on the modelling information being used would be welcome. More proscriptive actions come with significant risks of their own. For example, closing schools will potentially remove parents employed in health and social care from the workforce at this critical time and/or expose grandparents (the most vulnerable demographic) to risk of increased viral exposure if they take on childcare responsibilities. There is a risk that the government will start to ignore the advice of the CMO and CSA; I do not believe that these two professionals would allow their public health recommendations to be overridden for political expediency. Dr Miles Maxwell Hitchin, Hertfordshire \u2022 In the last 10 years of Tory control, the NHS has lost 100,000 doctors and nurses and 17,000 beds (Journal, 10 March). This has not been accidental, but deliberate, and has rendered the NHS incapable of dealing with this virus, whatever the government claims. I\u2019m almost 82 and feeling quite chirpy. If I eventually drop off my perch thanks to the virus and the Tories\u2019 destruction of the NHS, I intend to return and systematically haunt every guilty member of that administration on a daily basis.

      "body": "<p>Israeli political parties have backed the opposition leader, Benny Gantz, to form a government, in a shocking blow to Benjamin Netanyahu after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">appeared to come out ahead</a> in an election held earlier this month.</p> <p>The dramatic news came as a Jerusalem court postponed the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Leaders of the main parties met Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, on Sunday, giving Gantz the slimmest advantage of 61 recommendations from of a total of 120 lawmakers.</p> <p>The endorsement does not end Netanyahu\u2019s chances or guarantee Gantz will lead Israel\u2019s next administration. Before that can happen, he has up to six weeks of negotiations to forge a majority coalition in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset.</p> <p>The success of that scenario remains far from certain. While Gantz will be officially picked by the president as prime minister-designate on Monday, some of the politicians who backed him on Sunday may not also agree to join his government.</p> <p>Fifteen of the recommendations came from an alliance of Arab parties, who may have only supported Gantz to damage their political nemesis, Netanyahu. It remained unclear if the Joint List group, a merger of politicians predominantly representing Palestinian citizens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>, would join an administration led by Gantz, a former army chief with whom they have deep ideological differences.</p> <p>Gantz also won support from former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the far-right, ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party. Lieberman has repeatedly stated he would never join a government with Arab legislators, complicating Gantz\u2019s path to power.</p> <p>The dramatic news came at the end of a day in which Netanyahu\u2019s prospects appeared to be improving. A Jerusalem court announced that the long-awaited first hearing for the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial, scheduled for Tuesday, would be postponed until 24 May due to fears of the spread of the coronavirus in courthouses.</p> <p>About 210 people have been infected in Israel, with no deaths. Battling the outbreak, Israel has already imposed a series of stringent restrictions nationwide during the past few days, including barring gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down schools, hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls.</p> <p>The upcoming trial \u2013 in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">Netanyahu faces damning charges</a> of bribery, fraud and breach of trust \u2013 had been hanging over the 70-year-old leader and was set to start right as political negotiations were to begin.</p> <p>For a year, Israel has been in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/israel-limbo-third-election-twelve-months-netanyahu-gantz\">state of political paralysis</a> following three inconclusive elections, the latest of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">was held on 2 March</a>. In that time, both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister.</p> <p>With neither Netanyahu or Gantz commanding a majority of support, the president has urged them to agree on a power-sharing unity deal. He summoned them for an emergency meeting on Sunday night in the hopes of breaking the deadlock.</p> <p>\u201cWe must establish a government as soon as possible that will lead our people at this complex time,\u201d Rivlin said.</p> <p>After months of acrimonious election campaigning, it is unclear if politicians will be able to break the stalemate.</p> <p>In a clear attempt to block his rival, Gantz has pushed for legislation to bar anyone indicted for a crime from heading an administration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, temporarily freed from his legal woes, Netanyahu has urged Gantz and other politicians to fall in line, arguing that the coronavirus outbreak meant the formation of an \u201cemergency government \u2026 led by me\u201d was all the more vital.</p> <p>Under Israel\u2019s current caretaker administration, the government is restricted in its ability to tackle any major crisis. For example, it cannot pass a budget.</p> <p>Netanyahu said his proposed emergency government could last six months, or that he and Gantz could agree to a four-year unity administration. In that case, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next two years.</p> <p>\u201cThe state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <p>Gantz accused the prime minister of manipulation during a public health scare. \u201cWhen you get serious, we can talk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Separately, in an opaque move that raised immediate privacy issues, Netanyahu announced on Saturday night that he intended to use technology developed for counter-terrorism to track people with the coronavirus digitally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6eabacd19541741268ef781476223c7dd998b4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6eabacd19541741268ef781476223c7dd998b4a/85_76_3162_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in his upcoming trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUp until today I avoided using these measures in the civilian population but there is no choice,\u201d Netanyahu said in a televised news conference.</p> <p>The announcement, which needs further approval, prompted accusations of mass surveillance. </p> <p>Noa Landau, who works for the progressive local Haaretz newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-coronavirus-crisis-cannot-chip-away-at-israeli-democracy-1.8675891\">wrote</a> an article on Sunday against what she called the \u201cpoliticisation of the health crisis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIsrael is already on the edge when it comes to violations of individual rights.

It was the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime.</p> <p>The 70-year-old leader, the longest-serving in the small country\u2019s history, could face more than a decade in prison if convicted. He faces three separate inquiries, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</p> <p><strong>Case 1,000<br></strong>The first case, known as case 1,000, involves allegations of receiving gifts such as cigars, champagne and jewellery, from billionaires, including the Hollywood businessman Arnon Milchan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/james-packer\">Australian casino operator </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/james-packer\">James Packer</a>, allegedly in exchange for favours. Milchan and Packer are not facing any charges.</p> <p><strong>Case 2,000<br></strong>In case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/16/israeli-publisher-questioned-after-tapes-talks-netanyahu-leaked-arnon-mozes-yedioth-ahronoth\">country\u2019s top-selling newspaper, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/16/israeli-publisher-questioned-after-tapes-talks-netanyahu-leaked-arnon-mozes-yedioth-ahronoth\">Yedioth Ahronoth</a>, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.</p> <p><strong>Case 4,000</strong></p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/police-question-benjamin-netanyahu-over-third-corruption-case\">the third and most serious case, case 4,000</a>, the prime minister is accused of offering incentives worth close to \u00a3200m to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns.</p> <p><strong>How has he responded?</strong></p> <p>Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, alleging he is the victim of a politically-motivated witch-hunt.</p> <p><strong>Is that it for his legal woes?</strong></p> <p>No. There was also a separate case not involving Netanyahu, but his wife, Sara, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/israeli-court-convicts-sara-netanyahu-for-misusing-state-funds\">convicted</a> in June of illegally misusing thousands of pounds of public funds for lavish meals, despite having an in-house cook provided by the state.</p>",

The endorsement does not end Netanyahu\u2019s chances or guarantee Gantz will lead Israel\u2019s next administration. Before that can happen, he has up to six weeks of negotiations to forge a majority coalition in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset. The success of that scenario remains far from certain. While Gantz will be officially picked by the president as prime minister-designate on Monday, some of the politicians who backed him on Sunday may not also agree to join his government. Fifteen of the recommendations came from an alliance of Arab parties, who may have only supported Gantz to damage their political nemesis, Netanyahu. It remained unclear if the Joint List group, a merger of politicians predominantly representing Palestinian citizens of Israel, would join an administration led by Gantz, a former army chief with whom they have deep ideological differences. Gantz also won support from former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the far-right, ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party. Lieberman has repeatedly stated he would never join a government with Arab legislators, complicating Gantz\u2019s path to power. The dramatic news came at the end of a day in which Netanyahu\u2019s prospects appeared to be improving. A Jerusalem court announced that the long-awaited first hearing for the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial, scheduled for Tuesday, would be postponed until 24 May due to fears of the spread of the coronavirus in courthouses. About 210 people have been infected in Israel, with no deaths. Battling the outbreak, Israel has already imposed a series of stringent restrictions nationwide during the past few days, including barring gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down schools, hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. The upcoming trial \u2013 in which Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust \u2013 had been hanging over the 70-year-old leader and was set to start right as political negotiations were to begin. For a year, Israel has been in a state of political paralysis following three inconclusive elections, the latest of which was held on 2 March. In that time, both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister. With neither Netanyahu or Gantz commanding a majority of support, the president has urged them to agree on a power-sharing unity deal. He summoned them for an emergency meeting on Sunday night in the hopes of breaking the deadlock. \u201cWe must establish a government as soon as possible that will lead our people at this complex time,\u201d Rivlin said. After months of acrimonious election campaigning, it is unclear if politicians will be able to break the stalemate. In a clear attempt to block his rival, Gantz has pushed for legislation to bar anyone indicted for a crime from heading an administration. Meanwhile, temporarily freed from his legal woes, Netanyahu has urged Gantz and other politicians to fall in line, arguing that the coronavirus outbreak meant the formation of an \u201cemergency government \u2026 led by me\u201d was all the more vital. Under Israel\u2019s current caretaker administration, the government is restricted in its ability to tackle any major crisis. For example, it cannot pass a budget. Netanyahu said his proposed emergency government could last six months, or that he and Gantz could agree to a four-year unity administration. In that case, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next two years. \u201cThe state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,\u201d Netanyahu said. Gantz accused the prime minister of manipulation during a public health scare. \u201cWhen you get serious, we can talk,\u201d he said. Separately, in an opaque move that raised immediate privacy issues, Netanyahu announced on Saturday night that he intended to use technology developed for counter-terrorism to track people with the coronavirus digitally. \u201cUp until today I avoided using these measures in the civilian population but there is no choice,\u201d Netanyahu said in a televised news conference. The announcement, which needs further approval, prompted accusations of mass surveillance. Noa Landau, who works for the progressive local Haaretz newspaper, wrote an article on Sunday against what she called the \u201cpoliticisation of the health crisis\u201d. \u201cIsrael is already on the edge when it comes to violations of individual rights. The foundations of our system of government must not be undermined under the auspices of a viral outbreak,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis really is an emergency \u2013 over the protection of democracy.\u201d Q&amp;A: Netanyahu corruption allegations Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, indicted Netanyahu in November. It was the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime. The 70-year-old leader, the longest-serving in the small country\u2019s history, could face more than a decade in prison if convicted. He faces three separate inquiries, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Case 1,000 The first case, known as case 1,000, involves allegations of receiving gifts such as cigars, champagne and jewellery, from billionaires, including the Hollywood businessman Arnon Milchan and Australian casino operator James Packer, allegedly in exchange for favours. Milchan and Packer are not facing any charges. Case 2,000 In case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the country\u2019s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage. Case 4,000 In the third and most serious case, case 4,000, the prime minister is accused of offering incentives worth close to \u00a3200m to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns. How has he responded? Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, alleging he is the victim of a politically-motivated witch-hunt. Is that it for his legal woes? No. There was also a separate case not involving Netanyahu, but his wife, Sara, who was convicted in June of illegally misusing thousands of pounds of public funds for lavish meals, despite having an in-house cook provided by the state.",

It was, said the Wordsworth expert Kathleen Jones, an \u201camazingly close bond\u201d founded on the deep psychological trauma of being split up as young children and then reunited in their late teens. The National Trust is staging the exhibition at its property Wordsworth House and Garden in Cockermouth, Cumbria, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the poet\u2019s birth. It explores Wordsworth\u2019s childhood and how his life and poetry was shaped by the wild, outdoor upbringing he and his sister enjoyed at the house on the banks of the River Derwent. Among the exhibits will be Dorothy\u2019s tiny baby bonnet, handsewn most likely by their mother Ann. It is the only item from their childhood to survive. William was eight and Dorothy was seven when their mother died and they were split up. She was sent to relatives in Yorkshire and five years later they became orphans when their father died. Dorothy did not reunite with her brother for nine years. \u201cDorothy was passed around like a parcel,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt had a deep psychological impact. \u201cFor someone like Dorothy who was very sensitive, very emotional \u2013 what we\u2019d now call highly strung \u2013 that childhood bond with her brother was all she could remember of security and love, everything to do with family.\u201d When they finally met again a syndrome called \u201cgenetic attraction\u201d happened, said Jones. \u201cThey looked into each other\u2019s eyes and they saw a similar person with similar feelings \u2026 this is what happens when you fall in love with someone.

It also found that only 70% of action plans set by the CPS were not met with a proper response by police.</p> <p>Responding to questions from the Guardian, the CPS said it had made HMCPSI aware of its internal report in \u201cdiscussions\u201d before the start of its inspection, but had only shared it at the inspectorate\u2019s request in January. Asked if the HMCPSI was aware of the report when it was carrying out its inspection, the HMCPSI responded: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>The internal CPS review, marked \u201cofficial-sensitive\u201d, found disproportionate requests included requests for \u201ca weather report from 1972\u201d, \u201cschool reports from the 70s and 80s\u201d and care home records where there \u201cwas no indication that these could have or would be relevant\u201d.</p> <p>The review examined 200 cases that had been \u201cadministratively finalised\u201d between October 2018 and March 2019. These are cases the CPS counts as \u201cclosed\u201d where police have not responded to requests for further evidence. However, the cases could be reopened at a later date were new evidence provided. The proportion of administratively finalised cases increased from 22% to 29% of all pre-charge decisions made by the CPS between 2017-18 and 2018-19.</p> <p>Other prosecutors had requested \u201call phone downloads\u201d and \u201cCCTV or 999 calls when it was clear there was no such evidence\u201d. The report said the cases showed \u201csome evidence that the exact nature of social media \u2026 was not understood by all prosecutors, for example the request for \u2018downloads of all Snapchat communication\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In another case, a CPS prosecutor gave police an action plan with 30 actions \u201cnot specific to the case but a cut and paste set of generic actions\u201d. These requests had the effect of killing the case, as police did not, or were not able to, meet the demand for information.</p> <p>The report also reveals concerns about police actions. It found almost two-thirds of cases were of \u201cpoor quality\u201d, which \u201cindicates that the police are using the CPS as gatekeepers to quality control their files rather than undertaking proper supervision themselves\u201d. The report also found police were \u201cfailing to respond whatsoever\u201d to appropriate requests for more evidence in 75% of cases.</p> <p>The CPS said the report found no evidence that disproportionate requests contributed to delays. It added that when requests were disproportionate, often they were necessary but prosecutors had failed to set clear parameters. All specialist rape and sexual assault prosecutors had received training to address the issues raised in the internal report, said a spokesperson.</p> <p>Both the CPS and the HMCPSI said the reports had different aims, samples of cases and methodologies. The CPS said it \u201cwould not have been appropriate to share the report\u201d and that \u201croutine assurance work\u201d was not \u201croutinely circulated externally\u201d.</p> <p>In December, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/17/fall-in-convictions-due-to-justice-system-at-breaking-point\">HMCPSI concluded it had found no evidence</a> the CPS was taking a more risk-averse approach \u2013 a claim not examined in the internal report \u2013 and charging easier cases to improve its prosecution rate. The CPS said the inspectorate report had provided an \u201cindependent affirmation of its charging decisions\u201d. The report was fiercely criticised by victims\u2019 groups, which accused it of betraying \u201c<a href=\"https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/womens-groups-hugely-disappointed-at-hmcpsi-rape-prosecution-report/\">a huge lack of curiosity</a>\u201d about the collapse in rape charging.</p> <p>In a letter to the End Violence Against Women coalition seen by the Guardian, Kevin McGinty, the chief inspector of the HMCPSI, agreed the report was \u201cincomplete\u201d and said it had been expedited in order to inform the government review.</p> <p>\u201cWe were unable to explore matters arising as we went on, or to cover ground we felt needed further work,\u201d he wrote, adding that the inspectorate had recommended a further joint inspection with the police.</p> <p>The findings of the internal report confirmed the experience of Rape Crisis\u2019s independent sexual violence advocates, said Katie Russell, a campaigner within the Rape Crisis movement.</p> <p>\u201cWhat possible reason could the CPS have for effectively sitting on these findings and not even sharing them with the inspectorate?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy would they not want to fully and frankly engage with the ongoing end-to-end review into rape prosecutions which the government has ordered because there is widespread acknowledgement that the current system is failing? That is a question for them to answer.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/12/prosecutions-in-england-and-wales-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade\">Falling prosecution and conviction rates</a>, which are at a 10-year low, prompted the review of the criminal justice system\u2019s treatment of rape. The number of rape charges have dropped by 51% since 2014, while reported rapes have more than doubled in the same period, from 20,751 to 58,657 in 2018-19.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office said: \u201cImproving how the criminal justice system tackles rape and sexual violence is a priority of this government. A cross-government review into rape and serious sexual offence cases is under way, which will look at a wide range of issues within the system.\u201d</p> <p>The CPS is also facing a proposed <a href=\"https://www.centreforwomensjustice.org.uk/news/2020/3/10/stop-the-decriminalisation-of-rape\">legal case</a> brought by the <a href=\"https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/\">End Violence Against Women </a><a href=\"https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/\">coalition</a> represented by the <a href=\"https://www.centreforwomensjustice.org.uk/\">Centre for Women\u2019s Justice</a>, who argue that the CPS has unofficially changed its policy and practice in charging rape and has become more risk-averse. A judge will decide on Tuesday whether to grant a judicial review against the CPS.</p>",

The review examined 200 cases that had been \u201cadministratively finalised\u201d between October 2018 and March 2019. These are cases the CPS counts as \u201cclosed\u201d where police have not responded to requests for further evidence. However, the cases could be reopened at a later date were new evidence provided. The proportion of administratively finalised cases increased from 22% to 29% of all pre-charge decisions made by the CPS between 2017-18 and 2018-19. Other prosecutors had requested \u201call phone downloads\u201d and \u201cCCTV or 999 calls when it was clear there was no such evidence\u201d. The report said the cases showed \u201csome evidence that the exact nature of social media \u2026 was not understood by all prosecutors, for example the request for \u2018downloads of all Snapchat communication\u2019.\u201d In another case, a CPS prosecutor gave police an action plan with 30 actions \u201cnot specific to the case but a cut and paste set of generic actions\u201d. These requests had the effect of killing the case, as police did not, or were not able to, meet the demand for information. The report also reveals concerns about police actions. It found almost two-thirds of cases were of \u201cpoor quality\u201d, which \u201cindicates that the police are using the CPS as gatekeepers to quality control their files rather than undertaking proper supervision themselves\u201d. The report also found police were \u201cfailing to respond whatsoever\u201d to appropriate requests for more evidence in 75% of cases. The CPS said the report found no evidence that disproportionate requests contributed to delays. It added that when requests were disproportionate, often they were necessary but prosecutors had failed to set clear parameters. All specialist rape and sexual assault prosecutors had received training to address the issues raised in the internal report, said a spokesperson. Both the CPS and the HMCPSI said the reports had different aims, samples of cases and methodologies. The CPS said it \u201cwould not have been appropriate to share the report\u201d and that \u201croutine assurance work\u201d was not \u201croutinely circulated externally\u201d. In December, the HMCPSI concluded it had found no evidence the CPS was taking a more risk-averse approach \u2013 a claim not examined in the internal report \u2013 and charging easier cases to improve its prosecution rate. The CPS said the inspectorate report had provided an \u201cindependent affirmation of its charging decisions\u201d. The report was fiercely criticised by victims\u2019 groups, which accused it of betraying \u201ca huge lack of curiosity\u201d about the collapse in rape charging. In a letter to the End Violence Against Women coalition seen by the Guardian, Kevin McGinty, the chief inspector of the HMCPSI, agreed the report was \u201cincomplete\u201d and said it had been expedited in order to inform the government review. \u201cWe were unable to explore matters arising as we went on, or to cover ground we felt needed further work,\u201d he wrote, adding that the inspectorate had recommended a further joint inspection with the police. The findings of the internal report confirmed the experience of Rape Crisis\u2019s independent sexual violence advocates, said Katie Russell, a campaigner within the Rape Crisis movement. \u201cWhat possible reason could the CPS have for effectively sitting on these findings and not even sharing them with the inspectorate?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy would they not want to fully and frankly engage with the ongoing end-to-end review into rape prosecutions which the government has ordered because there is widespread acknowledgement that the current system is failing? That is a question for them to answer.\u201d Falling prosecution and conviction rates, which are at a 10-year low, prompted the review of the criminal justice system\u2019s treatment of rape. The number of rape charges have dropped by 51% since 2014, while reported rapes have more than doubled in the same period, from 20,751 to 58,657 in 2018-19. A spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office said: \u201cImproving how the criminal justice system tackles rape and sexual violence is a priority of this government. A cross-government review into rape and serious sexual offence cases is under way, which will look at a wide range of issues within the system.\u201d The CPS is also facing a proposed legal case brought by the End Violence Against Women coalition represented by the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, who argue that the CPS has unofficially changed its policy and practice in charging rape and has become more risk-averse. A judge will decide on Tuesday whether to grant a judicial review against the CPS.",

The current total of cases in the country now stands at over 60, with internal transmission of the virus becoming more common. Caseloads across Africa are still small compared with elsewhere but there were widespread fears that countries would have difficulty coping with large outbreaks, with only short supplies of ventilators and other critical equipment in many places. The Irish government on Sunday said all bars in the country should close until at least the end of the month after videos of singing in packed Dublin venues on Saturday sparked anger on social media. The move comes just two days before the country\u2019s national day, St Patrick\u2019s Day.",

      "bodyText": "People over 70 will soon be asked to stay at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the risk of contracting coronavirus, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said. Ministers are also not ruling out ordering the closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops as the coronavirus pandemic escalates. Such drastic measures would go beyond what the government anticipated in its coronavirus action plan, but countries such as France have ordered closures on this scale and Hancock said the government would do whatever was necessary to protect life. Hancock confirmed the government will soon tell people over 70 that they will need to self-isolate at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the disease \u2013 but his terminology caused some confusion, leading Scottish officials to stress that elderly people would not be asked to avoid all contact with other people. In an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Hancock said asking the over-70s to stay self-isolated would be \u201ca very big ask\u201d, but that it was part of the government\u2019s action plan because it would be necessary to protect them.

The health department said guidelines saying exactly what the new advice for the over-70s would mean in practice would be published in due course. In the Marr interview, Hancock was asked if the government would follow countries such as France and Spain, where bars, restaurants and shops have been closed, apart from supermarkets and pharmacies. Hancock replied: \u201cWe have not ruled that out. We will do what is necessary. Because the top priority is to protect life, and you do that by protecting the vulnerable, and by protecting the NHS.

He added: \u201cI doubt that actually we will need to use it much, because people are being very responsible.\u201d Hancock also confirmed the government may ban gatherings of more than 500 people \u2013 a move that is already being introduced in Scotland from Monday. In recent days, the government has faced growing criticism for not matching some of the more stringent public health measures taken in other European countries, where schools have been closed, public gatherings banned and entry restrictions imposed. Hancock defended the UK\u2019s response. He said it was doing more coronavirus testing than in any country apart from China, South Korea, and Italy, where the outbreak has been more severe. And he rejected claims that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere. \u201cWe are similar to many countries,\u201d he claimed. \u201cFor instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others. \u201cIt is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time. We are prepared to take, if we need to, all the sorts of measures [discussed], but we will do it based on the science.\u201d He said that \u201cin the coming days\u201d the government would publish details of the modelling it was using when determining its policy. He also said he was confident food supplies would continue. He was also relatively dismissive of an open letter signed by more than 300 scientists from UK universities criticising the government\u2019s approach. In the letter, the group, most of whom are not epidemiologists but instead specialists in subjects like maths, call for \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures to be introduced immediately, and argue that aiming for \u201cherd immunity\u201d is not viable. Asked about the letter, Hancock said: \u201cWhat we will do is listen to all the credible scientists. What we will not do is deviate from having a plan that is based on the best scientific advice.\u201d Hancock also argued that the letter was misstating government policy in suggesting that it wanted to build up herd immunity to coronavirus among the population at large. \u201cHerd immunity is not our goal or policy, it\u2019s a scientific concept\u201d, he said. \u201cOur policy is to protect lives and to beat this virus.\u201d",

She does a profound service to the complex life of this remarkable woman with her new biography, Truganini: Journey Through the Apocalypse. Pybus ventures beyond the tragic trope that has defined Truganini, the sadness surrounding her death and the horror of the exhumation and display of her remains by the Royal Society of Tasmania.</p> <p>This was part of Truganini\u2019s life and postmortem, of course. But Pybus brings so much more of Truganini\u2019s experience to the page. She gives us her story of survival and at times unimaginable physical endurance in what Pybus aptly describes as an apocalypse (<em>Ria Warrawah</em> \u2013 the intangible force of evil unleashed with European arrival \u2013 to Truganini\u2019s Nuenonne people) that descended upon the first Tasmanians post-invasion.</p> <p>Their world was upended. Under the governor George Arthur martial law was declared as the colony tried to rid itself \u2013 through war, ongoing massacres and poisonings, and later the absurdly ineffective \u201cblack line\u201d \u2013 of Tasmania\u2019s First Peoples.</p> <p>Pybus presents Truganini\u2019s life as one of resilience and of adaptation to precarious pathways through dispossession. It shows her negotiating the sexual demands of the violent sealers and others, and of the traditions she managed to cling to \u2013 including marriage to Wooredy \u2013 despite the constant infringements of colonialism\u2019s avaricious commodification of land, resources and Indigenous bodies.</p> <p>The figure \u2013 and the rich archive \u2013 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-national-picture-overwhelming-reminder-of-wilful-gaps-in-australias-history\">George Augustus Robinson</a>, a self-styled missionary who took it upon himself to \u201cconciliate\u201d with the Indigenes of Tasmania (and to remove them from their land and herd them into one isolated place) partly informs Pybus\u2019s Truganini. But where other scholars and writers have mined the Robinson archive for all it says about this perplexing and morally ambiguous man himself, Pybus has drawn from his invaluable, decades\u2019-long observation of Truganini.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4157059f8003cf085da3ed72a55774766c5c65f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4157059f8003cf085da3ed72a55774766c5c65f9/0_0_1795_2776/647.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Truganini by Cassandra Pybus\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Truganini emerges as wholly, spiritually and physically in sync with her natural world, having rejected Christianity despite the efforts of Robinson and others to inculcate her and the others.</p> <p>We learn of the fabulous swimmer who relished diving for crayfish (there\u2019s an encounter with a shark!).

      "bodyText": "Too many prominent Indigenous figures are recalled in popular myth and history as supposedly having slipped between traditional and European worlds. Even when historians began affording greater texture to the Indigenous experience in the mid-20th century (novelists and dramaturgs would follow), popular distorted myths about some of the most important Aboriginal people of colonial times nonetheless persisted. Bennelong is still fallaciously recounted as an obstreperous drunk who ultimately fitted in with neither his people nor with the colonists. Bungaree\u2019s epic part in Matthew Flinders\u2019 circumnavigation and his unofficial role as emissary to the invaders is often eclipsed by his later descent into drunkenness (in a colony whose currency was grog), ill health and vagrancy. And then there is Truganini, storied incorrectly as \u201cthe last of the Tasmanian Aboriginal race\u201d, a Nuenonne woman from one of the Earth\u2019s most beautiful realms \u2013 the paradise off the south-east coast of Tasmania that became Bruny Island. Truganini\u2019s life has frequently been crafted into something of a three-act \u201ctragedy\u201d \u2013 a trope that focuses, first, on her idyllic early life and European disruption; second, on her dispossession from country; and third, her 1876 death at Oyster Cove near Hobart and the later display of her remains in a cabinet at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. So very much else that came between has been forgotten or gone untold. Tragedy, of course \u2013 as Emma Dortins wrote in relation to Bennelong \u2013 \u201cis not life or history\u201d. Indeed, tragedy is a dramatic reinterpretation of the peaks and troughs \u2013 a precis \u2013 of both, with all of the rounding out of story and the honing off of the barnacles of human experience that impede smooth narrative. The Tasmanian historian and writer Cassandra Pybus pushes the historiographical boundary on Truganini. She does a profound service to the complex life of this remarkable woman with her new biography, Truganini: Journey Through the Apocalypse. Pybus ventures beyond the tragic trope that has defined Truganini, the sadness surrounding her death and the horror of the exhumation and display of her remains by the Royal Society of Tasmania. This was part of Truganini\u2019s life and postmortem, of course. But Pybus brings so much more of Truganini\u2019s experience to the page. She gives us her story of survival and at times unimaginable physical endurance in what Pybus aptly describes as an apocalypse (Ria Warrawah \u2013 the intangible force of evil unleashed with European arrival \u2013 to Truganini\u2019s Nuenonne people) that descended upon the first Tasmanians post-invasion. Their world was upended. Under the governor George Arthur martial law was declared as the colony tried to rid itself \u2013 through war, ongoing massacres and poisonings, and later the absurdly ineffective \u201cblack line\u201d \u2013 of Tasmania\u2019s First Peoples. Pybus presents Truganini\u2019s life as one of resilience and of adaptation to precarious pathways through dispossession. It shows her negotiating the sexual demands of the violent sealers and others, and of the traditions she managed to cling to \u2013 including marriage to Wooredy \u2013 despite the constant infringements of colonialism\u2019s avaricious commodification of land, resources and Indigenous bodies. The figure \u2013 and the rich archive \u2013 of George Augustus Robinson, a self-styled missionary who took it upon himself to \u201cconciliate\u201d with the Indigenes of Tasmania (and to remove them from their land and herd them into one isolated place) partly informs Pybus\u2019s Truganini. But where other scholars and writers have mined the Robinson archive for all it says about this perplexing and morally ambiguous man himself, Pybus has drawn from his invaluable, decades\u2019-long observation of Truganini. Truganini emerges as wholly, spiritually and physically in sync with her natural world, having rejected Christianity despite the efforts of Robinson and others to inculcate her and the others. We learn of the fabulous swimmer who relished diving for crayfish (there\u2019s an encounter with a shark!). We see a woman who loved children, a desired and desirous lover who took agency where she could, and a canny negotiator with Robinson and the colonial authorities who were pursuing the extinction of her people. Of Truganini\u2019s possum trapping, for example, Pybus writes: \u201cShe deftly wove a rope from the long wiry grass and hooked it around the trunk of a tree to pull herself up, cutting notches in the bark for her feet as she ascended. Once in the canopy, she would grab at the possum to knock it to the ground.\u201d While this communion with nature should be no surprise, Pybus\u2019s portrayal of that relationship is laced with moving poignancy, her prose about the bounty and wonder of country and Truganini\u2019s connection to it as lush and beautiful as the land itself. There is a reason for this. Pybus is descended from the colonist who received the biggest freehold land grant on Truganini\u2019s Nuenonne country. \u201cWooredy and Truganini compel my attention and emotional engagement because it is to them I owe a charmed existence in the temperate paradise where I now live and where my family has lived for generations,\u201d she writes. It is a profound hook for an important book that goes a long way towards reinvesting Truganani with all that has been eclipsed by the trope of her \u201ctragedy\u201d. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist.

      "bodyText": "Independent MP Zali Steggall is launching a national advertising campaign drawing on the summer bushfire crisis to rally public support for her private member\u2019s bill on climate change, due to be introduced to parliament later this month. The campaign will kick off on Monday and include digital billboards, and bus shelter and telephone booth advertisements across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide. The ads will feature images of the destruction wreaked by the summer bushfire season, with one pointing to the experience of \u201cone hell of a summer\u201d and another featuring a koala in burnt bushland. The ads call for the public to support Steggall\u2019s climate act, making the appeal that \u201cwhat happens next is up to you\u201d. The campaign is being funded by community climate change groups, donors of the Climate Act Now campaign and pro-bono assistance, with more than 120 \u201cClimate Act Now\u201d advertisements set to appear across the country this month. Steggall is hoping to garner bipartisan support for a national climate change framework bill aimed at transitioning Australia to a decarbonised economy that is based on the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act, passed in 2008. The bill would put in place national plans for climate change adaption and enshrine a net-zero emissions target by 2050 to be reviewed every five years by a newly established independent climate change commission. Steggall has been arguing that the framework legislation would take the politics out of the climate change policy debate, while putting in place an effective process for national targets, actions and reporting. She has been lobbying both Labor and government MPs to allow a conscience vote on the legislation, and has already locked in the support of the crossbench in the lower house. On Monday, four digital billboards will be in place in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, followed by a rotating poster advertisement campaign across the Sydney CBD and North Sydney, and in Melbourne. Steggall said the campaign was designed to keep the legislation in the public eye, and said there was strong support coming from North Sydney and Wentworth, where moderate Liberal MPs are under pressure to do more on climate change. \u201cAfter such a horrific summer, this advertising campaign is there to remind Australians that the country needs a sensible approach to climate change,\u201d Steggall said. \u201cWe have received enormous support from our neighbouring electorates of Wentworth and North Sydney who want their local federal members to vote for the bill.\u201d So far more than 73,000 Australians have supported the climate change bill through the \u201cClimate Act Now\u201d website. While the bill will be introduced when parliament next sits on 23 March, there is a risk that it will be left to languish on the notice paper without government support. If the government refuses to allow debate on the bill in the House of Representatives after it is introduced, Centre Alliance, which is co-sponsoring the legislation, could introduce it into the Senate later in the year. This would force Labor to declare its hand on the bill, which has so far failed to land a position, saying it will never come to a vote in the lower house. \u201cFor Zali Steggall\u2019s bill to be considered, Scott Morrison would need to allow a full debate in the parliament,\u201d the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said last month. As part of the campaign, B-Corp \u2013 a group that certifies businesses for making positive decisions on the community and the environment \u2013 will support the bill , backed by 16 of B-corp\u2019s 300 registered companies.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government only engaged a creative agency for its national public health campaign about coronavirus on 3 March, more than a month after the first case of the disease was reported in Australia. According to the contract notice on AusTender, the health department engaged Carbon Media to provide creative services for the Covid-19 campaign on 3 March. A spokesman for the health minister Greg Hunt defended the timeline, telling Guardian Australia the department \u201chad access to creative services from a range of sources, both internal and external, well before Carbon Media was engaged\u201d but conceded the contract for the national campaign began on 3 March. Labor has seized on the revelation to step up its criticism that the Morrison government was too slow to educate the public about preventing the spread of coronavirus through hygiene and social distancing measures. On Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia will require all international arrivals in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days and is now encouraging social distancing for others. The escalation comes on top of a recommendation that from Monday all non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled. The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable. The $407,700 Carbon Media contract is due to run until 30 June and was awarded by limited tender, subject to the exemption on open tenders for government advertising contracts. Carbon Media has numerous other contracts with the health department including for seasonal influenza communications and childhood immunisation. Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, told Guardian Australia: \u201cTime will tell whether this is in an effective advertising campaign, but Labor questions why it took the government over two months to commence an advertising campaign to provide the most basic public health information on Covid-19. \u201cThey should be doing more, sooner.\u201d The coronavirus ads, which were rolled out on Saturday, direct Australians to visit health.gov.au to access up-to-date advice: Another version of the ad urges people who have been overseas or had contact with people with coronavirus to call ahead before visiting the doctor and stay home if the illness is mild: Australians are directed to cough or sneeze into their arm or a tissue, and to wash their hands regularly: On Wednesday Hunt announced the $30m ad campaign as part of the $2.4bn health response to the coronavirus. So far, the health department has paid $2.3m to Mediabrands Australia for the media buy for the campaign, and $56,375 to Snapcracker Research and Strategy for concept testing for the campaign. Those contracts run from 12 March and 4 March. The department has paid $17,270 to Ansible Pty Ltd to develop a mobile application, although it is unclear if the contract relates to development of a new coronavirus app. At a press conference on Sunday Bowen said Labor welcomed the fact the advertising campaign has started in earnest. \u201cI have made the point consistently that the public information has not always been clear and consistent,\u201d he said. Bowen said the campaign \u201cneeds to be a nationally coordinated, fully integrated campaign to allay misinformation on social media\u201d and should also \u201cmake people\u2019s obligations for self-isolation very clear\u201d. On Monday, Scott Morrison told ABC\u2019s AM resources for the campaign were put in place \u201cseveral weeks ago\u201d and the government had taken coronavirus seriously since mid-January. He cited travel bans and evacuations from Wuhan, without explaining why the health campaign was commissioned on 3 March. The first case of coronavirus in Australia was confirmed on 25 January. On 11 March Hunt defended the pace of rolling out ads by noting the government had already started using signage at airports to communicate about measures to combat coronavirus. \u201cIn addition, we\u2019ll be focusing on online, electronic media and messages to the home to make sure that people have as many avenues [to receive information] as possible,\u201d he said. Hunt\u2019s spokesman said the government had run \u201ca range of messages and advertising, particularly targeted at the Chinese community and international travellers as was the original need in the early phases of the outbreak\u201d. \u201cThe public has been provided with the latest developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak through nearly daily press conferences, media releases, updates on the department\u2019s website and social media channels.\u201d \u201cMultiple fact sheets and communiques have been posted on the website and distributed to key stakeholders and industries to address their specific requirements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Western Sahara liberation movement has taken New Zealand\u2019s superannuation fund to the country\u2019s highest court over its investments in farms that use phosphate illegally mined in the occupied territory. New Zealand is one of the few remaining countries \u2013 and last western nation \u2013 that accepts imports from the contested territory in West Africa, forcibly occupied by Morocco since 1975. Morocco\u2019s claims to the territory are largely unrecognised internationally. The Polisario Front \u2013 the political arm of the Western Saharan independence movement \u2013 has lodged documents in the New Zealand high court saying the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, with $45bn under management, is exposed to unlawful practices through its investments in farms that use Western Saharan phosphate, and interests in companies operating in the occupied territory. Fertiliser companies Ravensdown and Ballance Agri-Nutrients in New Zealand are the only companies in the western world that import phosphate from Western Sahara, spread on New Zealand farms. The phosphate rock mined in Western Sahara has low levels of cadmium suitable for New Zealand soil conditions, although alternatives are available from other sources. In 2017, the Polisario Front won a South African court action, seizing a load of fertiliser in port in Port Elizabeth, ordered by Ballance Agri-Nutrients, and bound for New Zealand. The court ruled Morocco had no legal claim to the phosphate, and could not sell it to a third party. \u201cThe Sahrawi people are determined to protect their natural resources with all available means,\u201d the Polisario Front\u2019s representative of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to Australia and New Zealand, Kamal Fadel, said. \u201cThis legal action is a message to all who are involved in the exploitation of Sahrawi natural resources that they face legal action, reputational risks and investor withdrawal.\u201d The movement\u2019s claim to the high court said the NZ Super Fund\u2019s involvement in Western Saharan phosphate trade was inconsistent with statutory obligations to manage and administer the fund in a manner \u201cconsistent with avoiding prejudice to New Zealand\u2019s reputation as a responsible member of the world community\u201d. Fadel said the court action was determined to stop the extraction of Western Saharan resources and said the NZ Super Fund must \u201cput an end to their illegal involvement in the exploitation of the natural resources of our country\u201d. \u201cNew Zealand companies have plundered our phosphate for decades. The blood phosphate illegal trade must end.\u201d A spokesman for the Guardians of the NZ Super Fund said the fund was invested in several farms that used Western Sahara-sourced phosphate, and had a limited equity exposure through passive index funds to international companies that operated in the territory. He said the allegations made by the Polisario Front about the fund\u2019s investments were not accepted by the fund. \u201cWe take our obligations as a responsible investor very seriously. These obligations are integrated into the Guardians\u2019 investment activities through its responsible investment framework. \u201cThe Guardians believes it has appropriately applied its responsible investment framework in a manner that meets its legislative obligations to manage the fund in a manner consistent with best practice portfolio management and avoiding prejudice to New Zealand\u2019s reputation as a responsible member of the world community. The spokesman said NZ Super Fund\u2019s position was supported by independent third party assessments including the UN. \u201cThe framework and the Guardians\u2019 wider work programme are closely aligned to the United Nations-backed principles for responsible investment, which graded the Guardians\u2019 activities as A or A+ in its annual assessment of governance and strategy for responsible investment.\u201d Internal NZ Super Fund documents reveal the issue of Western Sahara has concerned fund investment managers for years. \u201cNew Zealand Super Fund says we need to understand alternatives to Western Sahara phosphate rock,\u201d a 2019 internal briefing document, revealed under the official information act, argues. \u201c[The] ministry of foreign affairs and trade says there are alternative sources. New Zealand only started getting phosphate from the Western Sahara in the 1980s.\u201d The document also says New Zealand Super Fund is directly exposed because it owns 25 farms. \u201cNew Zealand Super Funds\u2019 farms are continuing to be supplied by Ballance. NZSF has, however, asked its farm manager FarmRight and Ballance to explore whether or not, going forward, there are commercially-feasible alternatives to obtaining phosphate from the Western Sahara.\u201d Ballance Agri-Nutrients and Ravensdown are the only two members of the Fertiliser Association of NZ. They supply 98% of all fertiliser used in NZ. \u201cThe Fertiliser Association continues to believe that the local inhabitants of Western Sahara should benefit from the resources of their territory, and that any activities involving these resources should be undertaken in their best interests and for their benefit, however also consider that the United Nations is the most appropriate organisation to make judgements on situations like this,\u201d the internal briefing document argues. Western Sahara is regarded by the United Nations as a \u201cnon-self-governing territory\u201d, but international proposals for referenda and autonomy plans have failed to break the four-decade impasse. Since 2012, international funds, including the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, National Employment Savings Trust in the UK, the Netherlands\u2019 APG, AP Funds in Sweden, and FDC (Luxembourg) have divested from companies that extract resources from Western Sahara for ethical reasons.",

The former prime minister told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria: \u201cWhen I hear the rhetoric around Bernie Sanders, who by the way is obviously a very capable guy, it\u2019s eerily familiar to anyone who\u2019s just watched the debacle unfold in the British Labour party and our election defeat in the UK, which is essentially the worst in our 120-year history.\u201d In December, in an election primarily centered on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party was beaten heavily by Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. Reaction to Blair\u2019s comments on social media was swift, with many pointing out that Sanders\u2019 signature policy \u2013 universal healthcare \u2013 has been a feature of life in Britain since the setting up of the publicly funded National Health Service in 1948. Critics also point out that the British left gained support after Blair began introducing limited privatisation into the NHS. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, surged in the early stages of the Democratic primary and was a clear frontrunner after the Nevada caucuses in February. But Joe Biden has mounted a stunning comeback, dominating the Super Tuesday primaries and subsequent contests. Amid the growing chaos of the coronavirus outbreak and Trump\u2019s attempts to contain it, the senator and the former vice-president will debate behind closed doors in Washington on Sunday night. The next votes will be held in Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois on Tuesday. A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed Biden way ahead with Democratic voters and performing better than Sanders in a notional race against Trump. But the Vermont senator has said he will not drop out, aiming instead to shape the ideological outlook of the party on issues such as healthcare, student debt and the minimum wage and perhaps to surge back into contention should Biden stumble or fall. Like establishment figures and moderates in Democratic ranks, Blair doubts the wisdom of that decision. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s an appetite for socialist revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t in Britain, I\u2019d be surprised if there was in the US. And so I think \u2026 if they go down that path it\u2019s an enormous gamble. \u201cPut it like this: you\u2019re essentially saying, \u2018Put aside the middle ground, we\u2019re not really going to try to reach that, instead we\u2019re going to up the turnout and that\u2019s exactly the strategy of Corbyn\u2019s Labour party in the UK and it failed, drastically.\u201d Biden has attracted moderates, independents, suburban voters and a huge percentage of African Americans, many seemingly motivated to simply choose the candidate most likely to beat Trump in November. Sanders has done well among the young but hopes of a surge in turnout from such voters have not borne fruit. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m a skeptic about him,\u201d Blair said. \u201cNow on the other hand I think what is important to recognise is that progressive politics has got two big challenges. \u201cFirst of all, my view of the populism is you\u2019ve got to be very careful when you\u2019re from the liberal or progressive side of politics, because if you\u2019re not careful you tend to say that, \u2018These people who are voting for Donald Trump or Brexit, they\u2019re just irrational people, I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re doing it and you\u2019ve just got to hope this is a moment that passes.\u2019 \u201cNo, they\u2019re doing it for reasons, and whereas populism can exploit grievances they don\u2019t invent them. The grievances are real.\u201d Blair said he knew Biden well and thought him \u201chighly capable and decent\u201d, but said the challenge if he did win the White House would be to effect real change while in office. Blair also said he was \u201ca passionate believer that if the left goes down the path of trying to fight a culture war with the right, it will lose comprehensively and it really should not do that\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest fund manager has bowed to client pressure and agreed to launch its first fossil fuel-free ethical pension fund later this year. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which has been one of the most outspoken fund managers over the climate crisis, made the decision after a number of clients raised concerns that stocks such as Shell were still being included in its range of ethical funds. Those clients include PensionBee \u2013 an online pension provider that handles \u00a3750m-worth of client assets for more than 75,000 customers \u2013 which is expected to be among the new fund\u2019s first investors. It wrote to LGIM last year after being inundated with questions from its own customers about the fact that Shell was among the top 10 holdings in one of the investment firm\u2019s ethically focused Future World funds. PensionBee is believed to be one of the fund\u2019s top five owners, with more than \u00a360m invested. \u201cIt is clear that there is increasingly strong demand for pension products that give customers the choice to divest from oil,\u201d PensionBee said. While the full stock list for the new fossil fuel-free fund has not yet been confirmed, it will exclude oil companies and take a wider ethical stance by barring investments in tobacco, weapons makers and pure coal manufacturers. Emma Douglas, the head of defined contribution at LGIM, said: \u201cBased on our funds in our Future World range, the new fund will be driven by long-term thematic analysis, the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations and active ownership, which means engaging to bring about real, positive change in the companies we invest in.\u201d LGIM, which has more than \u00a31tn in assets, said the fund will be open to corporate pension schemes and individuals. The investment firm has defended holding Shell in its Future World range of funds. Those funds are governed by its climate impact pledge, meaning it is willing to exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as for lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis. LGIM has said it needs to balance environmental and financial concerns when putting together the investment portfolio, previously noting that Shell is one of the largest payers of dividends in the UK. Its climate pledge has led LGIM to dump stakes in China Construction Bank, Rosneft Oil, Japan Post Holdings, Subaru, Loblaw and Sysco Corporation in 2018. Last year, it cut a further five stocks from the ethical funds, including the oil corporation ExxonMobil, the insurer MetLife, the maker of Spam, Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) last year. However, a Guardian analysis last year also found LGIM as a whole had spent about $367m (\u00a3285m) between January and November, increasing its stake in those companies in other parts of the business, even when accounting for the divestments. LGIM openly admits it continues to hold stakes in companies excluded from those environmentally and socially focused funds, saying it gives them the opportunity to engage with the board and ultimately influence company behaviour. Commenting on the launch of the fossil fuel-free fund, PensionBee said: \u201cWe hope this is just the start of all savers using their investments to transform the world they live in \u2013 for the better of the planet, society and their retirement.\u201d",

And in this one, those of us who cling on to collectivist, egalitarian ideas can discern things that speak to our sense of how the world ought to be organised. To find crumbs of political comfort in a dire public health emergency might seem inappropriate. But unforeseen events always have consequences beyond their immediate impact: just because they fit some of our existing beliefs that does not make them any less real. Even if the new imperative of \u201csocial distancing\u201d sounds like the ultimate example of individualism and frantic panic-buying does not exactly look like an expression of altruism, our shared humanity has also been brought to the surface, or soon will be. As the rapid appearance online of community help initiatives proves, we are already getting used to doing some of what the common good requires. And as usually happens with sudden adverse events, the arrival of the Covid-19 virus has pushed the state and public sector into the foreground. The government machine suddenly looks less like the sclerotic inconvenience that annoys people like Dominic Cummings than the most basic means of help we have.

      "body": "<h2>Cat Women<br>Alice Maddicott</h2> <p><em>September</em><em>, pp144, \u00a312.99 </em></p> <p>This whimsical project is so satisfyingly of a piece with its subject, it\u2019s easy to overlook a certain lack of polish. Few creatures, the author notes, have the power to define you as cats do \u2013 if, that is, you\u2019re a woman. It\u2019s different for men: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ernesthemingway\" title=\"\">Ernest Hemingway</a> got away with having a houseful of them. \u201cCat Lady\u201d, conversely, is an identity, \u201cthe epitome of sad and lonely female failure\u201d. Maddicott only partially explores the roots of these negative associations, nodding to pagan deities and magical familiars while devoting the bulk of her book to \u201corphan\u201d images of cats and their female owners, vintage photographs found in junk shops and online auction sites. From the spectral to the plain kitsch, each prompts a fanciful meditation on the forms that this unique bond takes.</p> <h2>Saving Missy<br>Beth Morrey</h2> <p><em>HarperCollins, pp384, \u00a312.99 </em></p> <p>Millicent Carmichael may be 79 years old but this cosy debut novel is a bildungsroman nonetheless. Having never put her Cambridge University degree to use, surrendering instead to motherhood and the careful tending of a scholarly husband, Missy now spends her days in \u201cgalactic isolation\u201d, drifting around her cavernous Stoke Newington home in her nightie, knocking back the sherry as she moons over faded photo albums, until a chance encounter offers a path to happiness. Key to her transformation is Bobby, the \u201cmad mongrel\u201d of a mutt she\u2019s pressured into caring for. Morrey signposts her tale\u2019s mysteries a little too obviously, but it builds up an affable momentum as it swings between hope and melancholy, and a smattering of ancient Greek adds character.</p> <h2>Where the Hornbeam Grows<br>Beth Lynch</h2> <p><em>Weidenfeld</em><em>, pp288, \u00a38.99 </em></p> <p>When Beth Lynch\u2019s husband was offered a job in Switzerland, the time seemed right for a fresh adventure: she\u2019d just left a career as an Eng lit lecturer, they spoke French and German, and there were no children to uproot. Unfortunately, they found their host country chilly and rule-obsessed. Lonesome and \u201cliving a stranger\u2019s life\u201d, Lynch sets about recreating her most essential experience of home: the garden her parents made in Sussex. Planting anemones, aquilegias and hellebore, sedums and rudbeckia, she slowly transforms the grounds of their cottage in the dark-wooded hills of the Jura. Fusing memoir with travelogue and horticulture, this enchanting paean to green-fingered solace touches on topics from globalisation to inheritance, eschewing the indulgent excesses of nature writing in favour of a crisp lyricism and frequent bursts of drollery.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/cat-women-9781912836062.html\" title=\"\"><em>Cat Women</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/saving-missy-9780008334024.html\" title=\"\"><em>Saving Missy</em></a> or <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/where-the-hornbeam-grows-9781474606905.html\" title=\"\"><em>Where the Hornbeam Grows</em></a>, go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop. com</a>.

      "bodyText": "Cat Women Alice Maddicott September, pp144, \u00a312.99 This whimsical project is so satisfyingly of a piece with its subject, it\u2019s easy to overlook a certain lack of polish. Few creatures, the author notes, have the power to define you as cats do \u2013 if, that is, you\u2019re a woman. It\u2019s different for men: Ernest Hemingway got away with having a houseful of them. \u201cCat Lady\u201d, conversely, is an identity, \u201cthe epitome of sad and lonely female failure\u201d. Maddicott only partially explores the roots of these negative associations, nodding to pagan deities and magical familiars while devoting the bulk of her book to \u201corphan\u201d images of cats and their female owners, vintage photographs found in junk shops and online auction sites. From the spectral to the plain kitsch, each prompts a fanciful meditation on the forms that this unique bond takes. Saving Missy Beth Morrey HarperCollins, pp384, \u00a312.99 Millicent Carmichael may be 79 years old but this cosy debut novel is a bildungsroman nonetheless. Having never put her Cambridge University degree to use, surrendering instead to motherhood and the careful tending of a scholarly husband, Missy now spends her days in \u201cgalactic isolation\u201d, drifting around her cavernous Stoke Newington home in her nightie, knocking back the sherry as she moons over faded photo albums, until a chance encounter offers a path to happiness. Key to her transformation is Bobby, the \u201cmad mongrel\u201d of a mutt she\u2019s pressured into caring for. Morrey signposts her tale\u2019s mysteries a little too obviously, but it builds up an affable momentum as it swings between hope and melancholy, and a smattering of ancient Greek adds character. Where the Hornbeam Grows Beth Lynch Weidenfeld, pp288, \u00a38.99 When Beth Lynch\u2019s husband was offered a job in Switzerland, the time seemed right for a fresh adventure: she\u2019d just left a career as an Eng lit lecturer, they spoke French and German, and there were no children to uproot. Unfortunately, they found their host country chilly and rule-obsessed. Lonesome and \u201cliving a stranger\u2019s life\u201d, Lynch sets about recreating her most essential experience of home: the garden her parents made in Sussex. Planting anemones, aquilegias and hellebore, sedums and rudbeckia, she slowly transforms the grounds of their cottage in the dark-wooded hills of the Jura. Fusing memoir with travelogue and horticulture, this enchanting paean to green-fingered solace touches on topics from globalisation to inheritance, eschewing the indulgent excesses of nature writing in favour of a crisp lyricism and frequent bursts of drollery. \u2022 To order Cat Women, Saving Missy or Where the Hornbeam Grows, go to guardianbookshop. com.

But, come the afternoon, in a session about policymaking, something changed. \u201cSuddenly I was like: look at all these disparate people coming together figuring out how they would run the world!

But then I looked at myself and thought: what am I doing to change things?\u201d</p> <p>Seddon developed the play on-and-off until April 2017, when Theresa May called a snap general election and she spotted a tweet from the Yorkshire party asking for candidates. \u201cAnd I thought that was really funny. What political party gets candidates by just doing an open call? So I tweeted: \u2018Go on, stand!\u2019 as a joke to my followers. Then the party immediately messaged me saying: \u2018We\u2019d love you to stand.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She met party hacks at a cafe in Leeds and told them that, actually, her plan was to write a play about other people throwing their hat in the ring. \u201cBut then they said. \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you stand?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Do you feel represented in the current political system?\u2019 And I said no.\u201d</p> <p>They told her: \u201cYou can do as much or as little campaigning as you like. We just want a name on the ballot.\u201d As a Labour supporter, she worried about spitting the vote: \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t want to get 50 votes and then Labour lost by 50 votes.\u2019 But the Yorkshire party said, \u2018That won\u2019t happen because no one will vote for you. No one wastes their vote in the general election.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cThen I went away and thought, \u2018What an amazing, mad opportunity.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Why not?\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before she wondered if she was making a terrible mistake. She received an email from <a href=\"https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/34569/daniel-gascoigne\">Daniel Gascoigne</a>, whom she calls \u201cthe Justin Bieber of the Yorkshire party. I think he was about 19 and standing in Pontefract, helped by his nan. He said he got an email from the campaign manager of Labour in my area, asking me to drop out.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\">Ukip</a> had announced it wouldn\u2019t contest Leeds North East, prompting Labour to panic that Ukip\u2019s votes would all go to the Conservatives. This would imperil Labour\u2019s Fabian Hamilton, who had been the constituency\u2019s MP since the Blair landslide of 1997.</p> <p>\u201cSo suddenly I was thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, what have I done?\u2019\u201d But she was at the point of no return. The Yorkshire party had paid her \u00a3500 deposit and she was on the ballot. She considered putting out a flyer saying, \u201cDon\u2019t vote for me!\u201d but decided to carry on. \u201cI thought, \u2018Right, well, I\u2019d rather do something hopeful and actually figure what I stand for and what I want from the world.\u201d</p> <p>The party partnered her with its \u201cbest door-knocker\u201d, a physics teacher and railway enthusiast called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobbuxtonyorksp?lang=en\">Dr Bob Buxton</a>. \u201cHe knocks on, like, 200 a day and his wife meets him with a sandwich halfway through.\u201d Then she got the courage up to go out alone \u2013 and was astonished by the reaction. \u201cI\u2019d ask people, \u2018Do you feel represented by Westminster?\u2019 And every single person said no.\u201d No one was rude to her and one woman even offered her a fiver. \u201cI think she felt sorry for me. She thought I was very brave having my face on a flyer.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Suddenly, from being very apathetic, I started believing in my power to change things and everybody's power to take part in democracy, for all its flaws</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The campaign quickly took on meaning: \u201cIt started becoming this real, galvanising thing. Suddenly, from being fairly apathetic, I started believing in my power to change things and, actually, everybody\u2019s power to take part and participate in our democracy, for all its flaws.\u201d</p> <p>The only sinister moment came after a hustings. A man came up to her and said: \u201cVery well done, but you better not be taking Fabian\u2019s votes.\u201d She told him: \u201cActually, I don\u2019t really believe anyone owns anyone\u2019s votes.\u201d Then, she claims, he leaned into her and whispered: \u201cWe know where you live.\u201d</p> <p>There is no suggestion that this person was a Labour official and, in the end, Hamilton increased his majority to almost 17,000. Seddon polled 303 votes, better than the Alliance for Green Socialism and the Christian People\u2019s Alliance.</p> <p>Was it worth it? \u201cI still don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s more a question for audiences to go home and think about. But I think the lesson I learned was that the most hopeful thing you can do is take part.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://leedsplayhouse.org.uk/events/say-yes-to-tess-a-new-musical-2/\">Say Yes to Tess is at Leeds Playhouse</a>, 26 March-4 April.

No one wastes their vote in the general election.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cThen I went away and thought, \u2018What an amazing, mad opportunity.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Why not?\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before she wondered if she was making a terrible mistake. She received an email from Daniel Gascoigne, whom she calls \u201cthe Justin Bieber of the Yorkshire party. I think he was about 19 and standing in Pontefract, helped by his nan. He said he got an email from the campaign manager of Labour in my area, asking me to drop out.\u201d Ukip had announced it wouldn\u2019t contest Leeds North East, prompting Labour to panic that Ukip\u2019s votes would all go to the Conservatives. This would imperil Labour\u2019s Fabian Hamilton, who had been the constituency\u2019s MP since the Blair landslide of 1997. \u201cSo suddenly I was thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, what have I done?\u2019\u201d But she was at the point of no return. The Yorkshire party had paid her \u00a3500 deposit and she was on the ballot. She considered putting out a flyer saying, \u201cDon\u2019t vote for me!\u201d but decided to carry on. \u201cI thought, \u2018Right, well, I\u2019d rather do something hopeful and actually figure what I stand for and what I want from the world.\u201d The party partnered her with its \u201cbest door-knocker\u201d, a physics teacher and railway enthusiast called Dr Bob Buxton. \u201cHe knocks on, like, 200 a day and his wife meets him with a sandwich halfway through.\u201d Then she got the courage up to go out alone \u2013 and was astonished by the reaction. \u201cI\u2019d ask people, \u2018Do you feel represented by Westminster?\u2019 And every single person said no.\u201d No one was rude to her and one woman even offered her a fiver. \u201cI think she felt sorry for me. She thought I was very brave having my face on a flyer.\u201d The campaign quickly took on meaning: \u201cIt started becoming this real, galvanising thing. Suddenly, from being fairly apathetic, I started believing in my power to change things and, actually, everybody\u2019s power to take part and participate in our democracy, for all its flaws.\u201d The only sinister moment came after a hustings. A man came up to her and said: \u201cVery well done, but you better not be taking Fabian\u2019s votes.\u201d She told him: \u201cActually, I don\u2019t really believe anyone owns anyone\u2019s votes.\u201d Then, she claims, he leaned into her and whispered: \u201cWe know where you live.\u201d There is no suggestion that this person was a Labour official and, in the end, Hamilton increased his majority to almost 17,000. Seddon polled 303 votes, better than the Alliance for Green Socialism and the Christian People\u2019s Alliance. Was it worth it? \u201cI still don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s more a question for audiences to go home and think about. But I think the lesson I learned was that the most hopeful thing you can do is take part.\u201d \u2022 Say Yes to Tess is at Leeds Playhouse, 26 March-4 April. Touring in September/October.",

In our generation, it feels like we have to start over and over again, that things are constantly changing,\u201d she says. \u201cFor Ray, she\u2019s even more alien because she comes out of water and it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t know how the world works. The only thing she has is her body.\u201d</p> <p>That embodiment is a key feature of Tsangari\u2019s approach, one which saw Labed goose-stepping and dancing throughout Attenberg. \u201cUltimately, Athina looks at the world with a lot of love,\u201d Labed says. \u201cShe\u2019s observing it as if she\u2019s from another planet somehow, without judgment. That\u2019s what makes Trigonometry captivating.\u201d</p> <p>Despite having vowed to \u201cnever do TV\u201d, it seems Labed has caught the bug and is currently filming a new series in France, where she will return to her roots as a dancer. \u201cWhen I read something good I can\u2019t resist it,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are some themes that will always resonate no matter the time or place: family, relationships, desire, love.\u201d Even on Sunday nights on the BBC.</p> <p><em>Trigonometry starts tonight, 10pm, BBC Two</em></p>",

In our generation, it feels like we have to start over and over again, that things are constantly changing,\u201d she says. \u201cFor Ray, she\u2019s even more alien because she comes out of water and it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t know how the world works. The only thing she has is her body.\u201d That embodiment is a key feature of Tsangari\u2019s approach, one which saw Labed goose-stepping and dancing throughout Attenberg. \u201cUltimately, Athina looks at the world with a lot of love,\u201d Labed says. \u201cShe\u2019s observing it as if she\u2019s from another planet somehow, without judgment. That\u2019s what makes Trigonometry captivating.\u201d Despite having vowed to \u201cnever do TV\u201d, it seems Labed has caught the bug and is currently filming a new series in France, where she will return to her roots as a dancer. \u201cWhen I read something good I can\u2019t resist it,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are some themes that will always resonate no matter the time or place: family, relationships, desire, love.\u201d Even on Sunday nights on the BBC. Trigonometry starts tonight, 10pm, BBC Two",

      "bodyText": "The UK car industry risks losing out to Europe in the race to build major battery factories that are crucial to the sector\u2019s future, putting jobs at risk across the country, a government-backed research body has warned. A failure to attract so-called gigafactories to make batteries for electric cars could cost the UK 105,000 jobs by 2040, forecasts by the Faraday Institution show. Carmakers around the world are racing to switch production from internal combustion engines towards electric cars with zero exhaust emissions, amid tightening limits on carbon dioxide output and the threat of outright bans that could come as early as 2032 in the UK. Chinese companies are the main suppliers of lithium ion batteries to European manufacturers, but carmakers are looking to produce their own closer to their factories, meaning billions of pounds of investments are up for grabs, with many UK factories competing directly against their counterparts in France, Germany and Italy. \u201cOver time, car production will migrate to where the battery production is,\u201d said Neil Morris, the Faraday Institution\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re at or near the fork in the road.\u201d If the UK were to build enough batteries to replace fossil fuel car production, direct employment in the automotive industry could rebound from about 170,000 jobs in 2020 to as many as 220,000 in 2040. However, a worst-case outcome with no large-scale UK battery production could lead domestic vehicle producers to \u201cgradually wind down their production of internal combustion engine vehicles, progressively eliminating the jobs of the 170,000 people directly employed in the UK automotive sector,\u201d Faraday\u2019s report says. France and Germany have announced plans for up to \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.3bn) of investments in battery production, as they seek to secure employment for millions of workers in their automotive industries. The European commission has also approved a separate plan by Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden to pump \u20ac3.2bn into starting a European battery industry. The continued uncertainty over Brexit negotiations has further complicated the British government\u2019s efforts to secure private investment in a gigafactory. Despite the decline of its homegrown industry, the UK has managed to carve out a position as the fourth-largest car producer in Europe. However, all of the UK\u2019s large factories are owned by foreign companies, many of whom have been averse to making investments until the long-term trading relationship with the EU is decided. The UK\u2019s departure from the EU was thought by industry insiders to be a factor in Honda\u2019s decision to close its Swindon factory, as well as Nissan\u2019s U-turn on building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. The Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port is also under threat from a bad Brexit deal. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said in November that uncertainty over the Brexit process was a key reason for the US electric carmaker\u2019s choice of Berlin for its first European gigafactory, rather than a UK location.

      "bodyText": "While the fate of this football season remains in the balance, Virgil van Dijk has spoken of his fear that Liverpool\u2019s first title success in three decades will eventually be secured in an empty stadium while fans are excluded because of the coronavirus pandemic. The season is on hold with action due to restart on 4 April, though such an early resumption is widely considered unlikely. The government is expected to announce imminently a ban on mass gatherings, including sporting events, to come into force next weekend, while the Premier League is to meet on Thursday to discuss their next steps. \u201cIf we won it in an empty stadium and the fans weren\u2019t there, I\u2019d be gutted for them,\u201d said Van Dijk. \u201cObviously if there are no fans at Anfield then it will be a bit of a blow \u2013 no one wants to play games without the fans.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI am at war with the status quo of society and I am at war with those in control and power,\u201d said Genesis P-Orridge in 1989. \u201cI\u2019m at war with hypocrisy and lies, I\u2019m at war with the mass media.\u201d P-Orridge, who has died of leukaemia aged 70, stuck to the task of delivering aesthetic shocks and trampling over cultural taboos with impressive dedication and across multiple disciplines.</p> <p>Perhaps best known for work with the bands <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/throbbing-gristle\" title=\"\">Throbbing Gristle</a> and Psychic TV, P-Orridge, who used s/he as a pronoun, wrote songs about mass murder, mutilation, the occult and fascism. Throbbing Gristle\u2019s track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AzX1XIij4\" title=\"\">Zyklon B Zombie</a> was a reference to the poison gas used in the Nazi death camps. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuG6dLhBZM4\" title=\"\">Hamburger Lady</a> (from their 1978 album DOA) was inspired by the story of a burns victim.</p> <p>Unstintingly harsh and abrasive, Throbbing Gristle nonetheless built a select but dedicated following. Their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats (1979) \u2013 an exercise in Germanic electro-pop rather than jazz-funk \u2013 took them to No 6 on the UK indie chart.</p> <p>Psychic TV, in whose oeuvre a playful pop music sensibility could be discerned, among experiments with electronic noise, psychedelia and droning repetition, seemed to favour subtle infiltration rather than the bludgeoning approach of Throbbing Gristle. They reached 67 on the UK pop chart in 1986 with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1yr8w_vZ5E\" title=\"\">Godstar</a>, a song about the death of the Rolling Stones\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/brian-jones\" title=\"\">Brian Jones</a>. More remarkable was their project, starting in 1986, to record a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months. They managed 14 in 18 months, but this was enough to earn them a Guinness World Records entry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6df4db0366f5c49c0a4fa9eeb2950bbea6505a5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6df4db0366f5c49c0a4fa9eeb2950bbea6505a5a/0_77_3300_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis P-Orridge with Throbbing Gristle performing at the Coachella Valley festival in Indio, California, in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Genesis P-Orridge with Throbbing Gristle performing at the Coachella Valley festival in Indio, California, in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Axel Koester/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But music was only one of the ways in which P-Orridge channelled their creative energies. Psychic TV made their debut in 1982 at a four-day multimedia event in London and Manchester called the Final Academy, which featured artists including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1997/aug/04/fiction.williamburroughs\" title=\"\">William S Burroughs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/art.classics\" title=\"\">Brion Gysin</a> \u2013 whose cut-up writing technique had been a powerful influence on P-Orridge \u2013 in a mix of music, literature, film and video. In 1969, P-Orridge had begun laying the groundwork for future explorations by forming COUM Transmissions, a group based in Hull who performed improvised theatre and music shows. They adopted a logo of a partially erect penis, and infused their work with Dada-inspired absurdity.</p> <p>They became successful enough to win grants from the Yorkshire Arts Association, the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Council, though this did not bring with it a yearning for respectability. Their performances became increasingly extreme, featuring body-cutting and involving P-Orridge and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/14/cosey-fanni-tutti-throbbing-gristle-coum-art-sex-music-hull-2017\" title=\"\">Cosey Fanni Tutti</a> (AKA Christine Carol Newby) having sex onstage. In her autobiography Art Sex Music (2017), Fanni Tutti made allegations that P-Orridge had been a violent and manipulative partner, which were denied by P-Orridge.</p> <p>Throbbing Gristle was founded on 3 September 1975 (on the 36th anniversary of Britain declaring war on Germany), comprising Tutti and P-Orridge alongside Chris Carter and Peter Christopherson, and for a time continued alongside COUM.</p> <p>COUM\u2019s show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/18/genesis-p-orridge-ica-exhibition-1976\" title=\"\">Prostitution</a>, staged at the ICA in London in 1976, provoked uproar with its pornographic images, sculptures fashioned from used tampons and transvestite security guards, prompting the Scottish Conservative MP <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-sir-nicholas-fairbairn-1573984.html\" title=\"\">Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</a> to describe P-Orridge and Tutti as \u201cwreckers of civilisation\u201d.</p> <p>P-Orridge was born Neil Megson in Longsight, Manchester, the child of Muriel and Ronald Megson. Ronald was a travelling salesman, jazz drummer and former actor who had survived Dunkirk with the British Army in 1940. The family moved to Essex, then later to Cheshire, where Neil attended Gatley primary school and won a scholarship to Stockport grammar school. In 1964 Neil was sent to the private Solihull school.</p> <p>There tastes for literature and the avant-garde were developed and Neil became fascinated with the writings of the magician and occultist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/15/unseen-aleister-crowley-writings-short-story-the-drug\" title=\"\">Aleister Crowley</a>. (In 1981 Neil would form Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, an association of occultists.) In 1965 Neil founded his first band, Worm, with some school friends. They recorded an album, Early Worm (1968), but only one vinyl copy of it was produced.</p> <p>In 1968, Neil went to Hull University to study social administration and philosophy, but dropped out the following year and moved to London joining the Transmedia Explorations commune in Islington. By the end of 1969 Neil was back in Hull, where COUM Transmissions was developed with John Shapeero.</p> <p>The later phases of P-Orridge\u2019s life were in some ways the most startling. P-Orridge moved to the US in the 1990s, following allegations (that subsequently proved false) in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary that s/he had been involved in satanic ritual abuse.</p> <p>In 1993 P-Orridge met Jacqueline Breyer, who was working at a New York S&amp;M dungeon. She adopted the name <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lady-jaye-breyer-p-orridge-397604.html\" title=\"\">Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge</a>, and they moved in together in Queens, New York. They married in California in 1995, the year that P-Orridge was badly injured while escaping a fire at the Los Angeles home of the record producer Rick Rubin. He was awarded $1.5m compensation in 1998.</p> <p>The couple set about using plastic surgery to become mirror images of one another, beginning with matching breast implants on Valentine\u2019s Day 2003, and continuing with work on eyes and nose, liposuction and hormone therapy. They dressed in identical outfits, and P-Orridge coined the term \u201cpandrogyny\u201d to express the idea that they fused into a third person, Breyer P-Orridge, who only existed when they were together. P-Orridge subsequently preferred the self-descriptor \u201cwe\u201d, though did not object to being called \u201cs/he\u201d.</p> <p>This pandrogyny project was cut short when Breyer died of acute heart arrhythmia in 2007, an especially painful loss at a time when P-Orridge was beginning to receive highbrow acclaim. The Invisible-Exports gallery in New York staged a retrospective of their collages, <a href=\"http://invisible-exports.com/exhibitions/30-years-of-being-cut-up/\" title=\"\">30 Years of Being Cut Up</a>, and in 2009 <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/genesis-p-orridge-16646\" title=\"\">Tate</a> Britain purchased their archive.</p> <p>Marie Losier\u2019s documentary film The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye was released in 2011, and in 2016 the Rubin Museum of Art in New York hosted <a href=\"http://rubinmuseum.org/events/exhibitions/genesis-breyer-p-orridge\" title=\"\">Try to Altar Everything</a>, an exhibition of P-Orridge\u2019s paintings, sculptures and installations. In 2018 s/he published Brion Gysin: His Name Was Master, a collection of interviews and essays.</p> <p>In 2003 P-Orridge had unveiled PTV3, a new band drawing on the legacy of Psychic TV. They released four albums and several EPs between 2007 and 2016. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/10/genesis-p-orridge-throbbing-gristle\" title=\"\">2018</a> they performed at Heaven in London. </p> <p>P-Orridge is survived by two daughters, Genesse and Caresse, from a first marriage, to Paula Brooking, which ended in divorce.</p> <p>\u2022 Genesis P-Orridge (Neil Andrew Megson), musician, writer and performance artist, born 22 February 1950; died 14 March 2020</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI am at war with the status quo of society and I am at war with those in control and power,\u201d said Genesis P-Orridge in 1989. \u201cI\u2019m at war with hypocrisy and lies, I\u2019m at war with the mass media.\u201d P-Orridge, who has died of leukaemia aged 70, stuck to the task of delivering aesthetic shocks and trampling over cultural taboos with impressive dedication and across multiple disciplines. Perhaps best known for work with the bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, P-Orridge, who used s/he as a pronoun, wrote songs about mass murder, mutilation, the occult and fascism. Throbbing Gristle\u2019s track Zyklon B Zombie was a reference to the poison gas used in the Nazi death camps. Hamburger Lady (from their 1978 album DOA) was inspired by the story of a burns victim. Unstintingly harsh and abrasive, Throbbing Gristle nonetheless built a select but dedicated following. Their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats (1979) \u2013 an exercise in Germanic electro-pop rather than jazz-funk \u2013 took them to No 6 on the UK indie chart. Psychic TV, in whose oeuvre a playful pop music sensibility could be discerned, among experiments with electronic noise, psychedelia and droning repetition, seemed to favour subtle infiltration rather than the bludgeoning approach of Throbbing Gristle. They reached 67 on the UK pop chart in 1986 with Godstar, a song about the death of the Rolling Stones\u2019 Brian Jones. More remarkable was their project, starting in 1986, to record a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months. They managed 14 in 18 months, but this was enough to earn them a Guinness World Records entry. But music was only one of the ways in which P-Orridge channelled their creative energies. Psychic TV made their debut in 1982 at a four-day multimedia event in London and Manchester called the Final Academy, which featured artists including William S Burroughs and Brion Gysin \u2013 whose cut-up writing technique had been a powerful influence on P-Orridge \u2013 in a mix of music, literature, film and video. In 1969, P-Orridge had begun laying the groundwork for future explorations by forming COUM Transmissions, a group based in Hull who performed improvised theatre and music shows. They adopted a logo of a partially erect penis, and infused their work with Dada-inspired absurdity. They became successful enough to win grants from the Yorkshire Arts Association, the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Council, though this did not bring with it a yearning for respectability. Their performances became increasingly extreme, featuring body-cutting and involving P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti (AKA Christine Carol Newby) having sex onstage. In her autobiography Art Sex Music (2017), Fanni Tutti made allegations that P-Orridge had been a violent and manipulative partner, which were denied by P-Orridge. Throbbing Gristle was founded on 3 September 1975 (on the 36th anniversary of Britain declaring war on Germany), comprising Tutti and P-Orridge alongside Chris Carter and Peter Christopherson, and for a time continued alongside COUM. COUM\u2019s show Prostitution, staged at the ICA in London in 1976, provoked uproar with its pornographic images, sculptures fashioned from used tampons and transvestite security guards, prompting the Scottish Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn to describe P-Orridge and Tutti as \u201cwreckers of civilisation\u201d. P-Orridge was born Neil Megson in Longsight, Manchester, the child of Muriel and Ronald Megson. Ronald was a travelling salesman, jazz drummer and former actor who had survived Dunkirk with the British Army in 1940. The family moved to Essex, then later to Cheshire, where Neil attended Gatley primary school and won a scholarship to Stockport grammar school. In 1964 Neil was sent to the private Solihull school. There tastes for literature and the avant-garde were developed and Neil became fascinated with the writings of the magician and occultist Aleister Crowley. (In 1981 Neil would form Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, an association of occultists.) In 1965 Neil founded his first band, Worm, with some school friends. They recorded an album, Early Worm (1968), but only one vinyl copy of it was produced. In 1968, Neil went to Hull University to study social administration and philosophy, but dropped out the following year and moved to London joining the Transmedia Explorations commune in Islington. By the end of 1969 Neil was back in Hull, where COUM Transmissions was developed with John Shapeero. The later phases of P-Orridge\u2019s life were in some ways the most startling. P-Orridge moved to the US in the 1990s, following allegations (that subsequently proved false) in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary that s/he had been involved in satanic ritual abuse. In 1993 P-Orridge met Jacqueline Breyer, who was working at a New York S&amp;M dungeon. She adopted the name Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge, and they moved in together in Queens, New York. They married in California in 1995, the year that P-Orridge was badly injured while escaping a fire at the Los Angeles home of the record producer Rick Rubin. He was awarded $1.5m compensation in 1998. The couple set about using plastic surgery to become mirror images of one another, beginning with matching breast implants on Valentine\u2019s Day 2003, and continuing with work on eyes and nose, liposuction and hormone therapy. They dressed in identical outfits, and P-Orridge coined the term \u201cpandrogyny\u201d to express the idea that they fused into a third person, Breyer P-Orridge, who only existed when they were together. P-Orridge subsequently preferred the self-descriptor \u201cwe\u201d, though did not object to being called \u201cs/he\u201d. This pandrogyny project was cut short when Breyer died of acute heart arrhythmia in 2007, an especially painful loss at a time when P-Orridge was beginning to receive highbrow acclaim. The Invisible-Exports gallery in New York staged a retrospective of their collages, 30 Years of Being Cut Up, and in 2009 Tate Britain purchased their archive. Marie Losier\u2019s documentary film The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye was released in 2011, and in 2016 the Rubin Museum of Art in New York hosted Try to Altar Everything, an exhibition of P-Orridge\u2019s paintings, sculptures and installations. In 2018 s/he published Brion Gysin: His Name Was Master, a collection of interviews and essays. In 2003 P-Orridge had unveiled PTV3, a new band drawing on the legacy of Psychic TV. They released four albums and several EPs between 2007 and 2016. In 2018 they performed at Heaven in London. P-Orridge is survived by two daughters, Genesse and Caresse, from a first marriage, to Paula Brooking, which ended in divorce. \u2022 Genesis P-Orridge (Neil Andrew Megson), musician, writer and performance artist, born 22 February 1950; died 14 March 2020",

Ei Group \u2013 formerly known as Enterprise Inns and which owns a portfolio of more than 4,000 pubs \u2013 has told its managers that Covid-19 is not included in the group\u2019s policy with the insurer Zurich and has advised them to consider seeking further cover elsewhere. Industry sources indicated that it appears likely the problem could be replicated in other sectors. In a letter sent to publicans last week, which has been seen by the Guardian, Ei said: \u201cIt has been confirmed that Zurich is not including Covid-19 in its notifiable diseases section. As such, any business affected by Covid-19 will not be able to claim for loss of trade.\u201d The move comes after many small-business owners had thought a problem with making insurance claims for coronavirus losses had been solved. Earlier this month, the government bowed to pressure by changing its stance on insurance to declare coronavirus as a \u201cnotifiable disease\u201d \u2013 a formal classification required by many insurance policies. However, many of these existing policies cite specific diseases that businesses can claim for. As coronavirus is so new, it is not included in most of the lists. A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said: \u201cA small number of businesses may have cover in place that will specifically provide for business interruption arising from notifiable diseases.

Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks and are therefore unlikely to provide cover for the effects of global pandemics like Covid-19.\u201d Viv English, who runs the Lansdown Arms in Lewes, Sussex, said: \u201cWe have no Premier League games and maybe a 20% to 30% hit on trade. I have been paying into the policy for almost 20 years, it is compulsory for us to have it [as an Ei tenant] and it is going to let us down just when we need it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a real hit and I already know I can\u2019t pay my VAT bill. We are now paying VAT [due from] December when it was Christmas and everything was fab. We are now thinking if it is better to close down for a few months and pick up then?\u201d Last week, Rishi Sunak unveiled a range of moves in his first budget that were designed to assist pubs and other small businesses where trade is likely to be hit by the virus. The chancellor said he was also making big changes to the business rates paid by pubs this year, in an effort to insulate them from the economic effects of the coronavirus. Leisure businesses with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000 will pay no rates for the next 12 months, while the \u201cpub discount\u201d given to bars with a rateable value of up to \u00a3100,000 will increase from \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000 this year. A spokesman for Zurich said: \u201cZurich\u2019s cover for business interruption is fully aligned with the rest of the insurance market. We will always respond whenever one of our policies is triggered and are continuing to support our customers on a case-by-case basis.\u201d",

It\u2019s as if phone hacking is yesterday\u2019s story and no one cares any longer to know the truth. Neither newspapers nor broadcasters are giving the matter anything like the kind of attention they once devoted to similar intrusions into privacy by the News of the World (NoW), which led ultimately to that paper\u2019s closure. But it is time to break the silence. What journalists at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People did in the early years of this century requires proper public scrutiny. Just as important, arguably more important, is the need to discover why their grubby activities escaped censure and what the MGN board, its legal team and senior managers did, and didn\u2019t know or do, at the time. A quick bit of history. It was 2006 when the public first learned about hacking by the NoW when the paper\u2019s royal editor and a freelance \u201cprivate investigator\u201d were arrested. Three years later, the Guardian\u2019s Nick Davies revealed that many hundreds of celebrities had had their phones hacked by the paper.

At the time, the NoW\u2019s publisher, Rupert Murdoch, was identified as the villain of the piece for running a company \u2013 then trading as News International \u2013 which had allowed staff to use illegal and unethical methods to obtain stories. Plenty of journalists, however, were sure that hacking had not been confined to the NoW. I was among those who received information that similar practices had been carried out by MGN staff. Nor was I alone in raising the allegations in public and asking for comments from the management. The then chief executive, Sly Bailey, asked me for evidence. I replied by suggesting it was she who had the power, and the duty, to hold an internal inquiry. I said the same to the company\u2019s secretary and legal director, Paul Vickers. He too said there was no proof of hacking. Then BBC2\u2019s Newsnight ran a segment in which it reported on \u201croutine phone hacking in the newsroom\u201d of the Sunday Mirror. I approached Bailey and Vickers once again to ask what they thought of the Newsnight report. I was not alone. Several of the company\u2019s big shareholders also asked. They responded by ordering what was euphemistically called \u201ca review of Trinity Mirror\u2019s editorial controls and procedures\u201d. Vickers made it clear that it would not amount to an investigation of past activities by its journalists. It was, instead, a comic exercise in corporate face-saving, as was made clear in his evidence to Leveson. He explained that he had written to his group\u2019s \u201csenior editorial executives\u201d to ask whether they had any knowledge about any of their staff having intercepted phone messages. He said: \u201cAll 44 letters were returned to me signed with no issues raised.\u201d How did he keep a straight face? When Bailey appeared at the Leveson inquiry, which was set up to consider the culture, practices and ethics of the press, she was questioned about the swirl of MGN hacking rumours. Asked about the claims, she said there was \u201cno reason to investigate ... unsubstantiated rumours\u201d, adding \u201cI have seen no evidence that phone hacking has ever taken place at Trinity Mirror.\u201d No evidence existed because no editor had been put under pressure.None of the specific allegations had been put to journalists. None of the staff had been asked to come forward to give confidential statements. No internal emails had been monitored. It was the very definition of a whitewash. The following year, MGN received its first tranche of civil claims by people complaining about being hacked. They included the former England football manager, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, former footballer Garry Flitcroft, actor Shobna Gulati and Abbie Gibson, the former nanny to David and Victoria Beckham\u2019s children. All have since settled. At the latest count, 71 claimants are now engaged in legal action against MGN. Not that many people seem to know that. It is doubtful if they know that in January, Mr Justice Mann, a high court judge, spoke of allegations that MGN editors instructed private investigators to obtain information about Milly Dowler as \u201cserious and inflammatory\u201d.

      "body": "<p>In August 2009, an exhibition titled Innovative Women opened in Johannesburg, aiming to showcase the work of the city\u2019s young black female artists. The launch was attended by Lulu Xingwana, minister for arts and culture at the time, who had been invited to officially open the show. But instead of giving a speech, Xingwana stormed out of the gallery after seeing images by the photographer <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/zanele-muholi\" title=\"\">Zanele Muholi </a>that depicted naked women in close embrace. Muholi\u2019s work, said the minister, was immoral, offensive and ran contrary to \u201csocial cohesion and nation-building\u201d. South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, with discrimination on the basis of sexuality barred by law. Yet censorious attitudes such as Xingwana\u2019s towards homosexuality are widespread. Almost three-quarters of the population believe same-sex sexual activity is morally wrong, according to a 2016 survey. Similarly intolerant views are commonplace across Africa. Homosexuality is outlawed in <a href=\"https://ilga.org/maps-sexual-orientation-laws\" title=\"\">32 </a><a href=\"https://ilga.org/maps-sexual-orientation-laws\" title=\"\">of the continent\u2019s 54 nations</a>. It is punishable by life imprisonment in Uganda, Tanzania and Sierra Leone. In Sudan, southern Somalia, Somaliland, Mauritania and northern Nigeria, the penalty is death. Against that backdrop the work of a photographer such as Muholi takes on a dual role, both representing individual artistic expression and operating as a form of political activism; a means to positively assert LGBTQ+ identity in straitened circumstances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"505dbf02d389be263da8ffa8e2d626e067e706e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/505dbf02d389be263da8ffa8e2d626e067e706e8/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ama and Shana at lunch by Eric Gyamfi, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Ama and Shana at lunch by Eric Gyamfi, 2016<br></strong>Gay relationships are illegal in Ghana, where photographer Gyamfi was born, but the tender, intimate images in the series Just Like Us, where Gyamfi documents life in the country\u2019s queer communities, do not dwell on the sexuality of his subjects but emphasise their ordinariness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gyamfi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Ama and Shana at lunch by Eric Gyamfi, 2016<br></strong>Gay relationships are illegal in Ghana, where photographer Gyamfi was born, but the tender, intimate images in the series Just Like Us, where Gyamfi documents life in the country\u2019s queer communities, do not dwell on the sexuality of his subjects but emphasise their ordinariness.</p></li> </ul> <p>As well as serving to resist oppression, Muholi\u2019s imagery raises a larger question: how do you depict the reality of your life when your very existence is subject to denial or attack? The Ghanaian photographer Eric Gyamfi spent a year documenting queer individuals and communities in his series <a href=\"https://www.movingwalls.org/moving-walls/24/just-like-us.html\" title=\"\">Just Like Us</a>. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Ghana, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from his pictures. Shot in gorgeously textured black and white, the photographs are an intimate evocation of everyday life, titled with studied plainness: Ama and Shana at lunch; Kwasi at Kokrobite beach; Atsu during dance; Kwasi in bed. When queerness is regarded as the opposite of normality, the answer, suggests Gyamfi, is to insist on the very ordinariness of the people being documented and in so doing declare them as individually complex as everyone else. \u201cPeople are queer but people are also other things,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who do not understand queerness have a singular notion of what queer people are supposed to be or supposed to look like. So what I came in to do was to show people that queer people are people first and that they cut across all categories of humanness. There is no singular way of showing who a queer person is, I feel.

Also, bluntly, you may be about to have a lot more free time on your hands, so whether you have never trained before or you are a gym veteran looking to add some moves to your repertoire, there has never been a better time. We have assembled the best free online resources for at-home fitness for every level of dedication \u2013 so, whether you want to fix a dodgy hip or master your first handstand, now\u2019s the time.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://gmb.io/\" title=\"\">Gold Medal Bodies</a></strong></h2> <p>GMB\u2019s founders are gymnasts and martial artists with intimidating levels of coordination and bodily control, but their speciality is simplifying their expertise down into things that anyone can attempt \u2013 including mobility routines that will redress all the imbalances you have been cultivating from years of hunching over your phone. The larger programmes are paywalled, but resources such as the eight-move hip mobility routine are a fantastic way to make yourself more limber during even the most intense Boss Baby: Back in Business binge. If you are feeling more ambitious, there are programmes to start you down the path to (re)learning moves such as the handstand or cartwheel from the comfort of your home.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/\" title=\"\">/r/bodyweightfitness</a></strong></h2> <p>The quality of information on Reddit\u2019s various communities is variable, but bodyweight fitness is one of the best, with a wiki that features FAQs and advice on technique, as well as progressions to nudge you towards tough exercises such as the L-sit and single-leg squat. There\u2019s also plenty of helpful discussion, with regular events such as Form Check Friday that let you upload your efforts via video for more experienced users to critique. Start with the Recommended Routine, which includes dynamic stretching, strength work and mobility \u2013 or, if you\u2019re pushed for time, the Minimal Routine.

      "bodyText": "With offices shutting down and more people working from home, it\u2019s important to consider your physical fitness: exercise has proven benefits for mental wellbeing, and can be a welcome break from other daily stress. Also, bluntly, you may be about to have a lot more free time on your hands, so whether you have never trained before or you are a gym veteran looking to add some moves to your repertoire, there has never been a better time. We have assembled the best free online resources for at-home fitness for every level of dedication \u2013 so, whether you want to fix a dodgy hip or master your first handstand, now\u2019s the time. Gold Medal Bodies GMB\u2019s founders are gymnasts and martial artists with intimidating levels of coordination and bodily control, but their speciality is simplifying their expertise down into things that anyone can attempt \u2013 including mobility routines that will redress all the imbalances you have been cultivating from years of hunching over your phone. The larger programmes are paywalled, but resources such as the eight-move hip mobility routine are a fantastic way to make yourself more limber during even the most intense Boss Baby: Back in Business binge. If you are feeling more ambitious, there are programmes to start you down the path to (re)learning moves such as the handstand or cartwheel from the comfort of your home. /r/bodyweightfitness The quality of information on Reddit\u2019s various communities is variable, but bodyweight fitness is one of the best, with a wiki that features FAQs and advice on technique, as well as progressions to nudge you towards tough exercises such as the L-sit and single-leg squat. There\u2019s also plenty of helpful discussion, with regular events such as Form Check Friday that let you upload your efforts via video for more experienced users to critique. Start with the Recommended Routine, which includes dynamic stretching, strength work and mobility \u2013 or, if you\u2019re pushed for time, the Minimal Routine. A word of warning: if you don\u2019t want to invest in a pull-up bar, you\u2019ll probably want a sturdy kitchen table. Ross Training Old-school, but thoroughly modern. The boxing coach Ross Enamait has been banging the drum for DIY training since before YouTube was invented. Now in his 40s, he\u2019s a chiselled living advert for training in a garage with gear that has been duct-taped together. His blog is full of inspiration for quick workouts \u2013 such as the infamous \u201cdeck of cards\u201d, where you assign each card suit a movement and then run through them as fast as possible \u2013 but it\u2019s also worth checking out his Instagram for inspiration on making your own sandbags and ab wheels. Watch him skipping in deep snow and forget about about every excuse you have ever even considered. Cole Chance Yoga YouTube has more aspiring yoga gurus than downtown Los Angeles \u2013 so the real trick is finding one that doesn\u2019t want to make you dry-heave during your downward dog.

With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/throbbing-gristle\">Throbbing Gristle</a>, P-Orridge inadvertently helped invent an entire genre \u2013 industrial music, its name taken from the band\u2019s Industrial record label \u2013 which, over the years, developed and mutated from a misunderstood and frequently reviled cult into a platinum-selling concern.</p> <p>Intent on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/22/carter-christopherson-tutti-desertshore-review\">as one writer put it</a>, \u201cbursting open the blistered lie [that] rock and roll culture was telling about rebellion and transgression\u201d, virtually every one of Throbbing Gristle\u2019s radical, confrontational ideas was gradually subsumed into something approaching the mainstream. Electronic producers queued up to pay homage to the band, whose resident technical wizard Chris Carter may or may not have invented the first sampler by dismantling a series of cassette recorders and linking them to bandmate Peter Christopherson\u2019s keyboard: Detroit techno pioneer Carl Craig named a 1991 EP Four Jazz Funk Classics in homage to TG\u2019s 1979 album 20 Jazz Funk Greats.</p> <p>Twenty years after they caused disquiet by writing songs about serial killers and toying with quasi-Nazi imagery, one of the biggest rock stars in the world was called Marilyn Manson: on his Antichrist Superstar tour, performed in front of a huge logo that looked remarkably similar to TG\u2019s trademark thunderflash, with its echoes both of high-voltage warning signs and, more queasily, the symbol of the British Union of Fascists. If P-Orridge\u2019s later work with Psychic TV is less celebrated, it nevertheless demonstrated h/er uncanny ability to think ahead of the curve, presaging everything from acid house to the ongoing conversation about gender fluidity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a53f6f9a3dafdac2561a85fbbc4d47ef3303873\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a53f6f9a3dafdac2561a85fbbc4d47ef3303873/0_0_4709_2827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Throbbing Gristle perform in Culver City, California, 22 May 1981\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Throbbing Gristle perform in Culver City, California, 22 May 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>P-Orridge formed h/er first band, Worm, when s/he was still Neil Megson, a Manchester-born pupil at Solihull Public School. Worm even recorded an album, pressing up a solitary copy in 1968. If nothing else, it revealed that P-Orridge\u2019s approach to music was defiantly left-field from the start: noise, improvisations and tape experiments mixed with songs that sounded a little like a less adept, more chaotic version of psychedelic folkies the Incredible String Band. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/05/hull-city-of-culture-best-visual-art-coum\">When s/he moved to Hull</a>, adopted the pseudonym Genesis P-Orridge and set up performance art group Coum with h/er partner, Christine Newby, who was re-christened Cosey Fanni Tutti, they too were initially music-based, albeit in the widest sense of the phrase.</p> <p>They performed chaotic, tuneless, unrehearsed gigs, including one supporting Hawkwind where they chanted \u201coff off off\u201d from the stage to prefigure the audience\u2019s inevitable response. Despite the enthusiasm of DJ John Peel, who plugged the band in his Disc and Music Echo column, Coum\u2019s interest in music seemed to wane as h/er art became less playful and more disturbing: from brightly costumed actions on the streets of Hull that occasionally attracted crowds of entranced children, h/er performances shifted and began involving live sex acts, violence and much spilling of bodily fluids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/14/cosey-fanni-tutti-throbbing-gristle-coum-art-sex-music-hull-2017\">Cosey Fanni Tutti: 'I don\u2019t like acceptance. It makes me think I've done something wrong'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until P-Orridge and Tutti met former sound engineer Chris Carter that they were able to make music that reflected Coum\u2019s bleak latterday vision, while enabling them to break out of an art world they increasingly derided as sterile and elitist. With Peter \u201cSleazy\u201d Christopherson \u2013 a photographer and record sleeve designer who had taken part in some of Coum\u2019s later performances \u2013 on keyboards, the early Throbbing Gristle dealt in churning noise, punishing electronic rhythms and distorted vocals that dealt with a variety of distressing topics: the Moors Murders, the Nazi holocaust, the acts of mutilation and barbarism described in Slug Bait.</p> <p>They started playing gigs, to a largely apoplectic response: shows at regular rock venues frequently degenerated into violent confrontations with the audience. They performed at London\u2019s ICA as part of the Coum retrospective exhibition Prostitution, which provoked such outrage that questions were asked in Parliament \u2013 Tory MP Nicholas Fairbairn provided Throbbing Gristle with their lasting epigraph <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/18/genesis-p-orridge-ica-exhibition-1976\">by describing them as \u201cwreckers of civilisation\u201d</a> \u2013 and the venue\u2019s Arts Council funding was cut. Perhaps understandably, the band did not expect their murky, lo-fi, self-released debut album Second Annual Report to be a success: if it wasn\u2019t entirely without precedent \u2013 you could hear in it echoes of Yoko Ono and John Lennon\u2019s experimental work, the German avant-garde rock bands of the early 70s, the Velvet Underground circa White Light/White Heat and Lou Reed\u2019s notorious Metal Machine Music \u2013 it was nevertheless incredibly extreme for its era. But not only did its initial pressing of 750 copies sell out, it seemed to act as a lightning rod for other artists who had coincidentally been thinking along similar musical lines, many of whom ended up being released by Industrial: Sheffield\u2019s Cabaret Voltaire and Clock DVA, Australia\u2019s SPK and Sweden\u2019s Leather Nun.</p> <p>Throbbing Gristle proved to be a more expansive and diverse band than the unsettling din of Second Annual Report suggested. They followed it up with United, an alternately creepy and oddly sweet-sounding electronic single that foreshadowed the synth-led direction that mainstream pop would take in the early 80s: their subsequent albums took in everything from experiments with dark ambience, warped pop songs, audio collages and tracks that now sound remarkably like techno five years too early, while continually picking away at unpleasant subject matter. At its best, their work had a startling originality and power: 42 years after it first appeared on 1978\u2019s DOA: The Third and Final Report, Hamburger Lady\u2019s eerie, hushed retelling of the plight of a burns victim remains a genuinely terrifying piece of music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1opJnFer19nDXPpAw3PK9S?si=4RGRV9FMQROWGM9VarvGdQ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1opJnFer19nDXPpAw3PK9S\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Throbbing Gristle were never going to be anything other than divisive, as evidenced by the contemporary critical reaction, but they developed an increasingly fanatical cult following, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/joydivision\">Joy Division</a> frontman Ian Curtis among their ranks. Some of TG\u2019s members professed to be horrified by their popularity \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t like acceptance, I distrust it completely,\u201d said Tutti \u2013 but P-Orridge set about moulding their fanbase into a quasi-paramilitary cult. S/he began referring to their gigs as \u201crallies\u201d and sending out literature asking: \u201cDo you want to become a fully-equipped Terror Guard? Ready for action? NOTHING SHORT OF A TOTAL WAR\u201d; their 1981 single Discipline bore the legend \u201cmarching music for psychic youth\u201d. By the time of their rancorous split, shortly after Discipline\u2019s release, there was a burgeoning underground scene of new artists exploring similar musical and thematic areas: Current 93, Whitehouse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/24/got-any-horrific-child-discover-the-list-of-the-worlds-291-weirdest-bands\">Nurse With Wound</a>, Foetus, Test Department. Some were TG acolytes, some professed to loathe them and have no connection to their work: either way, it was impossible to see how said scene could have existed had Throbbing Gristle not existed first.</p> <p>P-Orridge formed Psychic TV with, among others, Christopherson and his partner John Balance. They unexpectedly signed to a major label; more unexpected still, their 1982 debut album, Force the Hand of Chance, was frequently lush, melodic and strangely romantic. Its sleeve, however, bore the words: \u201cFile under: fundraising activities\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For someone who occasionally purported to hate rock music \u2013 it was, a homemade T-shirt s/he was fond of wearing in the 1970s proclaimed, \u201cfor arselickers\u201d \u2013 Genesis Breyer P-Orridge ended up having a vast influence on it. With Throbbing Gristle, P-Orridge inadvertently helped invent an entire genre \u2013 industrial music, its name taken from the band\u2019s Industrial record label \u2013 which, over the years, developed and mutated from a misunderstood and frequently reviled cult into a platinum-selling concern. Intent on, as one writer put it, \u201cbursting open the blistered lie [that] rock and roll culture was telling about rebellion and transgression\u201d, virtually every one of Throbbing Gristle\u2019s radical, confrontational ideas was gradually subsumed into something approaching the mainstream. Electronic producers queued up to pay homage to the band, whose resident technical wizard Chris Carter may or may not have invented the first sampler by dismantling a series of cassette recorders and linking them to bandmate Peter Christopherson\u2019s keyboard: Detroit techno pioneer Carl Craig named a 1991 EP Four Jazz Funk Classics in homage to TG\u2019s 1979 album 20 Jazz Funk Greats. Twenty years after they caused disquiet by writing songs about serial killers and toying with quasi-Nazi imagery, one of the biggest rock stars in the world was called Marilyn Manson: on his Antichrist Superstar tour, performed in front of a huge logo that looked remarkably similar to TG\u2019s trademark thunderflash, with its echoes both of high-voltage warning signs and, more queasily, the symbol of the British Union of Fascists. If P-Orridge\u2019s later work with Psychic TV is less celebrated, it nevertheless demonstrated h/er uncanny ability to think ahead of the curve, presaging everything from acid house to the ongoing conversation about gender fluidity. P-Orridge formed h/er first band, Worm, when s/he was still Neil Megson, a Manchester-born pupil at Solihull Public School. Worm even recorded an album, pressing up a solitary copy in 1968. If nothing else, it revealed that P-Orridge\u2019s approach to music was defiantly left-field from the start: noise, improvisations and tape experiments mixed with songs that sounded a little like a less adept, more chaotic version of psychedelic folkies the Incredible String Band. When s/he moved to Hull, adopted the pseudonym Genesis P-Orridge and set up performance art group Coum with h/er partner, Christine Newby, who was re-christened Cosey Fanni Tutti, they too were initially music-based, albeit in the widest sense of the phrase. They performed chaotic, tuneless, unrehearsed gigs, including one supporting Hawkwind where they chanted \u201coff off off\u201d from the stage to prefigure the audience\u2019s inevitable response. Despite the enthusiasm of DJ John Peel, who plugged the band in his Disc and Music Echo column, Coum\u2019s interest in music seemed to wane as h/er art became less playful and more disturbing: from brightly costumed actions on the streets of Hull that occasionally attracted crowds of entranced children, h/er performances shifted and began involving live sex acts, violence and much spilling of bodily fluids. It wasn\u2019t until P-Orridge and Tutti met former sound engineer Chris Carter that they were able to make music that reflected Coum\u2019s bleak latterday vision, while enabling them to break out of an art world they increasingly derided as sterile and elitist. With Peter \u201cSleazy\u201d Christopherson \u2013 a photographer and record sleeve designer who had taken part in some of Coum\u2019s later performances \u2013 on keyboards, the early Throbbing Gristle dealt in churning noise, punishing electronic rhythms and distorted vocals that dealt with a variety of distressing topics: the Moors Murders, the Nazi holocaust, the acts of mutilation and barbarism described in Slug Bait. They started playing gigs, to a largely apoplectic response: shows at regular rock venues frequently degenerated into violent confrontations with the audience. They performed at London\u2019s ICA as part of the Coum retrospective exhibition Prostitution, which provoked such outrage that questions were asked in Parliament \u2013 Tory MP Nicholas Fairbairn provided Throbbing Gristle with their lasting epigraph by describing them as \u201cwreckers of civilisation\u201d \u2013 and the venue\u2019s Arts Council funding was cut. Perhaps understandably, the band did not expect their murky, lo-fi, self-released debut album Second Annual Report to be a success: if it wasn\u2019t entirely without precedent \u2013 you could hear in it echoes of Yoko Ono and John Lennon\u2019s experimental work, the German avant-garde rock bands of the early 70s, the Velvet Underground circa White Light/White Heat and Lou Reed\u2019s notorious Metal Machine Music \u2013 it was nevertheless incredibly extreme for its era. But not only did its initial pressing of 750 copies sell out, it seemed to act as a lightning rod for other artists who had coincidentally been thinking along similar musical lines, many of whom ended up being released by Industrial: Sheffield\u2019s Cabaret Voltaire and Clock DVA, Australia\u2019s SPK and Sweden\u2019s Leather Nun. Throbbing Gristle proved to be a more expansive and diverse band than the unsettling din of Second Annual Report suggested. They followed it up with United, an alternately creepy and oddly sweet-sounding electronic single that foreshadowed the synth-led direction that mainstream pop would take in the early 80s: their subsequent albums took in everything from experiments with dark ambience, warped pop songs, audio collages and tracks that now sound remarkably like techno five years too early, while continually picking away at unpleasant subject matter. At its best, their work had a startling originality and power: 42 years after it first appeared on 1978\u2019s DOA: The Third and Final Report, Hamburger Lady\u2019s eerie, hushed retelling of the plight of a burns victim remains a genuinely terrifying piece of music. Throbbing Gristle were never going to be anything other than divisive, as evidenced by the contemporary critical reaction, but they developed an increasingly fanatical cult following, with Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis among their ranks. Some of TG\u2019s members professed to be horrified by their popularity \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t like acceptance, I distrust it completely,\u201d said Tutti \u2013 but P-Orridge set about moulding their fanbase into a quasi-paramilitary cult. S/he began referring to their gigs as \u201crallies\u201d and sending out literature asking: \u201cDo you want to become a fully-equipped Terror Guard? Ready for action? NOTHING SHORT OF A TOTAL WAR\u201d; their 1981 single Discipline bore the legend \u201cmarching music for psychic youth\u201d. By the time of their rancorous split, shortly after Discipline\u2019s release, there was a burgeoning underground scene of new artists exploring similar musical and thematic areas: Current 93, Whitehouse, Nurse With Wound, Foetus, Test Department. Some were TG acolytes, some professed to loathe them and have no connection to their work: either way, it was impossible to see how said scene could have existed had Throbbing Gristle not existed first. P-Orridge formed Psychic TV with, among others, Christopherson and his partner John Balance. They unexpectedly signed to a major label; more unexpected still, their 1982 debut album, Force the Hand of Chance, was frequently lush, melodic and strangely romantic. Its sleeve, however, bore the words: \u201cFile under: fundraising activities\u201d. P-Orridge viewed Psychic TV as the musical wing of Thee Temple Ov Psychic Youth, which, depending on your perspective, was either an organisation dedicated to disseminating information about magickal practices \u2013 some derived from Aleister Crowley, others from occultist Austin Osman Spare \u2013 a satire on organised religion, or something approaching a cult, with P-Orridge its leader. The latter was an accusation frequently levelled by ex-members of Psychic TV, including Christopherson and Balance, who left after 1983\u2019s alternately cinematic and chilling Dreams Less Sweet to concentrate on their own project, the hugely acclaimed Coil. Their departure set the tone for a certain turbulence among Psychic TV\u2019s personnel: P-Orridge never failed to attract interesting collaborators \u2013 there\u2019s a credible argument that his greatest talent lay as a catalyst \u2013 but members perpetually came and left, frequently in acrimony, occasionally claiming that P-Orridge had taken credit for their work or ripped them off financially. Psychic TV\u2019s subsequent releases were never quite as musically compelling, although you couldn\u2019t fault their eclecticism, nor P-Orridge\u2019s willingness to spring surprises on his audience. Perhaps the biggest shock came when Psychic TV reinvented themselves as a relatively straightforward psychedelic rock band \u2013 P-Orridge having presumably decided that rock and roll wasn\u2019t for arselickers as long as he was doing it \u2013 with decidedly mixed results: their cover of the Beach Boys\u2019 Good Vibrations was an impressive act of chutzpah given P-Orridge\u2019s limited vocal ability, though they grazed the lower reaches of the charts with Godstar, a charming and remarkably catchy paean to late Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones. They then shifted into acid house, or at least something like it: an enthusiastic consumer of hallucinogens, P-Orridge had heard the term, but none of the music.

      "body": "<p>Governor Ron DeSantis last week declared a state of emergency in Florida in the face of the coronavirus as millions of Floridians are set to vote on Tuesday in a crucial delegate-rich primary that will help determine whether Bernie Sanders stays in the Democratic presidential nomination race against Joe Biden.</p> <p>In Florida, the impact of the virus, if left unchecked, could be particularly harsh on the state\u2019s ability to allow people to vote or vote safely without fear of infection.</p> <p>The state is home to one of the largest elderly populations in the country, with around <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/FL\">20%</a> of the residents age 65 or older. While this age group tends to be a stable voting bloc for both political parties, it\u2019s also the most vulnerable to the virus \u2013 which has a mortality rate around 18% for those over 80 years old.</p> <p>DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.nbc-2.com/story/41884945/desantis-places-limit-on-florida-nursing-home-visits\">issued an executive order</a> barring people who may have been exposed to the virus from visiting nursing homes. He urged election officials throughout the state to consider moving their polling locations for the state\u2019s 17 March primary out of those locations.</p> <p>But over the weekend before election day, the state seemed to be lacking a unified response, with many polling stations in senior centers and retirement communities still operating at status quo.</p> <p>Workers at Country Aire Manor, Senate Manor Estates, and Crystal Lakes Manor \u2013 Pasco and Pinellas county polling sites all held in communities comprised entirely of people above 55 \u2013 said they had received no guidelines for the election, and were already receiving equipment to set up for Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cAll locations will be open,\u201d said Robin Lehoux, who works at the parks and recreation department in Pompano Beach, Florida. She hadn\u2019t heard of any instructions from the state or local government regarding the Mullins Park Senior Center, a polling precinct where other senior programming had been shut down.</p> <p>But Florida\u2019s piecemeal response has been a stark departure from other election officials across the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-concerns-hurdle-voters-primary-elections\">implementing last-minute</a> measures to stave off concerns about contracting coronavirus at the polls. In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered all polling stations in senior centers and nursing homes to be relocated. Louisiana\u2019s state\u2019s top election official, Kyle Ardoin, announced Friday the primary election next month would be postponed until June.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing catch up,\u201d said congressman Darren Soto, who represents a central Florida district that includes Orlando. Soto was still expecting a large voter turnout on Friday, and said he was focused on making sure voting precincts remained open so crowds were dispersed. \u201cThe main thing is to avoid long lines so people can conduct best practices.\u201d</p> <p>Some election officials are still taking full precautions.</p> <p>In Broward county, the local supervisor of elections announced this week the county was moving <a href=\"https://www.browardsoe.org/\">12 precincts </a>from senior centers and assisted living facilities to alternate locations. The county sent out postcards to all of the voters who would normally cast ballots there letting them know their locations had moved.</p> <p>Some senior living facilities don\u2019t want to move their polling locations because they are wary of having to transport residents, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for the Broward county elections office. In such cases, the county elections office will make sure they have adequate cleaning and sanitization supplies, Vancore said.</p> <p>\ufeff</p> <p>State officials held a conference call with local supervisors of elections on Thursday to discuss sanitary measures they could take at the polls. In Volusia county, the supervisor of elections reminded voters they could bring their own pens to fill out ballots. In Marion county, elections officials have limited cleaning supplies and are encouraging people to bring their own from home, said Wesley Wilcox, the county\u2019s supervisor of elections.</p> <p>Florida is no stranger to adapting elections to emergencies.</p> <p>In 2018, Hurricane Michael derailed precincts in the panhandle, and forced election officials to extend voting hours and move locations. In 2016, a federal judge extended voter registration because of disruptions caused by Hurricane Matthew, despite opposition from Republican governor Rick Scott.</p> <p>But the state often only acts at the last minute. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight every time,\u201d said Brad Ashwell, the Florida director of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. The organization was looking to support changes for the primary that could include an extension in vote-by-mail deadlines, poll worker recruitment, as elderly poll workers dropped out, and more state funds to advertise changes to the polling stations.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like the freak out level is slowly creeping in here,\u201d Ashwell said. \u201cI don\u2019t sense anxiety among people.

      "bodyText": "Governor Ron DeSantis last week declared a state of emergency in Florida in the face of the coronavirus as millions of Floridians are set to vote on Tuesday in a crucial delegate-rich primary that will help determine whether Bernie Sanders stays in the Democratic presidential nomination race against Joe Biden. In Florida, the impact of the virus, if left unchecked, could be particularly harsh on the state\u2019s ability to allow people to vote or vote safely without fear of infection. The state is home to one of the largest elderly populations in the country, with around 20% of the residents age 65 or older. While this age group tends to be a stable voting bloc for both political parties, it\u2019s also the most vulnerable to the virus \u2013 which has a mortality rate around 18% for those over 80 years old. DeSantis issued an executive order barring people who may have been exposed to the virus from visiting nursing homes. He urged election officials throughout the state to consider moving their polling locations for the state\u2019s 17 March primary out of those locations. But over the weekend before election day, the state seemed to be lacking a unified response, with many polling stations in senior centers and retirement communities still operating at status quo. Workers at Country Aire Manor, Senate Manor Estates, and Crystal Lakes Manor \u2013 Pasco and Pinellas county polling sites all held in communities comprised entirely of people above 55 \u2013 said they had received no guidelines for the election, and were already receiving equipment to set up for Tuesday. \u201cAll locations will be open,\u201d said Robin Lehoux, who works at the parks and recreation department in Pompano Beach, Florida. She hadn\u2019t heard of any instructions from the state or local government regarding the Mullins Park Senior Center, a polling precinct where other senior programming had been shut down. But Florida\u2019s piecemeal response has been a stark departure from other election officials across the country implementing last-minute measures to stave off concerns about contracting coronavirus at the polls. In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered all polling stations in senior centers and nursing homes to be relocated. Louisiana\u2019s state\u2019s top election official, Kyle Ardoin, announced Friday the primary election next month would be postponed until June. \u201cThey\u2019re playing catch up,\u201d said congressman Darren Soto, who represents a central Florida district that includes Orlando. Soto was still expecting a large voter turnout on Friday, and said he was focused on making sure voting precincts remained open so crowds were dispersed. \u201cThe main thing is to avoid long lines so people can conduct best practices.\u201d Some election officials are still taking full precautions. In Broward county, the local supervisor of elections announced this week the county was moving 12 precincts from senior centers and assisted living facilities to alternate locations. The county sent out postcards to all of the voters who would normally cast ballots there letting them know their locations had moved. Some senior living facilities don\u2019t want to move their polling locations because they are wary of having to transport residents, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for the Broward county elections office. In such cases, the county elections office will make sure they have adequate cleaning and sanitization supplies, Vancore said. \ufeff State officials held a conference call with local supervisors of elections on Thursday to discuss sanitary measures they could take at the polls. In Volusia county, the supervisor of elections reminded voters they could bring their own pens to fill out ballots. In Marion county, elections officials have limited cleaning supplies and are encouraging people to bring their own from home, said Wesley Wilcox, the county\u2019s supervisor of elections. Florida is no stranger to adapting elections to emergencies. In 2018, Hurricane Michael derailed precincts in the panhandle, and forced election officials to extend voting hours and move locations. In 2016, a federal judge extended voter registration because of disruptions caused by Hurricane Matthew, despite opposition from Republican governor Rick Scott. But the state often only acts at the last minute. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight every time,\u201d said Brad Ashwell, the Florida director of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. The organization was looking to support changes for the primary that could include an extension in vote-by-mail deadlines, poll worker recruitment, as elderly poll workers dropped out, and more state funds to advertise changes to the polling stations. \u201cIt seems like the freak out level is slowly creeping in here,\u201d Ashwell said. \u201cI don\u2019t sense anxiety among people. People are upset their conferences are being cancelled. But it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a real high levels of concern.\u201d Meanwhile, he said, the fears around Covid-19 could build on other issues that voters faced in the state. Under the pressure of lawsuit brought on by civil rights groups and Puerto Rican residents, the state has been attempting to provide bilingual language assistance at each station, which could be impacted if poll workers don\u2019t show up on Tuesday. And the state rejected tens of thousands of mail-in ballots and absentee ballots in recent elections, stoking mistrust in that system. Danny Turkel, spokesperson for Voto Latino, an advocacy group focused on registering Latinx voters, said he predicted lower voter turnout in the election because of the state of emergency. He didn\u2019t think any specific community would be impacted, he said, but predicted that the uncertainty would keep voters at home. \u201cBeing from Miami, I\u2019m acutely aware of the difficulties people have,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were already obstacles in the way that the state has done nothing to improve.\u201d \u201cI think it will show out in the numbers.\u201d",

Leading ski and summer activity holiday company Neilson has called for the government to step in with \u201cemergency measures\u201d. There were reports of chaos and confusion across the Alps with one source saying local police had taken the French government\u2019s message into their own hands and were going round hotels and restaurants telling marooned Britons to go home immediately.

The best way of making a house a home is to build things up over time, with things that hold memories. It\u2019s not about buying everything brand new, off the rack.

Plant recommends antiques fairs and markets as good places to hunt out French linen sheets: \u201cThey make great upholstery fabric and curtaining.\u201d Silver cutlery, too: \u201cSetting up a kitchen can be such an expensive thing to do, but you can go to markets and buy silver cutlery for five quid a bundle.\u201d The interior designer Lonika Chande is also a fan of markets and junk shops. Old textiles, she says, \u201creally transform a place.

A large proportion of the population is at lower risk of developing severe disease: roughly speaking anyone up to the age of 40. So the reasoning goes that even though in a perfect world we\u2019d not want anyone to take the risk of infection, generating immunity in younger people is a way of protecting the population as a whole.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fecb04-934a-4af1-baee-358948ad8ba5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0hG3V9378fg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We talk about vaccines generating herd immunity, so why is this different? Because this is not a vaccine. This is an actual pandemic that will make a very large number of people sick, and some of them will die. Even though the mortality rate is likely quite low, a small fraction of a very large number is still a large number. And the mortality rate will climb when the NHS is overwhelmed. This would be expected to happen, even if we make the generous assumption that the government were entirely successful in restricting the virus to the low-risk population, at the peak of the outbreak the numbers requiring critical care would be greater than the number of beds available. This is made worse by the fact that people who are badly ill tend to remain so for a long time, which increases the burden.</p> \n<p>And of course you can\u2019t restrict it to this age group. Think of all the people aged between 20 and 40 who work in healthcare, or old people\u2019s homes. You don\u2019t need many introductions into settings like these for what we might coyly call \u201csevere outcomes\u201d. In Washington State, nearly all the deaths reported so far have been associated with nursing homes. Is everyone in a high-risk group supposed to withdraw themselves from society for six months until they can emerge once the (so far entirely imaginary) second wave has been averted?</p> \n<p>About that second wave: let me be clear. Second waves are real things, and we have seen them in flu pandemics. This is not a flu pandemic. Flu rules do not apply. There might well be a second wave, I honestly don\u2019t know. But vulnerable people should not be exposed to a virus right now in the service of a hypothetical future.</p> \n<p>Keeping people safe means self-isolation if you develop symptoms, but the official advice here is also misleading. While it is of paramount importance that sick people stay at home to avoid infecting others, it is increasingly clear that transmission can occur before symptoms develop. We know this is true from modelling and observational studies. I have seen it happen myself. We do not know how often it occurs or how important it is in the epidemiology, but it definitely does happen.</p> \n<p>However, arguments about the case fatality rate, the transmission parameters and presymptomatic transmission all miss the point. This virus is capable of shutting down countries. You should not want to be the next after Wuhan, Iran, Italy or Spain. In those places, the healthcare systems have broken down. In Italy, the choices of whom to save and whom to allow to die are real. You should instead look to the example of South Korea, which, through a combination of intense surveillance and social distancing, appears to have gained some semblance of control over the virus. We can learn from South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, all of which have so far done a good job mitigating the worst outcomes despite having reported cases early in the pandemic, and in the case of South Korea, suffering a substantial outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/this-coronavirus-crisis-has-forced-the-retirement-of-pantomime-johnson\">This coronavirus crisis has forced the retirement of pantomime Johnson | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The UK should not be trying to create herd immunity, that will take care of itself.

Even though they knew it was coming, and could see what happened to the neighbours as they were overwhelmed with terrifying speed, the UK government has inexplicably chosen to encourage the flames, in the misguided notion that somehow they will be able to control them. When I first heard about this, I could not believe it. I research and teach the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health. My colleagues here in the US, even as they are reeling from the stumbling response of the Donald Trump administration to the crisis, assumed that reports of the UK policy were satire \u2013 an example of the wry humour for which the country is famed.

      "body": "<p>Annalena McAfee\u2019s London home, on a quiet cobbled mews not far from Great Ormond Street hospital, seems a fitting place to be speaking about a book full of beautiful flowers. The author\u2019s third novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nightshade-9781787301948.html\" title=\"\"><em>Nightshade</em></a>, is about a botanical artist, and I approach her house through a sea of pot plants. McAfee \u2013 elegantly dressed in grey, her silver-blond hair falling about her shoulders \u2013 greets me at the door and shows me upstairs to a sitting room. An olive tree shimmers outside the window, jasmine clambers over the balcony.</p> <p>McAfee makes coffee and we sit on leather chairs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/dec/21/jane-bown-a-life-in-photography-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Jane Bown</a> prints line the walls. There are relatively few books in the room, just two shelves with a mixture of her work \u2013 I spot both McAfee\u2019s first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/24/spoiler-annalena-mcafee-clark-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Spoiler</em></a><em>,</em> which drew on her time as a journalist for the <em>Financial Times</em> and London\u2019s <em>Evening Standard</em>, and 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/14/hame-annalena-mcafee-review\" title=\"\"><em>Hame</em></a>, set on a fictional Hebridean island. There are also copies, several of them in translation, of her husband\u2019s books. McAfee is married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/14/ian-mcewan-interview-machines-like-me-artificial-intelligence\" title=\"\">Ian McEwan</a>, whom I think I hear clattering about somewhere below us several times during our conversation.</p> <p>We have met once before, at a literary festival, but she appears on edge, sipping her coffee with her shoulders hunched. I ask her how she feels about the promotional merry-go-round. \u201cMaybe some people enjoy it, but I feel it\u2019s like volunteering for the stocks and saying: \u2018Throw those vegetables right at my face.\u2019\u201d I remind her of something her husband said \u2013 that having to talk about a book you might have finished a year or more earlier was like being in the service of your former self. \u201cI love that he said that,\u201d McAfee laughs. \u201cAnother thing that he says about me is that I\u2019m the only writer he\u2019s ever met that doesn\u2019t want anyone to read their stuff. He\u2019s taking it to extremes, the fact that I\u2019m reticent about promotion. But any rational person would be reticent, I think.\u201d</p> <p>She shouldn\u2019t have too much to worry about \u2013 <em>Nightshade</em> is a glorious novel. Darker and more troubling than her earlier books, it tells the story of Eve Laing, a gifted artist railing against late middle age. Laing had a glamorous early life as the muse of a creepily controlling older painter, Florian Ki\u0161, then slid into a comfortable married existence with the doughty Kristof. Now, suddenly aware of the passing of time, she casts aside her home and family and commits herself fully to her flower paintings. This is a novel full of twisted sexuality, art and power, about what it means to commit yourself entirely to the artistic life. One of the novel\u2019s narrative engines is the rivalry between Eve and an art-school contemporary, Wanda Wilson, a conceptual artist who was also entangled with Ki\u0161. The book\u2019s ending is brutal and unforgettable.</p> <p><em>Nightshade</em> is remarkable because Eve\u2019s character is spiky, unpleasant, a bad mother, wife and grandmother, vain and coldly controlling of the young men she manipulates, as Florian once manipulated her. And yet the reader still roots for her. \u201cI was quite enjoying writing this really rather unpleasant character,\u201d McAfee says, \u201cwhen my own unconscious sexism made me ask, \u2018Who\u2019s going to believe in this monster?\u2019 Then I said to myself, \u2018Well, just change the sex and think about that. Entirely plausible.\u2019 A monster of selfishness whose talent gives them an out and exempts them from normal decent behaviour? It\u2019s every male artist. Just think of all the weeping women that Picasso left behind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcb2152124d49dddf0f937e992162f7f92258417\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcb2152124d49dddf0f937e992162f7f92258417/0_177_1950_1170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McAfee with her husband, Ian McEwan, 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McAfee with her husband, Ian McEwan, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harvey/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To research the novel, McAfee took a course in botanical art at Ruskin College, Oxford, as well as reading \u201ca hell of a lot of books about colour theory and pigments\u201d. She had always loved flowers and art and the book was a way of getting closer to both. \u201cI remember reading something by Ruskin where he said that whenever he wanted to find out about something, he wrote a book about it. This was my way of going deeper into art, into botany, subjects that have always fascinated me.\u201d</p> <p>McAfee came late to adult novels, publishing <em>The Spoiler</em> in 2011, just before her 60th birthday, but she has been writing all her life \u2013 not only journalism (she launched the <em>Guardian Review</em>) but also eight children\u2019s books. After a hardscrabble Glaswegian upbringing and student days that were, she says, \u201cwild, absolutely wild\u201d, she went to work at Marvel comics in the early 70s. \u201cWe\u2019d bought up the back catalogue of the golden age of US comics from the 1950s,\u201d she says. \u201cMy job was to edit the speech bubbles, to anglicise them and to take out all of the wartime references. I loved comics as a kid and I loved working on this.\u201d She also wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2018/nov/12/stan-lee-marvel-legend-life-in-pictures-death\" title=\"\">Stan Lee</a>\u2019s responses on the magazines\u2019 letters pages. \u201cI made up letters when the ones we received were all too batty to print.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We meet for lunch. It\u2019s like a job but much more fun. Less office politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her children\u2019s books came in the wake of a personal tragedy. \u201cI was diagnosed with a terminal illness in my late 20s and amid all the blizzard of emotions swirling about was the thought: \u2018You never wrote a book, you fool.\u2019 I had a very good friend \u2013 still a very good friend \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthony-browne\" title=\"\">Anthony Browne</a>, the children\u2019s book illustrator. During my long period of convalescence, we began to work on my first children\u2019s book. We enjoyed the experience and worked on several more together. I realise this now, looking back, I was writing about the children I wasn\u2019t going to have as a result of my illness.\u201d</p> <p>She met McEwan in 1994, when she interviewed him for the <em>Financial Times</em>. He was recently divorced from his first wife, Penny Allen. The couple now split their time between the London mews house and a home in Gloucestershire. They work together and are the first to read each other\u2019s work. \u201cWe write every day, mostly,\u201d McAfee tells me. \u201cWe keep office hours. We meet for lunch. It\u2019s like a job but much more fun. Less office politics.\u201d I ask if it\u2019s ever claustrophobic, writing in such close proximity. \u201cWe work in separate studies and in the early stages of a piece of writing, we respect each other\u2019s reticence about what we\u2019re doing. Later, when we\u2019re more confident and immersed in a project, discussing it in the evening or while on walks feels like an extension of rich conversations about family life.\u201d</p> <p>McAfee and McEwan met when they were already in their 40s and had accumulated the possessions of their separate lifetimes, including a vast number of books. \u201cWe had an interesting commitment ceremony melding our libraries when we moved in together,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d been married for five years before we lived in the same house.

      "bodyText": "Annalena McAfee\u2019s London home, on a quiet cobbled mews not far from Great Ormond Street hospital, seems a fitting place to be speaking about a book full of beautiful flowers. The author\u2019s third novel, Nightshade, is about a botanical artist, and I approach her house through a sea of pot plants. McAfee \u2013 elegantly dressed in grey, her silver-blond hair falling about her shoulders \u2013 greets me at the door and shows me upstairs to a sitting room. An olive tree shimmers outside the window, jasmine clambers over the balcony. McAfee makes coffee and we sit on leather chairs. Jane Bown prints line the walls. There are relatively few books in the room, just two shelves with a mixture of her work \u2013 I spot both McAfee\u2019s first novel, The Spoiler, which drew on her time as a journalist for the Financial Times and London\u2019s Evening Standard, and 2017\u2019s Hame, set on a fictional Hebridean island. There are also copies, several of them in translation, of her husband\u2019s books. McAfee is married to Ian McEwan, whom I think I hear clattering about somewhere below us several times during our conversation. We have met once before, at a literary festival, but she appears on edge, sipping her coffee with her shoulders hunched. I ask her how she feels about the promotional merry-go-round. \u201cMaybe some people enjoy it, but I feel it\u2019s like volunteering for the stocks and saying: \u2018Throw those vegetables right at my face.\u2019\u201d I remind her of something her husband said \u2013 that having to talk about a book you might have finished a year or more earlier was like being in the service of your former self. \u201cI love that he said that,\u201d McAfee laughs. \u201cAnother thing that he says about me is that I\u2019m the only writer he\u2019s ever met that doesn\u2019t want anyone to read their stuff. He\u2019s taking it to extremes, the fact that I\u2019m reticent about promotion. But any rational person would be reticent, I think.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t have too much to worry about \u2013 Nightshade is a glorious novel. Darker and more troubling than her earlier books, it tells the story of Eve Laing, a gifted artist railing against late middle age. Laing had a glamorous early life as the muse of a creepily controlling older painter, Florian Ki\u0161, then slid into a comfortable married existence with the doughty Kristof. Now, suddenly aware of the passing of time, she casts aside her home and family and commits herself fully to her flower paintings. This is a novel full of twisted sexuality, art and power, about what it means to commit yourself entirely to the artistic life. One of the novel\u2019s narrative engines is the rivalry between Eve and an art-school contemporary, Wanda Wilson, a conceptual artist who was also entangled with Ki\u0161. The book\u2019s ending is brutal and unforgettable. Nightshade is remarkable because Eve\u2019s character is spiky, unpleasant, a bad mother, wife and grandmother, vain and coldly controlling of the young men she manipulates, as Florian once manipulated her. And yet the reader still roots for her. \u201cI was quite enjoying writing this really rather unpleasant character,\u201d McAfee says, \u201cwhen my own unconscious sexism made me ask, \u2018Who\u2019s going to believe in this monster?\u2019 Then I said to myself, \u2018Well, just change the sex and think about that. Entirely plausible.\u2019 A monster of selfishness whose talent gives them an out and exempts them from normal decent behaviour? It\u2019s every male artist. Just think of all the weeping women that Picasso left behind.\u201d To research the novel, McAfee took a course in botanical art at Ruskin College, Oxford, as well as reading \u201ca hell of a lot of books about colour theory and pigments\u201d. She had always loved flowers and art and the book was a way of getting closer to both. \u201cI remember reading something by Ruskin where he said that whenever he wanted to find out about something, he wrote a book about it. This was my way of going deeper into art, into botany, subjects that have always fascinated me.\u201d McAfee came late to adult novels, publishing The Spoiler in 2011, just before her 60th birthday, but she has been writing all her life \u2013 not only journalism (she launched the Guardian Review) but also eight children\u2019s books. After a hardscrabble Glaswegian upbringing and student days that were, she says, \u201cwild, absolutely wild\u201d, she went to work at Marvel comics in the early 70s. \u201cWe\u2019d bought up the back catalogue of the golden age of US comics from the 1950s,\u201d she says. \u201cMy job was to edit the speech bubbles, to anglicise them and to take out all of the wartime references. I loved comics as a kid and I loved working on this.\u201d She also wrote Stan Lee\u2019s responses on the magazines\u2019 letters pages. \u201cI made up letters when the ones we received were all too batty to print.\u201d Her children\u2019s books came in the wake of a personal tragedy. \u201cI was diagnosed with a terminal illness in my late 20s and amid all the blizzard of emotions swirling about was the thought: \u2018You never wrote a book, you fool.\u2019 I had a very good friend \u2013 still a very good friend \u2013 Anthony Browne, the children\u2019s book illustrator. During my long period of convalescence, we began to work on my first children\u2019s book. We enjoyed the experience and worked on several more together. I realise this now, looking back, I was writing about the children I wasn\u2019t going to have as a result of my illness.\u201d She met McEwan in 1994, when she interviewed him for the Financial Times. He was recently divorced from his first wife, Penny Allen. The couple now split their time between the London mews house and a home in Gloucestershire. They work together and are the first to read each other\u2019s work. \u201cWe write every day, mostly,\u201d McAfee tells me. \u201cWe keep office hours. We meet for lunch. It\u2019s like a job but much more fun. Less office politics.\u201d I ask if it\u2019s ever claustrophobic, writing in such close proximity. \u201cWe work in separate studies and in the early stages of a piece of writing, we respect each other\u2019s reticence about what we\u2019re doing. Later, when we\u2019re more confident and immersed in a project, discussing it in the evening or while on walks feels like an extension of rich conversations about family life.\u201d McAfee and McEwan met when they were already in their 40s and had accumulated the possessions of their separate lifetimes, including a vast number of books. \u201cWe had an interesting commitment ceremony melding our libraries when we moved in together,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d been married for five years before we lived in the same house. So we had lots of doubles \u2013 we got rid of those. It was tough. There are some upstairs here, some downstairs. They\u2019re separated into fiction and nonfiction. The only really alphabetised bit is the history and biography. A step-daughter who worked in Waterstones alphabetised them for her pleasure. We want her to come and finish it all off.\u201d Beside her bed, she tells me, are \u201ctwo great piles of books. One of the secrets of my poor housekeeping. At the moment there is a children\u2019s book that we had when we were kids called Wee MacGreegor, written in Scots, which I got out of nostalgia. Then there\u2019s William Feaver\u2019s [The Lives of Lucien] Freud, the first volume, and Celia Paul\u2019s memoir. Celia Paul was his lover, mother of his child. A very good companion piece. There\u2019s also Mary Gaitskill\u2019s This Is Pleasure \u2013 I loved that - and Julian Barnes\u2019s Man in the Red Coat. It\u2019s delicious. That\u2019s just the top layer of the pile.

      "body": "<p>Roger Phillips is Britain\u2019s most celebrated mushroom-hunter, but it\u2019s winter, so we restrict our lunchtime foraging to Borough Market by London Bridge. Phillips, a spirited man of 87, has walked downriver from his home in Pimlico to meet me at <a href=\"https://boroughmarket.org.uk/traders/turnips\" title=\"\">Turnips</a>, the oldest speciality greengrocer at the market. He is a fan of its sideline in chanterelle and spelt stew, cooked in huge paella pans. We order a couple of steaming bowls of the thick mushroom dish \u2013 on a good day they sell 1,400 such bowls, each topped with a piece of parmesan crisp \u2013 and stand eating them on the cobblestones. Phillips is wearing a red and white spotted toadstool beret.</p> <p>The staff of Turnip Kitchen greet Phillips as something of a prophet, mycologist royalty; new recruits are given his book on mushrooms as their bible. That pioneering volume, first published in 1981 \u2013 with its vivid description and photographs of hundreds of varieties and stages of growth \u2013 has enabled two generations of foragers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/10/the-gospel-of-mushrooms-how-foraging-became-hip\" title=\"\">to pick and eat with confidence</a>.</p> <p>Phillips accepts their compliments modestly while polishing off his stew \u2013 a dish I feel I could eat every winter lunchtime and never tire of. There is some discussion of the origin of the chanterelles \u2013 Portugal at this time of year \u2013 and we then wander to the edge of the market to get a glass of wine and sit and talk about the mulchy beginnings of his first love.</p> <p>In the summer of 1940, with the blitz threatened, Phillips was sent away from his parents\u2019 home in Uxbridge out to his grandparents\u2019 dairy farm in Hertfordshire. \u201cIt just so happened that it must have been a marvellous mushrooming year,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAged seven or eight I would go out into the fields with these steel milking buckets and bring them back brimful of mushrooms. They grow around cow pats, of course. That was the start of it. My grandmother would cook them up and they sent a few buckets to market. I\u2019d get half a crown or something for each one.\u201d</p> <p>The thrill of those days has never left him. I guess a first question with any mushroom hunter is about hallucinogens but Phillips insists he has never had any interest in the \u201cmagic\u201d side of his vocation. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I worked in advertising in the 60s, people never used to bother to pass me a joint because they knew I didn\u2019t need it.\u201d He got all the highs he wanted simply by being in nature, tramping in woods, cooking outside, looking and learning. He wonders if it was genetic. \u201cMy father was an accountant. I imagine his daily life was bloody boring; but he absolutely loved going out blackberrying or whatever. That was total bliss to him \u2013 and to me.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips published books about trees and ferns and wild flowers before he got to mushrooms. He didn\u2019t think the publisher at Pan would go for it. The British, he suggests, had always been funny about fungi. While across Europe and beyond natives would be out in fields and forests as if on pilgrimage in mushroom season, in the UK there was no tradition. \u201cWe were famous for herbs from medieval times, of course,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cBut those books tend to refer to mushrooms as \u2018the spit of Jesus\u2019 or \u2018the fruit of the devil\u2019. Because they grew up from nowhere overnight they were associated with witchcraft.\u201d</p> <p>Those attitudes went surprisingly deep. When he was researching his first mushroom book Phillips was up in Scotland staying on a farm. The farmer was a \u201ctight sod, who charged you extra for hot water and all that\u201d. Phillips was out every day collecting chanterelles. One evening he told the farmer: \u201cYou have millions of these in your woods. Put them in a box and send them to France and you will make a small fortune.\u201d The farmer looked at him and said simply: \u201cPeople shouldnae eat that shite.\u201d \u201cAnd that was it. That idea was common.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips\u2019s evangelising has done much to shift those superstitions. His original book has sold 750,000 copies. Each year he joins the musician and DJ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/17/cerys-matthews-6-music-foraging-brexit-scrumping-nettles-where-the-wild-cooks-go\" title=\"\">Cerys Matthews at her Good Life Experience</a> festival in north Wales and takes a few hundred people out into the woods. They cook up all the edible stuff they find over a fire pit. It takes him back to when his kids were growing up and they would go out nearly every weekend, rain or snow, collecting wild food. \u201cIt began when I worried that my son was growing up a townie,\u201d Phillips recalls. \u201cWe used to go out to a place near the Grand Union Canal, at Denham. Just set up camp, build a little fire. It sort of took off. He would bring his pals and their parents would come. It was rather wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips has been a natural nonconformist. Three months into his national service in the RAF in Canada, he says, he somehow persuaded an air vice marshal to let him go home on the basis that he didn\u2019t want to be trained to kill people. He later gave up work as an art director at the ad agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, to become a freelance photographer, concentrating on plants. His guiding philosophy has always been: \u201cIf it\u2019s not fun, don\u2019t do it.\u201d That spirit has taken him all over the world \u2013 adventures in wild food that are celebrated in his latest book, <em>The Worldwide Forager</em>.</p> <p>The book grew out of his understanding of the propagation of knowledge: \u201cWe don\u2019t need governments to connect us, just space where it can happen,\u201d he says at one point. He hopes the latest book is timely in that it looks beyond our borders. Highlights include his pilgrimage in search of the desert truffle with a Portuguese plant magus. \u201cAs far as I can make out the desert truffle is the manna referred to in the Bible,\u201d he suggests. \u201cAnd we went out and found this thing. Didn\u2019t taste great, but it was incredibly exciting.\u201d</p> <p>He has learned a lot, too, from spending time with a Native American tribe, the Nez Perce, in Idaho, who retain some of the ancient knowledge of hunter-gatherers. Not only did Phillips increase his knowledge of edible tubers, he became friends with an eminently quotable chief: \u201cHow long will it take mankind to realise that you cannot eat money?\u201d</p> <p>I suggest that, like the hunter-gatherers, Phillips must see a different countryside to the rest of us when he goes for a walk in the woods; so much to eat for a start \u2026</p> <p>\u201cI find that particularly at the seaside,\u201d he says. \u201cI always think: what a dreadful waste. Just about everything is edible, and we hardly eat any of it. The Japanese know a hundred things to do with seaweed. I have no idea why we do not.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"85aabc4a0f8866c3411fdd8be705c4c5dd138836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85aabc4a0f8866c3411fdd8be705c4c5dd138836/0_613_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Turnips mushroom and spelt stew\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Roger and Tim both ate </strong><em>Mushroom and spelt stew, \u00a37.50. </em><strong>Roger drank </strong><em>Orange and mango juice, \u00a32.50.<br></em><strong>Tim drank </strong><em>Cranberry lemonade, \u00a32.50</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite all the changes he has witnessed at first hand as a result of factory farming, he remains an optimist.

In London this involves organising the planting and upkeep of the communal plot in Ecclestone Square where he lives; and also doing a bit of experimenting at a small cottage he owns in Wiltshire. He cooks and eats outside whenever he can; his last birthday meal involved \u2013 \u201cbugger the neighbours\u201d \u2013 a wood fire on the balcony of his flat.</p> <p>And what about retirement, I ask, before he heads off back up river.</p> <p>He shudders at the thought. \u201cWe are going to be dust long enough,\u201d he says. And then he brightens. \u201cAccording to a French mycologist there is a mushroom that grows only on the human brain, in graveyards. I suppose because they are uniquely nutritious.\u201d He laughs at the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a comforting thought \u2013 but there it is.\u201d OFM</p> <p><em>The Worldwide Forager is published on 2 April (Unbound, \u00a325).

In the summer of 1940, with the blitz threatened, Phillips was sent away from his parents\u2019 home in Uxbridge out to his grandparents\u2019 dairy farm in Hertfordshire. \u201cIt just so happened that it must have been a marvellous mushrooming year,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAged seven or eight I would go out into the fields with these steel milking buckets and bring them back brimful of mushrooms. They grow around cow pats, of course. That was the start of it. My grandmother would cook them up and they sent a few buckets to market. I\u2019d get half a crown or something for each one.\u201d The thrill of those days has never left him. I guess a first question with any mushroom hunter is about hallucinogens but Phillips insists he has never had any interest in the \u201cmagic\u201d side of his vocation. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I worked in advertising in the 60s, people never used to bother to pass me a joint because they knew I didn\u2019t need it.\u201d He got all the highs he wanted simply by being in nature, tramping in woods, cooking outside, looking and learning. He wonders if it was genetic. \u201cMy father was an accountant. I imagine his daily life was bloody boring; but he absolutely loved going out blackberrying or whatever. That was total bliss to him \u2013 and to me.\u201d Phillips published books about trees and ferns and wild flowers before he got to mushrooms. He didn\u2019t think the publisher at Pan would go for it. The British, he suggests, had always been funny about fungi. While across Europe and beyond natives would be out in fields and forests as if on pilgrimage in mushroom season, in the UK there was no tradition. \u201cWe were famous for herbs from medieval times, of course,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cBut those books tend to refer to mushrooms as \u2018the spit of Jesus\u2019 or \u2018the fruit of the devil\u2019. Because they grew up from nowhere overnight they were associated with witchcraft.\u201d Those attitudes went surprisingly deep. When he was researching his first mushroom book Phillips was up in Scotland staying on a farm. The farmer was a \u201ctight sod, who charged you extra for hot water and all that\u201d. Phillips was out every day collecting chanterelles. One evening he told the farmer: \u201cYou have millions of these in your woods. Put them in a box and send them to France and you will make a small fortune.\u201d The farmer looked at him and said simply: \u201cPeople shouldnae eat that shite.\u201d \u201cAnd that was it. That idea was common.\u201d Phillips\u2019s evangelising has done much to shift those superstitions. His original book has sold 750,000 copies. Each year he joins the musician and DJ Cerys Matthews at her Good Life Experience festival in north Wales and takes a few hundred people out into the woods. They cook up all the edible stuff they find over a fire pit. It takes him back to when his kids were growing up and they would go out nearly every weekend, rain or snow, collecting wild food. \u201cIt began when I worried that my son was growing up a townie,\u201d Phillips recalls. \u201cWe used to go out to a place near the Grand Union Canal, at Denham. Just set up camp, build a little fire. It sort of took off. He would bring his pals and their parents would come. It was rather wonderful.\u201d Phillips has been a natural nonconformist. Three months into his national service in the RAF in Canada, he says, he somehow persuaded an air vice marshal to let him go home on the basis that he didn\u2019t want to be trained to kill people. He later gave up work as an art director at the ad agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, to become a freelance photographer, concentrating on plants. His guiding philosophy has always been: \u201cIf it\u2019s not fun, don\u2019t do it.\u201d That spirit has taken him all over the world \u2013 adventures in wild food that are celebrated in his latest book, The Worldwide Forager. The book grew out of his understanding of the propagation of knowledge: \u201cWe don\u2019t need governments to connect us, just space where it can happen,\u201d he says at one point. He hopes the latest book is timely in that it looks beyond our borders. Highlights include his pilgrimage in search of the desert truffle with a Portuguese plant magus. \u201cAs far as I can make out the desert truffle is the manna referred to in the Bible,\u201d he suggests. \u201cAnd we went out and found this thing. Didn\u2019t taste great, but it was incredibly exciting.\u201d He has learned a lot, too, from spending time with a Native American tribe, the Nez Perce, in Idaho, who retain some of the ancient knowledge of hunter-gatherers. Not only did Phillips increase his knowledge of edible tubers, he became friends with an eminently quotable chief: \u201cHow long will it take mankind to realise that you cannot eat money?\u201d I suggest that, like the hunter-gatherers, Phillips must see a different countryside to the rest of us when he goes for a walk in the woods; so much to eat for a start \u2026 \u201cI find that particularly at the seaside,\u201d he says. \u201cI always think: what a dreadful waste. Just about everything is edible, and we hardly eat any of it. The Japanese know a hundred things to do with seaweed. I have no idea why we do not.\u201d Despite all the changes he has witnessed at first hand as a result of factory farming, he remains an optimist. He believes not only that we may see a necessary revival in sustainability, but that some of the more miraculous properties of fungi in particular might yet help us to fix the damage already done to the planet. \u201cFungi have been used to break down oil spills,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they will have a role to play in ridding the world of plastic.\u201d In the meantime, he follows Voltaire\u2019s dictum of \u201ctending his own garden\u201d. In London this involves organising the planting and upkeep of the communal plot in Ecclestone Square where he lives; and also doing a bit of experimenting at a small cottage he owns in Wiltshire. He cooks and eats outside whenever he can; his last birthday meal involved \u2013 \u201cbugger the neighbours\u201d \u2013 a wood fire on the balcony of his flat. And what about retirement, I ask, before he heads off back up river. He shudders at the thought. \u201cWe are going to be dust long enough,\u201d he says. And then he brightens. \u201cAccording to a French mycologist there is a mushroom that grows only on the human brain, in graveyards. I suppose because they are uniquely nutritious.\u201d He laughs at the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a comforting thought \u2013 but there it is.\u201d OFM The Worldwide Forager is published on 2 April (Unbound, \u00a325).

      "bodyText": "French voters were urged to turn out to vote in the first round of municipal elections, hours after a national shutdown of all non-essential shops and services. Polling stations opened on Sunday as planned despite calls for the two-round vote to be postponed as the coronavirus spread. On Saturday evening, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, announced the country was moving into stage 3 of its response to the coronavirus emergency and ordered a partial lockdown, including the closure of caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants and cinemas. Food shops, tobacconists, pharmacies and public transport will remain open, Philippe said, but transport ministers warned services would be reduced to a minimum this week to try to contain the spread of the virus. French schools and colleges have shut down indefinitely and people are advised to work from home where possible and avoid unnecessary journeys. The decision to shut down non-essential public places came as France reported 4,499 confirmed cases, including 91 deaths, according to the national health agency, Sant\u00e9 Publique France. At polling stations, voters were advised to keep a \u201csocial distance\u201d of one metre apart, to bring their own pens and to disinfect their hands before marking their voting paper. Priority was given to elderly and \u201cvulnerable\u201d voters. At midday, participation was 18.38%, five percentage points lower than at the same point during the last municipal elections in 2014. Philippe voted from Le Havre, where is standing for election as mayor. In Paris, the former president Nicolas Sarkozy and the current city mayor, Anne Hidalgo, were among the first to vote. President Emmanuel Macron was expected to vote in his home town at Le Touquet at lunchtime. Anthony Wimbush, a British company director based in Paris, said his local polling station in east of Paris was quiet. \u201cEveryone was keeping a metre apart and if you\u2019d forgotten a pen, as I had, they were offering disinfected ones. I saw some people wearing gloves but didn\u2019t see any masks,\u201d he said. At the local market, Wimbush said the food stalls were operating as normal, but police closed down a flower stall, considered non-essential. The normally busy Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris was deserted. One of the most contested municipal battles is in Paris, where opinion polls showed the Socialist Hidalgo remains favourite, closely followed by the mainstream right candidate, Rachida Dati, with Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, the candidate for the centrist government party, LREM, trailing in third place. Elisabeth Borne, the transport minister, said long distance public transport services would be slowly phased out and that people should avoid all unnecessary journeys. \u201cOur absolute objective is to slow down the spread of the virus to enable the health services to deal with it in the best way possible,\u201d Borne said. Jean Baptiste Djebbari, the transport secretary, added that 80% of the M\u00e9tro in Paris and 100% of buses and trams would run on Monday but services would be slowly reduced over the week. Seven out of 10 intercity and TGV services would run on Monday, reducing to half by the end of next week. Djebbari called for \u201cdiscipline and good civic behaviour\u201d. About 47.7 million people, including 330,000 citizens from other EU countries living in France, have the right to vote. Britons can no longer vote in France since the UK\u2019s departure from the EU on 31 January. Polling stations close at 8pm French time (7pm GMT). The second round of the elections is due to be held next Sunday.",

Policy action by central banks and finance ministries can help in this respect but only so much.

The Federal Reserve \u2013 the US central bank \u2013 did not need to be told by Donald Trump that it needed to cut interest rates and resume large-scale asset purchases known as quantitative easing. The world\u2019s most powerful central bank pulled out the stops on Sunday night by slashing rates to nearly zero and pledging to expand its balance sheet by $700bn. In the UK the coordinated response by the Bank of England and the Treasury last week was seen as a textbook example of how policymakers ought to respond to the crisis. It was, though, only the start.

Sunak will have to add to the \u00a312bn he has set aside to deal with Covid-19.

There is a limit to what they can do in the event of a combined supply and demand shock. Policymakers know that, which is why Sunak stressed in his budget speech that the economy faced a tough period. The aim is make the downturn as short and shallow as possible, even though the chances of this look vanishingly small. One reason for that is because the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 is enormous. Entire countries \u2013 Italy and Spain \u2013 are in lockdown. The problems facing airline companies are symptomatic of a crisis facing the global travel industry, from cruise companies to hotels that cater for tourists. Discretionary spending by consumers appears to have collapsed in recent days. Despite globalisation, much economic activity remains local but here, too, there will be an impact as people cancel appointments at the dentist, put off having their hair cut and wait to put their house on the market. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has estimated that output in Britain will shrink by 2.5% in the second quarter but says a 5% fall is possible. The more pessimistic estimate looks quite plausible. What\u2019s more, in a service-sector dominated economy much of the lost output is never going to be recovered. If people do not go out to their weekly meal at their favourite local restaurant for the next two months they are not going to eat out four times a week when the fear of infection has been lifted. It also seems likely that the economic pain will go on for longer than originally estimated. Having imposed bans and restrictions, governments and private-sector bodies will be cautious about removing them. Countries such as Italy will be wary of opening their borders while there is a fear of reinfection. The idea that Premier League football will be back by early April is fanciful. There is also a question of how long it will take consumer and business confidence to recover. Policy action by central banks and finance ministries can help in this respect but only so much. The chances are that the imminent recession will be U-shaped: a steep decline followed by a period of bumping along the bottom. There will be recovery but it will take time and only after much damage has been caused.",

      "body": "<p>Sami Tamimi was 17 when he moved out of his family home in East Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. He was gay and he knew his Muslim father especially would struggle to accept that. \u201cI was an angry kid,\u201d recalls Tamimi, who is now 52, at one of his restaurants, Rovi in central London. \u201cBecause of the whole sexuality thing, I couldn\u2019t talk about it to anybody. But I come from a different place now. I had a lot to prove. And I did it. I\u2019m not angry now. The opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Tamimi worked in West Jerusalem and Tel Aviv before moving to London in 1997 where he was head chef at the deli Baker &amp; Spice. Here he met Yotam Ottolenghi, an Israeli who also grew up in Jerusalem. Ottolenghi left in 2001 to start his own place, and Tamimi joined not long after; they have been business partners ever since.</p> <p>It was while they were putting together recipes for their 2012 bestseller <em>Jerusalem</em> that Tamimi began to appreciate how his Palestinian roots influenced his food. But he remained estranged from his family. \u201cI lost contact for almost 17 years,\u201d he says, with a wistful shake of his head.</p> <p>\u201cTime flies when you\u2019re chopping an onion,\u201d adds Tara Wigley, one of the \u201cOttolenghi family\u201d for a decade, who shares the writing with Tamimi on a new cookbook, <em>Falastin</em>.</p> <p><em>Falastin</em> \u2013 there\u2019s no \u201cp\u201d in Arabic \u2013 is, Wigley says, \u201cSami\u2019s love letter home\u201d. Tamimi calls it simply: \u201cThe book I always wanted to write.\u201d He goes on, \u201cIt\u2019s the food I always go back to; it\u2019s my mother\u2019s kind of cooking. The legacy of Ottolenghi started with these flavours.\u201d</p> <p>What is Palestinian food? The answer is complicated. In Gaza, it is dominated by fish and spices; in the West Bank, it is meats, flatbread and fermented yogurt. Tahini, za\u2019atar and shatta, a condiment made from red or green chillies, are ubiquitous. \u201cPeople are ready to zoom in, rather than just call it Middle Eastern food,\u201d says Wigley, who worked alongside Ottolenghi on <em>Plenty More</em> and <em>Simple</em>. \u201cNo one needs to know from us how to make tabbouleh traditionally, so we\u2019ve got three new tabboulehs. But we also have chicken musakhan, sumac onions and the \u201cupside down\u201d maqluba dish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPalestinian food is very earthy, it\u2019s not pretty to look at,\u201d Tamimi chips in. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of beige and brown. We had a few arguments before we decided: \u2018OK, we\u2019re gonna have to zhuzh it up a bit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Both Wigley and Tamimi spent time with Palestinian chefs and home cooks. For Wigley, it was an opportunity to tell the stories of individuals in <em>Falastin</em>. For Tamimi, it was a chance to reconnect with his huge family. \u201cEvery day, they\u2019ll invite you for breakfast and you go home at midnight,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThey\u2019re competing to cook the best meal for me. We don\u2019t ever say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 but you show it in different ways.\u201d</p> <h2>Hummus two ways \u2013 kofta &amp; aubergine</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9fb8edf09cc704926fbc78cd1d287c5ee01a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9fb8edf09cc704926fbc78cd1d287c5ee01a66/0_1820_4883_4731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hummus two ways.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"969\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Hummus should, ideally, be served freshly made and still warm. If you do want to make it in advance, though, that\u2019s fine: just store it in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for up to 4 days. If the hummus develops a bit of a skin then just give it a stir before serving. The most important thing if storing in the fridge, is to bring it back to room temperature before serving, to warm and loosen up.</p> <p>The meatballs can be made, rolled and kept in the fridge for a day before serving, all ready to fry. If doing this, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, but don\u2019t pack them too tightly: you want them to keep their round shape. They also freeze well, for up to a month. If you fry them from frozen they will need a couple more minutes in the oven to warm through.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves </strong></em><em><strong>6 </strong></em><br><em><strong>For the hummus </strong></em><br><strong>dried chickpeas </strong>250g, soaked overnight in double their volume of water <br><strong>bicarbonate of soda</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>tahini</strong> 270g <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 60ml <br><strong>garlic</strong> 4<strong> </strong>cloves, crushed <br><strong>salt</strong> <br><strong>ice-cold water</strong> 100ml</p> <p><em><strong>For kofta </strong></em><em><strong>hummus</strong></em><br><strong>beef or veal mince (or a mixture of both)</strong> 500g <br><strong>onion</strong> 1 small, peeled and coarsely grated <br><strong>tomato</strong> 1 large, coarsely grated and skin discarded (65g) <br><strong>parsley </strong>20g, finely chopped<br><strong>red chilli</strong> 1, deseeded and finely chopped<br><strong>olive oil </strong>about 45ml, to fry<br><strong>salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p><em><strong>For the kofta hummus topping</strong></em><br><strong>olive oil</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>pine nuts </strong>25g <br><strong>parsley</strong> 5g, roughly chopped <br><strong>Aleppo chilli flakes</strong> \u00bd tsp (or \u00bc tsp regular chilli flakes) <br><strong>mint leaves </strong>a few (optional)</p> <p><em><strong>For aubergine </strong></em><em><strong>hummus</strong></em><br><strong>aubergines</strong> 2 large, cut into roughly 2cm cubes (500g) <br><strong>sunflower oil </strong>about 300ml, to fry <br><strong>walnut halves </strong>160g, roughly chopped <br><strong>parsley leaves</strong> 10g, roughly chopped <br><strong>mint leaves </strong>10g, roughly chopped <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp <br><strong>Aleppo chilli flakes</strong> \u00bd tsp</p> <p>To make the hummus, drain the chickpeas and place them in a medium saucepan on a high heat. Add the bicarbonate of soda and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 1\u00bd litres of water and bring to the boil. Cook for about 30 minutes \u2013 timing can vary from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the freshness of the chickpeas \u2013 skimming off any foam that appears. The chickpeas are ready when they collapse easily when pressed between thumb and finger: almost but not quite mushy.</p> <p>Drain the chickpeas and transfer them to a food processor. Process to form a stiff paste and then, with the machine still running, add the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and continue to process for another 5 minutes: this will feel like a long time but it is what is needed to get a very smooth and creamy paste. Transfer to a bowl and set aside at room temperature, until needed. If you are making it in advance then transfer to a sealed container and keep in the fridge. Remove it half an hour before serving, to bring it back to room temperature, and give it a good stir if a \u201cskin\u201d has formed.</p> <p><strong>To make the kofta </strong><strong>hummus:</strong> Place all the ingredients for the meatballs, apart from the olive oil, in a medium bowl with 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Using your hands, mix well to combine. With wet hands, roll the mixture into roughly 3cm balls (weighing about 15g each): you should make about 45 balls.</p> <p>To make the topping, put the tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium heat. Add the pine nuts and cook for a minute, stirring constantly, until they are golden brown. Spoon the nuts, along with the oil from the pan, into a little bowl and set aside.</p> <p>Add a tablespoon of the oil for frying the kofta to the same pan and place on a medium heat. Add a third of the meatballs \u2013 or as many as you can fit into the pan without overcrowding \u2013 and cook for about 3 minutes, turning throughout so that all sides take on colour and the balls are just cooked through. Keep them somewhere warm while you continue with the remaining balls, adding another tablespoon of oil with each batch.</p> <p>When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual shallow bowls, creating a slight hollow in the centre of each. Divide the meatballs between the bowls, placing them in the middle of the hummus, and spoon over the pine nuts and their cooking oil. Sprinkle over the parsley, chilli and mint, if using, and serve with a final drizzle of olive oil.</p> <p><strong>To make the aubergine </strong><strong>hummus: </strong>Place the aubergines in a colander placed over a bowl or in the sink and sprinkle over 1 teaspoon of salt. Use your hands to mix well, then set aside for about 45 minutes: this is so that the bitter juices can be released. Transfer the aubergines to a tray lined with kitchen paper and pat dry as best you can.</p> <p>Put the sunflower oil into a medium frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the aubergines \u2013 in two or three batches so as to not overcrowd the pan \u2013 and fry for about 8 minutes, until completely softened and golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the aubergines to another tray lined with kitchen paper (or the same tray lined with fresh kitchen paper) and set aside, for the excess oil to be absorbed, while you continue with the remaining batches. Transfer the aubergines to a bowl, add the walnuts, parsley, mint, lemon, olive oil and Aleppo chilli and mix well to combine.</p> <p>When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual serving bowls, creating a small well in the middle of each portion. Spoon in the aubergine and serve at once.</p> <p>Serve the hummus with warm pita for scooping, along with a chopped salad to lighten things up.</p> <h2>Shatta (red or green)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcabbf86484351d837c44553fcfe4b5cb39cd28d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcabbf86484351d837c44553fcfe4b5cb39cd28d/0_0_5064_5765/878.jpg\" alt=\"Shatta, red and green.\" width=\"878\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This fiery condiment is as easy to make as it is to become addicted to. Shatta is there on every Palestinian table, cutting through rich foods or pepping up others. Eggs, fish, meat, vegetables: they all love it. Our recommendation is to keep a jar in your fridge or cupboard at all times.</p> <p>Once made, shatta will keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. The oil will firm up and separate from the chillies once it\u2019s in the fridge, so just give it a good stir, for everything to combine, before using.</p> <p>As with anything being left to ferment, the jar you put your chillies into needs to be properly sterilised. There are various ways to do this. A water bath (where the jars go into the water, with their lids added separately, the water is brought to the boil and then the jars are \u201ccooked\u201d for 10 minutes), or filing them with just-boiled water and then rinsing and drying them with a clean tea-towel. We tend to just put them into the dishwasher and run it as a normal wash: it works very well.</p> <p><em><strong>Makes 1 medium jar </strong></em><br><strong>red or green chillies</strong> 250g, stems trimmed and then very thinly sliced (with seeds) <br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>cider vinegar</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>olive oil</strong> to cover and seal</p> <p>Place the chillies and salt in a medium sterilised jar and mix well. Seal the jar and store in the fridge for 3 days. On the third day, drain the chillies, transfer them to a food processor and blitz: you can either blitz well to form a fine paste or roughly blitz so that some texture remains. Add the vinegar and lemon juice, mix to combine, then return the mixture to the same jar. Pour enough olive oil on top to seal, and keep in the fridge.</p> <h2>Baby gem lettuce with burnt aubergine yogurt, smacked cucumber &amp; shatta</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6ce78ed0e5850dd19f2e5002275733afcf12105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6ce78ed0e5850dd19f2e5002275733afcf12105/0_908_5197_5191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shatta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This works well either as a stand-alone starter or as part of a spread or side. It\u2019s lovely with some hot smoked salmon or trout. Thanks to Ottolenghi chef Calvin Von Niebel for this salad. The shatta needs to be made in advance.</p> <p>Some crumbled feta on top works very well, and if you don\u2019t have the urfa chilli flakes, just use a pinch of black nigella seeds or some black sesame seeds.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves </strong></em><em><strong>4 generously </strong></em><br><strong>baby gem lettuces</strong> 5-6 (500g), bases trimmed <br><strong>salt and black pepper </strong><br><strong>red or green shatta </strong>1\u00bd tbsp (see recipe above), or rose harissa, as an alternative <br><strong>urfa chilli flakes </strong>\u00bd tsp (or a small pinch of nigella seeds or black sesame seeds)</p> <p><em><strong>For the aubergine yog</strong></em><em><strong>urt </strong></em><br><strong>aubergines</strong> 2 large (500g) <br><strong>Greek-style yog</strong><strong>urt</strong> 35g <br><strong>garlic</strong> \u00bd clove, roughly chopped <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 1\u00bd tbsp <br><strong>tahini </strong>1\u00bd tbsp (25g)</p> <p><em><strong>For the smacked cucumber </strong></em><br><strong>cucumber </strong>1 regular English (ie not a small Lebanese), peeled, sliced in half lengthways and watery seeds removed (180g) <br><strong>parsley</strong> 25g, roughly chopped <br><strong>mint leaves</strong> 25g, roughly chopped <br><strong>garlic</strong> \u00bd clove, roughly chopped <br><strong>olive oil </strong>50ml</p> <p>The more you char your aubergines, the smokier the flesh. Unless you don\u2019t mind your whole house smelling of aubergines, ventilation is key. We char our aubergines in one of two ways. The first, if you have a gas cooker, is to put one aubergine over each gas ring, switch the flame on high and leave it there for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway with long tongs so that all sides get charred. Any mess can be minimised if in the first place if you cover your stove top with tin foil. Make holes in the foil for the gas rings to pop through, then proceed.</p> <p>If you have an induction hob, heat up a chargrill pan until very hot \u2013 sit it on a high heat for at least 5 minutes, until it is smoking. Pierce the aubergines a few times with a sharp knife then add them to the pan. This method takes longer than the open flame \u2013 around 35-40 minutes, again turning throughout with tongs so that all sides get charred \u2013 but will get the same result. At the end of the 40 minutes, transfer the aubergine to a foil-lined tray and place under a hot grill for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Once charred, place the aubergines in a colander. When cool enough to handle, slit them open to scoop out the flesh and place in a clean colander. Set aside for an hour or so (or overnight) over a bowl to drain.</p> <p>The scooped-out flesh should weigh about 160g. Place this in the bowl of a food processor along with the yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, tahini and \u00bd a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about a minute, until completely smooth, then set aside until needed.</p> <p>Prepare the cucumber by placing each half on a chopping board, cut side facing down. Using the flat side of a large knife, lightly smack them until bruised but still holding their shape. Cut the cucumber into roughly 1cm dice and set aside in a dish.</p> <p>Clean the food processor, then add the parsley, mint, garlic, olive oil and \u00bc a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides a couple of times if you need to, to form a smooth paste, then add to the cucumber. Set aside for at least 20 minutes (and up to a day in advance if kept in the fridge) for the flavours to infuse.</p> <p>Slice each head of baby gem lengthways to make 8 long thin wedges (per lettuce). When ready to assemble, arrange the lettuce on a round platter, overlapping the outer and inner circle to look like the petals of a flower. Lightly sprinkle the wedges with salt and a grind of black pepper, then splatter over the aubergine yogurt. Spoon over the cucumber, drizzle with the shatta, sprinkle over the chilli flakes and serve.</p> <h2>Prawn &amp; tomato stew with coriander pesto</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a0c055208d237a92cdfa9153bdbf49849d918b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a0c055208d237a92cdfa9153bdbf49849d918b9/67_779_4585_4585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prawn tomato stew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Serve this as it is, with some crusty white bread to mop up the juices, or dot some cubes of white feta or black olives (or both) on top. A crisp green salad with a lemony dressing on the side and you\u2019re all set.</p> <p>Batch-make the base for the stew here, if you like: this freezes well and keeps in the fridge for a good few days. That way you can just char your cherry tomatoes and pan-fry the prawns in minutes. The coriander pesto can also be made up to 3 days in advance and kept in the fridge.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves </strong></em><em><strong>4 </strong></em><br><strong>cherry tomatoes </strong>250g <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 60ml <br><strong>onion </strong>1 large, finely chopped (180g) <br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves, crushed <br><strong>ginger</strong> 2cm piece, peeled and finely grated (15g) <br><strong>green chilli </strong>1, finely chopped <br><strong>coriander seeds</strong> 2 tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar <br><strong>cumin seeds</strong> 1\u00bd tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar<br><strong>cardamom pods </strong>8, lightly bashed in a pestle and mortar <br><strong>dill</strong> 20g, finely chopped <br><strong>tomato puree </strong>2 tsp <br><strong>plum tomatoes </strong>6, roughly chopped (500g) <br><strong>salt and black pepper </strong><br><strong>raw king prawns</strong> 600g, peeled</p> <p><em><strong>For the coriander pesto </strong></em><br><strong>coriander</strong> 30g, roughly chopped <br><strong>green chilli</strong> 1, finely chopped <br><strong>pine nuts</strong> 50g, lightly toasted <br><strong>lemon</strong> 1, finely grate the zest to get 1\u00bd tsp, then cut into wedges, to serve <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 80ml</p> <p>Place a large saut\u00e9 pan on a high heat. Toss the cherry tomatoes with 1 teaspoon of oil and, once the pan is very hot, add the tomatoes. Cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice, until blistered and heavily charred on all sides. Remove the tomatoes from the pan and set them aside.</p> <p>Wipe the pan clean, add 2 tablespoons of oil and replace it on the stove on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli, spices, dill and tomato puree and cook for another 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the plum tomatoes, 300ml of water, 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have completely broken down.</p> <p>While the sauce is cooking, make the coriander pesto. Put the coriander, chilli and pine nuts into a food processor and pulse a few times until the pine nuts are roughly crumbled. Transfer to a bowl and add the lemon zest, oil, \u00bc teaspoon of salt and a grind of black pepper. Mix to combine, then set aside.</p> <p>Pat the prawns dry and mix them in a bowl with \u00bc teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of oil and a good grind of black pepper.</p> <p>Put 2 teaspoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a high heat. Once hot, add the prawns in batches and fry for a minute on each side, until cooked through and nicely browned. Set each batch aside while you continue with the remaining prawns. When the sauce is ready, stir in the prawns and charred tomatoes and cook on a medium heat for about another 3 minutes, to heat through. Serve either straight from the pan or spoon into wide shallow bowls. Scoop out the cardamom pods before serving, if you like: they are there to flavour the dish rather than to be eaten. Dot with about half of the pesto and serve at once, with the lemon and remaining pesto in a bowl alongside.</p> <h2>Fish kofta with yogurt, sumac &amp; chilli </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459248f9ee45481ad484f567e38bfa4d24557cb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459248f9ee45481ad484f567e38bfa4d24557cb3/186_1191_4808_4808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish kofta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These herb- and spice-packed kofta make a lovely starter, or a light meal in themselves, packed into a pita and served with a chopped salad. These can be made in advance \u2013 up to a day, if you like \u2013 up to the point where they are about to go into the oven. Once cooked they can be eaten the next day \u2013 the flavours actually improve \u2013 either at room temperature or warmed through.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><br><strong>olive oil</strong> 90ml <br><strong>onions</strong> 2 large, finely chopped <br><strong>garlic</strong> 6 cloves, crushed <br><strong>cod fillet or loin </strong>700g, skinless and boneless, chopped into 3cm chunks <br><strong>red chillies</strong> 2, one finely chopped and one finely sliced, to serve <br><strong>parsley leaves </strong>15g, roughly chopped <br><strong>dill</strong> 15g, roughly chopped, plus a few extra picked leaves to serve <br><strong>lemon</strong> 1, finely grate the zest to get 2 tsp, then cut into 4 wedges <br><strong>egg</strong> 1 <br><strong>fish spice mix</strong> 2 tsp (see below) <br><strong>sumac </strong>1 tbsp <br><strong>Greek-style yog</strong><strong>urt </strong>200g <br><strong>salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p><em><strong>For the fish spice mix</strong></em><br><strong>ground cardamom</strong> 2 tsp <br><strong>ground cumin</strong> 2 tsp <br><strong>paprika</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>ground turmeric</strong> 2 tsp</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C fan/gas mark 9.</p> <p>Put 3 tablespoons of the oil into a large saut\u00e9 pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook for 12-14 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until softened and golden. Add the garlic and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside until completely cool.</p> <p>Put the fish into a food processor and pulse a few times until finely chopped but not a complete paste. Transfer to a large bowl and add the cooled onion mixture, chopped chilli, herbs, lemon zest, egg, fish spice mix, 2 teaspoons of sumac, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well to combine, then, using your hands, shape the mixture into about 15 kofta: they should each be about 5cm wide and weigh about 65g.</p> <p>Put 2 tablespoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the kofta in batches of 2 or 3 and fry for about 4 minutes, turning halfway through so that both sides are golden brown. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for 4 or 5 minutes, until just cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes or so, to slightly cool.</p> <p>To serve, spread the yogurt evenly between four serving plates and top each with 3 fish kofta, saving any extra for seconds. Sprinkle the kofta with the remaining teaspoon of sumac, the picked dill and sliced chilli. Drizzle over the last tablespoon of oil and serve, with a lemon wedge alongside.</p> <p><em>The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/search\" title=\"\">Good Fish Guide</a></em></p> <h2>Chicken shawarma pie</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"765ee97f517544ed0a76cb0f039a4c165b1c5220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/765ee97f517544ed0a76cb0f039a4c165b1c5220/0_827_5068_5068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken shawarma pie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a wow of a pie.

Transfer this to the tin so that the base is covered and the filo rises up and over the tin\u2019s sides. Repeat with the next sheet of filo, brushing it first with butter, then arranging it in the tin, rotating it slightly so that the excess hangs at a different angle.

Brush the top with the butter mixture, then repeat with the last piece of filo, angling it to cover any exposed areas. Now fold over the overhang, crinkling up the filo to create a nice crumpled effect on the top.

The filling is traditionally made with ishta \u2013 a kind of thick, silky cream \u2013 which is then drizzled with rose water or rose water syrup.

Set aside.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6.</p> <p>To make the filling, put the cream cheese, cornflour, sugar, salt and mastic (or vanilla bean paste) into a medium bowl and whisk well to combine.</p> <p>To assemble, spread one filo sheet out on a work surface and brush evenly with some of the melted butter. Top with another sheet and brush with butter again. Repeat the process until you have 5 layers evenly brushed with butter. As is always the case when working with filo, you\u2019ll need to work fast when you start brushing and folding: the pastry will dry out if you don\u2019t. You should have used about a quarter of the melted butter at this stage.</p> <p>Using sharp scissors, cut the layered sheet of pastry into 6 squares, all 12cm x 12cm \u2013 you\u2019ll need to trim the sheets to get even squares. Taking one square at a time, spoon about 35g (or 2 tablespoons) of the thick filling into the centre of each square, leaving a 2-3cm border around the edge. Fold the pastry diagonally in half to form a triangle, press on the edges without reaching the filling (so that it stays well sealed within the pastry), then brush all over with more butter. Once all 6 triangle pastries are on a parchment-lined baking tray, repeat the whole process (brushing one large filo sheet with butter, layering it 5 times, cutting it into 6 squares, filling and folding and sealing each square) with the remaining pastry, butter and filling.</p> <p>Once all 12 pastries are made up and spread on two parchment-lined baking trays, bake for 22 minutes or until golden and crisp: some of them will pop open, but that\u2019s OK. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.

      "bodyText": "Sami Tamimi was 17 when he moved out of his family home in East Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. He was gay and he knew his Muslim father especially would struggle to accept that. \u201cI was an angry kid,\u201d recalls Tamimi, who is now 52, at one of his restaurants, Rovi in central London. \u201cBecause of the whole sexuality thing, I couldn\u2019t talk about it to anybody. But I come from a different place now. I had a lot to prove. And I did it. I\u2019m not angry now. The opposite.\u201d Tamimi worked in West Jerusalem and Tel Aviv before moving to London in 1997 where he was head chef at the deli Baker &amp; Spice. Here he met Yotam Ottolenghi, an Israeli who also grew up in Jerusalem. Ottolenghi left in 2001 to start his own place, and Tamimi joined not long after; they have been business partners ever since. It was while they were putting together recipes for their 2012 bestseller Jerusalem that Tamimi began to appreciate how his Palestinian roots influenced his food. But he remained estranged from his family. \u201cI lost contact for almost 17 years,\u201d he says, with a wistful shake of his head. \u201cTime flies when you\u2019re chopping an onion,\u201d adds Tara Wigley, one of the \u201cOttolenghi family\u201d for a decade, who shares the writing with Tamimi on a new cookbook, Falastin. Falastin \u2013 there\u2019s no \u201cp\u201d in Arabic \u2013 is, Wigley says, \u201cSami\u2019s love letter home\u201d. Tamimi calls it simply: \u201cThe book I always wanted to write.\u201d He goes on, \u201cIt\u2019s the food I always go back to; it\u2019s my mother\u2019s kind of cooking. The legacy of Ottolenghi started with these flavours.\u201d What is Palestinian food? The answer is complicated. In Gaza, it is dominated by fish and spices; in the West Bank, it is meats, flatbread and fermented yogurt. Tahini, za\u2019atar and shatta, a condiment made from red or green chillies, are ubiquitous. \u201cPeople are ready to zoom in, rather than just call it Middle Eastern food,\u201d says Wigley, who worked alongside Ottolenghi on Plenty More and Simple. \u201cNo one needs to know from us how to make tabbouleh traditionally, so we\u2019ve got three new tabboulehs. But we also have chicken musakhan, sumac onions and the \u201cupside down\u201d maqluba dish.\u201d \u201cPalestinian food is very earthy, it\u2019s not pretty to look at,\u201d Tamimi chips in. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of beige and brown. We had a few arguments before we decided: \u2018OK, we\u2019re gonna have to zhuzh it up a bit.\u2019\u201d Both Wigley and Tamimi spent time with Palestinian chefs and home cooks. For Wigley, it was an opportunity to tell the stories of individuals in Falastin. For Tamimi, it was a chance to reconnect with his huge family. \u201cEvery day, they\u2019ll invite you for breakfast and you go home at midnight,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThey\u2019re competing to cook the best meal for me. We don\u2019t ever say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 but you show it in different ways.\u201d Hummus two ways \u2013 kofta &amp; aubergine Hummus should, ideally, be served freshly made and still warm. If you do want to make it in advance, though, that\u2019s fine: just store it in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for up to 4 days. If the hummus develops a bit of a skin then just give it a stir before serving. The most important thing if storing in the fridge, is to bring it back to room temperature before serving, to warm and loosen up. The meatballs can be made, rolled and kept in the fridge for a day before serving, all ready to fry. If doing this, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, but don\u2019t pack them too tightly: you want them to keep their round shape. They also freeze well, for up to a month. If you fry them from frozen they will need a couple more minutes in the oven to warm through. Serves 6 For the hummus dried chickpeas 250g, soaked overnight in double their volume of water bicarbonate of soda 1 tsp tahini 270g lemon juice 60ml garlic 4 cloves, crushed salt ice-cold water 100ml For kofta hummus beef or veal mince (or a mixture of both) 500g onion 1 small, peeled and coarsely grated tomato 1 large, coarsely grated and skin discarded (65g) parsley 20g, finely chopped red chilli 1, deseeded and finely chopped olive oil about 45ml, to fry salt and black pepper For the kofta hummus topping olive oil 1 tbsp pine nuts 25g parsley 5g, roughly chopped Aleppo chilli flakes \u00bd tsp (or \u00bc tsp regular chilli flakes) mint leaves a few (optional) For aubergine hummus aubergines 2 large, cut into roughly 2cm cubes (500g) sunflower oil about 300ml, to fry walnut halves 160g, roughly chopped parsley leaves 10g, roughly chopped mint leaves 10g, roughly chopped lemon juice 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp Aleppo chilli flakes \u00bd tsp To make the hummus, drain the chickpeas and place them in a medium saucepan on a high heat. Add the bicarbonate of soda and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 1\u00bd litres of water and bring to the boil. Cook for about 30 minutes \u2013 timing can vary from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the freshness of the chickpeas \u2013 skimming off any foam that appears. The chickpeas are ready when they collapse easily when pressed between thumb and finger: almost but not quite mushy. Drain the chickpeas and transfer them to a food processor. Process to form a stiff paste and then, with the machine still running, add the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and continue to process for another 5 minutes: this will feel like a long time but it is what is needed to get a very smooth and creamy paste. Transfer to a bowl and set aside at room temperature, until needed. If you are making it in advance then transfer to a sealed container and keep in the fridge. Remove it half an hour before serving, to bring it back to room temperature, and give it a good stir if a \u201cskin\u201d has formed. To make the kofta hummus: Place all the ingredients for the meatballs, apart from the olive oil, in a medium bowl with 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Using your hands, mix well to combine. With wet hands, roll the mixture into roughly 3cm balls (weighing about 15g each): you should make about 45 balls. To make the topping, put the tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium heat. Add the pine nuts and cook for a minute, stirring constantly, until they are golden brown. Spoon the nuts, along with the oil from the pan, into a little bowl and set aside. Add a tablespoon of the oil for frying the kofta to the same pan and place on a medium heat. Add a third of the meatballs \u2013 or as many as you can fit into the pan without overcrowding \u2013 and cook for about 3 minutes, turning throughout so that all sides take on colour and the balls are just cooked through. Keep them somewhere warm while you continue with the remaining balls, adding another tablespoon of oil with each batch. When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual shallow bowls, creating a slight hollow in the centre of each. Divide the meatballs between the bowls, placing them in the middle of the hummus, and spoon over the pine nuts and their cooking oil. Sprinkle over the parsley, chilli and mint, if using, and serve with a final drizzle of olive oil. To make the aubergine hummus: Place the aubergines in a colander placed over a bowl or in the sink and sprinkle over 1 teaspoon of salt. Use your hands to mix well, then set aside for about 45 minutes: this is so that the bitter juices can be released. Transfer the aubergines to a tray lined with kitchen paper and pat dry as best you can. Put the sunflower oil into a medium frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the aubergines \u2013 in two or three batches so as to not overcrowd the pan \u2013 and fry for about 8 minutes, until completely softened and golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the aubergines to another tray lined with kitchen paper (or the same tray lined with fresh kitchen paper) and set aside, for the excess oil to be absorbed, while you continue with the remaining batches. Transfer the aubergines to a bowl, add the walnuts, parsley, mint, lemon, olive oil and Aleppo chilli and mix well to combine. When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual serving bowls, creating a small well in the middle of each portion. Spoon in the aubergine and serve at once. Serve the hummus with warm pita for scooping, along with a chopped salad to lighten things up. Shatta (red or green) This fiery condiment is as easy to make as it is to become addicted to. Shatta is there on every Palestinian table, cutting through rich foods or pepping up others. Eggs, fish, meat, vegetables: they all love it. Our recommendation is to keep a jar in your fridge or cupboard at all times. Once made, shatta will keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. The oil will firm up and separate from the chillies once it\u2019s in the fridge, so just give it a good stir, for everything to combine, before using. As with anything being left to ferment, the jar you put your chillies into needs to be properly sterilised. There are various ways to do this. A water bath (where the jars go into the water, with their lids added separately, the water is brought to the boil and then the jars are \u201ccooked\u201d for 10 minutes), or filing them with just-boiled water and then rinsing and drying them with a clean tea-towel. We tend to just put them into the dishwasher and run it as a normal wash: it works very well. Makes 1 medium jar red or green chillies 250g, stems trimmed and then very thinly sliced (with seeds) salt 1 tbsp cider vinegar 3 tbsp lemon juice 1 tbsp olive oil to cover and seal Place the chillies and salt in a medium sterilised jar and mix well. Seal the jar and store in the fridge for 3 days. On the third day, drain the chillies, transfer them to a food processor and blitz: you can either blitz well to form a fine paste or roughly blitz so that some texture remains. Add the vinegar and lemon juice, mix to combine, then return the mixture to the same jar. Pour enough olive oil on top to seal, and keep in the fridge. Baby gem lettuce with burnt aubergine yogurt, smacked cucumber &amp; shatta This works well either as a stand-alone starter or as part of a spread or side. It\u2019s lovely with some hot smoked salmon or trout. Thanks to Ottolenghi chef Calvin Von Niebel for this salad. The shatta needs to be made in advance. Some crumbled feta on top works very well, and if you don\u2019t have the urfa chilli flakes, just use a pinch of black nigella seeds or some black sesame seeds. Serves 4 generously baby gem lettuces 5-6 (500g), bases trimmed salt and black pepper red or green shatta 1\u00bd tbsp (see recipe above), or rose harissa, as an alternative urfa chilli flakes \u00bd tsp (or a small pinch of nigella seeds or black sesame seeds) For the aubergine yogurt aubergines 2 large (500g) Greek-style yogurt 35g garlic \u00bd clove, roughly chopped lemon juice 1\u00bd tbsp tahini 1\u00bd tbsp (25g) For the smacked cucumber cucumber 1 regular English (ie not a small Lebanese), peeled, sliced in half lengthways and watery seeds removed (180g) parsley 25g, roughly chopped mint leaves 25g, roughly chopped garlic \u00bd clove, roughly chopped olive oil 50ml The more you char your aubergines, the smokier the flesh. Unless you don\u2019t mind your whole house smelling of aubergines, ventilation is key. We char our aubergines in one of two ways. The first, if you have a gas cooker, is to put one aubergine over each gas ring, switch the flame on high and leave it there for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway with long tongs so that all sides get charred. Any mess can be minimised if in the first place if you cover your stove top with tin foil. Make holes in the foil for the gas rings to pop through, then proceed. If you have an induction hob, heat up a chargrill pan until very hot \u2013 sit it on a high heat for at least 5 minutes, until it is smoking. Pierce the aubergines a few times with a sharp knife then add them to the pan. This method takes longer than the open flame \u2013 around 35-40 minutes, again turning throughout with tongs so that all sides get charred \u2013 but will get the same result. At the end of the 40 minutes, transfer the aubergine to a foil-lined tray and place under a hot grill for 10 minutes. Once charred, place the aubergines in a colander. When cool enough to handle, slit them open to scoop out the flesh and place in a clean colander. Set aside for an hour or so (or overnight) over a bowl to drain. The scooped-out flesh should weigh about 160g. Place this in the bowl of a food processor along with the yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, tahini and \u00bd a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about a minute, until completely smooth, then set aside until needed. Prepare the cucumber by placing each half on a chopping board, cut side facing down. Using the flat side of a large knife, lightly smack them until bruised but still holding their shape. Cut the cucumber into roughly 1cm dice and set aside in a dish. Clean the food processor, then add the parsley, mint, garlic, olive oil and \u00bc a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides a couple of times if you need to, to form a smooth paste, then add to the cucumber. Set aside for at least 20 minutes (and up to a day in advance if kept in the fridge) for the flavours to infuse. Slice each head of baby gem lengthways to make 8 long thin wedges (per lettuce). When ready to assemble, arrange the lettuce on a round platter, overlapping the outer and inner circle to look like the petals of a flower. Lightly sprinkle the wedges with salt and a grind of black pepper, then splatter over the aubergine yogurt. Spoon over the cucumber, drizzle with the shatta, sprinkle over the chilli flakes and serve. Prawn &amp; tomato stew with coriander pesto Serve this as it is, with some crusty white bread to mop up the juices, or dot some cubes of white feta or black olives (or both) on top. A crisp green salad with a lemony dressing on the side and you\u2019re all set. Batch-make the base for the stew here, if you like: this freezes well and keeps in the fridge for a good few days. That way you can just char your cherry tomatoes and pan-fry the prawns in minutes. The coriander pesto can also be made up to 3 days in advance and kept in the fridge. Serves 4 cherry tomatoes 250g olive oil 60ml onion 1 large, finely chopped (180g) garlic 4 cloves, crushed ginger 2cm piece, peeled and finely grated (15g) green chilli 1, finely chopped coriander seeds 2 tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar cumin seeds 1\u00bd tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar cardamom pods 8, lightly bashed in a pestle and mortar dill 20g, finely chopped tomato puree 2 tsp plum tomatoes 6, roughly chopped (500g) salt and black pepper raw king prawns 600g, peeled For the coriander pesto coriander 30g, roughly chopped green chilli 1, finely chopped pine nuts 50g, lightly toasted lemon 1, finely grate the zest to get 1\u00bd tsp, then cut into wedges, to serve olive oil 80ml Place a large saut\u00e9 pan on a high heat. Toss the cherry tomatoes with 1 teaspoon of oil and, once the pan is very hot, add the tomatoes. Cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice, until blistered and heavily charred on all sides. Remove the tomatoes from the pan and set them aside. Wipe the pan clean, add 2 tablespoons of oil and replace it on the stove on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli, spices, dill and tomato puree and cook for another 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the plum tomatoes, 300ml of water, 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have completely broken down. While the sauce is cooking, make the coriander pesto. Put the coriander, chilli and pine nuts into a food processor and pulse a few times until the pine nuts are roughly crumbled. Transfer to a bowl and add the lemon zest, oil, \u00bc teaspoon of salt and a grind of black pepper. Mix to combine, then set aside. Pat the prawns dry and mix them in a bowl with \u00bc teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of oil and a good grind of black pepper. Put 2 teaspoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a high heat. Once hot, add the prawns in batches and fry for a minute on each side, until cooked through and nicely browned. Set each batch aside while you continue with the remaining prawns. When the sauce is ready, stir in the prawns and charred tomatoes and cook on a medium heat for about another 3 minutes, to heat through. Serve either straight from the pan or spoon into wide shallow bowls. Scoop out the cardamom pods before serving, if you like: they are there to flavour the dish rather than to be eaten. Dot with about half of the pesto and serve at once, with the lemon and remaining pesto in a bowl alongside. Fish kofta with yogurt, sumac &amp; chilli These herb- and spice-packed kofta make a lovely starter, or a light meal in themselves, packed into a pita and served with a chopped salad. These can be made in advance \u2013 up to a day, if you like \u2013 up to the point where they are about to go into the oven. Once cooked they can be eaten the next day \u2013 the flavours actually improve \u2013 either at room temperature or warmed through. Serves 4 olive oil 90ml onions 2 large, finely chopped garlic 6 cloves, crushed cod fillet or loin 700g, skinless and boneless, chopped into 3cm chunks red chillies 2, one finely chopped and one finely sliced, to serve parsley leaves 15g, roughly chopped dill 15g, roughly chopped, plus a few extra picked leaves to serve lemon 1, finely grate the zest to get 2 tsp, then cut into 4 wedges egg 1 fish spice mix 2 tsp (see below) sumac 1 tbsp Greek-style yogurt 200g salt and black pepper For the fish spice mix ground cardamom 2 tsp ground cumin 2 tsp paprika 1 tsp ground turmeric 2 tsp Preheat the oven to 220C fan/gas mark 9. Put 3 tablespoons of the oil into a large saut\u00e9 pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook for 12-14 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until softened and golden. Add the garlic and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside until completely cool. Put the fish into a food processor and pulse a few times until finely chopped but not a complete paste. Transfer to a large bowl and add the cooled onion mixture, chopped chilli, herbs, lemon zest, egg, fish spice mix, 2 teaspoons of sumac, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well to combine, then, using your hands, shape the mixture into about 15 kofta: they should each be about 5cm wide and weigh about 65g. Put 2 tablespoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the kofta in batches of 2 or 3 and fry for about 4 minutes, turning halfway through so that both sides are golden brown. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for 4 or 5 minutes, until just cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes or so, to slightly cool. To serve, spread the yogurt evenly between four serving plates and top each with 3 fish kofta, saving any extra for seconds. Sprinkle the kofta with the remaining teaspoon of sumac, the picked dill and sliced chilli. Drizzle over the last tablespoon of oil and serve, with a lemon wedge alongside. The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide Chicken shawarma pie This is a wow of a pie. Serve it with a crisp green salad and some pickles. The chicken can be made a day or two ahead of assembling the pie. Keep it in the fridge and just bring it back to room temperature before putting the dish together. You can also just make the chicken part of the dish. It makes a delicious stew, served with steamed rice or piled into a pita or wrap. If you do this, keep the tahini sauce: it\u2019s always a welcome addition. Serves 6 chicken thighs 750g, boneless and skinless garlic 4 cloves, crushed ginger 2cm piece, peeled and finely grated (15g) ground cumin 2 tsp ground coriander 2 tsp smoked paprika \u00be tsp ground turmeric \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon \u00be tsp ground cloves \u215b tsp olive oil 90ml, plus extra for greasing cider vinegar 3 tbsp salt and black pepper baking potatoes 2 (450g), unpeeled and cut into \u00bdcm thick rounds unsalted butter 45g onion 1, thinly sliced (150g) chicken stock 200ml parsley leaves 5g, roughly chopped coriander leaves 5g, roughly chopped filo 8 sheets (30cm x 38cm) nigella seeds 1 tsp Aleppo chilli flakes \u00be tsp (or \u2153 tsp regular chilli flakes) For the tahini sauce tahini 50g Greek yogurt 80g garlic 2 cloves, crushed lemon juice 1 tbsp salt and black pepper Put the chicken into a large bowl with the garlic, ginger, ground spices, 1 tablespoon of oil, 2 tablespoons of vinegar, 1 teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Mix to combine, then leave to marinate for at least half an hour (or overnight in the fridge). Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Mix the potatoes with 1\u00bd tablespoons of oil, \u00be teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and spread out so that they are not overlapping. Bake for 20 minutes, then increase the oven temperature to 220C fan/gas mark 9. Remove the tray from the oven, carefully flip over each potato slice, then return to the oven for another 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven and set aside until needed. Reduce the oven temperature to 180C fan/gas mark 6 again (or turn the oven off for now and preheat before baking). Put 15g of butter and 1\u00bd tablespoons of oil into a large saut\u00e9 pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the chicken and cook for about 10 minutes, until lightly brown, then add the stock, \u00bc teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to medium. Simmer gently for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked through. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to cook for about 8 minutes, or until the liquid has thickened and reduced to about 4 tablespoons. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for about 10 minutes, then use two forks to shred the chicken into large chunks. Stir in the herbs and set aside. To make the tahini sauce, put the tahini, yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, \u215b teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of water into a bowl. Whisk together until smooth, then set aside. Melt the remaining 30g of butter and combine with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment and lightly grease the sides with the butter mixture. Lay a sheet of filo out on a clean work surface and brush with the butter. Transfer this to the tin so that the base is covered and the filo rises up and over the tin\u2019s sides. Repeat with the next sheet of filo, brushing it first with butter, then arranging it in the tin, rotating it slightly so that the excess hangs at a different angle. Continue in this fashion, brushing each piece generously as you go, until you have used up 6 pieces of filo in total and the base and sides are all covered. Next, add the potato slices, overlapping slightly, so that the base of the pie is completely covered. Top with the chicken mixture and gently push down to even out. Lastly, spoon over the tahini sauce, spreading it gently to coat the chicken layer. Brush a piece of filo with butter and fold it in half horizontally,like a book. Place this over the tahini layer, tucking in the filo around the filling. Brush the top with the butter mixture, then repeat with the last piece of filo, angling it to cover any exposed areas. Now fold over the overhang, crinkling up the filo to create a nice crumpled effect on the top. Brush the top with the remaining butter, sprinkle with the nigella seeds, place on a tray and bake Filo triangles with cream cheese, pistachio &amp; rose \u2013 warbat Warbat is a popular snack during the month of Ramadan. The filling is traditionally made with ishta \u2013 a kind of thick, silky cream \u2013 which is then drizzled with rose water or rose water syrup. Ishta is not always easy to find, so we\u2019ve created a cream cheese filling instead. Makes 12 pastries filo pastry 10 sheets, each sheet 31cm x 38cm unsalted butter 120g, melted For the syrup caster sugar 100g lemon juice 1\u00bd tsp rose water \u00be tsp For the filling full-fat cream cheese 450g cornflour 2 tsp caster sugar 55g flaked sea salt \u00bd tsp powdered Arabic mastic gum \u00bc tsp, or \u00bd tsp vanilla bean paste To garnish pistachio kernels 20g, finely crushed in a food processor, or by hand as finely as possible dried rose petals about 1\u00bd tbsp (optional) First make the syrup. Put 55ml of water and the sugar into a small saucepan and place on a medium-high heat. Mix well using a wooden spoon, then, once it starts boiling, add the lemon juice. Simmer gently for 2 minutes, then stir in the rose water and remove from the heat straightaway. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. To make the filling, put the cream cheese, cornflour, sugar, salt and mastic (or vanilla bean paste) into a medium bowl and whisk well to combine. To assemble, spread one filo sheet out on a work surface and brush evenly with some of the melted butter. Top with another sheet and brush with butter again. Repeat the process until you have 5 layers evenly brushed with butter. As is always the case when working with filo, you\u2019ll need to work fast when you start brushing and folding: the pastry will dry out if you don\u2019t. You should have used about a quarter of the melted butter at this stage. Using sharp scissors, cut the layered sheet of pastry into 6 squares, all 12cm x 12cm \u2013 you\u2019ll need to trim the sheets to get even squares. Taking one square at a time, spoon about 35g (or 2 tablespoons) of the thick filling into the centre of each square, leaving a 2-3cm border around the edge. Fold the pastry diagonally in half to form a triangle, press on the edges without reaching the filling (so that it stays well sealed within the pastry), then brush all over with more butter. Once all 6 triangle pastries are on a parchment-lined baking tray, repeat the whole process (brushing one large filo sheet with butter, layering it 5 times, cutting it into 6 squares, filling and folding and sealing each square) with the remaining pastry, butter and filling. Once all 12 pastries are made up and spread on two parchment-lined baking trays, bake for 22 minutes or until golden and crisp: some of them will pop open, but that\u2019s OK. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Drizzle over the syrup, sprinkle over the crushed pistachios and rose petals, if using, and serve.

      "body": "<p>Mae Martin is an addict. At the age of six, she was addicted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bette-midler\" title=\"\">Bette Midler</a>. It was a curious, grand, important feeling and one she knew she must indulge alone, in her room after dinner. At 11, after she was invited up on stage to pretend to be a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy, and there felt the full force of an audience\u2019s laughter, Martin became addicted to standup comedy, leaving school three years later to perform full-time. She would walk onstage at 14 with a cigarette to complicated silences, and spend her evenings with adults, and their alcohol, and their cocaine. At 16 she was addicted to drugs and her parents kicked her out. Now 32, having been through rehab and moved from Toronto to London, she has used her 10,000-plus hours of standup to carve out a unique place in British comedy where she talks about all of these things; a place that is warm and clean and wise, and very funny.</p> <p>Shrugging off her jacket on a winterish afternoon last month, Martin was cautious but charming. White-haired, wide-eyed, she appeared freshly hatched. She\u2019d just come from having a new suit fitted \u2013 the answer, hopefully, to her long-standing anxieties over how to dress in order to feel like herself. Except, the tailor kept referencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ellen-degeneres\" title=\"\">Ellen DeGeneres</a> when she had been quite clear that he was to cut the suit with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\" title=\"\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> in mind, and only Leonardo DiCaprio. I could clearly picture the conversation: her polite insistence that he accept who she told him she was, rather than impose his own ideas.</p> <p>This will not be her first suit. As a child, she wore a three-piece suit and bow tie, and it was in this divine little outfit that her parents first took her to see the standup shows that would change her life. \u201cWatching comedy for the first time I felt absolutely on fire. I just couldn\u2019t believe there was this environment where people were being applauded for the weirdest things about themselves,\u201d she says, opening her eyes even wider. \u201cEspecially feeling like an outsider at school, and then finding this community where I could own those things and be applauded for them. People who would laugh with me instead of at me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74cc5b557e21ca2a8c9363816eeca538a433b390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74cc5b557e21ca2a8c9363816eeca538a433b390/171_269_5589_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin at the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mae Martin at the Laughing Horse at City Cafe Free Festival at the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRZ9-xDZ14w\" title=\"\">video on YouTube</a> of her performing at 16, in character as a competitor in a public-speaking competition about \u201cwomen in media\u201d. The audience seems equal parts dazzled and confused by the combination of lonely desperation and <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> obsession she presents, in cropped hair and pinafore dress. These days audiences are less confused; instead of leading with her awkwardness, she explores it, performs it and invites us to laugh at it with her. Her most recent standup tours were Us, in 2015, about sex and gender identity, and Dope, in 2017, about addiction \u2013 both were turned into BBC radio shows.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a slow process of getting closer and closer to my actual personality on stage. And now there\u2019s very little separation. I definitely find the more open and vulnerable I am, the more people enjoy it,\u201d she grins in understatement.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I saw Mae\u2019s work,\u201d the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ellenpage\" title=\"\">Ellen Page</a> says via email, \u201cI not only laughed so hard, I was struck by her honesty, vulnerability, intelligence and ability to tell personal stories that render them relatable to us all. I am inspired by Mae,\u201d she adds, \u201cand lucky to call her a friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today audiences treat Martin with a similarly delicate awe. Usually. \u201cWell, I got heckled the other night. I was talking about gender identity and this woman shouted, \u2018No one cares!\u2019 It was so harsh, but I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Partly because I was in control and partly because, well, I replied something like, \u2018The problem is that people actually care too much!\u2019 There\u2019s so much hysteria around gender, hysteria that comes from a place of misinformation and fear.\u201d She shrugs. Chuckles. Once, a therapist warned her that if she completed therapy, she\u2019d probably stop being funny. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I disagree.\u2019 I knew my job was not mutually exclusive to happiness. I think she was romanticising that tortured-artist thing, which I don\u2019t buy into any more. Really. If you\u2019re unhappy, you can\u2019t make anything.\u201d</p> <p>Dope, her show on addiction, took longer to brew. \u201cYeah, I needed enough distance from that time in my life to\u2026 retrospect. I approached it pretty academically and did tonnes of research and tried to make sense of it. And then I started telling my stories on stage and hoping the punchlines emerged.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a11c20b9312c900501ddd44beac89ff167ad7b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a11c20b9312c900501ddd44beac89ff167ad7b2c/175_360_4258_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Adrian Lukis and Lisa Kudrow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel Good comedy: (from left) Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Adrian Lukis and Lisa Kudrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did she learn? \u201cI guess the big realisation was that addiction isn\u2019t really about substances. The definition that I use is from [writer and physician] Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9, which is: addiction is something that you crave, find relief from and can\u2019t give up, despite knowing the negative consequences.\u201d Imagine, she asks her audiences, that they\u2019ve just realised they\u2019ve left their phone in the bar \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t burst into tears, but the nagging anxiety, the need to touch it again, would mean they wouldn\u2019t laugh for the rest of the show. \u201cRight? His is such a broad definition and resonates with so many people, whether it\u2019s our phones or food or sex or relationships. Things that we know are bad for us, but that soothe us when we\u2019re finding the present moment difficult. Hearing that was kind of a breakthrough for me.\u201d</p> <p>Why? \u201cBecause I think I was patting myself on the back for getting off drugs and not realising, actually, that addictive behaviour was still permeating my life in a lot of ways. So that\u2019s what the TV series is about.\u201d</p> <p>The TV series, yes. We are here to discuss <em>Feel Good</em>, a new Channel 4 comedy, co-written by and starring Martin as a comedian called Mae, navigating the sensitive dynamics of her NA group, a relationship with a straight girl (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/29/charlotte-ritchie-funniest-things\" title=\"\">Charlotte Ritchie</a>), and a strained bond with her mother, performed magnificently by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/lisa-kudrow\" title=\"\">Lisa Kudrow</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am. It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe character Mae is where I was about 10 years ago. So it\u2019s a pretty tenuous grip on sobriety, just fresh out of the depths of addiction and super manic. I have a pretty good hold on my life now \u2013 I\u2019m pretty stable. But I definitely feel like, in a way\u2026 I miss her.\u201d The old Mae is seen on screen as a panicked romantic who lies awake at night with her hands hovering in fists above her chest. \u201cShe\u2019s a mess, with all her agony and ecstasy, but I do miss the optimism and naivety. I don\u2019t miss the lows, but losing those sometimes means you don\u2019t get the highs.\u201d</p> <p>Five years ago Martin transferred her addictive obsession on to this script, this series, and she digs her hands into her knees at the thought that soon it will be out, in the world, with all the judgment and mainstream fame that might mean. She wants to be clear: it is comedy, not therapy. \u201cNo this is not purely some cathartic therapeutic exercise for me. Me and Joe [Hampson, her co-writer] really just wanted to write a good comedy that had a lot of heart. It\u2019s a work of fiction. But it\u2019s got an emotional truth, because it\u2019s based on experiences I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve dated lots of girls who\u2019ve never been with a girl before, for instance, which makes for quite a romantic and painful dynamic.\u201d</p> <p>And for all the pain of bleeding her own life into six half-hours, the surprise agony actually came from acting for the first time. \u201cI sort of thought acting was just about arranging your face into emotions. I didn\u2019t realise it was about actually allowing yourself to feel the feelings, then letting your face follow. That was a big learning curve.\u201d</p> <p>Actually allowing herself to feel the feelings has been a lesson in more ways than one. Since discussing her childhood and addictions on stage, Martin\u2019s life has expanded, along with her career. \u201cIt\u2019s enriching and cathartic to share things that your gut tells you are not all right to say. To say things that you\u2019re embarrassed or ashamed of, and then have everybody go: \u2018Me too.\u2019 And the more specific and embarrassing, the more people seem to connect.\u201d During her show about gender and sexuality, she witnessed lots of teenagers coming out to their friends and family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d3fadef21021e5c9b275e3d854a8ab99611bb21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3fadef21021e5c9b275e3d854a8ab99611bb21/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie in Feel Good\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a work of fiction. But it\u2019s got an emotional truth\u2019: Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie in Feel Good.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After one show, a girl approached Martin with her father, before turning to him and saying, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m bisexual.\u2019 \u201cAnd do you know what he replied? \u2018Me too.\u2019\u201d How did that feel? \u201cIt was cool! But I\u2019m not a licensed family therapist, so it was also quite scary. Especially because then they wanted to go out to a club. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna pass.\u2019 With the next show, Dope, I saw a lot of addicts or people who have family members struggling with addictions. That was pretty wild. But I love it all.\u201d</p> <p>Last year she wrote a book for teenagers, a guide to 21st-century sexuality. \u201cI had to constantly remind people that I\u2019m just writing about my experiences. It\u2019s different for everyone \u2013 the most important thing is not to be squeamish. Talking about sexuality and gender right now is so politicised, but imagine being a teenager in your first relationship, and how stressful it would feel if you were seeing your identity debated on <em>Newsnight</em>. And so I try to take a lighter look, and remind people that it\u2019s supposed to be fun and also, that you don\u2019t have to feel pressured to pick a certain label.\u201d The book\u2019s title is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/can-everyone-please-calm-down-9781526361653.html\" title=\"\">Can Everyone Please Calm Down?</a></em></p> <p>As well as belly laughs, Martin\u2019s audiences have become accustomed to feeling something slightly higher up: a light pressure on their heart, for example, or a tightening of the throat, or a small nudge on the brain. Her favourite comedians can, she says, \u201cDo both \u2013 be really hilarious while also sneaking in a social message.\u201d On stage she offers a critical analysis of contemporary obsessions, stories from her own life weaving through a theme, resulting in yes, punchlines, but also tight political conclusions \u2013 such as her insistence that we should eliminate labels like gay, straight, or bi.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone needs to take a deep breath and look at the facts and not the headlines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m all for people identifying however they want. But I\u2019ve found that sometimes those labels bulldoze over nuance. My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am! It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part. Apparently 40% of people under 25 don\u2019t identify as gay or straight any more. So I feel like that\u2019s where we are heading. If we just assume everyone\u2019s a bit gay, then we wouldn\u2019t have to go through that quite harrowing process of declaring yourself to be something else. Yeah, I see a lot of benefits to not expecting everyone to declare who they are.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder whether researching her own life for a show has brought up any surprising realisations. \u201cWell, one thing I found interesting is this false impression that gender fluidity or \u2018dismantling the gender binary\u2019 is a recent millennial fad, when, for centuries of human civilisation, there have been variances in gender. It\u2019s actually quite a recent western thing to have such a strict gender binary. In 2018, India decriminalised homosexuality, and we celebrated it over here.

      "bodyText": "Mae Martin is an addict. At the age of six, she was addicted to Bette Midler. It was a curious, grand, important feeling and one she knew she must indulge alone, in her room after dinner. At 11, after she was invited up on stage to pretend to be a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy, and there felt the full force of an audience\u2019s laughter, Martin became addicted to standup comedy, leaving school three years later to perform full-time. She would walk onstage at 14 with a cigarette to complicated silences, and spend her evenings with adults, and their alcohol, and their cocaine. At 16 she was addicted to drugs and her parents kicked her out. Now 32, having been through rehab and moved from Toronto to London, she has used her 10,000-plus hours of standup to carve out a unique place in British comedy where she talks about all of these things; a place that is warm and clean and wise, and very funny. Shrugging off her jacket on a winterish afternoon last month, Martin was cautious but charming. White-haired, wide-eyed, she appeared freshly hatched. She\u2019d just come from having a new suit fitted \u2013 the answer, hopefully, to her long-standing anxieties over how to dress in order to feel like herself. Except, the tailor kept referencing Ellen DeGeneres when she had been quite clear that he was to cut the suit with Leonardo DiCaprio in mind, and only Leonardo DiCaprio. I could clearly picture the conversation: her polite insistence that he accept who she told him she was, rather than impose his own ideas. This will not be her first suit. As a child, she wore a three-piece suit and bow tie, and it was in this divine little outfit that her parents first took her to see the standup shows that would change her life. \u201cWatching comedy for the first time I felt absolutely on fire. I just couldn\u2019t believe there was this environment where people were being applauded for the weirdest things about themselves,\u201d she says, opening her eyes even wider. \u201cEspecially feeling like an outsider at school, and then finding this community where I could own those things and be applauded for them. People who would laugh with me instead of at me.\u201d There\u2019s a video on YouTube of her performing at 16, in character as a competitor in a public-speaking competition about \u201cwomen in media\u201d. The audience seems equal parts dazzled and confused by the combination of lonely desperation and Buffy the Vampire Slayer obsession she presents, in cropped hair and pinafore dress. These days audiences are less confused; instead of leading with her awkwardness, she explores it, performs it and invites us to laugh at it with her. Her most recent standup tours were Us, in 2015, about sex and gender identity, and Dope, in 2017, about addiction \u2013 both were turned into BBC radio shows. \u201cIt was a slow process of getting closer and closer to my actual personality on stage. And now there\u2019s very little separation. I definitely find the more open and vulnerable I am, the more people enjoy it,\u201d she grins in understatement. \u201cThe first time I saw Mae\u2019s work,\u201d the actor Ellen Page says via email, \u201cI not only laughed so hard, I was struck by her honesty, vulnerability, intelligence and ability to tell personal stories that render them relatable to us all. I am inspired by Mae,\u201d she adds, \u201cand lucky to call her a friend.\u201d Today audiences treat Martin with a similarly delicate awe. Usually. \u201cWell, I got heckled the other night. I was talking about gender identity and this woman shouted, \u2018No one cares!\u2019 It was so harsh, but I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Partly because I was in control and partly because, well, I replied something like, \u2018The problem is that people actually care too much!\u2019 There\u2019s so much hysteria around gender, hysteria that comes from a place of misinformation and fear.\u201d She shrugs. Chuckles. Once, a therapist warned her that if she completed therapy, she\u2019d probably stop being funny. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I disagree.\u2019 I knew my job was not mutually exclusive to happiness. I think she was romanticising that tortured-artist thing, which I don\u2019t buy into any more. Really. If you\u2019re unhappy, you can\u2019t make anything.\u201d Dope, her show on addiction, took longer to brew. \u201cYeah, I needed enough distance from that time in my life to\u2026 retrospect. I approached it pretty academically and did tonnes of research and tried to make sense of it. And then I started telling my stories on stage and hoping the punchlines emerged.\u201d What did she learn? \u201cI guess the big realisation was that addiction isn\u2019t really about substances. The definition that I use is from [writer and physician] Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9, which is: addiction is something that you crave, find relief from and can\u2019t give up, despite knowing the negative consequences.\u201d Imagine, she asks her audiences, that they\u2019ve just realised they\u2019ve left their phone in the bar \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t burst into tears, but the nagging anxiety, the need to touch it again, would mean they wouldn\u2019t laugh for the rest of the show. \u201cRight? His is such a broad definition and resonates with so many people, whether it\u2019s our phones or food or sex or relationships. Things that we know are bad for us, but that soothe us when we\u2019re finding the present moment difficult. Hearing that was kind of a breakthrough for me.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause I think I was patting myself on the back for getting off drugs and not realising, actually, that addictive behaviour was still permeating my life in a lot of ways. So that\u2019s what the TV series is about.\u201d The TV series, yes. We are here to discuss Feel Good, a new Channel 4 comedy, co-written by and starring Martin as a comedian called Mae, navigating the sensitive dynamics of her NA group, a relationship with a straight girl (played by Charlotte Ritchie), and a strained bond with her mother, performed magnificently by Lisa Kudrow. \u201cThe character Mae is where I was about 10 years ago. So it\u2019s a pretty tenuous grip on sobriety, just fresh out of the depths of addiction and super manic. I have a pretty good hold on my life now \u2013 I\u2019m pretty stable. But I definitely feel like, in a way\u2026 I miss her.\u201d The old Mae is seen on screen as a panicked romantic who lies awake at night with her hands hovering in fists above her chest. \u201cShe\u2019s a mess, with all her agony and ecstasy, but I do miss the optimism and naivety. I don\u2019t miss the lows, but losing those sometimes means you don\u2019t get the highs.\u201d Five years ago Martin transferred her addictive obsession on to this script, this series, and she digs her hands into her knees at the thought that soon it will be out, in the world, with all the judgment and mainstream fame that might mean. She wants to be clear: it is comedy, not therapy. \u201cNo this is not purely some cathartic therapeutic exercise for me. Me and Joe [Hampson, her co-writer] really just wanted to write a good comedy that had a lot of heart. It\u2019s a work of fiction. But it\u2019s got an emotional truth, because it\u2019s based on experiences I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve dated lots of girls who\u2019ve never been with a girl before, for instance, which makes for quite a romantic and painful dynamic.\u201d And for all the pain of bleeding her own life into six half-hours, the surprise agony actually came from acting for the first time. \u201cI sort of thought acting was just about arranging your face into emotions. I didn\u2019t realise it was about actually allowing yourself to feel the feelings, then letting your face follow. That was a big learning curve.\u201d Actually allowing herself to feel the feelings has been a lesson in more ways than one. Since discussing her childhood and addictions on stage, Martin\u2019s life has expanded, along with her career. \u201cIt\u2019s enriching and cathartic to share things that your gut tells you are not all right to say. To say things that you\u2019re embarrassed or ashamed of, and then have everybody go: \u2018Me too.\u2019 And the more specific and embarrassing, the more people seem to connect.\u201d During her show about gender and sexuality, she witnessed lots of teenagers coming out to their friends and family. After one show, a girl approached Martin with her father, before turning to him and saying, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m bisexual.\u2019 \u201cAnd do you know what he replied? \u2018Me too.\u2019\u201d How did that feel? \u201cIt was cool! But I\u2019m not a licensed family therapist, so it was also quite scary. Especially because then they wanted to go out to a club. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna pass.\u2019 With the next show, Dope, I saw a lot of addicts or people who have family members struggling with addictions. That was pretty wild. But I love it all.\u201d Last year she wrote a book for teenagers, a guide to 21st-century sexuality. \u201cI had to constantly remind people that I\u2019m just writing about my experiences. It\u2019s different for everyone \u2013 the most important thing is not to be squeamish. Talking about sexuality and gender right now is so politicised, but imagine being a teenager in your first relationship, and how stressful it would feel if you were seeing your identity debated on Newsnight. And so I try to take a lighter look, and remind people that it\u2019s supposed to be fun and also, that you don\u2019t have to feel pressured to pick a certain label.\u201d The book\u2019s title is Can Everyone Please Calm Down? As well as belly laughs, Martin\u2019s audiences have become accustomed to feeling something slightly higher up: a light pressure on their heart, for example, or a tightening of the throat, or a small nudge on the brain. Her favourite comedians can, she says, \u201cDo both \u2013 be really hilarious while also sneaking in a social message.\u201d On stage she offers a critical analysis of contemporary obsessions, stories from her own life weaving through a theme, resulting in yes, punchlines, but also tight political conclusions \u2013 such as her insistence that we should eliminate labels like gay, straight, or bi. \u201cI\u2019m all for people identifying however they want. But I\u2019ve found that sometimes those labels bulldoze over nuance. My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am! It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part. Apparently 40% of people under 25 don\u2019t identify as gay or straight any more. So I feel like that\u2019s where we are heading. If we just assume everyone\u2019s a bit gay, then we wouldn\u2019t have to go through that quite harrowing process of declaring yourself to be something else. Yeah, I see a lot of benefits to not expecting everyone to declare who they are.\u201d I wonder whether researching her own life for a show has brought up any surprising realisations. \u201cWell, one thing I found interesting is this false impression that gender fluidity or \u2018dismantling the gender binary\u2019 is a recent millennial fad, when, for centuries of human civilisation, there have been variances in gender. It\u2019s actually quite a recent western thing to have such a strict gender binary. In 2018, India decriminalised homosexuality, and we celebrated it over here. But, England went into India and criminalised homosexuality in 1856! It\u2019s the gaslighting that gets me. It\u2019s like setting somebody\u2019s house on fire and then going, \u2018Argh, it\u2019s taking me so long to put the fire out, like, it\u2019s sooo hard.\u201d She is fun to sit with. An afternoon discussing social politics with a comedian more brusque or earnest than Martin would be a slightly exhausting prospect. But she treads so lightly and with such conviction that the segues from her coconut allergy to the reaction to strap-on dildos in Feel Good to trans rights carry me gently and jollily through our conversation. It\u2019s only later, transcribing, that it strikes me how radical her post-identity politics might be. \u201cI totally understand people feeling overwhelmed, or feeling a sense of vertigo about how quickly things are changing. But everyone needs to take a deep breath and look at the facts and not the headlines.\u201d She searches quickly for an example from life. \u201cI remember when I first learned algebra and I got into this real angry panic because I was like, \u2018I just figured out numbers \u2013 and now they\u2019re introducing letters again?\u2019\u201d That was when she left school. \u201cI think that\u2019s the kind of thing people feel is happening now, and they\u2019re panicking.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 5.15pm on a Tuesday in Herne Hill, south London, and in a cafe under the railway arches the countdown to dinner is well under way. Orders for cottage pies, pasta bakes and fish-finger sandwiches have been placed and are being processed in the kitchen next door. Meanwhile, six very hungry children are expending as much energy as possible \u2013 swinging from door handles, batting balloons in all directions \u2013 as they wait for the food to arrive.</p> <p>At a long table decked with flowers and colouring books, their parents are doing their best, amid screams and laughter, to conduct an intelligible conversation. The topic is takeaway food: its conveniences, its letdowns, and the increasing sway that online delivery companies such as Just Eat and Deliveroo are exerting over our family mealtimes.</p> <p>Serena Cunningham, who lives in Lambeth, is a regular takeaway consumer \u2013 she orders a delivery via Uber Eats about once a week, when the demands on her time make it impossible to cook at home. \u201cI\u2019m a single mum, I\u2019ve got four kids, and life is very hectic with work, doing the school runs daily and bringing the children to their activities, and still having to prepare a meal\u2026 it\u2019s a lot,\u201d she says. Ordering takeaway is by no means a perfect solution. \u201cSomething goes missing, something\u2019s cold, something doesn\u2019t taste right, you find a piece of hair \u2013 and home-cooked food to me always tastes better,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some reason I\u2019m still ordering. They make it so easy.\u201d</p> <p>Among the considerations Serena weighs up while scrolling through takeaway menus on her phone \u2013 such as whether to let her younger children Noah-Isaac, nine, and Naila, four, indulge their ardent love of melted cheese \u2013 healthy eating isn\u2019t necessarily top of the list. \u201cYou can get healthy food,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, McDonald\u2019s let you choose carrots or chips, so we do have a choice. But, we end up going for the chips \u2013 my children prefer them.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re here to taste-test a new takeaway which claims to offer healthier options across the board. Medleys, which launched last November from the commercial kitchen next door, is a delivery-only service available via Just Eat and other platforms, and <a href=\"https://www.just-eat.co.uk/restaurants-medleys--the-kitchen-herne-hill/menu\" title=\"\">its menu</a> looks nothing out of the ordinary. Bright-red, with a jaunty logo and stickers promising discounts on orders over a tenner, it advertises dishes \u2013 peri-peri chicken and lasagne \u2013 that you\u2019ll find in takeaways all over the capital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How can we have everyday takeaway that\u2019s convenient, appealing and affordable, but better for families?</p> <footer> <cite>Patrick Bek</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Take a closer look and you\u2019ll notice the emphasis is on homely classics, many with veg or salad. And the prices are competitive: cottage pie with greens costs \u00a35.99, while veggie curry is under a fiver. Amid the parade of fried temptations that saturate the lower end of the takeaway market, this seems like a point of difference.</p> <p>To understand what\u2019s truly different about Medleys, you have to look further afield, because neither the menu nor its online profile gives any indication that this fledgling enterprise, with its core staff of two and its modest cooking set-up, is part of an ambitious initiative to tackle childhood obesity in the UK.</p> <p>The organisation behind it is <a href=\"https://shiftdesign.org/\" title=\"\">Shift</a>, a London-based design charity that builds social ventures as well as physical products. They\u2019ve been working on food-related projects since 2012 \u2013 one, in east London, attempted to create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/26/fried-chicken-fast-food-shop-schoolkids\" title=\"\">a healthier alternative to high-street chicken shops</a>. With this challenge they really do, as project leader Patrick Bek admits, \u201chave a mountain to climb\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bca1a02c1636e477e091255418cac228d0d5705e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bca1a02c1636e477e091255418cac228d0d5705e/2946_22_3143_3929/800.jpg\" alt=\"Medleys\u2019 cheesy cottage pie, green beans and chicken curry\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medleys\u2019 cheesy cottage pie, green beans and chicken curry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A complex problem with many interlinking causes, childhood obesity is on the rise. <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-obesity-physical-activity-and-diet/statistics-on-obesity-physical-activity-and-diet-england-2019\" title=\"\">According to the NHS</a>, 20.1% children aged 10-11 in England now qualify as obese, up from 17.5% in 2006. The prevalence more than doubles in the most deprived areas, compared to the least deprived, and in Camberwell Green, just up the road from the Medleys kitchen, obesity rates are <a href=\"https://www.gsttcharity.org.uk/get-involved/news-and-opinion/views/what-behind-local-childhood-obesity-corridor\" title=\"\">among the highest in the country</a>, rising to 34% at ages 10-11.</p> <p>Among the initiatives trying to address obesity through diet, this one stands out for its counterintuitive approach: Shift wants to use low-cost takeaway food, a sector much maligned for its poor nutritional standards, to boost healthy eating.</p> <p>The logic becomes clearer when you consider how much eating habits have changed. Between 2009 and 2016, spending on takeaways rose by 34%, to \u00a39.9bn a year. Much of this has been fuelled by online delivery: last year, according to the analysts Kantar, the UK hot-food delivery market grew by nearly 20%.</p> <p>This has particular bearing on young adults and parents with young children, who are most likely to be frequent users of food delivery services. According to research by Shift in south London, low-income families are increasingly reliant on takeaways, with some households ordering in three or more times a week.</p> <p>Bek points out the problem is that takeaways, particularly at the cheaper end of the market, are designed not as an everyday option but as a treat. Research published in <em>Nutrition &amp; Food Science</em> in 2014 found that the majority of takeaway meals were excessive for portion size, energy, fat, carbs, protein and salt.</p> <p>Instead of trying to encourage regular takeaway users away from their habit, however, Shift decided to follow the trend. \u201cOur challenge,\u201d says Bek, \u201cwas to ask: How can we populate the market with everyday takeaway that\u2019s just as convenient, appealing and affordable, but better for families?\u201d</p> <p>Bek, who is 38, grew up in a working-class suburb of Birmingham and was a furniture designer, before co-founding an online luxury watch store. Looking for a way to make a greater social impact through design, he went back to university in 2016, doing an MA in innovation management at Central Saint Martins, and joined Shift the following year.

This is the first time Bek and his team have had a chance to taste the results and they\u2019ve invited a number of people, including Jennie Crossan, a dietician from Evelina London children\u2019s hospital, and Steve Pooley, an ex-Jamie Oliver chef who drew on consultation with local parents to devise the initial menu.</p> <p>It\u2019s FIS\u2019s job to ensure that targets for nutrition and calories, portion size, flavour profile and price point are being met. As in-house chef Alex Dome brings each dish to the table, the assembled tasters pick apart everything from the salt content of the sweet and sour chicken to the exact fineness of the grated cheese covering the pasta bake.</p> <p>That pasta bake may look innocuous, but hidden inside are seven vegetables including peppers, tomatoes, squash and courgettes, blitzed into a smooth red sauce. I\u2019m surprised by the menu: most of it <em>does</em> feel like a treat. The fish, butter-bean and pepper stew has depth of flavour and a spicy kick, while the lasagne is so comforting that I fail to notice, at first, that lentils have been used to pad out the beef. (\u201cThis is a dish where we can\u2019t afford to have just meat, either from a calorie or a cost perspective,\u201d explains the head of FIS, Nicola Swift.) The one disappointing note is the falafel wrap, the clagginess of which is explained by the falafel being baked instead of deep-fried, for reasons of costs as well as calories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c967b573f5f2603d27f0c9e2a311967a3f0b19fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c967b573f5f2603d27f0c9e2a311967a3f0b19fc/0_683_6328_3797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Stephenson of Shift, out promoting Medleys\u2019 menu on the streets of south London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Stephenson of Shift, out promoting Medleys\u2019 menu on the streets of south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the next couple of months, a brand comes together \u2013 the name Medleys is intended to evoke both variety and greatest-hits-style popularity. Originally slated for late summer, the launch gets pushed back till mid-November \u2013 the initial kitchen site, at a community centre in Myatts Field, fell through because Lambeth council were concerned about scooter noise. The current kitchen, in Herne Hill, is less than ideal \u2013 it\u2019s a shared space, with a full commercial rent, and they have to wheel their gear in and out of a storeroom every day \u2013 but nevertheless, on 14 November, I\u2019m on hand to witness the first evening of proper service.</p> <p>It is, inevitably, a slow start, though we all jump up when the first order comes through \u2013 cheesy cottage pie with a side of greens, and peri-peri chicken with rice, totalling \u00a316.97. The chef, Charles Johnson, springs into action, heating pre-cooked components and making sure the final dishes are properly seasoned.</p> <p>Johnson, whose previous job was cooking in a nursing home, came on board a couple of months earlier, drawn by the hours \u2013 he has small children and his partner is a nurse \u2013 and the social angle. \u201cI like the idea of providing an option that\u2019s healthier than what people would otherwise go for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy to taste good, look good and appeal to people.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, most of the dishes come pre-prepared by Food Innovation Solutions, but Johnson is working to bring all food production in-house. For the first three months, Bek acts as Johnson\u2019s sidekick, taking orders, packaging dishes and delivering some orders himself on his single-speed bike. When I next see him, at the family tasting in late January, he looks exhausted. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hard slog,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Business has been slow to pick up: they had four or five orders a night in the run-up to Christmas, but early January has been dead. Keeping up morale is a daily struggle. Working in a shared space has been challenging, too, but Bek has been able to identify a variety of unforeseen problems. \u201cEvery day we\u2019re tweaking things,\u201d says Johnson.</p> <p>The challenge this evening, more immediately, is to impress the six now-ravenous children and their parents who have gathered in the next-door cafe to give feedback on the Medleys menu. Mohammed and Naheed Suleman and their children Hassan, 10, Hussein, eight, and nine-month-old Aisha, who ordered pasta bake, fish stew and three \u201cposh\u201d fish finger wraps, are full of praise. \u201cThe fish is fantastic,\u201d says Mohammed. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different from how we eat at home, but it\u2019s good to have a change. We would definitely order again.\u201d</p> <p>Serena Cunningham is less convinced. \u201cIt was really fresh and reasonably priced and the portions were the perfect size.\u201d But would she order again? \u201cProbably not,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly because it\u2019s the type of thing I can cook anyway. I could make pasta bake and cottage pie at home, because I\u2019ve always got the ingredients.\u201d Takeaway, for Cunningham, means food she can\u2019t make herself. \u201cLiterally, I don\u2019t know the recipe for Kentucky,\u201d she says. \u201cIt needs to feel like a treat for the kids.\u201d</p> <p>The kids, however, are more positive. \u201cI loved it,\u201d says Naila, who screams \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if mummy should order it again. \u201cFive out of five,\u201d is Noah-Isaac\u2019s verdict, even though he left half his cottage pie uneaten due to the presence of lentils. \u201cI only like <em>green</em> peas,\u201d he murmurs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e32e3e0936ce1503b05eb9245a76d32868ff35e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e32e3e0936ce1503b05eb9245a76d32868ff35e/1594_569_3129_3911/800.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Bek in the Medleys kitchen.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Bek in the Medleys kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The analogy that keeps coming back to me, each time I call in on Bek and his team, is that of taking small steps up a big mountain. Professor Martin Caraher underlines this when he says: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one solution to obesity. Obesity is complex: it\u2019s nutrient intake, but it\u2019s also activity. No one thing will solve obesity.\u201d Shift\u2019s project is part of a solution, he goes on, \u201cbut it\u2019s not <em>the</em> solution. Though I do applaud what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>Bek acknowledged this on our very first meeting, saying: \u201cA single takeaway in Lambeth is not really going to change childhood obesity. What will change it,\u201d he went on, \u201cor what we\u2019re all hoping for, is a networked approach and a density of options in local areas.\u201d</p> <p>In our final conversation, at the end of January, Bek is still focused on making this one takeaway commercially viable \u2013 they\u2019re getting up to eight orders a night now but need many more than that to break even; Bek hopes that plugging into Uber Eats and Deliveroo in the months ahead will put them in a much better position.</p> <p>But he has been having thoughts, too, about what a more networked approach and a greater density of options might look like in practice. For Bek, hot-food delivery is just one among several ways of making healthier food available to his target audience. Another option is a subscription service for ready-to-cook meals, which parents could collect from local pick-up points \u2013 outside the school gates, for example.</p> <p>Even if the takeaway picks up, Bek is aware that he could still be doing more. \u201cThe next thing is local catering,\u201d he says. \u201cIf somebody said, we\u2019ve got a 40-person event, can you cater it? Absolutely, we can. We\u2019ve got a space, we\u2019ve got the equipment, we\u2019ve got the people \u2013 let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p> <p>What really interests him, though, is joining forces with like-minded organisations, and creating an example that others \u2013 entrepreneurs as well as social enterprises \u2013 will want to replicate.</p> <p>\u201cMy hunch is that to really make something like this work, it\u2019s a collective effort,\u201d he says.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe really don\u2019t want to be doing this on our own,\u201d Bek\u2019s colleague Rachel Stephenson chips in. \u201cWe want other people to be doing similar things and collaborating more. It\u2019s hard enough if you don\u2019t have a social mission to do a food business,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut when you do, it\u2019s definitely worth us all clubbing together.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Patrick Bek has now left Shift to become head of new product development at Birmingham City University\u2019s innovation hub Steamhouse. He has been replaced as venture lead on Medleys by Alice Wilson. Medleys will launch on Uber Eats later in March.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 5.15pm on a Tuesday in Herne Hill, south London, and in a cafe under the railway arches the countdown to dinner is well under way. Orders for cottage pies, pasta bakes and fish-finger sandwiches have been placed and are being processed in the kitchen next door. Meanwhile, six very hungry children are expending as much energy as possible \u2013 swinging from door handles, batting balloons in all directions \u2013 as they wait for the food to arrive. At a long table decked with flowers and colouring books, their parents are doing their best, amid screams and laughter, to conduct an intelligible conversation. The topic is takeaway food: its conveniences, its letdowns, and the increasing sway that online delivery companies such as Just Eat and Deliveroo are exerting over our family mealtimes. Serena Cunningham, who lives in Lambeth, is a regular takeaway consumer \u2013 she orders a delivery via Uber Eats about once a week, when the demands on her time make it impossible to cook at home. \u201cI\u2019m a single mum, I\u2019ve got four kids, and life is very hectic with work, doing the school runs daily and bringing the children to their activities, and still having to prepare a meal\u2026 it\u2019s a lot,\u201d she says. Ordering takeaway is by no means a perfect solution. \u201cSomething goes missing, something\u2019s cold, something doesn\u2019t taste right, you find a piece of hair \u2013 and home-cooked food to me always tastes better,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some reason I\u2019m still ordering. They make it so easy.\u201d Among the considerations Serena weighs up while scrolling through takeaway menus on her phone \u2013 such as whether to let her younger children Noah-Isaac, nine, and Naila, four, indulge their ardent love of melted cheese \u2013 healthy eating isn\u2019t necessarily top of the list. \u201cYou can get healthy food,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, McDonald\u2019s let you choose carrots or chips, so we do have a choice. But, we end up going for the chips \u2013 my children prefer them.\u201d We\u2019re here to taste-test a new takeaway which claims to offer healthier options across the board. Medleys, which launched last November from the commercial kitchen next door, is a delivery-only service available via Just Eat and other platforms, and its menu looks nothing out of the ordinary. Bright-red, with a jaunty logo and stickers promising discounts on orders over a tenner, it advertises dishes \u2013 peri-peri chicken and lasagne \u2013 that you\u2019ll find in takeaways all over the capital. Take a closer look and you\u2019ll notice the emphasis is on homely classics, many with veg or salad. And the prices are competitive: cottage pie with greens costs \u00a35.99, while veggie curry is under a fiver. Amid the parade of fried temptations that saturate the lower end of the takeaway market, this seems like a point of difference. To understand what\u2019s truly different about Medleys, you have to look further afield, because neither the menu nor its online profile gives any indication that this fledgling enterprise, with its core staff of two and its modest cooking set-up, is part of an ambitious initiative to tackle childhood obesity in the UK. The organisation behind it is Shift, a London-based design charity that builds social ventures as well as physical products. They\u2019ve been working on food-related projects since 2012 \u2013 one, in east London, attempted to create a healthier alternative to high-street chicken shops. With this challenge they really do, as project leader Patrick Bek admits, \u201chave a mountain to climb\u201d. A complex problem with many interlinking causes, childhood obesity is on the rise. According to the NHS, 20.1% children aged 10-11 in England now qualify as obese, up from 17.5% in 2006. The prevalence more than doubles in the most deprived areas, compared to the least deprived, and in Camberwell Green, just up the road from the Medleys kitchen, obesity rates are among the highest in the country, rising to 34% at ages 10-11. Among the initiatives trying to address obesity through diet, this one stands out for its counterintuitive approach: Shift wants to use low-cost takeaway food, a sector much maligned for its poor nutritional standards, to boost healthy eating. The logic becomes clearer when you consider how much eating habits have changed. Between 2009 and 2016, spending on takeaways rose by 34%, to \u00a39.9bn a year. Much of this has been fuelled by online delivery: last year, according to the analysts Kantar, the UK hot-food delivery market grew by nearly 20%. This has particular bearing on young adults and parents with young children, who are most likely to be frequent users of food delivery services. According to research by Shift in south London, low-income families are increasingly reliant on takeaways, with some households ordering in three or more times a week. Bek points out the problem is that takeaways, particularly at the cheaper end of the market, are designed not as an everyday option but as a treat. Research published in Nutrition &amp; Food Science in 2014 found that the majority of takeaway meals were excessive for portion size, energy, fat, carbs, protein and salt. Instead of trying to encourage regular takeaway users away from their habit, however, Shift decided to follow the trend. \u201cOur challenge,\u201d says Bek, \u201cwas to ask: How can we populate the market with everyday takeaway that\u2019s just as convenient, appealing and affordable, but better for families?\u201d Bek, who is 38, grew up in a working-class suburb of Birmingham and was a furniture designer, before co-founding an online luxury watch store. Looking for a way to make a greater social impact through design, he went back to university in 2016, doing an MA in innovation management at Central Saint Martins, and joined Shift the following year. When we first meet in May 2019, he is full of enthusiasm about the food-delivery project, if a little daunted by the scale of the task. He\u2019s already done a lot of groundwork. The previous year, Bek and his colleagues spent more than 200 hours with 44 parents and children in low-income households in Lambeth and Southwark, observing their cooking and eating habits and joining them on what they termed \u201cshop-alongs\u201d Alert to environmental triggers \u2013 such as fast-food advertising and sweets next to supermarket tills \u2013 the researchers attached cameras to the children\u2019s chests to track exactly what they were looking at, noting how they homed in on particular brands or food types. Each participant kept a food diary for a week, recording what they ate and how it made them feel, and they also consented to having their phone\u2019s GPS data logged. Their testimonies provide a vivid sense of how challenging it can be to feed yourself and your children healthily, or at all, in circumstances limited by budget, cooking facilities and affordable eating options. \u201cAfter having my boy I went through a period where we stopped eating, because we was in a shared-kitchen, hostel-type place and I wasn\u2019t really keen on going, especially because I wasn\u2019t a good cook \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself,\u201d recalls Donna, a single mother in her 20s. \u201cI just remember buying crackers and things like that and just eating crackers in my room.\u201d They also illustrate how takeaway food can become a default in times of stress. \u201cI got days I love cooking,\u201d says Meryam, a 35-year-old single parent of three. \u201cSometimes my body shuts down \u2013 those are the days when I can\u2019t really get up and cook, so I will end up either getting takeaway or cooking oven food.\u201d Having identified the challenge, the next step was to \u201cstress-test\u201d the concept. With funding from Birmingham City Council, Shift created a brand called Family Feeds and launched it as a pilot in summer 2018. Over 10 weeks, Bek and Louise Cooper, neither of whom had any catering experience, ran the takeaway from a \u201cdark\u201d (delivery-only) kitchen in the deprived suburb of Erdington, where, as it happened, Bek grew up. The focus in the menu was calorie reduction. In testing, Shift had found that the average adult takeaway portion contained 1,155 calories (the NHS recommends a daily intake of 2,000 calories for women, 2,500 for men). The aim for Family Feeds was to reduce it by half: 500-550 for adults and 300-350 for a child portion. \u201cIf the most regular takeaway consumers were to substitute one high-calorie meal each week with one of ours, then we\u2019re starting to move the needle,\u201d reasons Bek. Martin Caraher, professor of food and health policy at City University, has reservations about the calorie-focused approach. \u201cThis is a crude measure,\u201d he says. \u201cMost processed food has trans fats in it, what about that? And the key issue here is vegetable intake.\u201d Bek acknowledges Caraher\u2019s concerns, pointing out the quantity of vegetables already on the menu and stressing that calories are just the first step. \u201cAs we learn more about the types of food that our customers want to eat, we can continue to design the menu in such a way that we can build in more nutrition without losing them,\u201d he says. The Birmingham trial wasn\u2019t a money-spinner by any measure \u2013 they had four or five orders a night \u2013 but data from Just Eat suggested they were reaching the right audience and the feedback was positive. Returning to London, they approached Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Charity and were granted \u00a3350,000 to realise the concept. The stakes this time are much higher: Bek and his team are aiming to create a not-for-profit social enterprise which, by the end of the two-year funding period, will need to sustain itself financially in a highly competitive market. Bek is aware of the pitfalls. \u201cA lot of the pushback from parents,\u201d he says, \u201cis this idea of a waggy finger\u201d \u2013 the condescending voice berating poor people for not eating healthily enough. Bek\u2019s response has been to remove all surface evidence that Medleys is anything other than a commercial enterprise. The decision to enter the takeaway market is another possible source of criticism \u2013 that by encouraging parents to order in, they are discouraging them from cooking at home. When I ask Bek if he feels compromised by Shift\u2019s association with Just Eat, which supported both the Birmingham and London projects, he frowns. \u201cHow else are we going to reach our customers? Our job is to understand people\u2019s behaviours and work with those behaviours. To fight against it seems just counterintuitive.\u201d Before they can reach those customers, however, Bek and his team have a business to build from scratch. Over the next six months, I keep a close eye on their progress, from brand and menu development to finding a local chef and a place in which to cook. In August, I visit the Waterloo headquarters of Food Innovation Solutions (FIS), the menu development company Shift have hired to commercialise a selection of 12 dishes. This is the first time Bek and his team have had a chance to taste the results and they\u2019ve invited a number of people, including Jennie Crossan, a dietician from Evelina London children\u2019s hospital, and Steve Pooley, an ex-Jamie Oliver chef who drew on consultation with local parents to devise the initial menu. It\u2019s FIS\u2019s job to ensure that targets for nutrition and calories, portion size, flavour profile and price point are being met. As in-house chef Alex Dome brings each dish to the table, the assembled tasters pick apart everything from the salt content of the sweet and sour chicken to the exact fineness of the grated cheese covering the pasta bake. That pasta bake may look innocuous, but hidden inside are seven vegetables including peppers, tomatoes, squash and courgettes, blitzed into a smooth red sauce. I\u2019m surprised by the menu: most of it does feel like a treat. The fish, butter-bean and pepper stew has depth of flavour and a spicy kick, while the lasagne is so comforting that I fail to notice, at first, that lentils have been used to pad out the beef. (\u201cThis is a dish where we can\u2019t afford to have just meat, either from a calorie or a cost perspective,\u201d explains the head of FIS, Nicola Swift.) The one disappointing note is the falafel wrap, the clagginess of which is explained by the falafel being baked instead of deep-fried, for reasons of costs as well as calories. Over the next couple of months, a brand comes together \u2013 the name Medleys is intended to evoke both variety and greatest-hits-style popularity. Originally slated for late summer, the launch gets pushed back till mid-November \u2013 the initial kitchen site, at a community centre in Myatts Field, fell through because Lambeth council were concerned about scooter noise. The current kitchen, in Herne Hill, is less than ideal \u2013 it\u2019s a shared space, with a full commercial rent, and they have to wheel their gear in and out of a storeroom every day \u2013 but nevertheless, on 14 November, I\u2019m on hand to witness the first evening of proper service. It is, inevitably, a slow start, though we all jump up when the first order comes through \u2013 cheesy cottage pie with a side of greens, and peri-peri chicken with rice, totalling \u00a316.97. The chef, Charles Johnson, springs into action, heating pre-cooked components and making sure the final dishes are properly seasoned. Johnson, whose previous job was cooking in a nursing home, came on board a couple of months earlier, drawn by the hours \u2013 he has small children and his partner is a nurse \u2013 and the social angle. \u201cI like the idea of providing an option that\u2019s healthier than what people would otherwise go for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy to taste good, look good and appeal to people.\u201d Right now, most of the dishes come pre-prepared by Food Innovation Solutions, but Johnson is working to bring all food production in-house. For the first three months, Bek acts as Johnson\u2019s sidekick, taking orders, packaging dishes and delivering some orders himself on his single-speed bike. When I next see him, at the family tasting in late January, he looks exhausted. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hard slog,\u201d he says. Business has been slow to pick up: they had four or five orders a night in the run-up to Christmas, but early January has been dead. Keeping up morale is a daily struggle. Working in a shared space has been challenging, too, but Bek has been able to identify a variety of unforeseen problems. \u201cEvery day we\u2019re tweaking things,\u201d says Johnson. The challenge this evening, more immediately, is to impress the six now-ravenous children and their parents who have gathered in the next-door cafe to give feedback on the Medleys menu. Mohammed and Naheed Suleman and their children Hassan, 10, Hussein, eight, and nine-month-old Aisha, who ordered pasta bake, fish stew and three \u201cposh\u201d fish finger wraps, are full of praise. \u201cThe fish is fantastic,\u201d says Mohammed. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different from how we eat at home, but it\u2019s good to have a change. We would definitely order again.\u201d Serena Cunningham is less convinced. \u201cIt was really fresh and reasonably priced and the portions were the perfect size.\u201d But would she order again? \u201cProbably not,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly because it\u2019s the type of thing I can cook anyway. I could make pasta bake and cottage pie at home, because I\u2019ve always got the ingredients.\u201d Takeaway, for Cunningham, means food she can\u2019t make herself. \u201cLiterally, I don\u2019t know the recipe for Kentucky,\u201d she says. \u201cIt needs to feel like a treat for the kids.\u201d The kids, however, are more positive. \u201cI loved it,\u201d says Naila, who screams \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if mummy should order it again. \u201cFive out of five,\u201d is Noah-Isaac\u2019s verdict, even though he left half his cottage pie uneaten due to the presence of lentils. \u201cI only like green peas,\u201d he murmurs. The analogy that keeps coming back to me, each time I call in on Bek and his team, is that of taking small steps up a big mountain. Professor Martin Caraher underlines this when he says: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one solution to obesity. Obesity is complex: it\u2019s nutrient intake, but it\u2019s also activity. No one thing will solve obesity.\u201d Shift\u2019s project is part of a solution, he goes on, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the solution. Though I do applaud what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Bek acknowledged this on our very first meeting, saying: \u201cA single takeaway in Lambeth is not really going to change childhood obesity. What will change it,\u201d he went on, \u201cor what we\u2019re all hoping for, is a networked approach and a density of options in local areas.\u201d In our final conversation, at the end of January, Bek is still focused on making this one takeaway commercially viable \u2013 they\u2019re getting up to eight orders a night now but need many more than that to break even; Bek hopes that plugging into Uber Eats and Deliveroo in the months ahead will put them in a much better position. But he has been having thoughts, too, about what a more networked approach and a greater density of options might look like in practice. For Bek, hot-food delivery is just one among several ways of making healthier food available to his target audience. Another option is a subscription service for ready-to-cook meals, which parents could collect from local pick-up points \u2013 outside the school gates, for example. Even if the takeaway picks up, Bek is aware that he could still be doing more. \u201cThe next thing is local catering,\u201d he says. \u201cIf somebody said, we\u2019ve got a 40-person event, can you cater it? Absolutely, we can. We\u2019ve got a space, we\u2019ve got the equipment, we\u2019ve got the people \u2013 let\u2019s do it.\u201d What really interests him, though, is joining forces with like-minded organisations, and creating an example that others \u2013 entrepreneurs as well as social enterprises \u2013 will want to replicate. \u201cMy hunch is that to really make something like this work, it\u2019s a collective effort,\u201d he says.\u201d \u201cWe really don\u2019t want to be doing this on our own,\u201d Bek\u2019s colleague Rachel Stephenson chips in. \u201cWe want other people to be doing similar things and collaborating more. It\u2019s hard enough if you don\u2019t have a social mission to do a food business,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut when you do, it\u2019s definitely worth us all clubbing together.\u201d \u2022 Patrick Bek has now left Shift to become head of new product development at Birmingham City University\u2019s innovation hub Steamhouse. He has been replaced as venture lead on Medleys by Alice Wilson. Medleys will launch on Uber Eats later in March.",

      "body": "<p>I am a chef, but I don\u2019t \u201ccook\u201d that much. I shop really well and pretty much \u201cput together\u201d. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m lazy; come Sunday and I\u2019m cooking a ragu, or a roast chicken then stock with the carcass for the freezer, and so on. But as a working mum, I have to cut corners. I soak beans the night before for a soup with herby courgettes. I\u2019ll keep polenta ready to fry. A green tea cake with rhubarb will take a little time, but is an easy pudding-like cake. It\u2019s delicious served warm, so make it before dinner and place it in the oven while you\u2019re eating. When the spring blossom is out and the sun lasts longer these are the kind of gorgeous dishes I want to put on the table.</p> <h2>Fried polenta with broad beans</h2> <p>This would also be delicious with a runny egg or roasted tomatoes. <br><em>Serves 4</em></p> <p><strong>butter</strong> 25g, plus extra for the tin<br><strong>water </strong>750ml, salted<br><strong>polenta</strong> 250g<br><strong>parmesan</strong> 50g, grated, plus extra to serve<br><strong>broad beans </strong>1 kg (in shells) or 350g frozen beans<br><strong>olive oil<br>garlic </strong>2 cloves, thinly sliced<br><strong>baby spinach </strong>250g, washed<br><strong>salt </strong>and<strong> pepper<br>chilli flakes </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>thyme</strong> 3 sprigs<br><strong>lemon </strong>1, cut into 4 wedges<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong></p> <p>Butter a 21 x 11 x 7cm loaf tin and set aside. Bring the salted water to a boil, add the polenta and cook until it is thick and clings to the spoon \u2013 about 10 minutes, but it will vary, so always check the instructions on the packet. Stir in the parmesan and butter until you have a smooth mixture. Pour the soft polenta mixture into the prepared tin and leave to cool and set for half an hour. This will keep for up to 5 days in the fridge.</p> <p>Have a bowl of ice water ready. Pod the beans if you are using fresh and bring a small saucepan of salted water to the boil. Drop the beans into the pan and cook for about 2 minutes, until they start to float. Drain the beans and add to the ice water, if the water has warmed up from the beans you can refresh the ice water. You can pop the skins off any larger beans, though this is more of a preference. Put the cold beans into a bowl, toss with a little olive oil and set aside.</p> <p>Heat a frying pan with 2 tbsp of olive oil, add the garlic and thyme and cook on a medium heat until the garlic begins to colour. Drop in the spinach and cook for a couple of minutes until wilted, stirring constantly. Season with salt, pepper and chilli flakes. Drizzle with oil, turn off the heat and leave the pan on the hob so it stays warm.</p> <p>Heat a nonstick or seasoned cast iron frying pan with 1 tbsp of olive oil and slice the polenta into 8. Fry until golden on each side (you may need more oil as you go). If you are using a smaller pan, you can keep the polenta warm in the oven.</p> <p>Divide the spinach between the plates, removing the thyme sprigs, and top with 2 slices of polenta. Spoon over the broad beans, drizzle with olive oil and finish with grated parmesan. Serve with a lemon wedge.</p> <h2>Kohlrabi and avocado salad</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8520242e65356c7525ee7b5add104edbb580047e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8520242e65356c7525ee7b5add104edbb580047e/0_3409_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crisp and fresh: kohlrabi and avocado salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crisp and fresh: kohlrabi and avocado salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first tried shaved kohlrabi at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/15/gospel-of-st-john-a-restaurant-should-be-an-old-friend-fergus-henderson-trevor-gulliver\" title=\"\">St John</a> <a href=\"https://stjohnrestaurant.com/pages/bread-and-wine\" title=\"\">Bread and Wine</a>.

Divide the spinach between the plates, removing the thyme sprigs, and top with 2 slices of polenta. Spoon over the broad beans, drizzle with olive oil and finish with grated parmesan. Serve with a lemon wedge. Kohlrabi and avocado salad I first tried shaved kohlrabi at St John Bread and Wine. It changed my idea of salad forever. Serves 4 kohlrabi 2, trimmed and peeled lemon juice and zest of 1 anchovies 30g grey salt and flaky sea salt white wine vinegar 2 tbsp black pepper extra virgin olive oil 2\u00bd tbsp avocados 2 cobnuts 50g (or hazelnuts), lightly toasted with skins removed Lightly toast the nuts in the oven on a low temperature for 4 or 5 minutes, remove from the oven, put in a clean tea towel while still warm and rub gently until the outer shells are removed. Trim and peel the kohlrabi and using a handheld mandolin or sharp knife, slice into paper-thin ovals. Juice and zest the lemon into a bowl and add the vinegar and sea salt. Add the kohlrabi slices and toss until all sides of the slices are covered with the lemon juice mixture. Set aside for later. Loosely drizzle each serving plate in a circular motion with 2 tsp of olive oil. Strain the kohlrabi and reserve the dressing. Drizzle half of the dressing on to the plate with the oil, reserving the other half for the top. Slice the avocados in half and remove the stones. Take 3 scoops from each half and add to each plate. Place an anchovy fillet on to each avocado piece and then sprinkle with the grey sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Arrange the kohlrabi slices in a loose overlapping pattern leaving some of the avocado covered and some exposed. Drizzle with the remaining half of the dressing. Sprinkle with the hazelnuts. Serve immediately. White bean soup with courgette and fresh herbs Serves 4-6 dried cannellini beans 250g, soaked for at least 12 hours garlic 1 head, halved plus 2 cloves, thinly sliced thyme 3 sprigs salt and pepper parsley 1 bunch, leaves picked and roughly chopped courgettes 2, trimmed and chopped into small cubes basil 1 handful (or green garlic leaves) extra virgin olive oil Soak the beans ahead of time, for at least 12 hours (I prefer 24), and then drain and put them in a large pot and cover with about 5cm of water, bring to the boil and then drain and refresh with the same amount of water again. Take a whole head of garlic and slice it in half down the middle and put both halves into the pot with the beans and water with 2 to 3 sprigs of thyme. Bring to the boil and then bring down to a simmer for 2-2\u00bd hours. Check on the beans occasionally, you may have to add a little more water. After 2 or 3 hours, check that the beans are ready (they should be tender), strain them and reserve the cooking liquid. Using a food processor, blitz half of the cooked beans and keep the rest whole. Mix the whole beans into the blitzed beans and add some of the cooking liquid to create a soupy texture and season with salt and pepper. In a small pan, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil and add the 2 cloves of sliced garlic. Drop in the chopped parsley and toss. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add another tbsp of oil to the same pan and add the chopped courgettes. Do not salt as you want them to turn a little golden and soften. Add these to the garlicky parsley and toss. Add the chopped basil or wild garlic leaves and drizzle a little fresh oil and toss again. Serve the soup immediately with a spoonful of the courgette mixture and a drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil. Serve with crusty bread. Green tea rhubarb pudding cake This is perfect served warm after dinner with stone-cold cream. Serves 4-6 For the pudding cake: plain flour 350g baking powder 1\u00bd tsp bicarb \u00bd tsp fine sea salt \u00bd tsp matcha powder 2 tbsp eggs 3 caster sugar 200g plain yogurt 300g vanilla bean paste 1 tbsp unsalted butter 220g, melted For the fruit topping: rhubarb 500g, forced or outdoor caster sugar 100g blood orange 1, zest and juice (or use a regular orange) icing sugar 1 tbsp matcha powder 1 tsp double cream to serve Preheat the oven to 170C/gas mark 3. Grease and line a 23cm spring-form or loose-bottom cake tin with parchment paper. In a bowl measure out the flour, baking powder, bicarb, salt and matcha powder and whisk until combined. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until smooth and then whisk in the yogurt and vanilla until combined. Slowly whisk in the melted butter until a smooth batter forms. Pour the wet mixture over the dry flour mix and whisk until combined. Pour the batter into your prepared tin, using a rubber spatula to get all of the mixture from the bottom and sides of the bowl. Trim and slice the rhubarb in half down the length and then into 5cm batons and empty into a clean bowl. Add the zest and juice of the orange and toss and make sure all of the batons are covered, pour over 100g sugar and allow to macerate for no longer than 5 minutes. Toss again. Arrange the rhubarb batons on the top to create a loose pattern. Bake the cake for 40-45 minutes or until springy to touch. Whisk together the icing sugar and matcha and sift over half of the cake. The cake can be served right away with cream or at room temperature later. Claire Ptak is a chef, author and owner of Violet Bakery (@violetcakeslondon). Nigel Slater returns in two weeks",

And Parma feels medieval because it is so quiet. I\u2019ve never known it so safe to cycle around an Italian city. It\u2019s as if the cars, as well as the humans, are keeping their distance.</p> <p>So everything feels softer somehow. I never knew there was someone in the next block of flats who played the guitar. You can hear them strumming late at night. The natural world \u2013 all the turtle doves and cherry blossom \u2013 seems brighter or emboldened. That quietness extends to the football.

It made them seem mortal, like Sunday league players. Now, of course, several players \u2013 Juventus\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51844945\" title=\"\">Daniele Rugani</a> and the former Southampton (now Sampdoria) striker <a href=\"https://www.goal.com/en/news/coronavirus-sampdoria-forward-gabbiadini-becomes-second/v6yah8i6ugmx19m85rxpj6en1\" title=\"\">Manolo Gabbiadini</a> \u2013 have tested positive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11b17e502f2e0ef82bf59df612e5d3958bae7f9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b17e502f2e0ef82bf59df612e5d3958bae7f9b/0_0_3072_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Players from Parma vs Spal line up in an empty stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Players from Parma vs Spal prepare to play without spectators in early March, before Serie A was suspended.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elisabetta Baracchi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s intriguing is that all the adjectives you might normally use to describe Italy (sociable, excitable, chaotic, undisciplined, polemical, fun and \u2013 despite all its troubles \u2013 somehow optimistic) have become redundant. It feels completely the opposite: isolated, calm, orderly, obedient, cowed, dour and pessimistic. It\u2019s as if the country has suddenly discovered a different, maybe deeper, side. It\u2019s a sterner, more serious place.</p> <p>It\u2019s sombre, of course, because there have now been more than 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy. There\u2019s bafflement at the fact that the mortality rate here is (at time of writing) 7.17% compared with 0.05% in Sweden and 0.2% in Germany. We don\u2019t understand why we\u2019ve got it so bad, whether it\u2019s related to hospital capacity, superbugs, a very aged population, a high proportion of smokers or something else entirely. Nor do we understand why the contagion has spread so fast in Italy: the cases per million of the population is, at 250, far higher than anywhere else in the world: Iran stands at 120, China at 56.</p> <p>There are also well-founded fears about the Italian economy, which was in deep trouble even before this crisis. The Milan stock market plunged 11% last Monday, then plummeted another 17% on the Thursday. With shops and businesses at a standstill, the government has promised a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/italy-plans-debt-moratorium-to-cope-with-coronavirus-lockdown-11583849663\" title=\"\">moratorium on mortgage payments</a>, childcare vouchers for working parents and a suspension of tax payments. The costs of unemployment benefit (the country\u2019s <em>cassa integrazione</em>) is likely to spike. Those measures will cost the treasury an estimated \u20ac25bn.</p> <p>The trouble is that the cupboard is bare. If banks are not receiving mortgage repayments, nor the government its usual tax revenue in spite of soaring expenditure, there will suddenly be a liquidity crisis. The ruthless markets know that: the yields on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds (a clear indication of the cost of government borrowing) rose more in one day last week than ever before \u2013 50 basis points. Shares in some of Italy\u2019s biggest banks \u2013 Intesa and Unicredit \u2013 saw double-digit falls. Hence the fury in Italy when the European Central Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11ab8f84-6452-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\" title=\"\">offered no assistance</a> to the country. The response from Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, was close to institutional incandescence. \u201cWe need solidarity, not impediments to our actions,\u201d he seethed.</p> <p>Many of us feel deeply melancholic at the suffering Italy is going through. For all my frustrations with this country, I\u2019m an Italian patriot, obsessed by the underdog heroics of the Risorgimento in the mid-late 19th century, when Giuseppe Garibaldi\u2019s guerrillas fought for Italian reunification against the European super-powers. When they were younger, my kids used to salute Garibaldi every time they passed his statue in Parma\u2019s main square, and I would repeat my favourite Garibaldi line: \u201cItaly will never be wholly without sons [and daughters, I added] who can astound the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acbdc16c9f52e392b79e3ce23a9d968b76225752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acbdc16c9f52e392b79e3ce23a9d968b76225752/0_319_5130_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The statue of Garibaldi in Parma\u2019s main square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Garibaldi in Parma\u2019s main square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So I, too, felt offended at the latest international media coverage. There was a discernible glee in some quarters that the \u201csilly Eye-ties\u201d had messed things up again. \u201cThey\u2019ll never follow the rules,\u201d said some.</p> <p>Prejudices about Italy \u2013 assuming that problem was the country itself, and not coronavirus \u2013 meant that few people abroad took note when, for weeks, Italian leaders, epidemiologists and journalists urged similarly decisive action across Europe. Even as this slow-motion, medical tsunami was moving towards the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was sneering at the need for \u201cdraconian\u201d measures. We watched in disbelief as thousands of people travelled to watch horse racing in Cheltenham and 3,500 gathered in Paris dressed as smurfs just to break a world record.</p> <p>From our lockdown in Italy, it seemed at that time as if the world\u2019s addiction to sport, partying and frivolity was blinding it to the most serious pandemic in our lifetimes.</p> <p>Because actually Italians are very well-informed (some might even say obsessive) about personal health. They learn about plague and contagion at school because two of the classics of Italy\u2019s literary canon \u2013 Alessandro Manzoni\u2019s <em>The Betrothed</em> and Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s <em>The Decameron</em>, deal with precisely those themes. Italians, on the whole, know far more about hygiene and medicine than their European counterparts. Now that so many other countries are following Italy\u2019s lead \u2013 closing schools, universities and sports events \u2013 we feel, at least, somewhat vindicated.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the five of us are all holed up at home. This is the third week our kids have not been to school with, at least, another three to go. They are sent homework by their teachers through the school websites. There are endless technical hitches and there\u2019s barely enough work to fill a morning. Benedetta attends her ballet school online, using a chair as the bar and dancing around her (neither tidy nor spacious) bedroom.</p> <p>We\u2019re fortunate that we all get along and that Francesca and I both work flexibly or from home. But some families, and couples, are really struggling with being cooped up, and as well as a spike in birth rates later this year, one suspects divorce rates may also rise.</p> <p>Even for us, this forced time together is subtly shifting the way we all rub along and who does what. With their usual, frenetic hobbies cancelled, the children have a lot of spare time, so we\u2019re shamelessly giving them domestic chores. They\u2019re cleaning the fridge and the windows, mopping the floors and hanging out laundry. I\u2019m also setting them daily challenges with a didactic dad\u2019s earnestness: if they want to watch TV they have to learn the Nato phonetic alphabet (three passes), the names and dates of the Plantagenet monarchs (two passes), how to tie knots (three passes) or a Shakespeare soliloquy (only one pass). I\u2019m learning quite a lot myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ca92aa860590fea4d8eafbcf547c6918441097d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca92aa860590fea4d8eafbcf547c6918441097d/43_734_5102_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Jones family, Francesca, Emma, Benedetta and Leonardo, play cards at home during the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jones family; Francesca, Emma, Benedetta and Leonardo; play cards at home during the lockdown.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tobias Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But you do wonder what\u2019s going through their minds. Quite apart from the fear, they\u2019re dealing with disappointments which, at their age, must seem huge. Benedetta had won, along with her dance troupe, an international ballet competition, the prize for which was to dance in New York in April. That won\u2019t now happen. Emma, Mozart-obsessed, was due to go with her grandmother to the opera house in Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s birthplace, Busseto, to see <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em>. That, too, has been cancelled. She has started playing melancholic Chopin instead of playful Mozart. Leonardo, like me, just longs to be able to play football again. In our manic matches of indoor one-aside, we\u2019ve accidentally pruned the Victoria spiderworts and smashed the odd lightbulb.</p> <p>They\u2019re finding new passions too. They love playing euchre and blackjack, betting with matchsticks. Leo is teaching himself Spanish and now calls me <em>el padre</em> or <em>hombre</em>. Benedetta is sewing, she says from behind her bedroom door, a suit jacket. Emma is pretending to get fit. It\u2019s all fairly wholesome in a Waltons kind of way. But they are, like us, getting cabin fever. We don\u2019t know when this is going to end or what the outside world will look like when it does.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/parma-map/giv-3902BKRp2XyLZDlv/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/parma-map/giv-3902BKRp2XyLZDlv/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>There have been eight deaths so far in Parma and, we assume, there will be many more. Parma is a small city. With more than 518 cases, almost everyone has a friend or friend-of-a-friend who is ill. It\u2019s less important, perhaps, but many businesses, too, will go under.</p> <p>Everyone is trying to be resilient.

There have been many goosebump moments, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDu_kLJ-5Mk\" title=\"\">the spontaneous singing of whole streets</a>, the voices joining in complex harmonies through the open windows. There have been laughs: one Roman market stallholder wore a wide, plywood doughnut to guarantee personal distance. But it feels like gallows humour and the songs sound mournful.</p> <p>Since we\u2019ve been in lockdown, spring has erupted. You can see pinky-white bursts of magnolias lining the empty roads. Daises, primroses and dandelions are suddenly brightening the grass. It even smells like spring. The Parma air is, for once, so clean you can see the snow-capped Apennines from my study. It only makes you keener to get out.</p> <p>But until this emergency lockdown ends, we will \u2013 except for rare excursions \u2013 experience the world like prisoners, from the windows of our cells.</p> <p><em>Tobias Jones lives in Parma.

We don\u2019t understand why we\u2019ve got it so bad, whether it\u2019s related to hospital capacity, superbugs, a very aged population, a high proportion of smokers or something else entirely. Nor do we understand why the contagion has spread so fast in Italy: the cases per million of the population is, at 250, far higher than anywhere else in the world: Iran stands at 120, China at 56. There are also well-founded fears about the Italian economy, which was in deep trouble even before this crisis. The Milan stock market plunged 11% last Monday, then plummeted another 17% on the Thursday. With shops and businesses at a standstill, the government has promised a moratorium on mortgage payments, childcare vouchers for working parents and a suspension of tax payments. The costs of unemployment benefit (the country\u2019s cassa integrazione) is likely to spike. Those measures will cost the treasury an estimated \u20ac25bn. The trouble is that the cupboard is bare. If banks are not receiving mortgage repayments, nor the government its usual tax revenue in spite of soaring expenditure, there will suddenly be a liquidity crisis. The ruthless markets know that: the yields on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds (a clear indication of the cost of government borrowing) rose more in one day last week than ever before \u2013 50 basis points. Shares in some of Italy\u2019s biggest banks \u2013 Intesa and Unicredit \u2013 saw double-digit falls. Hence the fury in Italy when the European Central Bank offered no assistance to the country. The response from Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, was close to institutional incandescence. \u201cWe need solidarity, not impediments to our actions,\u201d he seethed. Many of us feel deeply melancholic at the suffering Italy is going through. For all my frustrations with this country, I\u2019m an Italian patriot, obsessed by the underdog heroics of the Risorgimento in the mid-late 19th century, when Giuseppe Garibaldi\u2019s guerrillas fought for Italian reunification against the European super-powers. When they were younger, my kids used to salute Garibaldi every time they passed his statue in Parma\u2019s main square, and I would repeat my favourite Garibaldi line: \u201cItaly will never be wholly without sons [and daughters, I added] who can astound the world.\u201d So I, too, felt offended at the latest international media coverage. There was a discernible glee in some quarters that the \u201csilly Eye-ties\u201d had messed things up again. \u201cThey\u2019ll never follow the rules,\u201d said some. Prejudices about Italy \u2013 assuming that problem was the country itself, and not coronavirus \u2013 meant that few people abroad took note when, for weeks, Italian leaders, epidemiologists and journalists urged similarly decisive action across Europe. Even as this slow-motion, medical tsunami was moving towards the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was sneering at the need for \u201cdraconian\u201d measures. We watched in disbelief as thousands of people travelled to watch horse racing in Cheltenham and 3,500 gathered in Paris dressed as smurfs just to break a world record. From our lockdown in Italy, it seemed at that time as if the world\u2019s addiction to sport, partying and frivolity was blinding it to the most serious pandemic in our lifetimes. Because actually Italians are very well-informed (some might even say obsessive) about personal health. They learn about plague and contagion at school because two of the classics of Italy\u2019s literary canon \u2013 Alessandro Manzoni\u2019s The Betrothed and Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s The Decameron, deal with precisely those themes. Italians, on the whole, know far more about hygiene and medicine than their European counterparts. Now that so many other countries are following Italy\u2019s lead \u2013 closing schools, universities and sports events \u2013 we feel, at least, somewhat vindicated. Meanwhile, the five of us are all holed up at home. This is the third week our kids have not been to school with, at least, another three to go. They are sent homework by their teachers through the school websites. There are endless technical hitches and there\u2019s barely enough work to fill a morning. Benedetta attends her ballet school online, using a chair as the bar and dancing around her (neither tidy nor spacious) bedroom. We\u2019re fortunate that we all get along and that Francesca and I both work flexibly or from home. But some families, and couples, are really struggling with being cooped up, and as well as a spike in birth rates later this year, one suspects divorce rates may also rise. Even for us, this forced time together is subtly shifting the way we all rub along and who does what. With their usual, frenetic hobbies cancelled, the children have a lot of spare time, so we\u2019re shamelessly giving them domestic chores. They\u2019re cleaning the fridge and the windows, mopping the floors and hanging out laundry. I\u2019m also setting them daily challenges with a didactic dad\u2019s earnestness: if they want to watch TV they have to learn the Nato phonetic alphabet (three passes), the names and dates of the Plantagenet monarchs (two passes), how to tie knots (three passes) or a Shakespeare soliloquy (only one pass). I\u2019m learning quite a lot myself. But you do wonder what\u2019s going through their minds. Quite apart from the fear, they\u2019re dealing with disappointments which, at their age, must seem huge. Benedetta had won, along with her dance troupe, an international ballet competition, the prize for which was to dance in New York in April. That won\u2019t now happen. Emma, Mozart-obsessed, was due to go with her grandmother to the opera house in Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s birthplace, Busseto, to see The Marriage of Figaro. That, too, has been cancelled. She has started playing melancholic Chopin instead of playful Mozart. Leonardo, like me, just longs to be able to play football again. In our manic matches of indoor one-aside, we\u2019ve accidentally pruned the Victoria spiderworts and smashed the odd lightbulb. They\u2019re finding new passions too. They love playing euchre and blackjack, betting with matchsticks. Leo is teaching himself Spanish and now calls me el padre or hombre. Benedetta is sewing, she says from behind her bedroom door, a suit jacket. Emma is pretending to get fit. It\u2019s all fairly wholesome in a Waltons kind of way. But they are, like us, getting cabin fever. We don\u2019t know when this is going to end or what the outside world will look like when it does. There have been eight deaths so far in Parma and, we assume, there will be many more. Parma is a small city. With more than 518 cases, almost everyone has a friend or friend-of-a-friend who is ill. It\u2019s less important, perhaps, but many businesses, too, will go under. Everyone is trying to be resilient. Children across the country are hanging out paintings on balconies saying andr\u00e0 tutto bene (everything will be fine). There have been many goosebump moments, like the spontaneous singing of whole streets, the voices joining in complex harmonies through the open windows. There have been laughs: one Roman market stallholder wore a wide, plywood doughnut to guarantee personal distance. But it feels like gallows humour and the songs sound mournful. Since we\u2019ve been in lockdown, spring has erupted. You can see pinky-white bursts of magnolias lining the empty roads. Daises, primroses and dandelions are suddenly brightening the grass. It even smells like spring. The Parma air is, for once, so clean you can see the snow-capped Apennines from my study. It only makes you keener to get out. But until this emergency lockdown ends, we will \u2013 except for rare excursions \u2013 experience the world like prisoners, from the windows of our cells. Tobias Jones lives in Parma.

McQueen takes Keaton\u2019s place and repeats the shot from different angles. In his short <em>Five Easy Pieces</em>, he films a group of black men hula hooping; as they move, their shadows seem to be acting independently of them, like ghosts.

A director of another club, who did not want to air his thoughts as publicly, said that while clubs could still garner enough points to change their positions, none will want to accept a disadvantage, especially given the huge sporting and financial gap between the Premier League and Championship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/english-football-shutdown-until-april-means-season-may-never-be-completed\">English football's shutdown until April means season may never be completed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scrapping the season is the only solution that avoids a descent into litigation by those who would lose out if current places are converted into permanence, he said.</p> <p>Another executive said they could do that, but avoid rancourous battles with a more creative solution: reward the winners but reprieve the losers. If the season needs to be considered finished at this stage, Liverpool, 25 points ahead at the top, would be awarded the title they have waited 30 years to reclaim and nobody could justifiably argue. Leeds and West Brom should go up, he said, but no club be relegated and the Premier League could play next season with 22 clubs.</p> <p>Those in the promotion places in Leagues One and Two and the National League should be promoted and the numbers made up by none going down. The leagues could readjust their numbers with more clubs relegated over the next couple of seasons. Those in play-off places could legitimately argue they may have made it to automatic promotion, but none would suffer an actual major loss.</p> <p>These scenarios are so speculative as to be the private thoughts of people still stunned by this nightmare event, but discussions will solidify this coming week. As for the financial hit, it will be unavoidable if the season does not finish. Sky and BT Sport, whose holding position is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/bt-sport-not-offering-refunds-to-customers-despite-football-suspension\" title=\"\">not to give subscribers refunds</a> while this remains a short postponement, would have to do so if the season is cancelled. The broadcasters are thought to have the contractual right to withhold multimillions from the leagues, although given their longstanding relationships and the nature of this crisis, the leagues would be hopeful of an accommodation. It has not yet been made clear even to the clubs if the leagues have insurance to cover the loss of broadcasting income in these extraordinary circumstances.</p> <p>Some clubs do have \u201cbusiness interruption\u201d insurance to cover them for the loss of matchday revenues, but this is thought to become less common down the pyramid. Lower division Football League clubs, which rely on ticket income and are more financially fragile, are considered most at risk of falling into difficulties. The government has been made aware of this national sport\u2019s vulnerabilities and there is some hope that public money could provide a safety net. But, really, after a decade of austerity and underfunding of the NHS, everybody knows the government has many more urgent priorities and attending to football\u2019s financial ailments will not be top of the list.</p>",

Scrapping the season is the only solution that avoids a descent into litigation by those who would lose out if current places are converted into permanence, he said. Another executive said they could do that, but avoid rancourous battles with a more creative solution: reward the winners but reprieve the losers. If the season needs to be considered finished at this stage, Liverpool, 25 points ahead at the top, would be awarded the title they have waited 30 years to reclaim and nobody could justifiably argue. Leeds and West Brom should go up, he said, but no club be relegated and the Premier League could play next season with 22 clubs. Those in the promotion places in Leagues One and Two and the National League should be promoted and the numbers made up by none going down. The leagues could readjust their numbers with more clubs relegated over the next couple of seasons. Those in play-off places could legitimately argue they may have made it to automatic promotion, but none would suffer an actual major loss. These scenarios are so speculative as to be the private thoughts of people still stunned by this nightmare event, but discussions will solidify this coming week. As for the financial hit, it will be unavoidable if the season does not finish. Sky and BT Sport, whose holding position is not to give subscribers refunds while this remains a short postponement, would have to do so if the season is cancelled. The broadcasters are thought to have the contractual right to withhold multimillions from the leagues, although given their longstanding relationships and the nature of this crisis, the leagues would be hopeful of an accommodation. It has not yet been made clear even to the clubs if the leagues have insurance to cover the loss of broadcasting income in these extraordinary circumstances. Some clubs do have \u201cbusiness interruption\u201d insurance to cover them for the loss of matchday revenues, but this is thought to become less common down the pyramid. Lower division Football League clubs, which rely on ticket income and are more financially fragile, are considered most at risk of falling into difficulties. The government has been made aware of this national sport\u2019s vulnerabilities and there is some hope that public money could provide a safety net. But, really, after a decade of austerity and underfunding of the NHS, everybody knows the government has many more urgent priorities and attending to football\u2019s financial ailments will not be top of the list.",

More than 200 Run for Something candidates won state legislative seats, some capturing red-state seats that had been in Republican hands for longer than the young candidates had been alive. That\u2019s 10% of all 2018 Democratic state house gains, all for just $2.1m, and not much more than the average budget for one US House race.</p> <p>While Run for Something helped funnel enthusiastic candidates into electoral politics, groups like Flippable, Sister District and Forward Majority provided another approach. They focused their efforts on reclaiming the state legislative chambers most crucial for the 2021 redistricting. They targeted blue and purple states which had been under complete GOP control since 2010, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia and North Carolina; red states with changing demographics, like Texas and Arizona; and competitive states including Washington and Colorado, where a small number of Democratic gains would be enough to create a blue trifecta.</p> <p>Together, they channeled dollars and volunteers toward these small local races with massive national impact. Republican strategists and donors had long ago unlocked the importance of these elections and built the party\u2019s national power one state legislative chamber at a time. Republicans captured more than 700 state legislative seats in the 2010 Tea Party wave, then locked in those gains with redistricting, tilting the playing field an even rubier red. In all, Republicans gained more than 1,000 state legislative seats during the Obama years, and used those majorities to enact measures making it more difficult to register to vote or cast a ballot in twenty-five states, further disadvantaging Democrats and consolidating GOP power.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats had an entire cycle of losing,\u201d says Vicky Hausman, the co-founder of Forward Majority.</p> <p>Democrats contested more than 5,300 of the 6,066 state legislative seats up for election in 2018, the highest percentage in more than a decade. In one year, they won back almost 450 of the seats that had washed away over the previous decade. It came bottom-up, as Run for Something, Sister District and Forward Majority delivered energy, candidates and strategic smarts to races that the party ignored. They helped win majorities in the Colorado and New York senate, and eroded GOP majorities in Pennsylvania and Arizona. They cracked a Republican supermajority in North Carolina and significantly improved their party\u2019s position in Florida, Michigan and Texas, gaining important yardage with one election to go before the next redistricting.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If our majority \u2013 our three-million-person majority \u2013 was engaged in state politics, everything is different</p> <footer> <cite>Rita Bosworth</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just citizens who have been activated. If our majority \u2013 our three-million-person majority \u2013 was engaged in state politics, everything is different,\u201d says Rita Bosworth, the co-founder of Sister District, which started with a Facebook conversation and now has 30,000 nationwide volunteers organized through sixty-five active teams on the ground. They focused on thirty-two legislative elections \u2013 and won sixteen of them \u2013 in nine states where Democrats might flip a chamber or make inroads into gerrymandered GOP majorities.</p> <p>Her three co-founders \u2013 political director Gabrielle Goldstein, partnerships and engagement director Lala Wu and programs and communication director Lyzz Schwegler \u2013 came together largely through a secret Facebook group of liberal lawyers established after the 2016 election. By spring, Bosworth, Goldstein and Wu had abandoned successful law careers to save democracy full-time.</p> <p>On election night 2016, tearful in Columbus, Ohio, Flippable\u2019s Catharine Vaughan found herself coming to a similar conclusion. She had taken a leave from McKinsey and Co and left San Francisco to work for the Hillary campaign and spend months on a host family\u2019s sofa. When the campaign ended with whiskey and tears, Vaughan planned to head back to consulting and the Bay Area. Over farewell margaritas, the team tried to unpack what had gone wrong and what might come next. The conversation turned to gerrymandering. Ohio is enough of a competitive, bellwether state that they\u2019d all put their lives on hold, thinking the state\u2019s electoral votes could decide the presidential election. But Republicans still held a two-to-one edge in the state legislature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61a625ce88dba10c91e4db08fc7bfcd6704b9ceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61a625ce88dba10c91e4db08fc7bfcd6704b9ceb/0_0_3500_1943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of thousands march down Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women\u2019s March in Washington in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"555\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of thousands march down Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women\u2019s March in Washington in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Woolston/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vaughan had spent several years working with the Gates Foundation and others on health problems in east Africa that were completely preventable if the right resources landed in the right places.

      "body": "<p>Despite the title, there\u2019s no \u201csecret\u201d to <em>Secrets of Cinema</em>, a new three-part BBC4 series of which <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bbn5pt/episodes/guide\" title=\"\">begins this week</a>. Instead the programme is about the things we recognise, but perhaps haven\u2019t acknowledged, in cinema; the recurrent stories, themes and tropes that underlie the movies we love.</p> <p>From the outset, Kim Newman\u2019s involvement as lead writer on <em>Secrets of Cinema</em> was crucial. His knowledge of movies is encyclopaedic. I met him when I was first working as a film critic in London in the 1980s, and we have a shared interest in narrative \u2013 in the way movies tell stories.</p> <p>Along with director Nick Freand Jones, producer John Das and archivist Jane Long, we\u2019d sit in Newman\u2019s London flat brainstorming each programme, and the scripts came out of the notes of those fantastically enjoyable meetings. I think it was that sense of excitement that spurred the positive response to the first series, which covered romcoms, heist movies, sci-fi, horror and coming-of-age pictures. Since then we\u2019ve made three one-off specials, and now the new series, which covers superheroes, British history and spies. Here\u2019s some of our favourite \u201csecrets\u201d, culled from those programmes\u2026 <strong>MK</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f018bdc8cb0242ff99ef4180db38333d413f16a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f018bdc8cb0242ff99ef4180db38333d413f16a/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Monster movies can be romcoms too</h2> <p>Film genres are slippery, with cross-pollination and mutation the order of the day. A film can look like one thing from the outside \u2013 be it a drama, thriller, horror or comedy \u2013 but delve beneath the surface and you\u2019ll find a rich cocktail of movie-genre DNA. Take <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/18/the-shape-of-water-review-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins\" title=\"\">The Shape of Water</a></em>, which won the Oscar for best picture in 2018. On the surface, it looks like a science-fiction/horror hybrid in the style of <em>Creature from the Black Lagoon</em> \u2013 the 3D monster-movie from 1954. Yet <em>The Shape of Water</em> also features a musical fantasy sequence, inspired by the monochrome designs and dances of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film <em>Follow the Fleet </em>(1936). And with its central tale of a love affair between a woman and what it basically a merman, it bears an uncanny similarity to Ron Howard\u2019s <em>Splash</em> (1984), a classic romcom posing as a fairytale fantasy.</p> <p>You can find the romcom gene in a host of movie genres, from Bollywood musical melodramas to Hollywood superhero spectaculars (see below). Japanese director Takashi Miike\u2019s <em>Audition</em> (1999), adapted from the novel by Ryu Murakami, starts out like an off-kilter romcom before mutating into a terrifying symphony of pain and piano wire. As for David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 remake of the 1958 shocker <em>The Fly</em>, its plot is essentially a twisted variation on an old romcom favourite: boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy has accident with a teleporter and splices himself with an insect before getting girl to shoot him in the head. Ah, sweet!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0fa8560b1fe18c9e273fd596a88841339a919bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0fa8560b1fe18c9e273fd596a88841339a919bc/0_12_2993_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daryl Hannah in Splash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daryl Hannah in Splash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea8bb3085896360892118a7a91a0b2f48717e20e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea8bb3085896360892118a7a91a0b2f48717e20e/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Oscar statuette\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>How to win an Oscar</h2> <p>The most often repeated canard about the Oscars is that the easiest path to an acting statuette is to play a character with mental health issues (see <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/19/comedy\" title=\"\">Tropic Thunder</a></em>). Best-picture winners focusing on mental-health issues include <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/24/my-favorite-best-picture-oscar-winner-the-lost-weekend\" title=\"\">The Lost Weekend</a></em>, <em>Rain Man</em>, <em>Forrest Gump </em>and<em> A Beautiful Mind</em>. Even <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest</em> and <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, which won several awards (including gongs for both leading actors), are about patients under psychiatric care. This year, Joaquin Phoenix took best actor for <em>Joker</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/06/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-ace-turn\" title=\"\">playing a supervillain with a range of complexes</a> and compulsions.</p> <p>But Oscar also loves British royalty, all the way back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/dec/10/private-life-henry-viii-reel-history\" title=\"\">Charles Laughton\u2019s Henry VIII</a>, with crowned-head awards on the shelves of Helen Mirren (<em>The Queen</em>), Judi Dench (<em>Shakespeare in Love</em>), Katharine Hepburn (<em>The Lion in Winter</em>) and more. The glow of privilege even falls upon common prime ministers, with George Arliss, Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman taking top acting honours as Disraeli, Thatcher and Churchill respectively.</p> <p>Thus, the most obvious Oscar lock-in in cinema history was Colin Firth in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/09/kings-speech-philip-french-review\" title=\"\">The King\u2019s Speech</a></em>, playing a royal underdog struggling against hidebound courtiers (award-winning screen royals all have to be rebellious) while simultaneously overcoming a handicap (his stutter). Firth had the statuette on his mantelpiece from the first time he opened the script \u2013 it\u2019s a wonder the other nominees even bothered to show up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5dac1a58b2b765637f3ca42cde3c3423a4da9488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dac1a58b2b765637f3ca42cde3c3423a4da9488/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Colman in the Favourite.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia Colman in The Favourite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>British history is best seen from a distance</h2> <p>History is the quintessential British film genre. America may have the great outdoors for westerns and road movies, and teeming cities for cop and crime sagas. But Britain has seen off the Romans, been ruled by Tudors and Stuarts, built and then lost an empire, and fought all the way through two world wars. Unsurprisingly, British history films have proved a highly exportable film commodity \u2013 yet it\u2019s notable that many of the best movies in this genre were made by film-makers from other countries.</p> <p>The first British talkie to make significant inroads into the American market was <em>The Private Life of Henry VIII</em> in 1933. Charles Laughton won a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of the gluttonous monarch, famously tearing into chicken with his bare hands, and running through wives the way he ran through numerous multi-course feasts. Fast forward to 2019, and Olivia Colman won a best actress Oscar for her portrayal of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-emma-stone-rachel-weisz-yorgos-lanthimos\" title=\"\">emotionally damaged Queen Anne in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-emma-stone-rachel-weisz-yorgos-lanthimos\" title=\"\">The Favourite</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-emma-stone-rachel-weisz-yorgos-lanthimos\" title=\"\">.</a></p> <p>Both of these films (which are fondly imagined as very \u201cBritish\u201d triumphs) had \u201cforeign\u201d directors; the Hungarian Alexander Korda and the Greek Yorgos Lanthimos respectively. Both also play fast and loose with history (as does everything from Hammer\u2019s oft-forgotten 1967 romp <em>The Viking Queen</em>, which is actually set in Roman times, to Mel Gibson\u2019s 1996 best picture winner <em>Braveheart</em>, an American production, set in Scotland, shot in Ireland, directed by and starring an Irish-American-Australian). Meanwhile, despite its bizarre mashup of glam-rock costumes and 1970s sex comedy tropes, Italian Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s <em>The Canterbury Tales </em>(1972) evoked Chaucer with zest and earthiness, making it one of the few films about medieval Britain that an actual medieval audience might recognise. Perhaps true Britishness \u2013 or at least the version of it that sells to an international audience \u2013 can only really be observed from the outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3246fdf2d8ecd8348a628ae12827aa37d08d76cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3246fdf2d8ecd8348a628ae12827aa37d08d76cf/0_53_1782_1069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Viking Queen from 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Viking Queen from 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05e41eeee0a26662343a4a115e364f1889926ee0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e41eeee0a26662343a4a115e364f1889926ee0/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North By Northwest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Bond movies owe a huge debt to Alfred Hitchcock</h2> <p>The spy genre has its roots in such 1920s Fritz Lang movies as the Dr Mabuse series and <em>Spies</em> (1928), which drew on the earlier French thriller serials of Louis Feuillade. But Alfred Hitchcock dominated the origins of the \u201cspy film\u201d with such prewar British thrillers as <em>The 39 Steps</em> (1935) and <em>The Lady Vanishes</em> (1938). A succession of sophisticated Hollywood movies established Hitchcock as the maestro of mistrust and suspense, reaching its apotheosis in <em>North By Northwest </em>(1959) in which Cary Grant\u2019s ad man Roger Thornhill is mistaken for a government agent. Hitchcock\u2019s influence on the look and feel of the action is critical; Sean Connery said that the early Bond films would have looked very different without <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/19/north-by-northwest-hitchcock-cary-grant-film-review\" title=\"\">North By Northwest</a></em>. The famous crop-duster scene clearly influenced the helicopter attack in <em>From Russia With Love</em> \u2013 and Eva Marie Saint\u2019s role as the villain\u2019s girlfriend who defects to side with Grant prefigures Pussy Galore from <em>Goldfinger</em> and many another Bond girl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dd131a6f357da8c5911aed73845d3b7bd4a2134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dd131a6f357da8c5911aed73845d3b7bd4a2134/0_0_2170_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madeleine Carroll and Robert donat in The 39 Steps.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat in The 39 Steps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gaumont</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b654ea0ad91322f96f6d856478121c1d8b944635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b654ea0ad91322f96f6d856478121c1d8b944635/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben-Hur\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Before disaster movies, we had disaster theatre</h2> <p>Since the days of the earliest biblical epics, audiences have revelled in seeing temples crumble, worlds shake, ships sink and towers fall. From the fire-and-brimstone biblical epics of early cinema to the boom years of the 1970s in which the US producer Irwin Allen became the \u201cmaster of disaster\u201d, spectacular destruction has been a saleable movie mainstay. Like horror films, disaster movies often work as modern morality tales; reminding us of the natural order of things by terrifying us with visions of chaos and apocalypse. But although the visceral thrills of disaster epics such as James Cameron\u2019s <em>Titanic</em> (one of the most successful movies of all time) may seem unique to cinema, they are in fact rooted in a popular form of Victorian theatre which featured sunken ships, onstage pyrotechnics and drowning extras aplenty.</p> <p>Indeed, one of the earliest surviving fragments of film, shot at the London Hippodrome in 1902, captured the finale of <em>Bandits</em> \u2013 an action-packed theatre show in which a mill explodes into flames and, in the ensuing flood, a bridge collapses and speeding horses plunge into a millpond. This kind of theatrical spectacle was a sensational crowd-pleasing draw, along with re-enactments of famous sea battles and infamous wrecks \u2013 the more realistic the better. You can draw a direct line from these stage productions to such silent-era films as Cecil B DeMille\u2019s <em>The Ten Commandments </em>(1923) and Fred Niblo\u2019s <em>Ben-Hur</em> (1925), the latter having been staged in London and New York in the late 19th century, complete with chariots pulled by live horses, charging on treadmills!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5940bb0355c10c2a25410ddbd988219a933c79cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5940bb0355c10c2a25410ddbd988219a933c79cd/0_67_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet in James Cameron\u2019s Titanic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet in James Cameron\u2019s Titanic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"248fb72dd7e90c8fd18e14f60a0b9961806a901c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/248fb72dd7e90c8fd18e14f60a0b9961806a901c/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scarlett Johansson in The Avengers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scarlett Johansson in The Avengers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The secret of a successful superhero movie is to make one that women will want to see</h2> <p>Comic-book-derived superhero films are <em>the</em> reigning genre of spectacular cinema. But decades-old Marvel or DC properties can\u2019t click as big-screen franchises unless they can manage crossover appeal beyond 13-year-old male comics fans. This core constituency might be vocal online about whether Spider-Man\u2019s webs should squirt from wrist-gadgets or be organic secretions, but there aren\u2019t enough of them to record box-office numbers in the billions. As far back as <em>Superman</em> (1978), film-makers have balanced super-heroics with elements calculated to appeal to female viewers \u2013 casting male eye-candy leads from Christopher Reeve and Chris Hemsworth to Chadwick Boseman and Jason Momoa in costumes every bit as objectifying as a Bond girl\u2019s negligee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81aeaf968026ddfc2fc7a4d1ab634aba5622a60b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81aeaf968026ddfc2fc7a4d1ab634aba5622a60b/0_39_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Keaton in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman Returns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Keaton in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman Returns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They\u2019ve also baked romcom (or soap opera) elements into most broad-appeal super-sagas, from the 1940s-style newsroom banter between Reeve\u2019s Clark Kent and Margot Kidder\u2019s Lois Lane, through the kinkier 30 Shades of Black Leather sparks between Michael Keaton\u2019s Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s Catwoman, to the sweet teen romances that all three big-screen incarnations of Peter Parker have with appealing, distinctive relatable female leads (Kirsten Dunst, Emma Stone, Zendaya). <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights\" title=\"\">Avengers: Endgame </a></em>features a huge battle in the climax, but sent audiences home with an unashamed (if bittersweet) romantic happy ending.</p> <p>For a perfect example of not understanding the rules, consider Zack Snyder\u2019s run of DC films \u2013 <em>Man of Steel</em>, <em>Batman v Superman</em>, <em>Justice League</em> \u2013 which drown in earnest, fan-servicing bombast, but flare into life only when Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman forces her way on screen and demands attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ab8a86de7484d69c1d4d318c5f366f8c1d03343\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab8a86de7484d69c1d4d318c5f366f8c1d03343/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muppet Christmas Carol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Charles Dickens invented the Christmas movie</h2> <p>There\u2019s a theory, dramatised in the 2017 biopic <em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em>, that Charles Dickens \u2013 inspired perhaps by Prince Albert, who imported many German Yuletide traditions to Victorian Britain \u2013 is more responsible than anyone else for the way we still celebrate Christmas.<em> A Christmas Carol</em>, published in 1843, has been filmed more often than almost any other novel, including modern-dress takes like Hammer\u2019s enormously underrated 1961 <em>Cash on Demand</em> (Peter Cushing\u2019s Scrooge-like bank manager mends his ways after he\u2019s tormented by genial hold-up man Andr\u00e9 Morell) and pantomime charades like <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> (1992). Its storyline, characters and underlying message have seeped into a wealth of apparently unrelated films set over the holidays.</p> <p>If there is such a genre as the Christmas film, then they\u2019re all essentially adaptations of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, in which a despairing, Christmas-hating grouch (or Grinch) suffers amid jollity (the contrast of misery with tinsel and carols is always poignant) and finally comes to appreciate hearth and home (stressed far more often in Christmas films than Christianity \u2013 Santa Claus is a bigger presence than baby Jesus in these movies). Frank Capra\u2019s <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life </em>(1946), in which George Bailey (James Stewart) is visited by an angel rather than three ghosts and (yes) John McTiernan\u2019s <em>Die Hard</em> (1988), in which John McClane (Bruce Willis) literally fights terrorists in order to get his wife Holly (!) home for present\u2011opening and eggnog, both fit the pattern set down by Ebeneezer Scrooge, the spectral visitors, and the happy-despite-all-their-woes Cratchits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cb9d0cec1304965e3ec74af777c4b7bdcf1538f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb9d0cec1304965e3ec74af777c4b7bdcf1538f/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King Kong vs Godzilla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Horror movies only scare if we care</h2> <p>To a casual observer, a horror film just needs the scariest monster imaginable. Fans debate whether Dracula is more evil than Michael Myers (the masked killer from <em>Halloween</em>) or who ought to win in <em>King Kong vs Godzilla </em>(Kong controversially won the 1964 bout on points, but a new version is being made). Studios hire makeup-effects geniuses to transform character actors, stunt men or masses of pixels into supernatural killing machines. But that\u2019s not enough. The job of a horror film is to be frightening, and to be frightened an audience has to enter the world of the movie \u2013 invest emotionally in people who will be (at the very least) seriously inconvenienced when werewolves besiege the ranch or an X from Outer Space eats the police station. The crucial segments of great horror films are the \u201cnormal\u201d scenes that come before the monster attacks \u2013 the rapport between the teenagers in John Carpenter\u2019s <em>Halloween</em> (1978), the dynamics of the struggling family in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s <em>The Host</em> (2006), the all-too-credible escape from the controlling boyfriend who isn\u2019t yet a full-on movie monster at the beginning of the latest reboot of <em>The Invisible Man</em> (2020). Genre aficionado Rob Zombie, who remade <em>Halloween</em> in 2007, is an imaginative film-maker who has never had a mainstream hit because he\u2019s obsessed with monsters who can be merchandised as action figures, but has zero interest in (and, in fact, contempt for) the people they kill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3e54112748c229835d64f430aff95c5c75fa0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3e54112748c229835d64f430aff95c5c75fa0b/0_128_2745_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Carpenter\u2019s groundbreaking slasher movie Halloween.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Carpenter\u2019s groundbreaking slasher movie Halloween.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magnum Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5925d343d6d656ede1b865f5af6224b7b874023d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5925d343d6d656ede1b865f5af6224b7b874023d/0_0_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moonlight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>In coming-of-age movies, pop music is a memory</h2> <p>When director Richard Brooks slapped the Bill Haley B-side Rock Around the Clock over the opening credits of <em>Blackboard Jungle</em> (1955) to give his film a contemporary edge, the result was incendiary.

      "bodyText": "Despite the title, there\u2019s no \u201csecret\u201d to Secrets of Cinema, a new three-part BBC4 series of which begins this week. Instead the programme is about the things we recognise, but perhaps haven\u2019t acknowledged, in cinema; the recurrent stories, themes and tropes that underlie the movies we love. From the outset, Kim Newman\u2019s involvement as lead writer on Secrets of Cinema was crucial. His knowledge of movies is encyclopaedic. I met him when I was first working as a film critic in London in the 1980s, and we have a shared interest in narrative \u2013 in the way movies tell stories. Along with director Nick Freand Jones, producer John Das and archivist Jane Long, we\u2019d sit in Newman\u2019s London flat brainstorming each programme, and the scripts came out of the notes of those fantastically enjoyable meetings. I think it was that sense of excitement that spurred the positive response to the first series, which covered romcoms, heist movies, sci-fi, horror and coming-of-age pictures. Since then we\u2019ve made three one-off specials, and now the new series, which covers superheroes, British history and spies. Here\u2019s some of our favourite \u201csecrets\u201d, culled from those programmes\u2026 MK Monster movies can be romcoms too Film genres are slippery, with cross-pollination and mutation the order of the day. A film can look like one thing from the outside \u2013 be it a drama, thriller, horror or comedy \u2013 but delve beneath the surface and you\u2019ll find a rich cocktail of movie-genre DNA. Take The Shape of Water, which won the Oscar for best picture in 2018. On the surface, it looks like a science-fiction/horror hybrid in the style of Creature from the Black Lagoon \u2013 the 3D monster-movie from 1954. Yet The Shape of Water also features a musical fantasy sequence, inspired by the monochrome designs and dances of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film Follow the Fleet (1936). And with its central tale of a love affair between a woman and what it basically a merman, it bears an uncanny similarity to Ron Howard\u2019s Splash (1984), a classic romcom posing as a fairytale fantasy. You can find the romcom gene in a host of movie genres, from Bollywood musical melodramas to Hollywood superhero spectaculars (see below). Japanese director Takashi Miike\u2019s Audition (1999), adapted from the novel by Ryu Murakami, starts out like an off-kilter romcom before mutating into a terrifying symphony of pain and piano wire. As for David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 remake of the 1958 shocker The Fly, its plot is essentially a twisted variation on an old romcom favourite: boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy has accident with a teleporter and splices himself with an insect before getting girl to shoot him in the head. Ah, sweet! How to win an Oscar The most often repeated canard about the Oscars is that the easiest path to an acting statuette is to play a character with mental health issues (see Tropic Thunder). Best-picture winners focusing on mental-health issues include The Lost Weekend, Rain Man, Forrest Gump and A Beautiful Mind. Even One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and The Silence of the Lambs, which won several awards (including gongs for both leading actors), are about patients under psychiatric care. This year, Joaquin Phoenix took best actor for Joker, playing a supervillain with a range of complexes and compulsions. But Oscar also loves British royalty, all the way back to Charles Laughton\u2019s Henry VIII, with crowned-head awards on the shelves of Helen Mirren (The Queen), Judi Dench (Shakespeare in Love), Katharine Hepburn (The Lion in Winter) and more. The glow of privilege even falls upon common prime ministers, with George Arliss, Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman taking top acting honours as Disraeli, Thatcher and Churchill respectively. Thus, the most obvious Oscar lock-in in cinema history was Colin Firth in The King\u2019s Speech, playing a royal underdog struggling against hidebound courtiers (award-winning screen royals all have to be rebellious) while simultaneously overcoming a handicap (his stutter). Firth had the statuette on his mantelpiece from the first time he opened the script \u2013 it\u2019s a wonder the other nominees even bothered to show up. British history is best seen from a distance History is the quintessential British film genre. America may have the great outdoors for westerns and road movies, and teeming cities for cop and crime sagas. But Britain has seen off the Romans, been ruled by Tudors and Stuarts, built and then lost an empire, and fought all the way through two world wars. Unsurprisingly, British history films have proved a highly exportable film commodity \u2013 yet it\u2019s notable that many of the best movies in this genre were made by film-makers from other countries. The first British talkie to make significant inroads into the American market was The Private Life of Henry VIII in 1933. Charles Laughton won a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of the gluttonous monarch, famously tearing into chicken with his bare hands, and running through wives the way he ran through numerous multi-course feasts. Fast forward to 2019, and Olivia Colman won a best actress Oscar for her portrayal of the emotionally damaged Queen Anne in The Favourite. Both of these films (which are fondly imagined as very \u201cBritish\u201d triumphs) had \u201cforeign\u201d directors; the Hungarian Alexander Korda and the Greek Yorgos Lanthimos respectively. Both also play fast and loose with history (as does everything from Hammer\u2019s oft-forgotten 1967 romp The Viking Queen, which is actually set in Roman times, to Mel Gibson\u2019s 1996 best picture winner Braveheart, an American production, set in Scotland, shot in Ireland, directed by and starring an Irish-American-Australian). Meanwhile, despite its bizarre mashup of glam-rock costumes and 1970s sex comedy tropes, Italian Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s The Canterbury Tales (1972) evoked Chaucer with zest and earthiness, making it one of the few films about medieval Britain that an actual medieval audience might recognise. Perhaps true Britishness \u2013 or at least the version of it that sells to an international audience \u2013 can only really be observed from the outside. Bond movies owe a huge debt to Alfred Hitchcock The spy genre has its roots in such 1920s Fritz Lang movies as the Dr Mabuse series and Spies (1928), which drew on the earlier French thriller serials of Louis Feuillade. But Alfred Hitchcock dominated the origins of the \u201cspy film\u201d with such prewar British thrillers as The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938). A succession of sophisticated Hollywood movies established Hitchcock as the maestro of mistrust and suspense, reaching its apotheosis in North By Northwest (1959) in which Cary Grant\u2019s ad man Roger Thornhill is mistaken for a government agent. Hitchcock\u2019s influence on the look and feel of the action is critical; Sean Connery said that the early Bond films would have looked very different without North By Northwest. The famous crop-duster scene clearly influenced the helicopter attack in From Russia With Love \u2013 and Eva Marie Saint\u2019s role as the villain\u2019s girlfriend who defects to side with Grant prefigures Pussy Galore from Goldfinger and many another Bond girl. Before disaster movies, we had disaster theatre Since the days of the earliest biblical epics, audiences have revelled in seeing temples crumble, worlds shake, ships sink and towers fall. From the fire-and-brimstone biblical epics of early cinema to the boom years of the 1970s in which the US producer Irwin Allen became the \u201cmaster of disaster\u201d, spectacular destruction has been a saleable movie mainstay. Like horror films, disaster movies often work as modern morality tales; reminding us of the natural order of things by terrifying us with visions of chaos and apocalypse. But although the visceral thrills of disaster epics such as James Cameron\u2019s Titanic (one of the most successful movies of all time) may seem unique to cinema, they are in fact rooted in a popular form of Victorian theatre which featured sunken ships, onstage pyrotechnics and drowning extras aplenty. Indeed, one of the earliest surviving fragments of film, shot at the London Hippodrome in 1902, captured the finale of Bandits \u2013 an action-packed theatre show in which a mill explodes into flames and, in the ensuing flood, a bridge collapses and speeding horses plunge into a millpond. This kind of theatrical spectacle was a sensational crowd-pleasing draw, along with re-enactments of famous sea battles and infamous wrecks \u2013 the more realistic the better. You can draw a direct line from these stage productions to such silent-era films as Cecil B DeMille\u2019s The Ten Commandments (1923) and Fred Niblo\u2019s Ben-Hur (1925), the latter having been staged in London and New York in the late 19th century, complete with chariots pulled by live horses, charging on treadmills! The secret of a successful superhero movie is to make one that women will want to see Comic-book-derived superhero films are the reigning genre of spectacular cinema. But decades-old Marvel or DC properties can\u2019t click as big-screen franchises unless they can manage crossover appeal beyond 13-year-old male comics fans. This core constituency might be vocal online about whether Spider-Man\u2019s webs should squirt from wrist-gadgets or be organic secretions, but there aren\u2019t enough of them to record box-office numbers in the billions. As far back as Superman (1978), film-makers have balanced super-heroics with elements calculated to appeal to female viewers \u2013 casting male eye-candy leads from Christopher Reeve and Chris Hemsworth to Chadwick Boseman and Jason Momoa in costumes every bit as objectifying as a Bond girl\u2019s negligee. They\u2019ve also baked romcom (or soap opera) elements into most broad-appeal super-sagas, from the 1940s-style newsroom banter between Reeve\u2019s Clark Kent and Margot Kidder\u2019s Lois Lane, through the kinkier 30 Shades of Black Leather sparks between Michael Keaton\u2019s Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s Catwoman, to the sweet teen romances that all three big-screen incarnations of Peter Parker have with appealing, distinctive relatable female leads (Kirsten Dunst, Emma Stone, Zendaya). Avengers: Endgame features a huge battle in the climax, but sent audiences home with an unashamed (if bittersweet) romantic happy ending. For a perfect example of not understanding the rules, consider Zack Snyder\u2019s run of DC films \u2013 Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Justice League \u2013 which drown in earnest, fan-servicing bombast, but flare into life only when Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman forces her way on screen and demands attention. Charles Dickens invented the Christmas movie There\u2019s a theory, dramatised in the 2017 biopic The Man Who Invented Christmas, that Charles Dickens \u2013 inspired perhaps by Prince Albert, who imported many German Yuletide traditions to Victorian Britain \u2013 is more responsible than anyone else for the way we still celebrate Christmas. A Christmas Carol, published in 1843, has been filmed more often than almost any other novel, including modern-dress takes like Hammer\u2019s enormously underrated 1961 Cash on Demand (Peter Cushing\u2019s Scrooge-like bank manager mends his ways after he\u2019s tormented by genial hold-up man Andr\u00e9 Morell) and pantomime charades like The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). Its storyline, characters and underlying message have seeped into a wealth of apparently unrelated films set over the holidays. If there is such a genre as the Christmas film, then they\u2019re all essentially adaptations of A Christmas Carol, in which a despairing, Christmas-hating grouch (or Grinch) suffers amid jollity (the contrast of misery with tinsel and carols is always poignant) and finally comes to appreciate hearth and home (stressed far more often in Christmas films than Christianity \u2013 Santa Claus is a bigger presence than baby Jesus in these movies). Frank Capra\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (1946), in which George Bailey (James Stewart) is visited by an angel rather than three ghosts and (yes) John McTiernan\u2019s Die Hard (1988), in which John McClane (Bruce Willis) literally fights terrorists in order to get his wife Holly (!) home for present\u2011opening and eggnog, both fit the pattern set down by Ebeneezer Scrooge, the spectral visitors, and the happy-despite-all-their-woes Cratchits. Horror movies only scare if we care To a casual observer, a horror film just needs the scariest monster imaginable. Fans debate whether Dracula is more evil than Michael Myers (the masked killer from Halloween) or who ought to win in King Kong vs Godzilla (Kong controversially won the 1964 bout on points, but a new version is being made). Studios hire makeup-effects geniuses to transform character actors, stunt men or masses of pixels into supernatural killing machines. But that\u2019s not enough. The job of a horror film is to be frightening, and to be frightened an audience has to enter the world of the movie \u2013 invest emotionally in people who will be (at the very least) seriously inconvenienced when werewolves besiege the ranch or an X from Outer Space eats the police station. The crucial segments of great horror films are the \u201cnormal\u201d scenes that come before the monster attacks \u2013 the rapport between the teenagers in John Carpenter\u2019s Halloween (1978), the dynamics of the struggling family in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s The Host (2006), the all-too-credible escape from the controlling boyfriend who isn\u2019t yet a full-on movie monster at the beginning of the latest reboot of The Invisible Man (2020). Genre aficionado Rob Zombie, who remade Halloween in 2007, is an imaginative film-maker who has never had a mainstream hit because he\u2019s obsessed with monsters who can be merchandised as action figures, but has zero interest in (and, in fact, contempt for) the people they kill. In coming-of-age movies, pop music is a memory When director Richard Brooks slapped the Bill Haley B-side Rock Around the Clock over the opening credits of Blackboard Jungle (1955) to give his film a contemporary edge, the result was incendiary. Teen audiences were reported to be dancing in the aisles and even slashing cinema seats, overcome by the excitement of hearing such up-to-the-minute sounds blaring out of the large speakers of their local cinemas. Yet by the time that same song reappeared \u2013 again over the opening credits \u2013 in George Lucas\u2019s coming-of-age classic American Graffiti (1973), it had entirely lost its element of edgy threat. Instead, it had become an integral part of a nostalgic patchwork of jukebox hits used to evoke a lost age of innocence \u2013 a musical time-machine transporting the viewer back to a bygone era. While pop music is still used to lend a cutting edge to some teen-oriented releases, its main function in contemporary coming-of-age movies is more likely to have a retrospective edge. Think about the 2017 best picture winner Moonlight: in one of the film\u2019s most memorable scenes, director Barry Jenkins very specifically places Barbara Lewis\u2019s melancholy hit Hello Stranger on a diner jukebox in a scene that could have come straight out of American Graffiti. Through the sound of that song, our protagonists are returned to their younger selves, rekindling the love they had before adulthood changed everything. As film producer Steve Woolley once observed: \u201cPop music in movies is like a knife \u2013 you twist it and nostalgia comes pouring out.\u201d In a heist movie, after the meticulously worked-out plan is put into action, there has to be a hiccup at the end of the second act... This also works for putting-on-a-show musicals, men-on-a-mission war films and losers-turn-it-around movies \u2013 suggesting a mythic template underlies apparently disparate genres. The pleasure of these stories is that a problem is posed \u2013 a bank that can\u2019t be robbed, a jewel behind the most elaborate security system in the world, a casino run by gangsters who\u2019ll kill anyone who tries to rob them \u2013 that can only be solved by a range of specialists who might not naturally work together. A key scene \u2013 paralleled by the first rehearsal, mission briefing or locker room strategising in the related genres \u2013 has the master planner (producer, commanding officer, coach) explain on a blackboard, or using a model, exactly how the trick will be pulled off. As the military maxim has it, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. At a crucial point, usually toward the end of the second act, a random factor has to be thrown-in \u2013 a changed password, an unexpected double-cross, a star who breaks her ankle so an understudy has to step up \u2013 forcing our heroes to ditch some element of their meticulous pre-planning and just wing it. Heist movies sub-divide into breezy romps and gritty noirs. In the former, Danny Ocean or some similar suave modern-day Robin Hood improvises his way out of trouble and dances off with the loot. In the latter, thieves fall out, or deadly fate gets in the way, and the joke\u2019s on the dead guys who dreamed they could get away with it.

      "body": "<p>Briefly there was the possibility England\u2019s cricketers may provide a semblance of normality given Sri Lanka has so far managed to avoid having many coronavirus cases. In such extraordinary times there just might have been the reassurance of waking up in the morning to news of an England batting collapse on foreign soil and everyone could conclude that all was well with the world. Life was going on as usual. But on Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cricket bowed to the inevitable</a>.</p> <p>Covid-19 has caused an upheaval to the schedules in a manner way beyond anything the terrorists have ever managed. England, following the lead of their rugby team at the height of the troubles in Ireland (\u201cWe may not be very good but at least we turn up,\u201d said the captain, John Pullin, at the post-match dinner in Dublin in 1972 after England had been soundly beaten), have often brazened it out when tours have been under threat. In India in 1984\u201185 they stayed on despite the civil unrest following the assassination of Indira Gandhi; they travelled \u2013 well, most of them did \u2013 to India in 2001 and 2008 when there were security concerns, and also to Bangladesh in 2016.</p> <p>But the current threat is beyond the realm of Reg Dickson, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s cheerfully ubiquitous security officer. Like all of us the players must have been concerned they were now in uncharted territory. Sri Lanka is almost virus-free but the yearning to be alongside one\u2019s family in such uncertain times is easy to understand. Moreover, the notion of playing in front of empty stadiums (even though that already happens too often in Test cricket, especially when England are not involved) is unpalatable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/joe-root-says-england-players-minds-were-elsewhere-over-coronavirus\">Joe Root says England players\u2019 minds were elsewhere over coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are all losers here. Sri Lanka is a wonderful place to tour and in different circumstances there would have been thousands of England supporters there to enjoy the cricket and add to the atmosphere. Among the players, Matt Parkinson probably deserves more sympathy than any of the others. On his third tour of the winter there was just a chance that he would make his Test debut in Galle, where the ball always turns. But will there ever be another chance for him? Not next summer for a variety of reasons; just possibly next winter in India or indeed in Sri Lanka if the postponed tour is somehow rescheduled in between England\u2019s already taxing commitments. Will he have to bounce grandchildren on his knee and explain to them wistfully the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for his career?</p> <p>Like every other sphere of life the immediate future of the game is shrouded with uncertainty, which may have been reflected by the words of Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB. \u201cOur main priorities are to ensure we scope out the landscape for financial, logistical and scheduling implications.\u201d</p> <p>That landscape is starting to look barren. The series against West Indies, due to begin at the Oval on 4 June, must be in deep jeopardy. I have heard the neat suggestion that the series could be played in the Caribbean instead (as I write Barbados has no cases of the virus and Antigua one) but why would any nation there welcome an influx of cricketers and supporters from the UK in the next few months? It is not going to happen, especially since on Saturday when the West Indies Board, acting on the advice of their medical advisory committee, suspended all its tournaments and face-to-face group meetings from Monday onwards for a minimum of 30 days. They are determined to act \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\">England cricket tour of Sri Lanka called off due to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The series of white-ball fixtures against Australia must also be in doubt. These matches produce vital income, especially when the ECB\u2019s emergency budget has been diminished. The second half of the summer should contain a three-Test series against Pakistan beginning on 30 July, followed by more one-day matches. The landscape in August and September also takes some scoping out.</p> <p>The uncertainty applies to domestic cricket as well. The T20 Blast, the most reliable source of revenue for the counties, is due to start on 29 May, when we are told that the virus is likely to be at its peak. Perhaps that competition will be shunted to the end of the season. Meanwhile, the Hundred is scheduled to begin on 18 July. There may be cynics out there who think I would welcome disruption to the Hundred, but this is not the case.

      "bodyText": "Briefly there was the possibility England\u2019s cricketers may provide a semblance of normality given Sri Lanka has so far managed to avoid having many coronavirus cases. In such extraordinary times there just might have been the reassurance of waking up in the morning to news of an England batting collapse on foreign soil and everyone could conclude that all was well with the world. Life was going on as usual. But on Friday cricket bowed to the inevitable. Covid-19 has caused an upheaval to the schedules in a manner way beyond anything the terrorists have ever managed. England, following the lead of their rugby team at the height of the troubles in Ireland (\u201cWe may not be very good but at least we turn up,\u201d said the captain, John Pullin, at the post-match dinner in Dublin in 1972 after England had been soundly beaten), have often brazened it out when tours have been under threat. In India in 1984\u201185 they stayed on despite the civil unrest following the assassination of Indira Gandhi; they travelled \u2013 well, most of them did \u2013 to India in 2001 and 2008 when there were security concerns, and also to Bangladesh in 2016. But the current threat is beyond the realm of Reg Dickson, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s cheerfully ubiquitous security officer. Like all of us the players must have been concerned they were now in uncharted territory. Sri Lanka is almost virus-free but the yearning to be alongside one\u2019s family in such uncertain times is easy to understand. Moreover, the notion of playing in front of empty stadiums (even though that already happens too often in Test cricket, especially when England are not involved) is unpalatable. We are all losers here. Sri Lanka is a wonderful place to tour and in different circumstances there would have been thousands of England supporters there to enjoy the cricket and add to the atmosphere. Among the players, Matt Parkinson probably deserves more sympathy than any of the others. On his third tour of the winter there was just a chance that he would make his Test debut in Galle, where the ball always turns. But will there ever be another chance for him? Not next summer for a variety of reasons; just possibly next winter in India or indeed in Sri Lanka if the postponed tour is somehow rescheduled in between England\u2019s already taxing commitments. Will he have to bounce grandchildren on his knee and explain to them wistfully the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for his career? Like every other sphere of life the immediate future of the game is shrouded with uncertainty, which may have been reflected by the words of Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB. \u201cOur main priorities are to ensure we scope out the landscape for financial, logistical and scheduling implications.\u201d That landscape is starting to look barren. The series against West Indies, due to begin at the Oval on 4 June, must be in deep jeopardy. I have heard the neat suggestion that the series could be played in the Caribbean instead (as I write Barbados has no cases of the virus and Antigua one) but why would any nation there welcome an influx of cricketers and supporters from the UK in the next few months? It is not going to happen, especially since on Saturday when the West Indies Board, acting on the advice of their medical advisory committee, suspended all its tournaments and face-to-face group meetings from Monday onwards for a minimum of 30 days. They are determined to act \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d. The series of white-ball fixtures against Australia must also be in doubt. These matches produce vital income, especially when the ECB\u2019s emergency budget has been diminished. The second half of the summer should contain a three-Test series against Pakistan beginning on 30 July, followed by more one-day matches. The landscape in August and September also takes some scoping out. The uncertainty applies to domestic cricket as well. The T20 Blast, the most reliable source of revenue for the counties, is due to start on 29 May, when we are told that the virus is likely to be at its peak. Perhaps that competition will be shunted to the end of the season. Meanwhile, the Hundred is scheduled to begin on 18 July. There may be cynics out there who think I would welcome disruption to the Hundred, but this is not the case. Instead, my hunch is that the advocates of the Hundred \u2013 like some ardent Brexiters \u2013 will be quick to point out: \u201cIt would have been a great success but for the virus.\u201d Alternatively, if the Hundred is able to take place, sports fans might then be so desperate for some live action on their screens after being denied for so long that they might tune in in their millions. We are in straw\u2011clutching territory. What of the championship? There is an argument, though it is unlikely to prevail, that a four-day match at the majority of venues would allow the spectators to self-isolate in the stands without any difficulty, although this would not be the case at Scarborough and occasionally at Taunton or Chelmsford, small grounds that often attract relatively large crowds. Nor would a championship match require too many resources that might be urgently needed elsewhere to oversee the event.

      "body": "<p>My entertainment options this week were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/the-hunt-movie-behind-elites-v-deplorables-thriller\">a movie</a> in which \u201cliberal elites\u201d hunt down and murder \u201cdeplorables\u201d for sport \u2013 deaths that are ultra gory and played for laughs \u2013 and a Hulu documentary in which Hillary Clinton explains with a chuckle and a smile why the policies supported by her 2016 opponent, Bernie Sanders \u2013 policies like universal healthcare and prison reform, which would help countless Americans \u2013 are just not \u201cdoable\u201d. In other words, essentially the same thing.</p> <p>The Hunt was supposed to be released last fall, but it was put on hold after some people wondered if a movie about political polarity and divisiveness in contemporary society, in which a bunch of poor people die violently was really going to be a good idea. Released now, the controversy is its main selling point. And \u2013 since we are in the beginning stages of a pandemic for which the United States is not remotely prepared and in which the uninsured, elderly, and poor are much more likely to die \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say the timing creates a certain tone.</p> <p>The co-writer and producer Damon Lindelof \u2013 who recently read the legendary anti-fascist comic Watchmen and thought, huh, okay, but <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/dr-manhattan-cop-watchmen-frantz-fanon/\">what if instead we made the cops the heroes</a>? \u2013 has created a world where a group of rich, NPR-listening liberals, who bicker about gendered language and whether \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d is the more acceptable term, drug, abduct, and murder Trump voters for sport. One of the Trump voters actually isn\u2019t a Trump voter but is brought there by mistake, and not being a redneck hillbilly idiot, she manages to fight back. I think that\u2019s a metaphor. For something.</p> <p>Ultimately the film wants to pretend to be a commentary on cancel culture and our new culture wars. It turns out the whole plan for liberal elites to hunt deplorables becomes a reality because deplorables can\u2019t take a joke about liberal elites hunting deplorables. The slapstick deaths are supposed to indicate that hey, we\u2019re just playing around here, rather than show a callous disregard for human life on the part of the film-makers. And if you don\u2019t find it funny to watch a woman impaled on spikes or a man blown up on a landmine or a woman choking to death after she\u2019s poisoned, you must be one of those humorless cancel culture freaks who need to learn to take a joke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/the-hunt-movie-behind-elites-v-deplorables-thriller\">'It's a fun movie, I promise': behind the elites v 'deplorables' thriller The Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But of course if you\u2019re from and of the coasts it\u2019s easy to believe these new culture wars are just about a difference of opinion about gun control or abortion and not about the hopelessness and loss of meaning and instability causing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/06/opinion/working-class-death-rate.html\">the deaths of despair</a> killing white middle Americans without college degrees through suicide and addiction. It\u2019s similar to how one segment of the population will remember the culture wars of the 1990s as a discussion about whether a crucifix of Jesus Christ submerged in urine should be considered art, and not about whether the thousands of gay people, IV drug users, hemophiliacs, and others deemed ultimately disposable by the government and society should have been allowed to die from Aids. Or as a debate about whether children should be exposed to vulgarity in music, and not about whether black people or people in poor neighborhoods should be murdered, brutalized, and harassed by the police forces that claim to protect them.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear that anyone involved with this film has ever even been to the south. The star, Betty Gilpin, plays a working-class woman named Crystal who spends the entirety of the film holding her jaw as if she is trying not to let any spit from the chewing tobacco dribble out, and yet at no time does she partake in chewing tobacco. It\u2019s like she saw a picture of someone once and thought, Oh, that must be how they do it down there, but no one explained to her it\u2019s not just that all southerners have a severe underbite. But then no one involved in the production thought it might be weird for the action of the film to play out in Croatia, a country still dealing with the aftermath of its own \u2026 uh, let\u2019s call it political polarity and divisiveness, I guess.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the millionaires who endorsed billionaire Mike Bloomberg in the Democratic primaries will watch this movie on their private jets and have a good chuckle at the depiction of clueless and out-of-touch elites heading to Croatia on their private plane with a cargo full of white trash. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so us! I also enjoy a little caviar snack while on my way to my private manor in the Balkans.\u201d And then they\u2019ll go back to deciding which underprivileged group should receive their charity this month \u2013 instead of just paying their taxes, which could fund an adequate public healthcare system that would keep people from having to beg online to afford chemotherapy.</p> <p>Cinemas across the US are currently closing because of coronavirus; perhaps only the elites who can afford private screenings of The Hunt in their palatial estates will be able to see it. In the meantime, the rest of us are about to go on quarantine lockdown, forced to sustain ourselves on whatever mediocre bilge Netflix has put out this week. I think that\u2019s a metaphor. For something.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast. She is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "My entertainment options this week were a movie in which \u201cliberal elites\u201d hunt down and murder \u201cdeplorables\u201d for sport \u2013 deaths that are ultra gory and played for laughs \u2013 and a Hulu documentary in which Hillary Clinton explains with a chuckle and a smile why the policies supported by her 2016 opponent, Bernie Sanders \u2013 policies like universal healthcare and prison reform, which would help countless Americans \u2013 are just not \u201cdoable\u201d. In other words, essentially the same thing. The Hunt was supposed to be released last fall, but it was put on hold after some people wondered if a movie about political polarity and divisiveness in contemporary society, in which a bunch of poor people die violently was really going to be a good idea. Released now, the controversy is its main selling point. And \u2013 since we are in the beginning stages of a pandemic for which the United States is not remotely prepared and in which the uninsured, elderly, and poor are much more likely to die \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say the timing creates a certain tone. The co-writer and producer Damon Lindelof \u2013 who recently read the legendary anti-fascist comic Watchmen and thought, huh, okay, but what if instead we made the cops the heroes? \u2013 has created a world where a group of rich, NPR-listening liberals, who bicker about gendered language and whether \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d is the more acceptable term, drug, abduct, and murder Trump voters for sport. One of the Trump voters actually isn\u2019t a Trump voter but is brought there by mistake, and not being a redneck hillbilly idiot, she manages to fight back. I think that\u2019s a metaphor. For something. Ultimately the film wants to pretend to be a commentary on cancel culture and our new culture wars. It turns out the whole plan for liberal elites to hunt deplorables becomes a reality because deplorables can\u2019t take a joke about liberal elites hunting deplorables. The slapstick deaths are supposed to indicate that hey, we\u2019re just playing around here, rather than show a callous disregard for human life on the part of the film-makers. And if you don\u2019t find it funny to watch a woman impaled on spikes or a man blown up on a landmine or a woman choking to death after she\u2019s poisoned, you must be one of those humorless cancel culture freaks who need to learn to take a joke. But of course if you\u2019re from and of the coasts it\u2019s easy to believe these new culture wars are just about a difference of opinion about gun control or abortion and not about the hopelessness and loss of meaning and instability causing the deaths of despair killing white middle Americans without college degrees through suicide and addiction. It\u2019s similar to how one segment of the population will remember the culture wars of the 1990s as a discussion about whether a crucifix of Jesus Christ submerged in urine should be considered art, and not about whether the thousands of gay people, IV drug users, hemophiliacs, and others deemed ultimately disposable by the government and society should have been allowed to die from Aids. Or as a debate about whether children should be exposed to vulgarity in music, and not about whether black people or people in poor neighborhoods should be murdered, brutalized, and harassed by the police forces that claim to protect them. It\u2019s not clear that anyone involved with this film has ever even been to the south. The star, Betty Gilpin, plays a working-class woman named Crystal who spends the entirety of the film holding her jaw as if she is trying not to let any spit from the chewing tobacco dribble out, and yet at no time does she partake in chewing tobacco. It\u2019s like she saw a picture of someone once and thought, Oh, that must be how they do it down there, but no one explained to her it\u2019s not just that all southerners have a severe underbite. But then no one involved in the production thought it might be weird for the action of the film to play out in Croatia, a country still dealing with the aftermath of its own \u2026 uh, let\u2019s call it political polarity and divisiveness, I guess. I\u2019m sure the millionaires who endorsed billionaire Mike Bloomberg in the Democratic primaries will watch this movie on their private jets and have a good chuckle at the depiction of clueless and out-of-touch elites heading to Croatia on their private plane with a cargo full of white trash. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so us! I also enjoy a little caviar snack while on my way to my private manor in the Balkans.\u201d And then they\u2019ll go back to deciding which underprivileged group should receive their charity this month \u2013 instead of just paying their taxes, which could fund an adequate public healthcare system that would keep people from having to beg online to afford chemotherapy. Cinemas across the US are currently closing because of coronavirus; perhaps only the elites who can afford private screenings of The Hunt in their palatial estates will be able to see it. In the meantime, the rest of us are about to go on quarantine lockdown, forced to sustain ourselves on whatever mediocre bilge Netflix has put out this week. I think that\u2019s a metaphor.

      "body": "<p>The Mestalla in Valencia has to be one of the most intimidating stadiums in the world for visiting football teams. Its stands, which have the pitch of a ski jump, allow home fans to create a claustrophobic wall of noise. The rabid screams of 55,000 Valencians, bouncing off the concrete foundations, have made it something of a fortress for the local team and a popular venue for Spain\u2019s home fixtures. A while back, I watched Valencia play Barcelona at the Mestalla, and there was a febrile menace in the air that night unlike any other I have experienced in a football ground.</p> <p>The vibe at the Mestalla was rather different last week, when Valencia hosted Atalanta in the second leg of the sides\u2019 Champions League last-16 tie. If ever a team needed a boost from their 12th man, their fans, it was now: Valencia had to make up a 4-1 deficit from the first leg. But, because of the coronavirus outbreak, the fixture was played behind closed doors. Watching the match on TV was eerie: you could hear the players shouting for the ball or celebrating or appealing for a foul. At times you had to remind yourself that it wasn\u2019t a training exercise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/10/valencia-atalanta-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">Josip Ilicic scores four as Atalanta beat Valencia to continue European dream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The match became even more listless after just 90 seconds, when Atalanta were awarded a penalty.

The Champions League and Europa League have also been suspended. What happens next is decidedly murky.

And there might well be more surreal spectacles like the one that played out between Valencia and Atalanta.</p> <p>If more matches do have to be played in empty stadiums without fans, can we expect it to affect the results? Will Liverpool suddenly be less formidable without the Kop behind them? Home advantage is one of the immutable facts of sport, especially football \u2013 what happens when you remove the crowd from the equation?</p> <p>Playing sport behind closed doors has traditionally been used as a punishment for the home team. In football, it dates back to the early 1980s, when English clubs were feared across Europe for their tenacity on the field and their brutality off it. West Ham were the first team on the receiving end. In September 1980, the Hammers played Castilla, essentially Real Madrid\u2019s feeder team, at the Bernab\u00e9u in the European Cup Winners Cup. When they lost 3-1 in the first leg \u2013 perhaps because they were humiliated by losing to a second\u2011string outfit, or maybe because they just fancied a punch-up \u2013 the West Ham supporters went on the rampage. Dozens were ejected from the stadium; outside, one was run over by a bus and died.</p> <p>Uefa determined that the second leg should be played in an empty Upton Park. In fact, the official attendance was 262, when you took players, staff, ball kids and media into account. But the atmosphere was unquestionably odd: the West Ham goalkeeper Phil Parkes recalled afterwards that he had to tune out commentary on the game from a radio behind the goal. It became known as \u201cthe ghost match\u201d.</p> <p>In one sense, West Ham were punished for the riot in Madrid: the club would have expected a full house of 36,000 for the second leg, so it made a hefty dent in their income. But what about on the pitch? Did West Ham suffer from not having the Upton Park faithful roaring them on?</p> <p>Not especially. Back in London, West Ham tied the match 3-1 in 90 minutes; in extra time they scored two more. It was a similar story in September 1982, when Aston Villa were made to start their European campaign on a Wednesday afternoon at 2.30pm in front of 187 spectators, as a censure for rioting by their supporters the previous season in Belgium. Again, it wasn\u2019t much of a punishment: Villa beat Besiktas 3-1. Internazionale had to play three Champions League home games behind closed doors in 2005, and they won all three.</p> <p>So we\u2019re clear: it\u2019s not that home clubs usually perform better when forced to play behind closed doors. That\u2019s probably not the case, and there\u2019s not enough statistical evidence to confirm or deny it.

      "bodyText": "The Mestalla in Valencia has to be one of the most intimidating stadiums in the world for visiting football teams. Its stands, which have the pitch of a ski jump, allow home fans to create a claustrophobic wall of noise. The rabid screams of 55,000 Valencians, bouncing off the concrete foundations, have made it something of a fortress for the local team and a popular venue for Spain\u2019s home fixtures. A while back, I watched Valencia play Barcelona at the Mestalla, and there was a febrile menace in the air that night unlike any other I have experienced in a football ground. The vibe at the Mestalla was rather different last week, when Valencia hosted Atalanta in the second leg of the sides\u2019 Champions League last-16 tie. If ever a team needed a boost from their 12th man, their fans, it was now: Valencia had to make up a 4-1 deficit from the first leg. But, because of the coronavirus outbreak, the fixture was played behind closed doors. Watching the match on TV was eerie: you could hear the players shouting for the ball or celebrating or appealing for a foul. At times you had to remind yourself that it wasn\u2019t a training exercise. The match became even more listless after just 90 seconds, when Atalanta were awarded a penalty. The Slovenian striker Josip Ilicic buried it and added three more in a 4-3 victory. \u201cFabulous game missed by fans at Mestalla,\u201d Gary Lineker tweeted. \u201cImagine scoring all 4 goals like Ilicic has done with barely a soul in the stadium.\u201d On Friday, it was announced that all elite football in England and Scotland will be postponed until at least April. The Champions League and Europa League have also been suspended. What happens next is decidedly murky. There may be play\u2011offs to decide titles and relegation. Euro 2020 could be delayed. And there might well be more surreal spectacles like the one that played out between Valencia and Atalanta. If more matches do have to be played in empty stadiums without fans, can we expect it to affect the results? Will Liverpool suddenly be less formidable without the Kop behind them? Home advantage is one of the immutable facts of sport, especially football \u2013 what happens when you remove the crowd from the equation? Playing sport behind closed doors has traditionally been used as a punishment for the home team. In football, it dates back to the early 1980s, when English clubs were feared across Europe for their tenacity on the field and their brutality off it. West Ham were the first team on the receiving end. In September 1980, the Hammers played Castilla, essentially Real Madrid\u2019s feeder team, at the Bernab\u00e9u in the European Cup Winners Cup. When they lost 3-1 in the first leg \u2013 perhaps because they were humiliated by losing to a second\u2011string outfit, or maybe because they just fancied a punch-up \u2013 the West Ham supporters went on the rampage. Dozens were ejected from the stadium; outside, one was run over by a bus and died. Uefa determined that the second leg should be played in an empty Upton Park. In fact, the official attendance was 262, when you took players, staff, ball kids and media into account. But the atmosphere was unquestionably odd: the West Ham goalkeeper Phil Parkes recalled afterwards that he had to tune out commentary on the game from a radio behind the goal. It became known as \u201cthe ghost match\u201d. In one sense, West Ham were punished for the riot in Madrid: the club would have expected a full house of 36,000 for the second leg, so it made a hefty dent in their income. But what about on the pitch? Did West Ham suffer from not having the Upton Park faithful roaring them on? Not especially. Back in London, West Ham tied the match 3-1 in 90 minutes; in extra time they scored two more. It was a similar story in September 1982, when Aston Villa were made to start their European campaign on a Wednesday afternoon at 2.30pm in front of 187 spectators, as a censure for rioting by their supporters the previous season in Belgium. Again, it wasn\u2019t much of a punishment: Villa beat Besiktas 3-1. Internazionale had to play three Champions League home games behind closed doors in 2005, and they won all three. So we\u2019re clear: it\u2019s not that home clubs usually perform better when forced to play behind closed doors. That\u2019s probably not the case, and there\u2019s not enough statistical evidence to confirm or deny it. But these matches played without supporters do make you wonder how influential fans in the stadium are to the performance of their beloved team. Research shows home advantage is clearly and definitely a major factor in football. Taken aAcross all teams and all leagues in England, the home team invariably wins around 45% of matches, and draws 25%. Fans might believe this is down to their support but actually the size of the crowd and the intensity of their screaming does not appear to have a significant impact on the result. Where the home crowd can sometimes have a game-changing influence, however, is on the decisions of the referee. A couple of studies have indicated that football officials \u2013 unwittingly, of course \u2013 were wary of making controversial calls against the home team because they suspected, perhaps subliminally, that the crowd would turn on them. In practice, this means fewer yellow cards, more penalties given \u2013 and the louder and more partisan the crowd, the greater the unconscious bias. If some of the key fixtures this season do end up being decided behind closed doors, they will be intriguing to watch (obviously on a screen, not in the stands). Will referees make better decisions? Will the intensity of home players dip without the crowd to gee them up? Or, counter-intuitively, will these players suddenly display a new sense of freedom?

The roofs of the district\u2019s buildings will be filled with greenery or solar panels, which would cover three hectares if put side to side.</p> \n<p>Broekman said he and his collaborators had been inspired by smaller-scale projects in Paris and a 600-home development in Amsterdam\u2019s Gemeente Waterleiding district, but that he believed the scale of the project was unique.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cBy having this car-free area, we can design spaces without the straitjacket rules of the car, and thus focus on essentials for a high-density area, which is the quality of public space, city on eye level, green, biodiversity, climate adaptation and meeting places for social interaction.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kees Diepeveen, the alderman responsible for the city district, known as the Merwedekanaalzone, said Utrecht was rapidly growing and the behaviour of its citizens was changing as quickly.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe have the highest number of shared cars [per capita] in the Netherlands. It is amazing to see how the average household is changing its habits. This especially counts for the younger generations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Merwede, a third of whose land is owned by the municipality with the rest belonging to private entities, follows the example of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/mar/23/freiburg.germany.greenest.city\" title=\"Vauban in Germany\">Vauban in Germany</a>, which is home to more than 5,000 people.</p> \n<p>Residents there must confirm once a year that they do not own a car or otherwise purchase a space in a multistorey car park on the edge of the district. A space was initially provided for every two households, but car ownership has fallen over time, and many of spaces now lie empty.</p>",

For shopping deliveries, and for the removal of rubbish from the new car-free streets, it is expected small electric vehicles will be deployed to trundle from the \u201clogistical roads\u201d to the homes and back. The Merwede district will boast the largest underground heat and cold storage facility in the Netherlands, using water from the Merwedekanaal to cool it. The roofs of the district\u2019s buildings will be filled with greenery or solar panels, which would cover three hectares if put side to side. Broekman said he and his collaborators had been inspired by smaller-scale projects in Paris and a 600-home development in Amsterdam\u2019s Gemeente Waterleiding district, but that he believed the scale of the project was unique. He said: \u201cBy having this car-free area, we can design spaces without the straitjacket rules of the car, and thus focus on essentials for a high-density area, which is the quality of public space, city on eye level, green, biodiversity, climate adaptation and meeting places for social interaction.\u201d Kees Diepeveen, the alderman responsible for the city district, known as the Merwedekanaalzone, said Utrecht was rapidly growing and the behaviour of its citizens was changing as quickly. He said: \u201cWe have the highest number of shared cars [per capita] in the Netherlands. It is amazing to see how the average household is changing its habits. This especially counts for the younger generations.\u201d Merwede, a third of whose land is owned by the municipality with the rest belonging to private entities, follows the example of Vauban in Germany, which is home to more than 5,000 people. Residents there must confirm once a year that they do not own a car or otherwise purchase a space in a multistorey car park on the edge of the district. A space was initially provided for every two households, but car ownership has fallen over time, and many of spaces now lie empty.",

      "body": "<p>In a conflict often called the \u201cforgotten war\u201d, one Yemeni city feels most forgotten of all.</p> <p>\u201cI want the whole world to know about Taiz,\u201d declares Mohammed Saleh al-Qaisi. \u201cI want them to see what Taiz was, and what\u2019s happening now.\u201d We\u2019re sitting on a step on a street buzzing with motorcycles and the tinkle of bicycle bells. A few shops away, young men drinking hot sweet tea cradle rifles in their laps and wave at passersby. Above them, a billboard advertises books from Cambridge University Press and McGraw-Hill.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s third-largest city was once known as its capital of culture. Taizis prided themselves on producing the best-educated people who became the best teachers, lawyers, pilots, you name it. Now it is known as Yemen\u2019s longest-running battlefield, the most heavily bombed by blistering Saudi airstrikes, the deadliest governorate in Yemen\u2019s devastating war. The conflict, which enters its sixth year this month, pits the Houthis aligned to Iran against Yemen\u2019s government backed by a Saudi-led coalition supported by western military powers.</p> <p>And Taiz has had its own combustible mix of infighting among rival groups armed by the coalition, including political Islamists and hardline Salafists comprising gunmen accused of links to al-Qaida.</p> <p>\u201cI know what this city was. I know what I went to school for,\u201d Qaisi says, his eyes watering.</p> <p>Attention to Taiz\u2019s plight has been eclipsed by alarm over the fate of more strategic battlefields, including the contested Red Sea port city of Hodeida. The last major effort to push Yemen away from war in December 2018, in UN-brokered negotiations outside Stockholm, only reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d on the need to talk about Taiz. It didn\u2019t go any further.</p> <p>And adding Taiz to Yemen\u2019s long shopping list has made it even harder. \u201cNow its fate is linked to a much bigger picture in a three-dimensional chess game,\u201d says Peter Salisbury of the International Crisis Group.</p> <p>In recent weeks, after one of the quietest periods in this war, there\u2019s been an upsurge in fighting on key frontlines across Yemen.</p> <p>Taiz is a city split in two, an ugly emblem of the wider conflict tearing a whole country apart. From the top of Jabal Sabir, the city\u2019s towering mountain, inside the hollow pockmarked shell of what was once a prized tourist resort, there\u2019s a dazzling view. A vista that once drew visitors now provides the best vantage point to understand Taiz\u2019s political topography.</p> <p>The frontline slashes through the city from east to west, leaving a visible green and brown scar. Greenery has spread like tentacles across the no man\u2019s land. Beyond this line, about a third of Taiz is in the hands of Houthis who control the heights overlooking the northern edge of the city. The rest is run by the government. Close up, it\u2019s a seam crackling with tension.</p> <p>After securing permission from the head of a neighbourhood committee on the government side, whose members identify themselves as the \u201cresistance\u201d, we descend winding steps, sheltered by dark shadows and stone walls riddled with bullet holes, to a largely deserted lane.</p> <p>\u201cMy family is hiding at home,\u201d one of our escorts, in a Yemeni patterned turban and traditional \u201cfuta\u201d skirt, says as we hang back a bit from the open street. \u201cWhoever goes out gets shot by the Houthis.\u201d</p> <p>Families are caught in the crosshairs of both sides. War bestowed a new title on Taiz: \u201ccity of snipers\u201d.</p> <p>From where we stand, we see how life has been pulled from homes facing the line of fire. Building facades are like mournful faces of black-eyed windows and gaping holes.</p> <p>Another man hurries past. \u201cThere\u2019s only one street between my home and the Houthis,\u201d he says, pointing the other way as he catches his breath. \u201cMy family was so scared they left.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-3902cwVui1f8F15P/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-3902cwVui1f8F15P/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>Beyond this alley, daily life is a battle. All roads in and out of Taiz, except one, are controlled by the Houthis.</p> <p>\u201cWe were invited to cross to the other side for talks but clashes broke out and both sides shot at us,\u201d recalls Abdul Kareen Shaiban with a grimace as he remembers a negotiating effort years ago. An MP who chairs a roads committee, he\u2019s talked many times over many years to both sides.</p> <p>We\u2019re standing on what was once a bustling main road running though Taiz, which connected it to other major cities including the capital Sana\u2019a in the north. A few goats pick their way down the carriageway and a little boy furiously pedals past on his beat-up bicycle. We can see the rusted metal barriers overgrown with shrubbery blocking the road a short distance away. \u201cPeople inside this city have nothing to do with politics or war. They just simply want to live and they need a road,\u201d Shaiban says.</p> <p>\u201cThe siege has made life difficult and deadly,\u201d chimes in Dalia Nasr of another initiative, Taizi Women for Life. She knows the danger \u2013 a sniper\u2019s bullet blinded her in one eye. Her aunt, two brothers and a nephew were killed during clashes.</p> <p>Nasr explains how blocking the roads splits life in two: patients with chronic illnesses are separated from specialised hospitals; students can\u2019t make it to their universities; workers living on the government side can\u2019t reach factories mainly concentrated in the area under Houthi control.</p> <p>Getting to the other side of Taiz used to be a five-minute drive. Now it takes more than five hours.</p> <p>We take this route, which hugs mountains with breathtaking sheer drops, bumps along a dirt track through soaring palm trees and runs through checkpoints manned by rival groups. We weren\u2019t given permission by the Houthi authorities to spend time on the other side.</p> <p>Everyone we meet in Taiz remembers what happened to them as if it was yesterday. \u201cNo one pays attention to us,\u201d says Marwan with palpable anger. We\u2019re standing in the rubble of his home, where 10 relatives died as they slept in an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition. It happened five years ago. The house, and Marwan, are still in pieces.</p> <p>\u201cTo this day we\u2019ve received no explanation from the local authorities or the army or the coalition,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know why they hit a neighbourhood full of civilians.\u201d</p> <p>Airstrikes by the coalition \u2013 often with UK- or US-made bombs \u2013 have caused the most civilian casualties in Taiz, and other battlefields across Yemen, according to figures compiled by the UN and other data sources including Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project).</p> <p>\u201cThe attack was so aggressive it took us six days to find the body parts,\u201d Marwan recalls. \u201cWe looked for them in nearby houses, on the streets and on the roofs.\u201d Eight of his neighbours perished in the same attack.</p> <p>A Yemeni government official accompanying us insists we also visit a home destroyed by the Houthis.</p> <p>We\u2019re greeted by a gaggle of children. A little girl in a red velvet dress, braids sticking out like a Yemeni Pippa Longstocking, starts chattering about the attack that killed her playmate next door. The boy\u2019s mother, Zahra, soon arrives with graphic photographs of that fateful day. Their home is still a mess of shattered windows and walls.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone sold Yemen for their own benefit,\u201d Zahra declares bitterly. \u201cThe Houthis work with Iran, half the resistance works with Saudi Arabia, the other half with the United Arab Emirates.\u201d It\u2019s a lament not just about the main warring parties, but also skirmishes between local forces trained and armed by Arab states in the coalition. Zahra\u2019s story is the story of Yemen\u2019s war. Her youngest son died in the first strike, her older son was later shot dead, a daughter lost an eye and her husband went mad with grief. \u201cThey see this huge crisis happening to us and no one does anything.\u201d</p> <p>When we leave, Zahra hurries after us with freshly baked Yemeni bread \u2013 a reminder, if one was needed, that even this merciless war can\u2019t completely crush a kind and cultured people.</p> <p><em>Lyse Doucet is the BBC\u2019s </em><em>chief </em><em>international </em><em>correspondent and a presenter for BBC World News and BBC World Service</em></p>",

Yemen\u2019s third-largest city was once known as its capital of culture. Taizis prided themselves on producing the best-educated people who became the best teachers, lawyers, pilots, you name it. Now it is known as Yemen\u2019s longest-running battlefield, the most heavily bombed by blistering Saudi airstrikes, the deadliest governorate in Yemen\u2019s devastating war. The conflict, which enters its sixth year this month, pits the Houthis aligned to Iran against Yemen\u2019s government backed by a Saudi-led coalition supported by western military powers. And Taiz has had its own combustible mix of infighting among rival groups armed by the coalition, including political Islamists and hardline Salafists comprising gunmen accused of links to al-Qaida. \u201cI know what this city was. I know what I went to school for,\u201d Qaisi says, his eyes watering. Attention to Taiz\u2019s plight has been eclipsed by alarm over the fate of more strategic battlefields, including the contested Red Sea port city of Hodeida. The last major effort to push Yemen away from war in December 2018, in UN-brokered negotiations outside Stockholm, only reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d on the need to talk about Taiz. It didn\u2019t go any further. And adding Taiz to Yemen\u2019s long shopping list has made it even harder. \u201cNow its fate is linked to a much bigger picture in a three-dimensional chess game,\u201d says Peter Salisbury of the International Crisis Group. In recent weeks, after one of the quietest periods in this war, there\u2019s been an upsurge in fighting on key frontlines across Yemen. Taiz is a city split in two, an ugly emblem of the wider conflict tearing a whole country apart. From the top of Jabal Sabir, the city\u2019s towering mountain, inside the hollow pockmarked shell of what was once a prized tourist resort, there\u2019s a dazzling view. A vista that once drew visitors now provides the best vantage point to understand Taiz\u2019s political topography. The frontline slashes through the city from east to west, leaving a visible green and brown scar. Greenery has spread like tentacles across the no man\u2019s land. Beyond this line, about a third of Taiz is in the hands of Houthis who control the heights overlooking the northern edge of the city. The rest is run by the government. Close up, it\u2019s a seam crackling with tension. After securing permission from the head of a neighbourhood committee on the government side, whose members identify themselves as the \u201cresistance\u201d, we descend winding steps, sheltered by dark shadows and stone walls riddled with bullet holes, to a largely deserted lane. \u201cMy family is hiding at home,\u201d one of our escorts, in a Yemeni patterned turban and traditional \u201cfuta\u201d skirt, says as we hang back a bit from the open street. \u201cWhoever goes out gets shot by the Houthis.\u201d Families are caught in the crosshairs of both sides. War bestowed a new title on Taiz: \u201ccity of snipers\u201d. From where we stand, we see how life has been pulled from homes facing the line of fire. Building facades are like mournful faces of black-eyed windows and gaping holes. Another man hurries past. \u201cThere\u2019s only one street between my home and the Houthis,\u201d he says, pointing the other way as he catches his breath. \u201cMy family was so scared they left.\u201d Beyond this alley, daily life is a battle. All roads in and out of Taiz, except one, are controlled by the Houthis. \u201cWe were invited to cross to the other side for talks but clashes broke out and both sides shot at us,\u201d recalls Abdul Kareen Shaiban with a grimace as he remembers a negotiating effort years ago. An MP who chairs a roads committee, he\u2019s talked many times over many years to both sides. We\u2019re standing on what was once a bustling main road running though Taiz, which connected it to other major cities including the capital Sana\u2019a in the north. A few goats pick their way down the carriageway and a little boy furiously pedals past on his beat-up bicycle. We can see the rusted metal barriers overgrown with shrubbery blocking the road a short distance away. \u201cPeople inside this city have nothing to do with politics or war. They just simply want to live and they need a road,\u201d Shaiban says. \u201cThe siege has made life difficult and deadly,\u201d chimes in Dalia Nasr of another initiative, Taizi Women for Life. She knows the danger \u2013 a sniper\u2019s bullet blinded her in one eye. Her aunt, two brothers and a nephew were killed during clashes. Nasr explains how blocking the roads splits life in two: patients with chronic illnesses are separated from specialised hospitals; students can\u2019t make it to their universities; workers living on the government side can\u2019t reach factories mainly concentrated in the area under Houthi control. Getting to the other side of Taiz used to be a five-minute drive. Now it takes more than five hours. We take this route, which hugs mountains with breathtaking sheer drops, bumps along a dirt track through soaring palm trees and runs through checkpoints manned by rival groups. We weren\u2019t given permission by the Houthi authorities to spend time on the other side. Everyone we meet in Taiz remembers what happened to them as if it was yesterday. \u201cNo one pays attention to us,\u201d says Marwan with palpable anger. We\u2019re standing in the rubble of his home, where 10 relatives died as they slept in an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition. It happened five years ago. The house, and Marwan, are still in pieces. \u201cTo this day we\u2019ve received no explanation from the local authorities or the army or the coalition,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know why they hit a neighbourhood full of civilians.\u201d Airstrikes by the coalition \u2013 often with UK- or US-made bombs \u2013 have caused the most civilian casualties in Taiz, and other battlefields across Yemen, according to figures compiled by the UN and other data sources including Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project). \u201cThe attack was so aggressive it took us six days to find the body parts,\u201d Marwan recalls. \u201cWe looked for them in nearby houses, on the streets and on the roofs.\u201d Eight of his neighbours perished in the same attack. A Yemeni government official accompanying us insists we also visit a home destroyed by the Houthis. We\u2019re greeted by a gaggle of children. A little girl in a red velvet dress, braids sticking out like a Yemeni Pippa Longstocking, starts chattering about the attack that killed her playmate next door. The boy\u2019s mother, Zahra, soon arrives with graphic photographs of that fateful day. Their home is still a mess of shattered windows and walls. \u201cEveryone sold Yemen for their own benefit,\u201d Zahra declares bitterly. \u201cThe Houthis work with Iran, half the resistance works with Saudi Arabia, the other half with the United Arab Emirates.\u201d It\u2019s a lament not just about the main warring parties, but also skirmishes between local forces trained and armed by Arab states in the coalition. Zahra\u2019s story is the story of Yemen\u2019s war. Her youngest son died in the first strike, her older son was later shot dead, a daughter lost an eye and her husband went mad with grief. \u201cThey see this huge crisis happening to us and no one does anything.\u201d When we leave, Zahra hurries after us with freshly baked Yemeni bread \u2013 a reminder, if one was needed, that even this merciless war can\u2019t completely crush a kind and cultured people.

      "body": "<p>There is a paradox at the heart of Adrienne Miller\u2019s memoir, <em>In </em><em>the Land </em><em>of Men</em>. On the one hand, it\u2019s an account of her becoming the first female literary editor of US <em>Esquire</em> at the end of the 90s. On the other, it\u2019s really about her relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\" title=\"\">David Foster Wallace</a>, then arguably the pre-eminent American novelist of his generation until his death in 2008. The paradox (for a feminist reader, anyway) is that, while you want to celebrate the story of a woman carving out a space in a culture of male entitlement, there\u2019s no escaping the guilty sense that the book becomes a great deal more lively once the famous male writer takes centre stage.</p> <p>Miller is well aware of this, of course. Much of the book is about the gradual formation of her feminist awareness and the tensions inherent in her professional position (a male colleague tells her \u201ceveryone wondered\u201d whom she had slept with to get the job). Suddenly, at 25, she finds herself with a certain amount of power in the literary world \u2013 \u201c<em>Esquire</em> had been the chief platform for American short fiction from the 40s through the 70s\u201d \u2013 while on the other side of the equation are male writers who can\u2019t even comprehend the notion of taking editorial suggestions from a woman. One of \u201cthe most famous and successful authors in the world\u201d responds to her edits via his agent: \u201cWHY is this person bothering me with this? Tell her the story is FINISHED.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, my sensitivity about the ways in which male writers represented female characters \u2013 or, in the case of male journalists who wrote for men\u2019s magazines, how they represented actual women \u2013 was ever increasing,\u201d she writes of her early tenure at the magazine, weighing up her aesthetic versus her ideological responsibility. \u201cIt was not my job to be a censor. But I also knew that I needed the women in what I read to be as clever and as dumb, as noble and as wicked, as any man.\u201d This may seem glaringly obvious now, but it\u2019s easy to forget how far the literary culture of the late 90s lionised certain male voices, and how much character it must have taken for a young woman to assert her independence of thought against men who barely believed such a thing could exist. Wallace tells her his favourite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\" title=\"\">Updike</a> line is: \u201cYou never know for sure how girls\u2019 minds work (do you really think it\u2019s a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glass jar?)\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec455586bdfeb91e7f1c7f971e1d166b21a9404a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec455586bdfeb91e7f1c7f971e1d166b21a9404a/0_0_2592_3872/669.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Her tone is often one of adulation\u2019: Adrienne Miller\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Her tone is often one of adulation\u2019: Adrienne Miller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulf Andersen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not the first nor the last abhorrently sexist thing Wallace says to her. He begins stalking Miller (there\u2019s no other way to describe it) when she accepts a story of his for the magazine. He calls her several times a day to discuss his work, then asks for her home number so he can call her at the weekends. He consistently puts her down and patronises her; he is deliberately cruel and simultaneously needy.</p> <p>In the book, she is curiously reticent about the shift in their relationship from professional to personal. Miller tries at times to confront his behaviour, but she offers frustratingly vague analyses of why her younger self found ways to excuse it every time. \u201cWas I along for the ride?

      "bodyText": "There is a paradox at the heart of Adrienne Miller\u2019s memoir, In the Land of Men. On the one hand, it\u2019s an account of her becoming the first female literary editor of US Esquire at the end of the 90s. On the other, it\u2019s really about her relationship with David Foster Wallace, then arguably the pre-eminent American novelist of his generation until his death in 2008. The paradox (for a feminist reader, anyway) is that, while you want to celebrate the story of a woman carving out a space in a culture of male entitlement, there\u2019s no escaping the guilty sense that the book becomes a great deal more lively once the famous male writer takes centre stage. Miller is well aware of this, of course. Much of the book is about the gradual formation of her feminist awareness and the tensions inherent in her professional position (a male colleague tells her \u201ceveryone wondered\u201d whom she had slept with to get the job). Suddenly, at 25, she finds herself with a certain amount of power in the literary world \u2013 \u201cEsquire had been the chief platform for American short fiction from the 40s through the 70s\u201d \u2013 while on the other side of the equation are male writers who can\u2019t even comprehend the notion of taking editorial suggestions from a woman. One of \u201cthe most famous and successful authors in the world\u201d responds to her edits via his agent: \u201cWHY is this person bothering me with this? Tell her the story is FINISHED.\u201d \u201cNow, my sensitivity about the ways in which male writers represented female characters \u2013 or, in the case of male journalists who wrote for men\u2019s magazines, how they represented actual women \u2013 was ever increasing,\u201d she writes of her early tenure at the magazine, weighing up her aesthetic versus her ideological responsibility. \u201cIt was not my job to be a censor. But I also knew that I needed the women in what I read to be as clever and as dumb, as noble and as wicked, as any man.\u201d This may seem glaringly obvious now, but it\u2019s easy to forget how far the literary culture of the late 90s lionised certain male voices, and how much character it must have taken for a young woman to assert her independence of thought against men who barely believed such a thing could exist. Wallace tells her his favourite Updike line is: \u201cYou never know for sure how girls\u2019 minds work (do you really think it\u2019s a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glass jar?)\u201d This is not the first nor the last abhorrently sexist thing Wallace says to her. He begins stalking Miller (there\u2019s no other way to describe it) when she accepts a story of his for the magazine. He calls her several times a day to discuss his work, then asks for her home number so he can call her at the weekends. He consistently puts her down and patronises her; he is deliberately cruel and simultaneously needy. In the book, she is curiously reticent about the shift in their relationship from professional to personal. Miller tries at times to confront his behaviour, but she offers frustratingly vague analyses of why her younger self found ways to excuse it every time. \u201cWas I along for the ride? Yes, I guess you could say that I was.\u201d Ironically, it was Wallace who coined the phrase \u201cgreat male narcissists\u201d in a takedown of Updike, and Miller notes that most essays Wallace wrote about other writers were really \u201cnotes to self\u201d. But too often she finds a way to blame herself for his narcissism; when he breaks up with her (and behaves like a spoilt brat), she thinks: \u201cHis life is worth more than mine.\u201d Her relationship with him comes to seem one more manifestation of the way men treated her professionally (\u201cThe truth: my career had been built around protecting male egos\u201d). In one section she lists examples of the things men said or did to her in a professional context, ranging from creepy innuendos to putting their hands down her trousers \u2013 a reminder, in these post-#MeToo days, that there was a time when sexual harassment was so pervasive that women didn\u2019t know how to recognise it. Wallace even jokingly suggests that \u201cIs It Sexual Harassment Yet?\u201d should be the title of her memoir. \u201cHad I actually been involved in an abusive relationship with David?\u201d she wonders, towards the end of the book, but stops short of answering with the unequivocal \u201cYes!\u201d that the reader is by now shouting, while rolling their eyes.

Whether the book brings us closer to understanding Wallace or his work is debatable, but it is disappointing that in a memoir about a woman\u2019s progress in a man\u2019s world, it is his presence that dominates. \u2022 In the Land of Men by Adrienne Miller is published by Ecco (\u00a320)",

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world\u2019s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? \u201cYou just take these magic beans and...\u201d Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. \u201cI realise it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but, still\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Back then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn\u2019t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn\u2019t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn\u2019t production, it\u2019s what happens next.</p> <p>We waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it\u2019s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced \u2013 approximately 1.3bn tonnes \u2013 is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it\u2019s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46b4dc549a0062ba01d7159c3bc59bfcc1b15d22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46b4dc549a0062ba01d7159c3bc59bfcc1b15d22/868_396_2542_4476/568.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it\u2019: James Rogers, CEO of Apeel.\" width=\"568\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it\u2019: James Rogers, CEO of Apeel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehakver/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: \u201cAll fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.\u201d That insight \u2013 so simple, so true \u2013 struck him like a lightning bolt. \u201cThe problem,\u201d he recalls, \u201cis you\u2019re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.\u201d Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science\u2019s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him.</p> <p>He decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn\u2019t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado\u2019s shelf life by two to three times.</p> <p>The company Rogers founded, <a href=\"https://apeelsciences.com/\" title=\"\">Apeel Sciences</a>, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight \u2013 the big switch in his interests and research. \u201cSweetie,\u201d she said to him. \u201cThat sounds really nice. But you don\u2019t know anything about fruit and vegetables.\u201d</p> <p>Apeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company\u2019s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose \u2013 building prototypes for entry into the human body \u2013 to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit\u2019s skin.</p> <p>\u201cThis room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,\u201d says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. \u201cIt\u2019s still being set up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still putting wires into things.\u201d Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel\u2019s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet'</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Costanza</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel\u2019s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce.</p> <p>Costanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel\u2019s spray is in the mix. It\u2019s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. \u201cImagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,\u201d Costanza says. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. \u201cThis is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one\u2019s really able to replicate it \u2013 we don\u2019t really have competition.\u201d</p> <p>They do, really. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hazeltechnologies.com/\" title=\"\">Hazel Technologies</a>, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food\u2019s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called <a href=\"https://www.itsfresh.com/\" title=\"\">It\u2019s Fresh</a>, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from <a href=\"https://www.agrofresh.com/\" title=\"\">AgroFresh</a>, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look.</p> <p>There\u2019s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30048d4d9dd2bb104aa8703e22f5e9c230bed203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30048d4d9dd2bb104aa8703e22f5e9c230bed203/0_288_6516_3910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelf life: Apeel\u2019s HQ in California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelf life: Apeel\u2019s HQ in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehak/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number \u2013 $218bn \u2013 is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste.</p> <p>People have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they\u2019ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant.</p> <p>What sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology \u2013 the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company\u2019s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state\u2019s largest organic apple growers.</p> <p>Greathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it\u2019s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant \u2013 much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards \u2013 but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed.</p> <p>We arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team \u2013 the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable\u2019s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel\u2019s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years.</p> <p>Now we\u2019re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room.</p> <p>Finally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like moisturiser,\u201d Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, \u201cMaybe I can shave with this.\u201d In fact, she adds, \u201cThe reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss \u2013 same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>James Rogers, the CEO,<em><strong> </strong></em>has an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. \u201cThe joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,\u201d he says. But: \u201cWhen you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,\u201d because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. \u201cI know it\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s just my favourite,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they go bad so quickly.\u201d The company is a few years into R&amp;D on that one. \u201cWhen I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"164cdd5714c278448bce7ed10019b119a8321f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/164cdd5714c278448bce7ed10019b119a8321f6b/169_0_4175_5529/755.jpg\" alt=\"Building the future: inside the lab at the Apeel.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Building the future: inside the lab at the Apeel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehak/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it\u2019s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter?</p> <p>Within every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel\u2019s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because \u2013 yes \u2013 while it\u2019s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up.</p> <p>Where things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn\u2019t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel \u2013 stay firm and unripe quite as long \u2013 like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn\u2019t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it\u2019s essential for our future food security.</p> <p>Just up the road from Apeel\u2019s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it\u2019s known as a caviar lime. The farm\u2019s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they\u2019ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what\u2019s working, and what\u2019s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer\u2019s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets.</p> <p>The caviar limes weren\u2019t Rogers\u2019 idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses. The weird limes were actually the very first product Apeel brought to the market. \u201cThank God no one listened to me on that one,\u201d he says, smiling, thinking back on it. It taught him another important lesson, one he carries forward now. \u201cThe shorter the shelf life, the bigger the opportunity.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world\u2019s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? \u201cYou just take these magic beans and...\u201d Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. \u201cI realise it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but, still\u2026\u201d Back then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn\u2019t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn\u2019t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn\u2019t production, it\u2019s what happens next. We waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it\u2019s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced \u2013 approximately 1.3bn tonnes \u2013 is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it\u2019s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste? One day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: \u201cAll fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.\u201d That insight \u2013 so simple, so true \u2013 struck him like a lightning bolt. \u201cThe problem,\u201d he recalls, \u201cis you\u2019re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.\u201d Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science\u2019s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him. He decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn\u2019t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado\u2019s shelf life by two to three times. The company Rogers founded, Apeel Sciences, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight \u2013 the big switch in his interests and research. \u201cSweetie,\u201d she said to him. \u201cThat sounds really nice. But you don\u2019t know anything about fruit and vegetables.\u201d Apeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company\u2019s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose \u2013 building prototypes for entry into the human body \u2013 to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit\u2019s skin. \u201cThis room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,\u201d says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. \u201cIt\u2019s still being set up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still putting wires into things.\u201d Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel\u2019s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran. We pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel\u2019s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce. Costanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel\u2019s spray is in the mix. It\u2019s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. \u201cImagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,\u201d Costanza says. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. \u201cThis is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one\u2019s really able to replicate it \u2013 we don\u2019t really have competition.\u201d They do, really. There\u2019s Hazel Technologies, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food\u2019s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called It\u2019s Fresh, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from AgroFresh, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look. There\u2019s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company. All of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number \u2013 $218bn \u2013 is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste. People have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they\u2019ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant. What sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology \u2013 the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company\u2019s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state\u2019s largest organic apple growers. Greathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it\u2019s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant \u2013 much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards \u2013 but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed. We arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team \u2013 the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable\u2019s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel\u2019s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years. Now we\u2019re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room. Finally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process. \u201cIt feels like moisturiser,\u201d Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, \u201cMaybe I can shave with this.\u201d In fact, she adds, \u201cThe reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss \u2013 same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.\u201d James Rogers, the CEO, has an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. \u201cThe joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,\u201d he says. But: \u201cWhen you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,\u201d because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. \u201cI know it\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s just my favourite,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they go bad so quickly.\u201d The company is a few years into R&amp;D on that one. \u201cWhen I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it.\u201d These days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it\u2019s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter? Within every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel\u2019s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because \u2013 yes \u2013 while it\u2019s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up. Where things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn\u2019t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel \u2013 stay firm and unripe quite as long \u2013 like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn\u2019t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it\u2019s essential for our future food security. Just up the road from Apeel\u2019s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it\u2019s known as a caviar lime. The farm\u2019s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they\u2019ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked.

But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses.

      "body": "<p>Andy Warhol would be 92 this summer, had he not died of post-operative complications in 1987. His soup cans are almost 60, their whites now fading to grey. Few enough people dine daily on Campbell\u2019s soup, as he did, for these paintings to sustain their significance as demotic homages any more. The common soup for the common man is recognisable these days mainly as blue chip Warhol.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/andy-warhol\" title=\"\">Tate Modern</a>, in considering how to present the artist for a new generation, has eliminated almost everything that lacks the split-second familiarity that mattered so much to Warhol. His output as a portraitist, for instance, is generously edited. Instead of the dubious sitters \u2013 from German industrialists to the Shah of Iran \u2013 whose faces he (or his assistants) depicted by production-line rote, we are given only the immortals \u2013 Elvis, Marilyn, Jackie \u2013 or those still-living stars whose fame survives in our time. Debbie Harry in violet and turquoise, lime and sulphur colour-ways; Mick Jagger in 1975, with the wrong-shaped head and hairdo, in tarry dun and Elastoplast pink, his youthful beauty squandered. There are, after all, good and bad Warhols.</p> <p>There are also better and worse surveys, and this is decidedly the latter. Its drive is largely biographical, with a particular emphasis on sex. The curators want to quash the old myth of Andy as celibate voyeur, embarrassed by his pocked skin and sparse hair, and tell instead the evolutionary narrative of what\u2019s prissily described as his \u201cqueer identity\u201d. There are many images of the men Warhol fancied, and with whom he had affairs. The very first gallery has a side room in which his 1964 film <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KHdXhyKqTk\" title=\"\">Sleep</a></em> is showing. The poet John Giorno, Warhol\u2019s lover, is seen naked and sleeping in all his dark beauty, body foreshortened like that of some dead Renaissance Christ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46a9830cbb5f7dca3f0662706cc068b47c3821d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46a9830cbb5f7dca3f0662706cc068b47c3821d6/0_0_5067_5144/985.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Jagger, 1975.\" width=\"985\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mick Jagger, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 2020 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. / Licensed by DACS, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This opening room sets the worshipful tone with relics: family albums; childhood photographs; the passenger manifest recording his beloved mother Julia\u2019s arrival from Slovakia at Ellis Island in 1921. You see her again, later, talking in the East Slavic language Rusyn to her son in one of several videos taped in the Manhattan building they shared for years. Warhol did not attend her funeral, however; he was supposed to have become especially death-averse after being shot in 1968 by Valerie Solanas.</p> <p>Confronted in this show by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\" title=\"\">Richard Avedon</a>\u2019s vast black-and-white photograph of Warhol\u2019s torso \u2013 stitched up, the artist said, like a Chanel dress \u2013 that argument feels more simplistic than ever. Warhol poses like a model, parting his leather jacket and pulling down his underwear to bare his body. The swank is as much due to Warhol as Avedon.</p> <p>Death steals through this show, from the eerie shadows of his <em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/warhol-electric-chair-t07145\" title=\"\">Electric Chair</a></em> sequence, where the restraints lie slack on the ground after the corpse has been removed, to the shocking image of a suicide falling from a building, over and again, in Warhol\u2019s trademark repetitions. Here is <em>Pink Race Riot</em>, where you have to peer into the array of news shots of Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963 to notice the trained dog in the maelstrom. One after the other, the images have become so degraded they are scarcely legible; the dog has more prominence than the victims.</p> <p>\u201cEverything I do is connected with death,\u201d he said, and it is central to Warhol\u2019s method, the silkscreen prints taking the original photograph to the verge of dissolution with their blurry overlays and fadings, as the ink runs out. This is especially true of widowed Jackie, silver Elvis, the horrifying car crashes and Marilyn, dwindling from colour to ashen grey. Warhol began making these paintings immediately after her death; they have the status of exequies.</p> <p>But the power of these classics is appallingly undermined at Tate Modern. The curators have selected one painting from each series \u2013 as if they were mere tokens \u2013 and jammed them indiscriminately together in a single room like miscellaneous merchandise at the <a href=\"https://affordableartfair.com/fairs/london?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwmKLzBRBeEiwACCVihnH7SvVjpgeLDPxmYN6tPp7_6rNeexfdVfNzrmUEZfHoc6T_Sk4DwRoCWwgQAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">Affordable Art Fair</a>. You cannot stand at any distance from them, noticing their qualities and distinctions, absorbing their unique combination of graphic magnificence and froideur, their weird force of personality. And the Brillo boxes are heaped like coal in a corner, behind a cordon, so you can\u2019t walk round them appreciating their double life as both paintings and sculptures.</p> <p>There is a sense of hurrying through the masterworks to get back to the story. And, sure enough, far more attention is given to mocking up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/11/inside-andy-warhol-factory-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the Factory</a> in the next room. Here the silver walls reflect Steve Shore\u2019s famous shots of Andy and Lou and emaciated Edie et al, hanging out among the original silver walls.</p> <p>The <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfW9VU-M260\" title=\"\">Screen Tests</a></em> \u2013 where everyone is forced to sit still, or not, before Warhol\u2019s camera \u2013 are an evergreen fascination.

      "bodyText": "Andy Warhol would be 92 this summer, had he not died of post-operative complications in 1987. His soup cans are almost 60, their whites now fading to grey. Few enough people dine daily on Campbell\u2019s soup, as he did, for these paintings to sustain their significance as demotic homages any more. The common soup for the common man is recognisable these days mainly as blue chip Warhol. Tate Modern, in considering how to present the artist for a new generation, has eliminated almost everything that lacks the split-second familiarity that mattered so much to Warhol. His output as a portraitist, for instance, is generously edited. Instead of the dubious sitters \u2013 from German industrialists to the Shah of Iran \u2013 whose faces he (or his assistants) depicted by production-line rote, we are given only the immortals \u2013 Elvis, Marilyn, Jackie \u2013 or those still-living stars whose fame survives in our time. Debbie Harry in violet and turquoise, lime and sulphur colour-ways; Mick Jagger in 1975, with the wrong-shaped head and hairdo, in tarry dun and Elastoplast pink, his youthful beauty squandered. There are, after all, good and bad Warhols. There are also better and worse surveys, and this is decidedly the latter. Its drive is largely biographical, with a particular emphasis on sex. The curators want to quash the old myth of Andy as celibate voyeur, embarrassed by his pocked skin and sparse hair, and tell instead the evolutionary narrative of what\u2019s prissily described as his \u201cqueer identity\u201d. There are many images of the men Warhol fancied, and with whom he had affairs. The very first gallery has a side room in which his 1964 film Sleep is showing. The poet John Giorno, Warhol\u2019s lover, is seen naked and sleeping in all his dark beauty, body foreshortened like that of some dead Renaissance Christ. This opening room sets the worshipful tone with relics: family albums; childhood photographs; the passenger manifest recording his beloved mother Julia\u2019s arrival from Slovakia at Ellis Island in 1921. You see her again, later, talking in the East Slavic language Rusyn to her son in one of several videos taped in the Manhattan building they shared for years. Warhol did not attend her funeral, however; he was supposed to have become especially death-averse after being shot in 1968 by Valerie Solanas. Confronted in this show by Richard Avedon\u2019s vast black-and-white photograph of Warhol\u2019s torso \u2013 stitched up, the artist said, like a Chanel dress \u2013 that argument feels more simplistic than ever. Warhol poses like a model, parting his leather jacket and pulling down his underwear to bare his body. The swank is as much due to Warhol as Avedon. Death steals through this show, from the eerie shadows of his Electric Chair sequence, where the restraints lie slack on the ground after the corpse has been removed, to the shocking image of a suicide falling from a building, over and again, in Warhol\u2019s trademark repetitions. Here is Pink Race Riot, where you have to peer into the array of news shots of Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963 to notice the trained dog in the maelstrom. One after the other, the images have become so degraded they are scarcely legible; the dog has more prominence than the victims. \u201cEverything I do is connected with death,\u201d he said, and it is central to Warhol\u2019s method, the silkscreen prints taking the original photograph to the verge of dissolution with their blurry overlays and fadings, as the ink runs out. This is especially true of widowed Jackie, silver Elvis, the horrifying car crashes and Marilyn, dwindling from colour to ashen grey. Warhol began making these paintings immediately after her death; they have the status of exequies. But the power of these classics is appallingly undermined at Tate Modern. The curators have selected one painting from each series \u2013 as if they were mere tokens \u2013 and jammed them indiscriminately together in a single room like miscellaneous merchandise at the Affordable Art Fair. You cannot stand at any distance from them, noticing their qualities and distinctions, absorbing their unique combination of graphic magnificence and froideur, their weird force of personality. And the Brillo boxes are heaped like coal in a corner, behind a cordon, so you can\u2019t walk round them appreciating their double life as both paintings and sculptures. There is a sense of hurrying through the masterworks to get back to the story. And, sure enough, far more attention is given to mocking up the Factory in the next room. Here the silver walls reflect Steve Shore\u2019s famous shots of Andy and Lou and emaciated Edie et al, hanging out among the original silver walls. The Screen Tests \u2013 where everyone is forced to sit still, or not, before Warhol\u2019s camera \u2013 are an evergreen fascination. Dylan licks his lips, Debbie breaks into a smile, William Burroughs drags on a surprisingly senatorial cigar. Each portrait starts out as a still but quickens into suspenseful drama. But then it\u2019s back to old copies of Interview magazine, clips from home movies, photographs of Warhol on the Manhattan party scene, on television, as gossip column editor. Three of his wigs, white with creepy black under-hair, are laid out like dead creatures in a case. At times it feels as if the biography is taking over, the art an epiphenomenon to the overwhelming fame. There are exceptions, specifically the gallery devoted to the 1975 series Ladies and Gentlemen. These portraits of drag performers from New York nightclubs are life-size, rapturous in their exuberant whorls and shifts of colour. One sitter, only known as Lurdes, is portrayed with such ecstatic sweeps that the features seem to melt; as if both subject and artist were getting out of their heads. A wall text frets over the correct terminology \u2013 not knowing how Lurdes might have self-identified. But about Warhol himself there hardly seems much doubt. Blake Gopnik\u2019s newly published biography\u2013 necessarily monumental, given the prodigious scale of Warhol\u2019s social and professional life \u2013 makes his proclivities plain \u2013 plain as the art itself, with its lavish love of male beauty. The curators appear slightly wistful that they cannot make a queer activist of Warhol. In the final gallery, 60 black-and-white prints of Leonardo\u2019s The Last Supper are presented in sombre but glamorous lighting \u2013 a memorial wall, or so runs the wishful caption, invoking those who have died of Aids-related illnesses. But the work was commissioned by a Milan gallery in response to the restoration of The Last Supper; a print of it hung in Julia\u2019s kitchen; and Warhol rarely missed mass. You can cut the deck another way. Sixty Last Suppers is ultimately as affectless as Warhol so often wants to be. That it gets an entire gallery to itself exposes the flaws of this slight and ill-selected show. Stint on the art, in all its variations, in favour of identity politics and you get exactly the kind of zeitgeist pieties that would surely have bored Warhol himself. \u2022 Andy Warhol is at Tate Modern, London, until 6 September",

There is also the option for rescheduling games should a player be diagnosed with coronavirus and restructuring the competition for games to be played later in the season.</p> <p>Games are already closed to crowds from round two but conversations will continue with clubs over the next week as the global situation remains fluid.

      "bodyText": "Well, what a day we\u2019ve been through! Some big changes happening across the sporting landscape with doubtless more to come over the next week. We\u2019ve already seen the end, for now, of the Super Rugby. While the AFLM, AFLW, NRL and A-League are still scheduled to go ahead next week, albeit behind closed doors, advice is changing multiple times a day and who knows if those next games will happen next week, or at all? The Newcastle Jets look pretty comfortable in Adelaide, up 3-0 halfway through the second half, while in Wollongong the Tigers have pulled ahead, leading the Dragons 18-14 with 15 minutes remaining. Until we meet again, in whatever form Sportwatch takes over the coming weeks, good night, stay safe, socially distant and clean. So long! NRL: Here\u2019s that footage of Cameron Smith with his take on how the NRL should be handling the competition in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. NBL: The Perth Wildcats are one win away from securing the NBL premiership with a win over the Sydney Kings in game three of a best of five grand final series played behind closed doors today. NRL: Melbourne\u2019s Cameron Smith has added his voice to the debate on continuing the NRL, believing the competition should be suspended for two weeks. More from AAP: Cam Smith calls for NRL to be suspended Cameron Smith has called for the NRL to be suspended for at least two weeks in a bid to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Smith said he was speaking for all Melbourne players when he highlighted his concern around family members and the team\u2019s constant travel load. \u201cThere is something in place tomorrow to avoid being around groups larger than 500 people, and there are more than 500 people at airports and we\u2019re going to be doing that every second week,\u201d Smith said. A-League: Adelaide 0-1 Newcastle at half-time This game was scoreless for most of the half, until Dimitrios Petratos slid it across to Roy O\u2019Donovan for a simple tap in in the 41st minute to put the Jets ahead. Newcastle have been pretty ordinary on the road this year, so they\u2019ll be hoping to snatch just their second away win of the season if they can see this lead through. NRL: St George-Illawarra Dragons 12-8 Wests Tigers at half-time The Dragons got the early points in this one, before the Tigers hit back. But Zac Lomax was on hand to deliver another blow for the Dragons, putting pressure on the Tigers fullback Corey Thompson that forces and error and lets Lomax sneak over for an easy try, before adding the conversion. Lomax was lucky his own error didn\u2019t prove costly later as he dropped a simple kick return right on the Tigers\u2019 tryline, but the Dragons defence was good enough to hold the Tigers out. Despite West Coast finally managing to snare a goal in the final quarter, this game was all about the Gold Coast Suns. It was a dominant display from start to finish and keeps their finals hopes alive going into their match against Adelaide next week. Kalinda Howarth continued her form into the final quarter, finishing with four goals for the game. \u201cIt was an awesome game today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe love playing in the dry - it was a really great opportunity to show off our skills. It was awesome to be able to get on the board and hopefully we can keep pushing through and keep winning.\u201d Just a reminder that if you want a quick rundown of everything that\u2019s happening in Australian sport with regards to coronavirus, this story has all the latest updates. AFLW: Gold Coast leads West Coast 4.3 (27) to 0.2 (2) The Suns have really started to assert their dominance on this game, with some impressive stats coming out of their side of the scorecard. Jacqui Yorston has been a menace in defence, with nine tackles and eight disposals, while Kate Surman with 17 disposals is working like a machine. Kalinda Howarth has been on fire with the boot, kicking three of the Suns\u2019 four goals. Rugby Sevens: Here is more on that story I mentioned earlier about possible coronavirus cases coming out of the Australian Sevens camp, via AAP. Australian Sevens program possibly hit by virus Two members of the Australian sevens program have been tested for coronavirus after showing signs and symptoms associated with the pandemic. Rugby Australia didn\u2019t specify whether they were players or staff, only announcing two people had self-isolated after experiencing symptoms this weekend. Both had attended the RA high performance centre within its Moore Park headquarters in Sydney during the past week. As a precautionary measure, the governing body\u2019s headquarters will be closed for two days for an intensive clean. All administrative staff have been advised to work from home, and the Australian men\u2019s and women\u2019s sevens teams will not attend the facility on Monday or Tuesday. Results of the tests are expected to be known within 72 hours. The Phoenix finished off their last home game for the forseeable future in style, with a 3-0 takedown of the Victory in Wellington. A second half goal to David Ball sealed the deal and their defence held strong to deny the Victory any goals. It was a measured performance that will see them edge ever closer to Melbourne City on the ladder, sitting just outside the top two. Rugby Sevens: An interesting little piece of info from Georgina Robinson on Twitter here, we\u2019ll keep an eye on this story and see how it progresses. Well I predicted someone would blink before too long in the second half and it was Manly in the end - Melbourne were able to score the first try of the game in the 61st minute with a little chip over the top to winger Suliasi Vunivalu. Two minutes later Vunivalu was over again and Tom Eisenhuth put the icing on the cake in the 74th minute. An ominous start to the season for the Sea Eagles, who tend to rely on their parochial home crowd to get them over the line at their Brookvale fortress. The crowd couldn\u2019t do it today and from next week they will be unable to even get through the gates. AFLW: Gold Coast 2.2 (14) leads West Coast 0.1 (1) at half-time Things aren\u2019t getting any better for the Eagles, with still no goals on the board. It hasn\u2019t been a complete performance from the Suns so far, but they\u2019ve done enough to stay on top and will be feeling pretty confident heading into the sheds for half-time. A huge win for the Brumbies as the Super Rugby grinds to a halt while travel restrictions are enacted. Seven tries for the home side in this game, while the Waratahs couldn\u2019t manage to score again in the second half. Tom Banks scores an absolute belter at the death just to really send the Waratahs home with their tails between their legs. The Brumbies are comfortably on top of the Australian conference, while the Waratahs are languishing down near the bottom, just ahead of the Sunwolves. Formula One: Giles Richards\u2019 fascinating chat with former world champion Alan Jones (not the one from the radio) is well worth a read, some interesting thoughts on the Albert Park cancellation. Jones was hugely disappointed at the cancellation but accepts it was the right thing to do. The indomitable Australian can-do spirit tempered by the reality of the coronavirus. \u2018From my point of view I would have gone ahead and done it anyway but you have to be sensible about the whole thing,\u2019 he says.\u201d AFLW: Gold Coast leads West Coast 1.2 (8) to 0.0 (0) at quarter-time A defensive-heavy game so far, with Kalinda Howarth sneaking through a goal in the 11th minute after a couple of behinds from her teammates. A very unhappy outing from the Eagles so far, with plenty of tackling but no reward. A-League: Phoenix 2-0 Victory at half-time The Phoenix are making the most of what will likely be their last game in New Zealand for some time. They have been clinical this first half, taking their scoring opportunities and limiting Victory\u2019s time in possession. Ulises D\u00e1vila scored early for the home team, with Gary Hooper heading through the second in the 21st minute. A-League: An update via AAP on the situation with the Wellington Phoenix with travel restrictions coming into effect from tonight. Phoenix commit to Australian A-League stay Wellington have committed to playing out their A-League season in Australia, even though it means undergoing a self-isolation period after border restrictions introduced to Australia to combat coronavirus. With doubt surrounding the continuation of the league, the Phoenix are proposing to spend at least six-straight weeks in Australia in pursuit of a maiden title. Wellington will host Melbourne Victory on Sunday at Sky Stadium, hours before travel restrictions take effect at midnight on both sides of the Tasman. Phoenix general manager David Dome said his third-placed team had all but bought into playing out their campaign on Australian soil under extraordinary circumstances. They couldn\u2019t play for 14 days while undergoing mandatory isolation, and then would have an intense run of games, probably in empty stadiums. Wellington would be unable to play road games scheduled next week, against Sydney FC on Wednesday and Newcastle on Sunday. They would bank on FFA rescheduling both games, while two matches - which were to have been played in Wellington in April - would need to be relocated to Australia. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to capitulate and not play out. We had to play out; we had to do our best to get into the finals series,\u201d Dome said. \u201cThe disappointing thing for us is that the fans won\u2019t be there to enjoy it.\u201d Dome said the team would likely self-isolate in central Sydney accommodation and emerge only for controlled training sessions. Dome said players would have the choice to commit to a full Australian stay of at least six weeks. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to force players to go. We won\u2019t mandate it because there are some players with families. There are some players who are expecting children and do we really want to take them away from their newborn babies?\u201d Super Rugby: Brumbies 21-14 Waratahs at half-time Meanwhile in the code where trying scoring is usually much less frequent, there has been a bit of a try-fest down in Canberra in a high scoring first half between these two old foes. The Waratahs got on the board first through Rob Simmons, but the Brumbies hit back soon after and lead three tries to two. Solomone Kata managed two in eight minutes for the home side. With the Super Rugby suspended after today when travel restrictions into Australia and New Zealand come into place, this will be an important win to get. NRL: Manly 4-2 Melbourne at half-time A very low scoring start to the season for these two teams with the match resembling rugby union more than league - three penalty goals are all that has troubled the scorers in the first half. Both sides have been phenomenal in the defence of their lines, but early season lack of fitness is likely to plague one or both sides in the second half and we could see some late tries sneak through. A strong win for GWS over last year\u2019s premiers, sending them into second place on the Conference A ladder. Another goal from Cora Staunton sealed the deal as they kept up their defence all the way to the end. A late goal from Courtney Gum for the Crows wasn\u2019t enough to bridge the gap and the Giants celebrated the win. An emotional response from Staunton showed just how important this game was to the GWS team. \u201cObviously it was a big game for the club,\u201d said Staunton after the match. \u201cWe knew coming in it was a big game for the club...it was a massive win for us. We wanted consistency in our game and we showed that today. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that there\u2019s no crowd, but we obviously understand that people\u2019s health is a lot more important than sport. \u201cIt\u2019s been just over 10 months since I shattered my leg and had four breaks. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be back...it was a physical and mental battle to get back.\u201d More perspective on cancellations, this time out of the UK from Barney Ronay. There will be a clashing of gears over all this and no shortage of legal threats as time and resources are divvied up. Sport will survive. The beauty, the grace, the basic pleasure of these gaudy entertainments will remain unaffected. But a great deal of practical help will be required to ensure it is not offered only to those victims of this nasty little bug who can shout the loudest, that precarious livelihoods and the infrastructure of amateur sport are also protected.\u201d AFLW: GWS leads Adelaide 3.2 (20) to 2.3 (15) at three-quarter time Another low scoring quarter - the stifling defence from the Giants is doing the job here as they keep their noses in front. It\u2019s an exhausting style of game to play though, so it will be interesting to see how their fitness holds up in the last quarter. Alyce Parker is doing a power of work, with 25 disposals and six marks to her name. Brittany Tully scored the goal to ease the Giants ahead, just four minutes before three-quarter time. W-League: The match report on Melbourne City\u2019s dominant semi-final win is up now. Some good info here from Tom Kludt on the North American perspective of sport in the time of coronavirus and those who will be hit hardest by league suspensions. Schauder says the deepest, and most immediate implications, will be felt by those employed by the stadiums, which play host to other entertainment ventures along with sporting events, as well as nearby businesses that capitalize on those gatherings.\u201d AFLW: GWS leads Adelaide 2.2 (14) to 2.1 (13) As predicted, this game remains a tight struggle, with just one goal that quarter - to the Giants\u2019 cross-coder Jodie Hicks (also a cricketer with the Sydney Sixers in the WBBL). Last season\u2019s best and fairest for the Giants Rebecca Beeson has continued her dominance, with 10 disposals and three tackles for the match. Strong defence from the Giants is frustrating the Crows, the team in orange will need to keep that up and continue to stifle as the match plays out. F1: A bit of a mess this week with the cancellation of the F1 after all spectators had arrived and were waiting to get in. Giles Richards breaks it down for us in this story. It was merely mismanagement that had crowned what increasingly appears to have been at best an optimistic decision to bring thousands of F1 personnel from a Europe already creaking under the assault of coronavirus to a mass gathering event that attracts up to 100,000 people a day. In the light of sport across the world curtailing activity to restrict the spread of the virus, that F1 felt it could escape unscathed seems hopelessly naive.\u201d AFLW: Adelaide 2.1 (13) lead GWS 1.1 (7) at quarter time A strong first quarter from the Crows with Courtney Gum and Marijana Rajcic in the goals. Cora Staunton scored for GWS, who will feel that they are still in the game at this point. Tait Mackrill and Rebecca Beeson have both been strong for the Giants, with plenty of disposals in the first quarter. It\u2019s shaping up to be a cracker of a game. City have booked their spot in the W-League grand final with a decisive win over the Wanderers. Kyah Simon was happy with the performance and said the team is focusing on improving to ensure they play their best game in the grand final against Sydney FC next weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve played with a lot of the Sydney FC girls and spent a lot of my career there in the sky blue,\u201d she said. \u201cPriority is to play our own game and focus on what we do well.\u201d Interesting to see elbow bumps taking place between the two teams after the game considering the level of the goal celebrations taking place. Possibly each team believes they could only spread viruses through opposition and not teammates? A-League: News just in from AAP on the potential suspension of the A-League: Travel restrictions could shut A-League The A-League could be suspended with the governments of Australia and New Zealand imposing compulsory 14-day self-isolation periods to combat the coronavirus. Wellington Phoenix will host Melbourne Victory at Sky Stadium on Sunday, with travel restrictions taking effect in Australia and New Zealand at midnight. On Saturday following New Zealand announcing its health plan, the Phoenix said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to host matches at home due to international travellers having to self-isolate for two weeks. Well in this very strange week the coverage of sport has looked quite different to usual. This interesting piece from Jonathan Liew talks about sport bringing the brutal reality of coronavirus to the front of many people\u2019s minds. For so many of us, sport isn\u2019t simply a way of passing the time but a way of marking it. It offers a liturgy, a structure on which to measure the passing days and seasons...In frightening times, virus or no virus, these are the rituals that offer the veneer of normality, a background noise as reassuring and immutable as the ticking of the clock.\u201d Not a happy outing for the Brumbies, being comprehensively beaten by the Reds in Canberra. The Reds were dominant in every facet of the game and with this win, have earned the right to host next weekend\u2019s Super W playoff. Tries to Shannon Mato, Okeroa Manihera and Ivy Kaleta sealed the win for the Reds, with a 100% conversion rate from Lori Cramer. This swung back and forth like a pendulum and was very close throughout most of the match, but in the end the Dockers were able to put the foot down and come away with a strong 15 point win. Ashley Sharp was dominant for Fremantle, kicking three goals, while Mia-Rae Clifford finished with two. It was a valiant effort from the Bulldogs who are well down the Conference B ladder, taking it to the highly fancied Dockers who remained undefeated at the top of Conference B. NRL: An interesting story from AAP on potential responses the NRL are considering. NRL take advice from biosecurity expert ARL commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys has revealed a north Queensland resort has reached out to the NRL to be considered if all 16 clubs are to be relocated to play a \u2018Magic Round\u2019 style competition. As NRL bosses navigate one of the most complex challenges in the game\u2019s history due to the coronavirus pandemic, V\u2019landys has confirmed every option to keep the competition alive is being considered. That includes relocating all 16 NRL teams to a warmer climate such as Queensland where the virus is less likely to thrive, isolating teams in one location, and playing all games at one stadium to ensure the broadcast can proceed. A resort in far north Queensland has already emailed the NRL to advise they have vacancies to accommodate all 16 NRL teams should the competition be moved. However, it all hinges on a report from an appointed biosecurity expert who will assess which solution is safest for players. \u201cWe need to get our biosecurity experts to have a look at that facility and how we would eliminate any risk. There\u2019s an element of thought that you might put greater risk by having all the players in one area,\u201d V\u2019landys told Triple M on Sunday. \u201cWe have to look at all contingencies and ensure that we are providing the best biosecurity measures to eliminate any risk of the players catching the virus. The biggest risk for us is a player or official catching the virus, which means there would be isolation of some of the players and teams and that\u2019s when we can pull the lever on suspending the season.\u201d Other options understood to be considered are postponing the season for a month and extending the competition through until the end of October and playing catch-up games during bye rounds. There is also the option for rescheduling games should a player be diagnosed with coronavirus and restructuring the competition for games to be played later in the season. Games are already closed to crowds from round two but conversations will continue with clubs over the next week as the global situation remains fluid. It\u2019s still to be determined if lower grade and junior competitions will need to be shut down, with the state authorities to make those decisions in the coming days. However, V\u2019landys said it was inevitable there would be changes made. Coronavirus updates: Head to this story if you want to keep track of where Australian sports are at with postponing, cancelling and locking out spectators as the coronavirus continues to have an effect on sport around the world. We\u2019ll keep it updated throughout the day as information comes in and situations change. W-League: Melbourne City 3-0 Western Sydney Wanderers at half-time A big half for City who have all but booked their place in the grand final after a dominant first half. Goals from Kyah Simon, Claire Emslie and Rebekah Stott put City on the board, though the goal celebrations were not entirely in keeping with social distancing protocols - it will be interesting to see how this trends across sport this weekend. Well, what a weekend this is. At this stage we have plenty of live sport to get through, although many sports are locked out to crowds. But today may be the last day we see this much sport for a while - the Super Rugby will be postponed at the conclusion of the current round following travel restrictions to New Zealand coming into effect tonight. The NRL is continuing with round two at this stage, though crowds will be locked out after the conclusion of round one this evening. The Super Netball has cancelled the Team Girls Cup preseason competition that was due to be held from 27-29 March. It\u2019s certainly not the usual Sportwatch for a weekend - I\u2019ll do my best to keep you updated on all the latest developments as they unfold. Don\u2019t forget to tweet, email or leave a comment with your thoughts on how the sports are responding.",

It\u2019s the sort of creation that a 17th-century radical, a leveller or a digger, a ranter or a muggletonian might have made \u2013 a vision of a better world, which was always on Derek\u2019s mind, even as the molten lava of his rage at the fuck-up of a world made by other people erupted. I guess Prospect was his sanity, his lodestone in a frequently appalling world.\u201d</p> <p>The author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/philip-hoare\">Philip Hoare</a>, who is curator of Queer Nature, a forthcoming exhibition of Jarman\u2019s Prospect Cottage work at the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton, said the cottage could be considered Jarman\u2019s greatest work and described it as a \u201ctarry wonder-miracle\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like an overgrown garden shed, till you step inside and realise what a queer Tardis it is \u2013 a little bit of the Renaissance dropped into the Dungeness desert, as dark as the backrooms of Heaven, glittering like one of his film sets,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jarman, who died of an Aids-related illness in 1994, drew strength from his garden: his diary was published as <em>Modern Nature</em> in 1991.</p> <p>\u201cI first read <em>Modern Nature</em> when I was a teenager and was bewitched by his account of making a garden in the face of his own oncoming death,\u201d said<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\" title=\"\"> novelist Olivia Laing </a>. \u201cWe never think of Jarman as a nature writer, but to my mind he\u2019s the best, not least because he understands nature is inseparable from politics and that it includes sex.

      "bodyText": "With just two weeks to go until its fate is decided, leading artists have waded into the campaign to save for the nation a fisherman\u2019s shack on a bleak strip of coastline a stone\u2019s throw from a nuclear power station. Prospect Cottage in Dungeness, Kent, was the home of the filmmaker, artist and writer Derek Jarman, and has become a place of pilgrimage for those drawn to its stark beauty and enchanting shingle garden. But the cottage will be sold to a private buyer unless \u00a33.5m can be found by 31 March. It is being sold after the death in 2018 of Keith Collins, Jarman\u2019s partner, to whom he left the cottage. A crowdfunding campaign launched in January and spearheaded by the charity Art Fund, has raised more than \u00a32,750,000. At the launch of the fund, actress Tilda Swinton, Jarman\u2019s close friend and collaborator, said: \u201cFirst and foremost, the cottage was always a living thing, a practical toolbox for his work.\u201d Last week, costume designer Sandy Powell auctioned the cream suit she wore to the Oscars, which has been signed by 300 Hollywood stars, for \u00a316,000. But with \u00a3750,000 still to find, there are concerns the target may be missed, a scenario that has dismayed Jarman\u2019s many fans. \u201cTo me, Prospect Cottage was another manifestation of his visionary, Blakean self,\u201d said the actor Simon Callow. \u201cIn its sparseness and formality, he was showing us the world in a grain of sand, holding infinity in the palm of his hand. It\u2019s the sort of creation that a 17th-century radical, a leveller or a digger, a ranter or a muggletonian might have made \u2013 a vision of a better world, which was always on Derek\u2019s mind, even as the molten lava of his rage at the fuck-up of a world made by other people erupted. I guess Prospect was his sanity, his lodestone in a frequently appalling world.\u201d The author Philip Hoare, who is curator of Queer Nature, a forthcoming exhibition of Jarman\u2019s Prospect Cottage work at the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton, said the cottage could be considered Jarman\u2019s greatest work and described it as a \u201ctarry wonder-miracle\u201d. \u201cIt looks like an overgrown garden shed, till you step inside and realise what a queer Tardis it is \u2013 a little bit of the Renaissance dropped into the Dungeness desert, as dark as the backrooms of Heaven, glittering like one of his film sets,\u201d he said. Jarman, who died of an Aids-related illness in 1994, drew strength from his garden: his diary was published as Modern Nature in 1991. \u201cI first read Modern Nature when I was a teenager and was bewitched by his account of making a garden in the face of his own oncoming death,\u201d said novelist Olivia Laing . \u201cWe never think of Jarman as a nature writer, but to my mind he\u2019s the best, not least because he understands nature is inseparable from politics and that it includes sex. He\u2019s funny and erudite, knowledgeable about old roses and medieval history, but also bursting with gossip and capable of conveying instances of sublime, dreamlike beauty.\u201c \u201cOne of the things I find most inspiring about him is that he refuses boundaries. He didn\u2019t want to be confined by any single discipline, leaping between styles and subjects in a way that feels radical even now. I wish he was still here, but his house and garden remain, an emblem of his life, a site of experiment and openness and restless creativity. As a writer I feel very strongly that we need Derek\u2019s energy in the world right now. Prospect Cottage must be saved.\u201d The novelist Alan Hollinghurst, who went to the same school, Canford, as Jarman, who was 10 years older than him, recalled \u201cthis glamorous old boy who hated the school\u201d and described Prospect Cottage as having an aura. \u201cIt\u2019s long had a shrine-like atmosphere, in a strange quasi-religious way. Jarman was perpetually indulgent.It has a much bigger meaning than merely itself \u2013 a sort of countercultural shrine.

      "body": "<p>Confronted by the coronavirus menace, politicians and governments around the world are thrashing about wildly, trying to decide what to do for the best. \u201cPolitics isn\u2019t working\u201d is a common refrain among disaffected citizens in the modern era. But at this uniquely stressful moment, it really does appear to be true. While they mean well, most leaders haven\u2019t got a clue.</p> <p>The dawning realisation that national politicians cannot be relied upon to do the right or sensible thing, whatever that may turn out to be, has serious long-term implications for democracy and the principle of democratic consent. If the crisis is protracted, a catastrophic loss of confidence in the way the pandemic is managed could lead to unpredictable social disruption across many countries.</p> <p>As is the case with victims of the disease, underlying conditions and vulnerabilities in politics too are being painfully exposed.</p> <p>It\u2019s becoming clear, for example, that healthcare systems, even in wealthy countries such as the US, are chronically under-resourced and unprepared. Confusion reigns widely, fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\" title=\"\">conflicting official advice in different countries </a>about public gatherings, travel, and self-isolation.</p> <p>Some leaders may emerge with their reputations enhanced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\" title=\"\">For others, the opposite holds true. </a>The virus has already made fools of the world\u2019s two most powerful men. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has faced unprecedented criticism over his handling of the first recorded outbreak in Wuhan. He initially steered well clear of the problem \u2013 an early example of social distancing.</p> <p>But Xi has struggled since to contain the political and human fallout. The death from Covid-19 of Li Wenliang, a young doctor who sounded the alarm in Wuhan in December but was gagged by Communist party officials, sparked an online revolt. Xi finally ventured to the city last week, lavishing praise on its beleaguered residents in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/asia/coronavirus-china-xi-jinping.html\" title=\"\">what almost sounded like an apology</a>.</p> <p>Predictably, Donald Trump\u2019s reaction has been all about him. Among other inanities, he suggested the pandemic was a fake Democrat plot to harm his re-election chances. Ignoring the science and minimising the threat, he claimed his Mexican border wall had somehow immunised Americans, and likened the \u201cforeign virus\u201d to an alien invasion. It\u2019s embarrassingly obvious Trump is not up to the job.</p> <p>Both Trump and Xi could pay a heavy price. The US leader may have survived impeachment, but come November many voters will not forget or forgive this failure of leadership in a crisis. Xi\u2019s aura of paternal infallibility has shattered.

      "bodyText": "Confronted by the coronavirus menace, politicians and governments around the world are thrashing about wildly, trying to decide what to do for the best. \u201cPolitics isn\u2019t working\u201d is a common refrain among disaffected citizens in the modern era. But at this uniquely stressful moment, it really does appear to be true. While they mean well, most leaders haven\u2019t got a clue. The dawning realisation that national politicians cannot be relied upon to do the right or sensible thing, whatever that may turn out to be, has serious long-term implications for democracy and the principle of democratic consent. If the crisis is protracted, a catastrophic loss of confidence in the way the pandemic is managed could lead to unpredictable social disruption across many countries. As is the case with victims of the disease, underlying conditions and vulnerabilities in politics too are being painfully exposed. It\u2019s becoming clear, for example, that healthcare systems, even in wealthy countries such as the US, are chronically under-resourced and unprepared. Confusion reigns widely, fuelled by conflicting official advice in different countries about public gatherings, travel, and self-isolation. Some leaders may emerge with their reputations enhanced. For others, the opposite holds true. The virus has already made fools of the world\u2019s two most powerful men. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has faced unprecedented criticism over his handling of the first recorded outbreak in Wuhan. He initially steered well clear of the problem \u2013 an early example of social distancing. But Xi has struggled since to contain the political and human fallout. The death from Covid-19 of Li Wenliang, a young doctor who sounded the alarm in Wuhan in December but was gagged by Communist party officials, sparked an online revolt. Xi finally ventured to the city last week, lavishing praise on its beleaguered residents in what almost sounded like an apology. Predictably, Donald Trump\u2019s reaction has been all about him. Among other inanities, he suggested the pandemic was a fake Democrat plot to harm his re-election chances. Ignoring the science and minimising the threat, he claimed his Mexican border wall had somehow immunised Americans, and likened the \u201cforeign virus\u201d to an alien invasion. It\u2019s embarrassingly obvious Trump is not up to the job. Both Trump and Xi could pay a heavy price. The US leader may have survived impeachment, but come November many voters will not forget or forgive this failure of leadership in a crisis. Xi\u2019s aura of paternal infallibility has shattered. Trust has gone. To restore his grip, it is suggested, he may resort to more intrusive social controls, surveillance and censorship. Yet increased repression could prompt a career-ending backlash. Trump\u2019s knee-jerk reaction in pulling up the drawbridge and blaming others is not unique. Fear not facts has led European leaders such as Austria\u2019s Sebastian Kurz to act alone, hastily closing borders and barring people from specific countries.

      "body": "<p>The recent, turbulent history of the Dick family reads like a Netflix reboot of <em>Bleak House</em>. For this is the tale of an unending court case involving the recent sale of a fabulous mansion in one of Britain\u2019s better known tax havens, home to a man whose rags-to-riches life could have been penned by Charles Dickens.</p> <p>John W Dick was raised in Canada as a Mennonite \u2013 a Christian sect whose members live humble, God-fearing lives.</p> <p>It\u2019s a long way from the rarefied world he inhabits now. Today the 82-year-old tycoon rubs shoulders with business titans and political leaders and lives a life of immense luxury. He is a director of media giant Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, and an honorary consul for the Rwandan government.</p> <p>Dick \u2013 tall, bald and charismatic \u2013 has lived in St John\u2019s Manor, described as the finest house on Jersey, for more than 40 years. Until recently he was also the Seigneur of St John, a feudal title that carried privileges, including the right to execute servants.</p> <p>But instead of enjoying his twilight years in regal style, the multimillionaire is locked in an extraordinarily messy legal feud with his daughter by his first marriage, Tanya Dick-Stock, and her husband, Darrin Stock, a US businessman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e727965b7b8202819ca95139f2c63ccd0e69d62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e727965b7b8202819ca95139f2c63ccd0e69d62/0_0_6547_5854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage engraving from 1880 of Jersey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"894\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vintage engraving from 1880 of Jersey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Father v daughter: the claims and counter-claims<br><br></h2> <p>Few things about the feud are clear. Dick-Stock alleges that her father, abetted by others, has defrauded family trusts \u2013 offshore vehicles used to protect assets from the taxman \u2013 of which she is a beneficiary, of tens of millions of pounds. She is also heavily critical of the way the Jersey authorities and its financial services industry have investigated her claims.</p> <p>Dick vigorously disputes his daughter\u2019s allegations. He regards her and her husband as \u201cwholly unreliable\u201d and untrustworthy, citing, among other things, both criticism she received in a Jersey court and the number of court proceedings in which the couple are involved in the US. </p> <p>Dick\u2019s lawyers also say his daughter does not have the authority to bring the case against her father as the company bringing the action is in receivership, and therefore litigation should be controlled by the receiver.</p> <p>They point out that none of the trusts\u2019 other beneficiaries, including her own brother, John Dick II, share her views. The entire Dick family, not just Tanya, has been the victim of an audacious fraud, they say.</p> <p>Lawyers for Dick-Stock deny allegations that she is untrustworthy and insist she is entitled to bring a separate personal claim against her father.</p> <p>A spokesman for Dick-Stock said the case was due to be heard on 6 July.</p> <p>This may seem just a story about a wealthy family\u2019s spectacular implosion in a British Crown Dependency that prizes its independence from the mainland: think <em>Bergerac</em> meets <em>Succession</em>. But the father-daughter battle which, until now, has gone largely unreported, affords a rare glimpse of how the secretive offshore trust system, set up to protect assets from the taxman, can be exploited for fraudulent purposes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8930118a4f6512f4e2a0db5fa27d8693874d196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8930118a4f6512f4e2a0db5fa27d8693874d196/0_90_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanya Dick-Stock and Darrin Stock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanya Dick-Stock and Darrin Stock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, while there is now almost nothing upon which Dick and his daughter do agree, both believe that a massive fraud has been perpetrated in Jersey, the scale of which has yet to be truly appreciated. Some view the row as a wake-up call for the island.</p> <p>Lurking in the shadows, out of sight of regulators and law enforcement, the offshore trust system appears ripe for manipulation, with beneficiaries often unaware of how their assets are being used. Anonymous trusts that are trustees of other trusts based in different tax havens shuffle money and assets around like cards, using them as security for loans.</p> <p>Frank Casey, the financial analyst who blew the whistle on the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/madoff/interviews/casey.html\" title=\"\">Bernie Madoff scandal</a>, drew comparisons between the conditions under which the disgraced financier was able to operate his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/16/ponzi-madoff-business-scams\" title=\"\">ponzi scheme</a> and the way the system functions in tax havens around the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe similarities are really striking,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe basic elements are a lack of transparency and no reportability.\u201d</p> <p>This in turn raises an important question: if trusts\u2019 beneficiaries are not always aware of what is happening to their assets, what hope is there for external regulators and law enforcement agencies trying to stop them being used to launder money for kleptocrats, mobsters and drug cartels?</p> <p>The clearest indication that there was trouble in paradise came last month when St John\u2019s Manor was sold after languishing for two years on the market, the asking price having been <a href=\"https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2020/02/18/st-johns-manor-sold-after-two-years-on-the-market/\" title=\"\">slashed from \u00a322m to a reported \u00a317.5m</a>.</p> <p>The estate agent\u2019s sales brochure describes the 11,000 sq ft pile, which dates back to the 14th century, as having \u201cmagnificent\u201d landscaped grounds, a \u201cstunning\u201d Japanese water garden, stables, a swimming pool, a squash court and a falconry. It also has a chapel where Tanya and Darrin were married and underneath which Dick intends to be buried.</p> <p>Dick-Stock alleges that, down the years, Dick family trusts have had claims over St John\u2019s Manor as well as other properties including flats in St Petersburg, Jersey and Mayfair, a farm, a fleet of luxury cars and even a vintage doll collection.</p> <p>She also claims to have seen documents that show the trusts once owned a Botticelli painting worth an estimated $20m, a claim categorically denied by her father.</p> <p>But it is the fabulous house that is at the centre of the row. Both father and daughter agree that St John\u2019s Manor was used to fraudulently secure a \u00a36.5m loan from HSBC Jersey. It is claimed that a trustee of the Dick family trusts, an obscure offshore services company called PanTrust, played a key role in the alleged fraud before misappropriating the HSBC loan.</p> <p>If true, PanTrust\u2019s actions run counter to everything a trustee \u2013 a person or body who has a duty to protect a trust\u2019s assets \u2013 is supposed to do, in this case represent the interests of the entire Dick family.</p> <h2>The Panama connection and the shady financial adviser<br><br></h2> <p>But then PanTrust is not your average trustee. The company featured prominently in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>, the massive leak of confidential documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca that revealed how hundreds of wealthy individuals and companies had parked their money offshore, in some cases illegally.</p> <p>Banned from operating by the Panamanian regulator in February 2015, PanTrust was found to have set up a complex ponzi scheme in which scores of fake accounts were paying fictitious rates of interest with the results that scores of trusts were fleeced of millions of pounds.</p> <p>The Panamanian regulator also ruled that the firm had failed in its duty to prevent money-laundering and terrorist financing. To this day it has the distinction of being the only company in Panama to ever lose its trust licence.</p> <p>PanTrust was run by a man called Richard Wigley, who managed Dick\u2019s financial affairs for 30 years until his fraudulent acts were discovered. And it is the relationship between the two men that is now at the centre of the dispute between father and daughter. Was Wigley acting independently of Dick or, as his daughter insists, on his behalf?</p> <p>A Royal Court of Jersey judgment refers to a memo prepared by Wigley which claimed that Dick would receive a share of PanTrust\u2019s income. But Dick\u2019s representatives insist that he has never received an income from PanTrust. They say that it was Dick who drew PanTrust to the attention of the Panamanian regulator and that Wigley abused his position and defrauded the Dick family over three decades.</p> <p>It was during court proceedings to have him removed as a trustee that Wigley\u2019s lawyers made a bombshell admission. They acknowledged that he had created 24 fraudulent loans worth $30m involving a series of trusts set up for the Dick family.</p> <p>Then events took an even more extraordinary turn.</p> <p>According to Dick-Stock\u2019s legal action against her father, filed in 2018 in the district court, Denver County, Colorado, where one of the family trusts was established, it was only after Wigley had been removed as a trustee that she claims she discovered \u201cJohn W Dick was not a victim of \u2026 Wigley, but instead a confederate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she suspected her father it was like <em>Friday the 13th</em>, when the mask slips and you find out who Jason really is,\u201d Stock said.</p> <p>To say Dick denies the claim would be a serious understatement. A representative said: \u201cJohn Dick and his family dispute the entirety of Tanya\u2019s alternative history.\u201d</p> <p>Last June, the Dick-Stocks wrote to HSBC Jersey, informing it that the Jersey police and the US authorities had been alerted to allegations that the loan against St John\u2019s Manor had been secured fraudulently. Dick\u2019s representatives say they are not aware of any investigations. A spokeswoman for HSBC Jersey said: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment due to client confidentiality.\u201d</p> <p>A team of financial experts hired by Dick-Stock are examining whether other trusts linked to PanTrust \u2013 and two related trust companies \u2013 have also been plundered. There are claims that hundreds of millions of pounds may have been looted without the trust beneficiaries being aware of what had happened.</p> <h2>Question marks over the whistleblowers<br><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f20cb1552381b17c19e53aae9bd8dec9e2208880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f20cb1552381b17c19e53aae9bd8dec9e2208880/0_167_580_348/500.jpg\" alt=\"John W.

      "bodyText": "The recent, turbulent history of the Dick family reads like a Netflix reboot of Bleak House. For this is the tale of an unending court case involving the recent sale of a fabulous mansion in one of Britain\u2019s better known tax havens, home to a man whose rags-to-riches life could have been penned by Charles Dickens. John W Dick was raised in Canada as a Mennonite \u2013 a Christian sect whose members live humble, God-fearing lives. It\u2019s a long way from the rarefied world he inhabits now. Today the 82-year-old tycoon rubs shoulders with business titans and political leaders and lives a life of immense luxury. He is a director of media giant Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, and an honorary consul for the Rwandan government. Dick \u2013 tall, bald and charismatic \u2013 has lived in St John\u2019s Manor, described as the finest house on Jersey, for more than 40 years. Until recently he was also the Seigneur of St John, a feudal title that carried privileges, including the right to execute servants. But instead of enjoying his twilight years in regal style, the multimillionaire is locked in an extraordinarily messy legal feud with his daughter by his first marriage, Tanya Dick-Stock, and her husband, Darrin Stock, a US businessman. Father v daughter: the claims and counter-claims Few things about the feud are clear. Dick-Stock alleges that her father, abetted by others, has defrauded family trusts \u2013 offshore vehicles used to protect assets from the taxman \u2013 of which she is a beneficiary, of tens of millions of pounds. She is also heavily critical of the way the Jersey authorities and its financial services industry have investigated her claims. Dick vigorously disputes his daughter\u2019s allegations. He regards her and her husband as \u201cwholly unreliable\u201d and untrustworthy, citing, among other things, both criticism she received in a Jersey court and the number of court proceedings in which the couple are involved in the US. Dick\u2019s lawyers also say his daughter does not have the authority to bring the case against her father as the company bringing the action is in receivership, and therefore litigation should be controlled by the receiver. They point out that none of the trusts\u2019 other beneficiaries, including her own brother, John Dick II, share her views. The entire Dick family, not just Tanya, has been the victim of an audacious fraud, they say. Lawyers for Dick-Stock deny allegations that she is untrustworthy and insist she is entitled to bring a separate personal claim against her father. A spokesman for Dick-Stock said the case was due to be heard on 6 July. This may seem just a story about a wealthy family\u2019s spectacular implosion in a British Crown Dependency that prizes its independence from the mainland: think Bergerac meets Succession. But the father-daughter battle which, until now, has gone largely unreported, affords a rare glimpse of how the secretive offshore trust system, set up to protect assets from the taxman, can be exploited for fraudulent purposes. Indeed, while there is now almost nothing upon which Dick and his daughter do agree, both believe that a massive fraud has been perpetrated in Jersey, the scale of which has yet to be truly appreciated. Some view the row as a wake-up call for the island. Lurking in the shadows, out of sight of regulators and law enforcement, the offshore trust system appears ripe for manipulation, with beneficiaries often unaware of how their assets are being used. Anonymous trusts that are trustees of other trusts based in different tax havens shuffle money and assets around like cards, using them as security for loans. Frank Casey, the financial analyst who blew the whistle on the Bernie Madoff scandal, drew comparisons between the conditions under which the disgraced financier was able to operate his ponzi scheme and the way the system functions in tax havens around the world. \u201cThe similarities are really striking,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe basic elements are a lack of transparency and no reportability.\u201d This in turn raises an important question: if trusts\u2019 beneficiaries are not always aware of what is happening to their assets, what hope is there for external regulators and law enforcement agencies trying to stop them being used to launder money for kleptocrats, mobsters and drug cartels? The clearest indication that there was trouble in paradise came last month when St John\u2019s Manor was sold after languishing for two years on the market, the asking price having been slashed from \u00a322m to a reported \u00a317.5m. The estate agent\u2019s sales brochure describes the 11,000 sq ft pile, which dates back to the 14th century, as having \u201cmagnificent\u201d landscaped grounds, a \u201cstunning\u201d Japanese water garden, stables, a swimming pool, a squash court and a falconry. It also has a chapel where Tanya and Darrin were married and underneath which Dick intends to be buried. Dick-Stock alleges that, down the years, Dick family trusts have had claims over St John\u2019s Manor as well as other properties including flats in St Petersburg, Jersey and Mayfair, a farm, a fleet of luxury cars and even a vintage doll collection. She also claims to have seen documents that show the trusts once owned a Botticelli painting worth an estimated $20m, a claim categorically denied by her father. But it is the fabulous house that is at the centre of the row. Both father and daughter agree that St John\u2019s Manor was used to fraudulently secure a \u00a36.5m loan from HSBC Jersey. It is claimed that a trustee of the Dick family trusts, an obscure offshore services company called PanTrust, played a key role in the alleged fraud before misappropriating the HSBC loan. If true, PanTrust\u2019s actions run counter to everything a trustee \u2013 a person or body who has a duty to protect a trust\u2019s assets \u2013 is supposed to do, in this case represent the interests of the entire Dick family. The Panama connection and the shady financial adviser But then PanTrust is not your average trustee. The company featured prominently in the Panama Papers, the massive leak of confidential documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca that revealed how hundreds of wealthy individuals and companies had parked their money offshore, in some cases illegally. Banned from operating by the Panamanian regulator in February 2015, PanTrust was found to have set up a complex ponzi scheme in which scores of fake accounts were paying fictitious rates of interest with the results that scores of trusts were fleeced of millions of pounds. The Panamanian regulator also ruled that the firm had failed in its duty to prevent money-laundering and terrorist financing. To this day it has the distinction of being the only company in Panama to ever lose its trust licence. PanTrust was run by a man called Richard Wigley, who managed Dick\u2019s financial affairs for 30 years until his fraudulent acts were discovered. And it is the relationship between the two men that is now at the centre of the dispute between father and daughter. Was Wigley acting independently of Dick or, as his daughter insists, on his behalf? A Royal Court of Jersey judgment refers to a memo prepared by Wigley which claimed that Dick would receive a share of PanTrust\u2019s income. But Dick\u2019s representatives insist that he has never received an income from PanTrust. They say that it was Dick who drew PanTrust to the attention of the Panamanian regulator and that Wigley abused his position and defrauded the Dick family over three decades. It was during court proceedings to have him removed as a trustee that Wigley\u2019s lawyers made a bombshell admission. They acknowledged that he had created 24 fraudulent loans worth $30m involving a series of trusts set up for the Dick family. Then events took an even more extraordinary turn. According to Dick-Stock\u2019s legal action against her father, filed in 2018 in the district court, Denver County, Colorado, where one of the family trusts was established, it was only after Wigley had been removed as a trustee that she claims she discovered \u201cJohn W Dick was not a victim of \u2026 Wigley, but instead a confederate\u201d. \u201cWhen she suspected her father it was like Friday the 13th, when the mask slips and you find out who Jason really is,\u201d Stock said. To say Dick denies the claim would be a serious understatement. A representative said: \u201cJohn Dick and his family dispute the entirety of Tanya\u2019s alternative history.\u201d Last June, the Dick-Stocks wrote to HSBC Jersey, informing it that the Jersey police and the US authorities had been alerted to allegations that the loan against St John\u2019s Manor had been secured fraudulently. Dick\u2019s representatives say they are not aware of any investigations. A spokeswoman for HSBC Jersey said: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment due to client confidentiality.\u201d A team of financial experts hired by Dick-Stock are examining whether other trusts linked to PanTrust \u2013 and two related trust companies \u2013 have also been plundered. There are claims that hundreds of millions of pounds may have been looted without the trust beneficiaries being aware of what had happened. Question marks over the whistleblowers It is for this reason that Dick-Stock and her husband present themselves as whistleblowers. They have approached the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) and the island\u2019s financial crime unit, the JFCU, seeking their help in securing an investigation into the HSBC loan and their wider allegations of fraud, misappropriation and corruption. They claim to have handed over to the island\u2019s authorities and its police force thousands of pages of documents relating to hundreds of offshore trusts, which would make explosive reading, should they ever become public. But some are sceptical about their allegations and the sceptics have evidence to back their claims. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the couple, including for unpaid debts. They have also fallen out with their original lawyers and other members of the extended Dick family. Dick-Stock\u2019s credibility as a witness was also heavily criticised in related proceedings brought in the Royal Court of Jersey. The court said, among other things, the evidence she gave was \u201cat odds with what she has said on oath to other courts in other places and she has frequently changed her case and evidence\u201d. It concluded \u201cwe did not find Tanya\u2019s evidence reliable nor did we find reliable evidence called on her behalf.\u201d A spokeswoman for the JFSC confirmed that it was aware of the couple\u2019s allegations and referred to the judgment above which raises serious questions about Dick-Stock\u2019s credibility and that of her claim as a whole. The JFSC spokeswoman said: \u201cIt is important to note that our role, as the regulator, is not to investigate allegations of fraud, as fraud is a criminal offence.\u201d Compendium: Miami, money laundering and a mafia link It\u2019s not the first time Dick has found himself up against a family member in a lengthy court case. In the early 90s, while embroiled in divorce proceedings with his second wife, Elizabeth, he was reportedly held in a Jersey prison for 22 days until her alimony payments were resolved. However, in reality he ended up living under house arrest in his mansion for health reasons. The divorce, which was notable for the fact that it took seven years to conclude \u2013 two years more than the marriage lasted \u2013 shone light on a secretive Jersey-based trust called Compendium which, it transpired, was the trustee of a John Dick trust. Compendium, the US authorities discovered, had been used by a Miami-based lawyer, Lawrence Freeman, who was indicted for laundering money for the mafia and drug runners. At the time, the court heard suggestions that the Dick family fortune was worth an estimated $1.2bn, a figure Dick\u2019s representatives now describe as \u201cwildly inaccurate\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s like launching nuclear bombs. No one will win\u2019 A copy of the divorce settlement also confirmed that the Dicks listed a Jersey-based company, Sandsend Financial Services, among the assets in which they had a shared financial interest. The company, which was dissolved in 1999, was accused of receiving millions of dollars plundered from US savings and loan firms in the 1980s. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that it had received $7m of funds from a looted savings association called Vision Banc \u201cfor no apparent reason\u201d. There is no suggestion, nor was there any suggestion at the time, that Dick knew Sandsend or Compendium were being used for illegal purposes. But now, almost 30 years after his high-profile divorce garnered headlines, Dick once again finds himself in the spotlight. Ultimately the family feud, a modern-day Jarndyce v Jarndyce, may end in mutually assured destruction, just as it does in Bleak House, with only the lawyers celebrating. Dick\u2019s son, John Dick II, foresaw this possibility in a 2017 email he sent himself as a memo.

      "body": "<p>A pandemic is testing global leadership and its capacity to rise to the challenge of \u201cthe worst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. To some surprise, the man who said that is addressing the emergency in a more mature fashion than many anticipated when it first began to unfold. Boris Johnson has abandoned the \u201cinvisible man\u201d act for which I mocked him a fortnight ago and located the serious side of his character. The pantomime Johnson has been retired from public spectacle and replaced with the sombre Johnson we now see at news conferences. At his most recent, he struck an appropriately sober tone when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\" title=\"\">he warned</a>: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d, words prime ministers usually don\u2019t expect to utter outside wartime. Candour, not a quality always associated with this prime minister, is essential. Fear, panic and conspiracy theories are fomented when people suspect that their leaders are not telling them the truth. The Opinium poll that we publish today suggests that more people than not have confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but the margin is not a very solid one.</p> <p>The prime minister has been flattered by comparison with Donald Trump. His multiple flaws are being pitilessly highlighted by a crisis that a man who does not believe in scientific evidence or international cooperation is hopelessly ill-equipped to handle. Variously dismissing the coronavirus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/trump-calls-coronavirus-outbreak-a-hoax-and-links-it-to-immigration-at-rally\" title=\"\">a hoax</a>\u201d cooked up by his opponents to deny him re-election or no worse than the flu, he has swung from juvenile denialism to blaming it on foreigners and Democrats. Then he suddenly announced travel bans and declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\" title=\"\">\u201cnational emergency\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The ineffable American president is the quintessential example of a stretch of world history in which populist blowhards have prospered at the ballot box by stoking division, promoting polarisation, scorning expertise and championing ignorance. This crisis, one that now touches every continent on Earth apart from Antarctica, demands leaders who are willing to listen to professional advice, capable of fostering national cohesion at a time of emergency, and skilled at seeking international cooperation. The luckier countries will be those blessed with competent, honest and intelligent leadership. One of the possible positives to come out of this crisis \u2013 I put it no higher than possible at this stage \u2013 is that it will decrease the public appetite for bombastic charlatans and increase demand for serious leaders who respect expertise. If it does, that will be bad for populist hucksters more generally.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service isn't overwhelmed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mr Johnson has often aped Trumpian populism when he has seen political advantage in doing so, but he is smart enough to grasp that something more grown up is now required. People present at Cobra meetings and other decision-making moments generally report being impressed by the way he conducts himself. I asked one witness, who is not an instinctive cheerleader for this prime minister, how they thought he was doing. The reply came: \u201cPretty well. He is listening intently to the science.\u201d In this respect, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser and a fervent admirer of science, is acting as a positive influence on the prime minister, rather than a baleful one. Whenever he addresses the country from the state dining room, he has come flanked by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Thrust into the spotlight in a way neither man can have anticipated, they have both impressed with the clear and calm way they have talked to the nation. They can explain the reasoning for the strategy and how it is evolving with much more credibility than any politician. The polls tell us they will be much more likely to be believed. The government\u2019s senior scientists also serve as the prime minister\u2019s human shields against accusations that he is acting out of ideological fixations or for partisan advantage. No wonder he is clinging to them.</p> <p>The past few days have brought both more clarity and more controversy about their strategy. There is still consensus around one key component \u2013 to try to spread out the rate of infection: \u201cflattening the peak\u201d. The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service is not overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care. In his budget, an event all but eclipsed by the crisis, Rishi Sunak promised the NHS \u201cwhatever it takes\u2026 millions or billions\u201d to tackle the coronavirus, but you can\u2019t spend that money overnight. The NHS needs to increase its intensive care capacity, but that requires more staff, more equipment and more time. The crisis in Italy, whose leadership was slow to realise that they had a problem and who have now imposed an almost total lockdown of the entire country, has shocked ministers. It is widely assumed that Britain is about four weeks behind Italy in terms of infection, though that doesn\u2019t mean we have to end up in the same grisly place.</p> <p>There is not consensus, but mounting controversy, about another critical element of the government\u2019s strategy. Britain has adopted a strikingly different approach to the many other countries that are implementing faster and more sweeping programmes to curtail human contact. These include Ireland, France and Belgium, all close neighbours.</p> <p>That has fuelled the rising pressure on the prime minister to take much more stringent steps here. The pressure is coming both from Labour and from within the government\u2019s own ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has been the loudest voice asking why we are not seeking to emulate Asian states, such as Singapore and South Korea, that seem to have had some success in snuffing out the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The government is moving towards banning sports fixtures and other mass gatherings, but is still resistant to a more comprehensive shutdown. The scientific reasoning behind Britain\u2019s approach is that more draconian steps won\u2019t make that much difference at this stage, are not sustainable over the longer term, and may well turn out to be counterproductive because it will lead to a second wave of infections when restrictions are eased \u2013 possibly in winter, when the NHS is most stretched.</p> <p>Sir Patrick has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">lucidly explained</a> what the strategy is designed to achieve. It expects those on whom the disease has mild effects, the great majority, to be gradually exposed to the virus, building up \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Over time, this will lower the risk of infection for the vulnerable. While this is going on, they will do what they can to protect those for whom the coronavirus could be fatal. Perhaps the most important advice given by the government last week was the simplest. That was to tell people who have flu-type symptoms, however slight, that they should stay at home for seven days. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial,\u201d says one of those involved in this decision. \u201cThat is a significant amount of social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with an invisible menace with extremely visible impacts, a clamour for instant and total shutdowns is understandable. But it comes accompanied by the danger that kneejerk responses by frantic governments can end up doing more harm than good. One scientist drew my attention to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/japan-lifts-evacuation-order-futaba-town-fukushima-disaster\" title=\"\">Fukushima</a> nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011. Later studies found that around 20 people died from radiation. Many more, about a thousand, lost their lives as a result of the decision to evacuate: casualties of car crashes, heart attacks and other medical emergencies triggered by trying to clear the area in a rush. Sometimes the obvious reaction to a crisis will not be the correct one.</p> <p>Many lives depend on getting this right. The government can\u2019t be blamed for the virus, but there will be fierce scrutiny of its responses. There are risks with the strategy it has adopted \u2013 and huge ones for the reputation of Mr Johnson if the public concludes that his handling of the crisis led to avoidable deaths. There are hazards, too, with the alternative approaches. Various models for tackling the pandemic are now being live trialled around the world by governments of many different complexions and levels of competence. It will likely be a year or so before we will gain an understanding of which of the plans was the smartest. My conversations have convinced me that the British approach is rooted in scientific logic and a careful calibration of the different risks. I\u2019m no epidemiologist so I won\u2019t pretend to be a qualified judge of whether they are doing the right thing. I am persuaded that they are sincerely endeavouring to do the right thing.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "A pandemic is testing global leadership and its capacity to rise to the challenge of \u201cthe worst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. To some surprise, the man who said that is addressing the emergency in a more mature fashion than many anticipated when it first began to unfold. Boris Johnson has abandoned the \u201cinvisible man\u201d act for which I mocked him a fortnight ago and located the serious side of his character. The pantomime Johnson has been retired from public spectacle and replaced with the sombre Johnson we now see at news conferences. At his most recent, he struck an appropriately sober tone when he warned: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d, words prime ministers usually don\u2019t expect to utter outside wartime. Candour, not a quality always associated with this prime minister, is essential. Fear, panic and conspiracy theories are fomented when people suspect that their leaders are not telling them the truth. The Opinium poll that we publish today suggests that more people than not have confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but the margin is not a very solid one. The prime minister has been flattered by comparison with Donald Trump. His multiple flaws are being pitilessly highlighted by a crisis that a man who does not believe in scientific evidence or international cooperation is hopelessly ill-equipped to handle. Variously dismissing the coronavirus as \u201ca hoax\u201d cooked up by his opponents to deny him re-election or no worse than the flu, he has swung from juvenile denialism to blaming it on foreigners and Democrats. Then he suddenly announced travel bans and declared a \u201cnational emergency\u201d. The ineffable American president is the quintessential example of a stretch of world history in which populist blowhards have prospered at the ballot box by stoking division, promoting polarisation, scorning expertise and championing ignorance. This crisis, one that now touches every continent on Earth apart from Antarctica, demands leaders who are willing to listen to professional advice, capable of fostering national cohesion at a time of emergency, and skilled at seeking international cooperation. The luckier countries will be those blessed with competent, honest and intelligent leadership. One of the possible positives to come out of this crisis \u2013 I put it no higher than possible at this stage \u2013 is that it will decrease the public appetite for bombastic charlatans and increase demand for serious leaders who respect expertise. If it does, that will be bad for populist hucksters more generally. Mr Johnson has often aped Trumpian populism when he has seen political advantage in doing so, but he is smart enough to grasp that something more grown up is now required. People present at Cobra meetings and other decision-making moments generally report being impressed by the way he conducts himself. I asked one witness, who is not an instinctive cheerleader for this prime minister, how they thought he was doing. The reply came: \u201cPretty well. He is listening intently to the science.\u201d In this respect, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser and a fervent admirer of science, is acting as a positive influence on the prime minister, rather than a baleful one. Whenever he addresses the country from the state dining room, he has come flanked by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Thrust into the spotlight in a way neither man can have anticipated, they have both impressed with the clear and calm way they have talked to the nation. They can explain the reasoning for the strategy and how it is evolving with much more credibility than any politician. The polls tell us they will be much more likely to be believed. The government\u2019s senior scientists also serve as the prime minister\u2019s human shields against accusations that he is acting out of ideological fixations or for partisan advantage. No wonder he is clinging to them. The past few days have brought both more clarity and more controversy about their strategy. There is still consensus around one key component \u2013 to try to spread out the rate of infection: \u201cflattening the peak\u201d. The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service is not overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care. In his budget, an event all but eclipsed by the crisis, Rishi Sunak promised the NHS \u201cwhatever it takes\u2026 millions or billions\u201d to tackle the coronavirus, but you can\u2019t spend that money overnight. The NHS needs to increase its intensive care capacity, but that requires more staff, more equipment and more time. The crisis in Italy, whose leadership was slow to realise that they had a problem and who have now imposed an almost total lockdown of the entire country, has shocked ministers. It is widely assumed that Britain is about four weeks behind Italy in terms of infection, though that doesn\u2019t mean we have to end up in the same grisly place. There is not consensus, but mounting controversy, about another critical element of the government\u2019s strategy. Britain has adopted a strikingly different approach to the many other countries that are implementing faster and more sweeping programmes to curtail human contact. These include Ireland, France and Belgium, all close neighbours. That has fuelled the rising pressure on the prime minister to take much more stringent steps here. The pressure is coming both from Labour and from within the government\u2019s own ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has been the loudest voice asking why we are not seeking to emulate Asian states, such as Singapore and South Korea, that seem to have had some success in snuffing out the spread of the virus. The government is moving towards banning sports fixtures and other mass gatherings, but is still resistant to a more comprehensive shutdown. The scientific reasoning behind Britain\u2019s approach is that more draconian steps won\u2019t make that much difference at this stage, are not sustainable over the longer term, and may well turn out to be counterproductive because it will lead to a second wave of infections when restrictions are eased \u2013 possibly in winter, when the NHS is most stretched. Sir Patrick has lucidly explained what the strategy is designed to achieve. It expects those on whom the disease has mild effects, the great majority, to be gradually exposed to the virus, building up \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Over time, this will lower the risk of infection for the vulnerable. While this is going on, they will do what they can to protect those for whom the coronavirus could be fatal. Perhaps the most important advice given by the government last week was the simplest. That was to tell people who have flu-type symptoms, however slight, that they should stay at home for seven days. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial,\u201d says one of those involved in this decision. \u201cThat is a significant amount of social distancing.\u201d Faced with an invisible menace with extremely visible impacts, a clamour for instant and total shutdowns is understandable. But it comes accompanied by the danger that kneejerk responses by frantic governments can end up doing more harm than good. One scientist drew my attention to the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011. Later studies found that around 20 people died from radiation. Many more, about a thousand, lost their lives as a result of the decision to evacuate: casualties of car crashes, heart attacks and other medical emergencies triggered by trying to clear the area in a rush. Sometimes the obvious reaction to a crisis will not be the correct one. Many lives depend on getting this right. The government can\u2019t be blamed for the virus, but there will be fierce scrutiny of its responses. There are risks with the strategy it has adopted \u2013 and huge ones for the reputation of Mr Johnson if the public concludes that his handling of the crisis led to avoidable deaths. There are hazards, too, with the alternative approaches. Various models for tackling the pandemic are now being live trialled around the world by governments of many different complexions and levels of competence. It will likely be a year or so before we will gain an understanding of which of the plans was the smartest. My conversations have convinced me that the British approach is rooted in scientific logic and a careful calibration of the different risks. I\u2019m no epidemiologist so I won\u2019t pretend to be a qualified judge of whether they are doing the right thing. I am persuaded that they are sincerely endeavouring to do the right thing. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "body": "<p>The royals: an apology. In recent years it has been persuasively argued that younger members of the royals are more empathetic than their sourer, or weirder elders. And thus, as well as nicer, they are better qualified to connect with their subjects, and, in the long term, protect the family fortunes from, say, its members\u2019 regrettable weakness for paedophiles, at home and abroad.</p> <p>That William speaks well about mental health and Kate reaches out from Kensington Palace/Anmer Hall with her hints on <a href=\"https://people.com/royals/kate-middleton-supports-backyard-nature-campaign/\" title=\"\">rustic playtimes</a>, have both, for example, been accepted, even by the generally royal-averse, as welcome attempts at improvement. Recently, when the duchess disclosed, to fellow \u201cmum guilt\u201d sufferers, that she knows their pain, I found I had fallen into the habit of not laughing at would-be uplifting statements that may be hardly less inherently comical than, say, Prince Charles\u2019s longstanding ambition to \u201cheal the dismembered landscape and the poisoned soul\u201d.</p> <p>Its occasional Marie-Antoinetteishness aside, maybe the Cambridges\u2019 performed relatability really did signal the family\u2019s acquisition, as widely advertised, of an emotional intelligence that will ultimately overturn its reputation for coldness, feuding, successive betrayals, and an HRH-stripping vengefulness towards family misfits, like Diana?</p> <p>As of last week, it seems clear that this was an utter misapprehension.</p> <p>Courtesy of their hilarious double act in Westminster Abbey, it seems much more likely that William and Catherine are already, as inheritance edges closer, about as emotionally literate as Prince Philip, as careless of their status as Prince Andrew, and as supremely forgiving to outcasts as the late Queen Mother. With a few differences. The old Queen could at least cite, as the justification for a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6788085/The-Queen-Mother-Wallis-Simpson-savage-royal-feud-says-confidant-MICHAEL-THORNTON.html\" title=\"\">lifelong grudge</a>, her conviction that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/meghan-harry-wallis-simpson-edward-history\" title=\"\">Wallis Simpson</a> had devastated her own family life and ruined her husband\u2019s health. All Meghan Markle appears to have done to deserve a comparable level of visible ostracism from Kate and William is to conclude \u2013 admittedly rather late, and with scant notice \u2013 that a lifetime dedicated to trailing mutely in their wake would be unbearable. As a result, one hears the left-behind royals may now have to open more things and meet more subjects than usual.</p> <p>You can see why this might seem, as well as a nuisance, a rather pointed commentary on the ghastly, state-maintained life that Kate Middleton wanted for herself. But even so. It\u2019s not as if Meghan taught Kate\u2019s kids to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33578174\" title=\"\">Nazi salute</a>. And even minus their pretensions to leadership in talking/reaching out, blanking rarely-seen family members in a church, in public, isn\u2019t the most civilised example from the Cambridges, future leaders of the family that, according to its own website, symbolically unifies the nation. Some viciously divorced civilians do better than this every week.

      "bodyText": "The royals: an apology. In recent years it has been persuasively argued that younger members of the royals are more empathetic than their sourer, or weirder elders. And thus, as well as nicer, they are better qualified to connect with their subjects, and, in the long term, protect the family fortunes from, say, its members\u2019 regrettable weakness for paedophiles, at home and abroad. That William speaks well about mental health and Kate reaches out from Kensington Palace/Anmer Hall with her hints on rustic playtimes, have both, for example, been accepted, even by the generally royal-averse, as welcome attempts at improvement. Recently, when the duchess disclosed, to fellow \u201cmum guilt\u201d sufferers, that she knows their pain, I found I had fallen into the habit of not laughing at would-be uplifting statements that may be hardly less inherently comical than, say, Prince Charles\u2019s longstanding ambition to \u201cheal the dismembered landscape and the poisoned soul\u201d. Its occasional Marie-Antoinetteishness aside, maybe the Cambridges\u2019 performed relatability really did signal the family\u2019s acquisition, as widely advertised, of an emotional intelligence that will ultimately overturn its reputation for coldness, feuding, successive betrayals, and an HRH-stripping vengefulness towards family misfits, like Diana? As of last week, it seems clear that this was an utter misapprehension. Courtesy of their hilarious double act in Westminster Abbey, it seems much more likely that William and Catherine are already, as inheritance edges closer, about as emotionally literate as Prince Philip, as careless of their status as Prince Andrew, and as supremely forgiving to outcasts as the late Queen Mother. With a few differences. The old Queen could at least cite, as the justification for a lifelong grudge, her conviction that Wallis Simpson had devastated her own family life and ruined her husband\u2019s health. All Meghan Markle appears to have done to deserve a comparable level of visible ostracism from Kate and William is to conclude \u2013 admittedly rather late, and with scant notice \u2013 that a lifetime dedicated to trailing mutely in their wake would be unbearable. As a result, one hears the left-behind royals may now have to open more things and meet more subjects than usual. You can see why this might seem, as well as a nuisance, a rather pointed commentary on the ghastly, state-maintained life that Kate Middleton wanted for herself. But even so. It\u2019s not as if Meghan taught Kate\u2019s kids to Nazi salute. And even minus their pretensions to leadership in talking/reaching out, blanking rarely-seen family members in a church, in public, isn\u2019t the most civilised example from the Cambridges, future leaders of the family that, according to its own website, symbolically unifies the nation. Some viciously divorced civilians do better than this every week. Moreover, beaming impartially at friends and enemies is not even, unlike the Cambridges, a vital part of their day job. Kate, in particular, has previously demonstrated huge professionalism in this respect, bestowing the same, dazzling smile on Narenda Modi, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping as she does, crouching down in the curious way that royals consider essential in all child-encounters, on an innocent tot. Whatever crime Meghan and Harry have committed to be denied the same favour, it presumably strikes the Cambridges as worse than \u2013 to pick at random, from the above guests\u2019 specialities \u2013 sexual predation, brutal dictatorship and tolerating extreme violence against women and girls. In the Abbey scene, surely the finest among the multiple glories of Harry and Meghan\u2019s season one finale, we see a seated Meghan, smiling and waving like a pro at the approaching, then suddenly unsmiling Cambridges, who turn their backs, converse with everyone but them, then fall \u2013 William going, unsuccessfully, for dignified composure, Kate pursing into an unforgiving little face that would have discomfited the chattiest of tyrants \u2013 to ignoring them for the rest of the ceremony. Meghan, meanwhile, radiates artless goodwill. Her showy, green, caped outfit has already been acclaimed \u2013 along with its companion blue, and red pieces \u2013 as a superlatively choreographed, Diana-beating exercise in revenge dressing, but nothing confirmed the triumph that was the Sussexes\u2019 peerlessly executed exit better than the antics of his family. An intended official humiliation \u2013 with the Sussexes ostentatiously excluded from a royal parade \u2013 concluded as a disastrous face-off: Eloi 1; Morlocks nil. By this time all but Meghan\u2019s most dementedly racist persecutors must have spotted that, although well advised to swerve the oppressive littleness of much royal life, she is at the same time, given her ability to turn a secondary school visit into a touching national moment, its finest practitioner. All the family had to do was, for an hour or so, endure. When Hilary Mantel\u2019s 2013 essay on royal wives, Royal Bodies, prompted accusations that she\u2019d disrespected Kate (presumably, she wrote, the young woman was expected to \u201cbreed in some manners\u201d), the fuss obscured kindlier-sounding passages where she considered tawdry reminders for royals \u2013 the just-out-of-sight stacked chairs, canap\u00e9 detritus from a reception \u2013 that their entire purpose is for show. \u201cYou see,\u201d Mantel wrote, \u201cthat your life is a charade, that the scenery is cardboard, that the paint is peeling, the red carpet fraying, and if you linger you will notice the oily devotion fade from the faces of your subjects, and you will see their retreating backs as they turn up their collars and button their coats and walk away into real life.\u201d Maybe it took a professional actress to insist, as seems to be the Sussexes\u2019 plan, on a charade-life balance.

As I remember it, next Sunday\u2019s celebration has traditionally been a morning of handmade cards rashy with glitter, a proud bunch of tulips and perhaps jammy toast in bed. Of course these traditions have evolved \u2013 I\u2019ve been aware, as age has come, of the increasing number of afternoon tea deals and heavy marketing of heavy perfumes, neither of which offer much change from a hundred pound note.

While Stafford normally works from home on Fridays, her office has told employees to work from home during the week, with remote working expected for up to one month. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s the best thing for society as a whole,\u201d Stafford said of measures intended to lessen close person-to-person contact amid the outbreak. \u201cSo, I am 100% on board with the game plan.\u201d Yet, Stafford is concerned about one potential effect of this preventive measure. \u201cI live alone, I do not have pets, I only have my plants,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m a little bit nervous about what it\u2019s going to be like to spend this much time in isolation. Other than going out for a walk along the river, because that\u2019s what I consider safe social distancing at this point, I\u2019m really planning on avoiding other social engagements.\u201d Stafford is one of potentially millions of Americans whose daily life will be impacted by coronavirus-spurred measures to minimize in-person contact. As the number of US coronavirus cases continues to swell, both government authorities and private concerns have taken steps to foster \u201csocial distancing\u201d. Various US states and cities have enacted policies that limit close contact between people, in an attempt to slow this fast-moving outbreak; some of these mandates have included closing schools, prohibiting large gatherings, and limiting patrons at restaurants and bars. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered the closure of all Broadway shows until 13 April. Meanwhile, the National Basketball League suspended its season, as did Major League Soccer, National Hockey League and Major League Baseball. Performances and cultural events have been put off, as have some political rallies. Businesses across the US are increasingly encouraging their employees to work from home, as happened with Stafford\u2019s place of employ. These measures don\u2019t just keep people apart: they inevitably keep them from going out, requiring them to keep busy at home. \u201cI have at least 10 books I\u2019ve never read and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, this will come in really handy,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was planning to start a drawing class in April, because I\u2019ve always wanted to get into painting. I\u2019ve got all these art supplies. Now, I can pull up some YouTube videos, and teach myself to work on that.\u201d With her smart TV, she can do yoga and strength training exercises in her living room. \u201cI stocked up on some wine, so I can probably have FaceTime and wine hangouts with some friends,\u201d she said. Rebecca Dennett, a freelance stylist residing in Brooklyn, said she would prioritize when to leave the apartment and stick close to home. She would FaceTime and call people, and go on walks with friends. If the situation deteriorated and going outside, while maintaining distance from others, wasn\u2019t as viable an option, she\u2019d go on Netflix and \u201csort things out that I haven\u2019t\u201d around the house. \u201cMarie Kondo my apartment, that was one of my ideas,\u201d said Dennett, referring to the Japanese decluttering guru. \u201cI\u2019ve already done that, but I\u2019m probably just going to re-do it, have a wardrobe clean out.\u201d She doesn\u2019t tension with her roommates \u2013 two cats. \u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably going to be really happy, because I\u2019ll be around a lot more.\u201d Dana Humphrey, CEO of Whitegate PR, neither wants nor intends to weather mass disruptions of social activities at home. \u201cI am supposed to fly to Guatemala on Wednesday, and I sat on hold for two hours last night to see if i could fly out earlier,\u201d said Humphrey, a resident of New York City\u2019s Queens borough. \u201cSitting at home, not being able to go to events, is not OK for me.\u201d \u201cI just feel like there\u2019s no point in being in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here. I want to get out of here.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly afraid of what your neighbor is up to, it\u2019s no way to live.\u201d Ryan Walker, who DJs post-punk and goth rock at the Pyramid Club in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, said the venue is closed temporarily due to the outbreak. Walker, who also spends time at the Pyramid Club when he\u2019s not DJing, said he has fewer friends leaving home, \u201cso it\u2019s kind of less people to hang out with\u201d. \u201cThere is still reason to go out,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like, the people that are going out, we have a sense of humor about things, we understand the severity \u2026 but it\u2019s just our way of keeping our morale up.\u201d Walker \u2013 who said that while he\u2019s not \u201cwelding my door shut\u201d, he is limiting contact with older family members \u2013 said that he would find ways to occupy himself if the situation worsened. He would watch Netflix with his girlfriend or take online finance courses. \u201cSo yeah, that and probably just listen to more music,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always on the lookout for more music for my DJ sets. It would be an excuse for me to hang around and find danceable stuff that I\u2019ve never heard of before.\u201d Walker said his two roommates appeared to be handling the outbreak without incident. \u201cSo far, in our apartment, you probably wouldn\u2019t know there was a global pandemic outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could change, you know, it\u2019s supposed to be doubling everyday \u2026 so, we might be freaking out if you called me a week from now.\u201d",

There, Chinese authorities blocked all outdoor activities and halted the escalation, they argued. And, as the week wore on, and the number of deaths and sufferers across the world grew, more and more senior figures slowly began to question a British approach to coronavirus that began to look out of kilter with the responses of other countries including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.</p> \n<p>These criticisms were not just confined to politicians. \u201cSocial distancing has worked in China, Singapore and other countries,\u201d said Alan McNally, professor of microbial evolutionary genomics at Birmingham University. \u201cThere needs to be a combination of social distancing and extensive testing, followed by the quarantining of infected individuals to contain the epidemic \u2013 and that quarantine should not be at home, where we will see large levels of familial transmission, but in dedicated quarantine facilities.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Significant disruptions need high population compliance.

From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.</p>\n    <p>People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What does self-isolation mean?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cIf you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the <a href=\"http://www.health.gov.au/covid19-resources\">public transport guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cDuring the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don\u2019t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.\u201d</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cAsk others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don\u2019t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.\u201d</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cIf you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What if I feel sick?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including \u201cfever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.\u201d</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cIf you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Limiting the spread at home</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cTo minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas.

Cruise ship arrivals will also be banned for at least 30 days, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday, amid escalating efforts to contain the virus. The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening. A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman \u2013 a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge \u2013 died on Saturday. NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57. Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61. Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people. State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made. Penalties in some states include fines of thousands of dollars. The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable. On Friday the Council of Australia Governments decided to advise against \u201cstatic, non-essential\u201d mass public gatherings of 500 people or more, to apply from Monday.

      "body": "<p>With coronavirus upon us, one thing that probably needs to stop is this strange idea that anyone wants older people to die. That younger folk learn the old are vulnerable and think, \u201cThat\u2019s OK then.\u201d That Remainers think it\u2019s Old Testament-style payback for Brexit \u2013 a \u201cgammon\u201d apocalypse. Or that millennials are so embittered at how much easier past generations had it that they\u2019re happy for them to perish.</p> <p>If you perused certain sections of social media, you\u2019d think we were all busy stockpiling either ageist prejudices or paranoiac visions about the young wishing the old dead. That we\u2019re truly living in an era of militant ageism. But really, who are these militant ageists \u2013 does anyone actually know one?</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the elderly who are vulnerable \u2013 other groups include those with underlying conditions, disabled people and babies. But it\u2019s the elderly who have been the butt of gallows humour and worse. Then again, isn\u2019t this just the online cesspit? Somewhere, doubtless chiselled on a stone tablet, the first rule of the internet states: \u201cWhatever dost happen, big or small, there will always be a sizable group of people spouting appalling shit about it.\u201d Online Britain vents \u2013 it\u2019s what it does \u2013 but do such attitudes exist in the real world?</p> <p>Rationally, it\u2019s unlikely; emotionally, it\u2019s unthinkable. Older people are not some disposable, abstract concept to younger generations. Most of us have older relatives whom we love. Which explains why, for all the internet yak, I\u2019ve met a grand total of no one who feels relieved or smug that old people are in danger. On the contrary, people seem extremely concerned about ageing relatives and older neighbours who live alone. In reality, the intergenerational hate we\u2019re all supposed to be sloshing about in vanishes like the toxic, childish mirage it is.</p> <p>And thank God for that. There is quite enough to worry about without some twist on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/26/1\" title=\"\"><em>Logan\u2019s Run</em></a> kicking off. The idea of looking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-as-many-as-10000-in-britain-may-already-have-it-says-pm\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson for answers</a> feels plain weird \u2013 I\u2019d be more likely to hunt out the Magic 8-Ball I got from Amazon and give that a good shake. Tactless words have been said and written (talk of \u201cculls\u201d of the elderly?). And, naturally, our every own anti-Cassandra, <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/ann-widdecombe-coronavirus-aids-hiv-epidemic-twitter-response-9402006\" title=\"\">Ann Widdecombe</a>, couldn\u2019t resist wading in, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the scare of Sars, bird flu, Ebola and, of course, Aids. None proved as devastating as feared.\u201d So around 35 million Aids-related deaths isn\u2019t devastating?

      "bodyText": "With coronavirus upon us, one thing that probably needs to stop is this strange idea that anyone wants older people to die. That younger folk learn the old are vulnerable and think, \u201cThat\u2019s OK then.\u201d That Remainers think it\u2019s Old Testament-style payback for Brexit \u2013 a \u201cgammon\u201d apocalypse. Or that millennials are so embittered at how much easier past generations had it that they\u2019re happy for them to perish. If you perused certain sections of social media, you\u2019d think we were all busy stockpiling either ageist prejudices or paranoiac visions about the young wishing the old dead. That we\u2019re truly living in an era of militant ageism. But really, who are these militant ageists \u2013 does anyone actually know one? It\u2019s not just the elderly who are vulnerable \u2013 other groups include those with underlying conditions, disabled people and babies. But it\u2019s the elderly who have been the butt of gallows humour and worse. Then again, isn\u2019t this just the online cesspit? Somewhere, doubtless chiselled on a stone tablet, the first rule of the internet states: \u201cWhatever dost happen, big or small, there will always be a sizable group of people spouting appalling shit about it.\u201d Online Britain vents \u2013 it\u2019s what it does \u2013 but do such attitudes exist in the real world? Rationally, it\u2019s unlikely; emotionally, it\u2019s unthinkable. Older people are not some disposable, abstract concept to younger generations. Most of us have older relatives whom we love. Which explains why, for all the internet yak, I\u2019ve met a grand total of no one who feels relieved or smug that old people are in danger. On the contrary, people seem extremely concerned about ageing relatives and older neighbours who live alone. In reality, the intergenerational hate we\u2019re all supposed to be sloshing about in vanishes like the toxic, childish mirage it is. And thank God for that. There is quite enough to worry about without some twist on Logan\u2019s Run kicking off. The idea of looking to Boris Johnson for answers feels plain weird \u2013 I\u2019d be more likely to hunt out the Magic 8-Ball I got from Amazon and give that a good shake. Tactless words have been said and written (talk of \u201cculls\u201d of the elderly?). And, naturally, our every own anti-Cassandra, Ann Widdecombe, couldn\u2019t resist wading in, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the scare of Sars, bird flu, Ebola and, of course, Aids. None proved as devastating as feared.\u201d So around 35 million Aids-related deaths isn\u2019t devastating? Thanks for letting us know, Ms Widdecombe. So, as always, there\u2019s tons of stupid going around. Maybe, by now, there\u2019s even a deepening suspicion among the elderly that the young really would dance on their graves. My advice: don\u2019t fall for the online hype. Coronavirus is about many things, but it\u2019s not about ageism.

The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure. \u201cSchools have been a focus of the community and the government as the impacts of the coronavirus have developed globally,\u201d Scott said. \u201cFrom Monday onwards I expect assemblies and substantial gatherings to be cancelled, along with all excursions.\u201d All interschool arts and sports events have also been cancelled. But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said widespread school closures would not take place, despite a raft of other new measures to contain the spread of the virus. Morrison said the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday heard that taking children out of school and putting them into the community may actually hasten the spread of the disease and the disruption to critical workforce like nurses and doctors is too great. \u201cPeople are naturally anxious about the issue of schools,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Sydney. \u201cAs the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of widescale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these [disease] curves operate. \u201cWhen you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said school closures are inevitable and state and territory departments are preparing for closure by encouraging schools to prepare online learning resources. Three schools in Victoria and four in NSW have already closed temporarily but these are referred to as spot closures rather than a widespread shutdown. Another reason for the delay is that closing schools would mean many healthcare and other essential workers would have to stay home to care for young children, further disrupting the healthcare system. The future of the schools will be discussed again on Tuesday and Friday, Morrison said. Senior education sources said there was a split over what was the \u201copportune public health decision\u201d with tension between health experts over closing schools now or later. \u201cGiven that schools may be closed for months is it too early to close them now when there is only a handful of cases of potential infection,\u201d one source said. Schools are expected to introduce new social distancing measures this week, including scrapping school assemblies, school plays and concerts and reducing interschool activities. The senior vice-president of the NSW Teachers\u2019 Federation, Amber Flohm, said teachers had the technology available to deliver online learning but many children could be disadvantaged if they didn\u2019t have access to computers and the internet. \u201cWe are not doctors, we\u2019re teachers, and so the decision will be for them and the department of education will respond accordingly,\u201d Flohm said. \u201cThere will be an equity issue. I would argue a lot of kids don\u2019t have laptops. Children might have mobile phones but if we\u2019re talking about delivering the curriculum, significant resources would need to be provided for teachers and students.\u201d Flohm dismissed a claim by the Greens MP David Shoebridge that not all schools provided soap for children to wash their hands. \u201cIt is my understanding that all public schools have soap and access to water in their bathrooms \u2026 that\u2019s not what we have heard from teachers.\u201d The former Australian Medical Association president Kerryn Phelps called for schools to be immediately shut down despite the disruption to medical personnel who would have to care for children. Phelps, a Sydney GP, also said all children should be tested for a fever when arriving at school if schools are kept open. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable in the middle of an uncontrolled epidemic that the schools will be closed,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when. \u201cUnless the government has convincing evidence that the schools can safely be kept open, that should be now.\u201d",

The feeling of lightness proved liberating, and being able to swim without the weight of equipment won her over instantly. She began competing at world championship level \u2013 taking part in events where divers perform in different disciplines to see who can dive the deepest, or stay underwater the longest, with no breathing apparatus. There are 11 types of freediving \u2013 for example, diving for depth or swimming horizontally, with or without weights, with or without fins, in open water or swimming pools. Nordblad specialises in dynamic freediving with fins, which involves swimming as far as possible horizontally underwater on one breath.</p> <p>In 2004, in Cyprus, she set the women\u2019s world record by swimming a horizontal distance of 158m, and since then she has ranked among the best freedivers in the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe most difficult thing is watching the seconds go by. After two or three minutes your mind starts listing all the reasons why you should go back up to the surface instead of staying underwater. The more time goes by, the harder it gets. You need a lot of self-control,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But then, in 2010, a serious accident changed her life and set her on the path to make her mark in a new discipline, one in which she still holds the current world record: freediving under ice.</p> <p>\u201cI was riding a downhill bike, travelling a slippery, muddy path down a hill when suddenly I began to slip,\u201d she recounts. \u201cThe fall wasn\u2019t particularly dangerous, but I was unlucky and I hit a rock. My left leg was smashed into a thousand pieces, like a twisted branch.\u201d Rushed to hospital, Nordblad underwent delicate surgery. The swelling and compound fractures were so serious that the doctors weren\u2019t able to sew the leg back up and close the wounds until another 10 days had passed.</p> <p>A graphic designer by trade, she decided to sell her agency in Helsinki and say goodbye to the 13 people who were working for her to concentrate on rehabilitation, a painful and complex process that lasted for more than 18 months, consuming all her energies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a198b6c4177bec0a0b18358921b2b7c36f63ada3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a198b6c4177bec0a0b18358921b2b7c36f63ada3/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My leg smashed into a thousand pieces\u2019: Nordblad on the bicycle accident that sparked her diving career.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My leg smashed into a thousand pieces\u2019: Nordblad on the bicycle accident that sparked her diving career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After another year had passed she was finally able to walk without a stick, but the nerves in her leg were so badly damaged that the pain was profound and persistent. \u201cThat\u2019s when my doctor recommended I try cold-water therapy,\u201d says Nordblad. \u201cThe first time I put my leg in 4C water I only managed to keep it in for a minute, but the relief was immediate. Finally, it didn\u2019t hurt any more.\u201d</p> <p>As the months passed, Nordblad became so accustomed to the cold that she found she could no longer do without it. She began immersing the other leg as well, then her entire body, ultimately even her head. \u201cI liked the way it felt. That\u2019s when I first got the idea of diving beneath the ice. What better place to try it than Finland?\u201d</p> <p>In what is known as apnea \u2013 conducted beneath the ice \u2013 the diver has to move horizontally, covering a preset distance between two holes cut into the ice. In 2015, Nordblad set the women\u2019s world record in this discipline \u2013 50m \u2013 wearing only a simple swimsuit and goggles. The water temperature was barely 2C. \u201cUp until the end I was afraid that my head, the part of the body that suffers the most during low-temperature dives, couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d she confesses. \u201cBut in reality things were easier than I\u2019d anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>While her sister is preparing dinner, Nordblad sits on the little wooden dock that runs out from the bank into the lake, busy breaking up the thin layer of ice that\u2019s formed on the water\u2019s surface over the past couple of days. After she\u2019s pushed a few sections underwater, she lights a series of candles that illuminate the wooden stairs leading down into the water. Soon she\u2019ll be able to take the first dive of the season. She\u2019s been waiting for this moment for weeks, and it stirs emotions she finds hard to conceal.</p> <p>\u201cI love diving, feeling the water run between your fingers\u2026 When you\u2019re down below there\u2019s no margin for error. You have only yourself to trust. You have to be relaxed and in control at the same time,\u201d she explains. \u201cFreediving requires physical effort, but mental discipline is even more important. You have to do the dive without panicking or losing your head.\u201d</p> <p>Swimming beneath ice has other pitfalls. Visibility is one, since the thick layer of ice and snow on the water\u2019s surface often reduces vision to a minimum. It\u2019s easy to become disoriented and not be able to even see the exit hole, so much so that safety ropes are extended between the holes. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t even make out my own hands. That\u2019s how dark the water can be. In the event of a real emergency, my safety plan is to swim down deeper below the surface. That\u2019s the only way I can look up and see light coming in from the two holes and figure out where I can get out.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s hard to believe, Nordblad is afraid of the depths. Every time she goes freediving and swims down to the Finnish lakebed, her mind turns to sea monsters and unknown creatures that populate the abyss. \u201cThe deepest point I reach corresponds to the extreme limits of my ability to dominate my fears. Otherwise I could go much deeper,\u201d she says with a smile.</p> <p>Although she still holds the record for diving beneath the ice, for Nordblad freediving has long since evolved into something more than a desire to beat her opponents. \u201cIf you compete with that mentality, you\u2019re not enjoying the moment. I don\u2019t deny I thought that way when I was younger, but now I don\u2019t like it any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ca4641272a3144b385c2b285c164507a814812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ca4641272a3144b385c2b285c164507a814812/0_213_5616_3509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018So many windows of opportunity open up around you\u2019: Nordblad on winning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So many windows of opportunity open up around you\u2019: Nordblad on winning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you win, the expectations of those around you increase automatically,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many different windows of opportunity open up around you that you have to be good at figuring out what you want from life and what you truly desire from this sport.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, Nordblad earned one of just three government grants reserved for non-Olympic Finnish athletes. Not by chance, that was the year she found herself training the least. \u201cGoing to the pool just wasn\u2019t fun any more. I was losing motivation. I love apnea because I find it more stimulating than spending hours looking at a computer screen, but I realised I was turning it into a job just like any other,\u201d she explains. \u201cOne of the most beautiful periods of my life was the time just after my rehabilitation. I spent two years out in the open: I would take my kayak and go out and explore the islands around Helsinki. There are hundreds of them, and all you need is to paddle for five minutes before you\u2019re completely lost in nature.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the month Nordblad will attempt to beat the men\u2019s ice freediving world record (currently standing at 76.2m and held by Stig Severinsen, a Danish four-time world freediving champion). She is aiming to swim horizontally beneath the ice for 81m. She will take the challenge in her stride, almost as if it were a game. Sometimes that\u2019s how remarkable achievements are accomplished.</p>",

Nordblad specialises in dynamic freediving with fins, which involves swimming as far as possible horizontally underwater on one breath. In 2004, in Cyprus, she set the women\u2019s world record by swimming a horizontal distance of 158m, and since then she has ranked among the best freedivers in the world. \u201cThe most difficult thing is watching the seconds go by. After two or three minutes your mind starts listing all the reasons why you should go back up to the surface instead of staying underwater. The more time goes by, the harder it gets. You need a lot of self-control,\u201d she says. But then, in 2010, a serious accident changed her life and set her on the path to make her mark in a new discipline, one in which she still holds the current world record: freediving under ice. \u201cI was riding a downhill bike, travelling a slippery, muddy path down a hill when suddenly I began to slip,\u201d she recounts. \u201cThe fall wasn\u2019t particularly dangerous, but I was unlucky and I hit a rock. My left leg was smashed into a thousand pieces, like a twisted branch.\u201d Rushed to hospital, Nordblad underwent delicate surgery. The swelling and compound fractures were so serious that the doctors weren\u2019t able to sew the leg back up and close the wounds until another 10 days had passed. A graphic designer by trade, she decided to sell her agency in Helsinki and say goodbye to the 13 people who were working for her to concentrate on rehabilitation, a painful and complex process that lasted for more than 18 months, consuming all her energies. After another year had passed she was finally able to walk without a stick, but the nerves in her leg were so badly damaged that the pain was profound and persistent. \u201cThat\u2019s when my doctor recommended I try cold-water therapy,\u201d says Nordblad. \u201cThe first time I put my leg in 4C water I only managed to keep it in for a minute, but the relief was immediate. Finally, it didn\u2019t hurt any more.\u201d As the months passed, Nordblad became so accustomed to the cold that she found she could no longer do without it. She began immersing the other leg as well, then her entire body, ultimately even her head. \u201cI liked the way it felt. That\u2019s when I first got the idea of diving beneath the ice. What better place to try it than Finland?\u201d In what is known as apnea \u2013 conducted beneath the ice \u2013 the diver has to move horizontally, covering a preset distance between two holes cut into the ice. In 2015, Nordblad set the women\u2019s world record in this discipline \u2013 50m \u2013 wearing only a simple swimsuit and goggles. The water temperature was barely 2C. \u201cUp until the end I was afraid that my head, the part of the body that suffers the most during low-temperature dives, couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d she confesses. \u201cBut in reality things were easier than I\u2019d anticipated.\u201d While her sister is preparing dinner, Nordblad sits on the little wooden dock that runs out from the bank into the lake, busy breaking up the thin layer of ice that\u2019s formed on the water\u2019s surface over the past couple of days. After she\u2019s pushed a few sections underwater, she lights a series of candles that illuminate the wooden stairs leading down into the water. Soon she\u2019ll be able to take the first dive of the season. She\u2019s been waiting for this moment for weeks, and it stirs emotions she finds hard to conceal. \u201cI love diving, feeling the water run between your fingers\u2026 When you\u2019re down below there\u2019s no margin for error. You have only yourself to trust. You have to be relaxed and in control at the same time,\u201d she explains. \u201cFreediving requires physical effort, but mental discipline is even more important. You have to do the dive without panicking or losing your head.\u201d Swimming beneath ice has other pitfalls. Visibility is one, since the thick layer of ice and snow on the water\u2019s surface often reduces vision to a minimum. It\u2019s easy to become disoriented and not be able to even see the exit hole, so much so that safety ropes are extended between the holes. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t even make out my own hands. That\u2019s how dark the water can be. In the event of a real emergency, my safety plan is to swim down deeper below the surface. That\u2019s the only way I can look up and see light coming in from the two holes and figure out where I can get out.\u201d Although it\u2019s hard to believe, Nordblad is afraid of the depths. Every time she goes freediving and swims down to the Finnish lakebed, her mind turns to sea monsters and unknown creatures that populate the abyss. \u201cThe deepest point I reach corresponds to the extreme limits of my ability to dominate my fears. Otherwise I could go much deeper,\u201d she says with a smile. Although she still holds the record for diving beneath the ice, for Nordblad freediving has long since evolved into something more than a desire to beat her opponents. \u201cIf you compete with that mentality, you\u2019re not enjoying the moment. I don\u2019t deny I thought that way when I was younger, but now I don\u2019t like it any more. \u201cWhen you win, the expectations of those around you increase automatically,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many different windows of opportunity open up around you that you have to be good at figuring out what you want from life and what you truly desire from this sport.\u201d In 2006, Nordblad earned one of just three government grants reserved for non-Olympic Finnish athletes. Not by chance, that was the year she found herself training the least. \u201cGoing to the pool just wasn\u2019t fun any more. I was losing motivation. I love apnea because I find it more stimulating than spending hours looking at a computer screen, but I realised I was turning it into a job just like any other,\u201d she explains. \u201cOne of the most beautiful periods of my life was the time just after my rehabilitation. I spent two years out in the open: I would take my kayak and go out and explore the islands around Helsinki. There are hundreds of them, and all you need is to paddle for five minutes before you\u2019re completely lost in nature.\u201d At the end of the month Nordblad will attempt to beat the men\u2019s ice freediving world record (currently standing at 76.2m and held by Stig Severinsen, a Danish four-time world freediving champion). She is aiming to swim horizontally beneath the ice for 81m. She will take the challenge in her stride, almost as if it were a game. Sometimes that\u2019s how remarkable achievements are accomplished.",

      "bodyText": "Old-Lands, Monmouthshire This historic country estate has been in the same family since the 1800s. Today\u2019s inhabitants moved in with their young family five years ago and have slowly introduced a form of traditional, sustainable grazing management that is transforming the once intensively farmed fields into a species-rich landscape. Guests can stay in one of three cottages that surround a central courtyard that\u2019s alive with bees and butterflies. There\u2019s an honesty shop on site, featuring fruit and veg from the walled garden, locally made bread and vintage bits and pieces from \u201cthe big house\u2019s attics\u201d. The owner \u2013 the ninth Sam Bosanquet \u2013 is an ecologist offering guided nature tours of the estate. There\u2019s also a weekend forest school for kids, a treasure hunt, and the option to preorder a fridge-full of homemade meals on arrival. \u2022 From \u00a3300 for three nights, old-lands.co.uk Sartfell Rural Retreat, Isle of Man In 2016, the Isle of Man was awarded Biosphere Reserve status by Unesco. Dolphins, minke whales and basking sharks swim in the waters here, while bats, wild polecats, mountain hares and hedgehogs roam the land. From the summer, visitors will be able to stay on Cloud Nine \u2013 a sparsely populated area in the west of the island. Here, a retired couple are working with the Manx Wildlife Trust to return three hectares of denuded farmland into a haven for frogs, rare orchids, hen harriers, buzzards and butterflies. (Pygmy shrews are the latest newcomers.) Accommodation is in a newly converted, 19th-century Manx cottage that overlooks the rolling hills of Sartfell. A visitor centre is also under construction, which aims to educate young people in the importance of sustainable living. \u2022 From \u00a3300 for three nights, facebook.com/SartfellNatureReserve Dodgson Wood, Cumbria Nibthwaite Grange Farm is an upland farm in the Lake District National Park that has been farmed by the same family for six generations. Today, it is managed by John Atkinson and his partner, Maria Benjamin, who have \u201creversed the clock\u201d by keeping rare breeds of cattle and sheep in the meadows and fields that surround the river Crake and Coniston Water. These are rotated throughout the year, which has led to a huge increase in biodiversity. Similarly, by cutting hay meadows later in the year, they are allowing plants to flower and seed, which encourages insects and the birds that feed on them. The farm borders Dodgson Wood \u2013 a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Guests can stay in a range of eco-accommodation, including an off-grid, 16th-century farmhouse, a secluded, lakeside campsite, or a newly renovated former cowshed. Stock up on soap made from the farm\u2019s Jersey cow\u2019s milk, and wool products woven from the fleeces of their flock of rare sheep. \u2022 From \u00a3300 for three nights, dodgsonwood.co.uk Fritton Lake, Suffolk Fritton Lake is a luxurious holiday resort set within the majestic Somerleyton estate that stretches across 2,000 hectares of East Anglia. Two years ago, Hugh Somerleyton began working with Rewilding Britain in order to give a fifth of his estate back to nature. Guests can enjoy the wood-fired hot tubs on the deck of their lakeside own lodge, while the patchwork of heath, woodland, wetland and former arable land around them slowly returns to its natural, uncultivated state. This is part of a wider ambition \u2013 The Wild East Project \u2013 which is described as a \u201csuper-regional nature recovery plan\u201d. Landowners and conservation organisations have joined forces with the aim of creating momentum for landscape-scale nature recovery across the whole of the county of East Anglia. \u2022 From \u00a390 a night, fritton-lake.co.uk Elmley Nature Reserve, Kent The Elmley National Nature Reserve is a 1,300-hectare family-run estate tucked away on the Isle of Sheppey in northern Kent. It is home to a huge number of rare and endangered species, including breeding wading birds, hares, owls, marsh harriers, water voles, avocets and dragonflies, which hover over and hop between the shallow ponds that riddle this low-lying rural landscape. Elmley is the only nature reserve in the UK where you can actually spend the night. Visitors can choose from one of several overnight options: shepherd\u2019s huts, a calm, contemporary cottage or a luxurious 18th-century farmhouse. This isn\u2019t rewilding per se (the manmade landscape is carefully controlled), but a visit to Elmley offers total immersion in a landscape that, 40 years ago, was given over to intensive farming. \u2022 From \u00a385 a night, elmleynaturereserve.co.uk Knepp Safaris, West Sussex At 1,400 hectares, Knepp is the biggest rewilding project in lowland Britain. As such, it is well-equipped for visitors eager to discover what\u2019s happened to the land since the owners, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, halted decades of intensive farming and returned it to nature in 2001. The estate offers a range of guided nature safaris (by vehicle or on foot), which show the profusion of animals, birds, bats, plants and insects that have flourished here since the disappearance of herbicides and pesticides. There are bell tents, yurts, tree houses and shepherd\u2019s huts to stay in, or you can pitch your own tent in a wildflower meadow on the edge of an ancient woodland. Tree has written a book, Wilding, about her experience at Knepp that makes perfect fireside reading. \u2022 From \u00a320pppn for a pitch, kneppsafaris.co.uk Dundreggan, Inverness At 4,000 hectares, Dundreggan is Scotland\u2019s flagship rewilding estate. It was purchased by the Trees for Life charity in 2008 who set about replanting the overgrazed land, creating a new wild forest that is now home to more than 4,000 plant and animal species. Rewilding holidays are organised throughout the year and involve three or four days of tree planting followed by a couple of days spent working in the onsite tree nursery. Volunteers can book individually or as a group and will stay in Dundreggan Lodge, which sleeps 12 and overlooks the river Moriston. The charity has recently announced plans to create the world\u2019s first rewilding centre in Dundreggan, which is scheduled to open in 2022 alongside new accommodation for up to 40 people. The centre is aimed to encourage longer, more immersive experiences for volunteers, students and researchers keen to explore this ancient landscape. \u2022 \u00a3435 a week, treesforlife.org.uk/dundreggan Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire In 1899, Wicken Fen \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s most important wetlands \u2013 was a two-acre nature reserve. Today, it is in its 21st year of a 100-year plan to expand the reserve to 53km\u00b2 of wild landscape. The site, which comprises wet grassland, reed beds and open water, is now home to herds of konik ponies and highland cattle, which graze at low density, which helps increase biodiversity. Already home to more than 9,000 species of plants, animals, birds and insects, the reserve has seen overwintering birds, short-eared owls and lapwing return since it started rewilding. Visitors can immerse themselves in the sights and sounds of this changing landscape by staying in one of four raised, open-fronted shelters, each sleeping about six. Access is by foot or bike only. (Booking is essential and is for the whole site only.) \u2022 From \u00a340 a night, wickenwildcamping@nationaltrust.org.uk Killiehuntly Farmhouse, Kingussie, Highlands This luxury lodge is one of 12 properties that sit on the estate belonging to Wildland, an ambitious project dedicated to the conservation and restoration of 90,000 hectares of northern Scotland. Killiehuntly is a working farm and a sturdy, historic lodge that has been reimagined with natural materials and local, hand-crafted furniture. (The aesthetic is described as \u201cScandi-Scot\u201d \u2013 the owners are Danish.) After a day spent hiking the heather-clad hills, guests can brave the outdoor plunge pool and wood-fired sauna yurt before a communal meal of freshly picked produce. \u2022 From \u00a3360 for dinner, bed and breakfast, killiehuntly.scot/killiehuntly Cambrian Wildwood, West Wales The Cambrian Wildwood is a community project in the early stages of habitat restoration. The 140-hectare site \u2013 which is in the Cambrian mountains, with far-reaching views towards the sea \u2013 is an area of open moorland and ancient woodland. Internal fencing is slowly being dismantled, and a herd of wild horses has been introduced to the landscape (their grazing should allow a greater variety of plant species to establish themselves). An ambitious tree-planting project will eventually allow the native woodland to colonise the landscape naturally. There is an annual open day at the nearby historic house, Y Plas, on 18 April, which includes a small exhibition, talks and activities for children, followed by a guided walk of Wildwood. For a longer exploration, visitors to this can stay in the nearby cottage or barn at Cefn Coch Farm. The owner, Joe Hope, is a farmer and ecologist who runs guided nature walks of this unique \u201cCeltic rainforest\u201d. \u2022 From \u00a3210 for three nights, cambrianwildwood.org Wilder side: retreats and courses to book Embercombe, Exeter Embercombe offers a range of rewilding retreats, from equinox experience weekends and unplugged week-long yurt stays, to year-long wilding courses that promise an \u201cimmersive journey\u201d with stopovers at some of Britain\u2019s flagship rewilding projects. \u2022 From \u00a3125 for a weekend, embercombe.org The Old Way, Devon Less of a holiday, more of a series of survival courses, The Old Way aims to teach participants forgotten \u201chunter-gatherer lifeways\u201d. The course takes place between April and December across different habitats for five days at a time, and explores the lost arts of hunting, fishing, foraging, tracking, primitive craft and mindfulness in the landscape. \u2022 \u00a32,500 for a year-long course, theoldway.info/devon The Nature Sessions, Kent The Nature Sessions runs a seasonal programme of day and/or weekend retreats in rural Kent. The gentle itinerary is designed to instil complete calm and connectedness to nature. There is outdoor yoga and meditation, wild swimming, a craft workshop, nature safaris and communal dining in small groups under the stars. The next weekend retreat will be held at Elmley Nature Reserve 15-17 May. \u2022 From \u00a3100, naturesessions.co.uk",

On the less super, but still delegate-heavy, Tuesday that followed, Biden won four out of six states and established a delegate lead that looks unassailable. </p> <p>Speaking after his first big win, Biden seemed as surprised as anyone, and not just because<a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/joe-biden-reacts-wife-jill-defending-him-protester-t175276\"> an anti-dairy protester had rushed</a> him on the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce4f8bcd5f3bb8fbcc457e95641b536091e9439f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce4f8bcd5f3bb8fbcc457e95641b536091e9439f/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scranton, Pennsylvania: Biden\u2019s hometown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scranton, Pennsylvania: Biden\u2019s hometown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!\u201d Biden told his supporters in Los Angeles.</p> <p>\u201cTo those who\u2019ve [been] knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead.\u201d</p> <p>Biden wasn\u2019t exaggerating. The influential, and frequently accurate, US polling site<a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\"> FiveThirtyEight</a> had given Biden just a one in 12 chance of winning the nomination outright. Bernie Sanders was considered the most likely nominee \u2013 but not any more.</p> <p>Media coverage has shifted from talk of a contested convention, where neither Biden nor Sanders have enough delegates to win the nomination, to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/joe-biden-dropping-hints-vp-150413413.html\">whom Biden will pick</a> as his running mate and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/11/trump-will-corrupt-everything-sight-beat-biden-heres-whats-next/\">what a Biden-Trump election</a> will look like. Meanwhile, the ashes of Sanders\u2019 campaign are being sifted through to work out what went wrong.</p> <p>Super Tuesday not only handed back Biden the frontrunner status he held for much of 2019 \u2013 it handed him a big pot of money, too. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/politics/biden-fundraising-bernie-brothers/index.html\">His campaign said</a> it had raked in $22m in the five days following that vote, a colossal amount considering it took Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/01/politics/2020-democratic-race-financing/index.html\">three months to raise $23.2m</a> at the end of 2019.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s surge has little to do with Pennsylvania, which only votes on 28 April, and much more to do with<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-voters-know-what-they-want-tuesday-it-was-joe-n1151001\"> his strong support</a> among African Americans in the south.

We talk a lot here. We know he has a tendency sometimes to maybe go on a little too much \u2013 that would be from living around here,\u201d Owens said.</p> <p>It is, in part, Biden\u2019s talking that has been a major weakness.

Scranton, a town of 77,000 nestled in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s Wyoming Valley, is firmly a part of America\u2019s rust belt \u2013 a band of towns and cities stretching nearly a thousand miles from Wisconsin in the west all the way through Pennsylvania in the east.</p> <p>The communities in the rust belt suffered more than most from de-industrialization, as coalmines, steel plants and car factories closed, and some areas still suffer from chronic unemployment. Scranton was once home to the coal industry, and the city and region boomed in the 1930s and 40s, but the decline was just as swift. As the US turned to oil and gas for its energy, mines closed and jobs were lost.</p> <p>Biden and his family moved to Delaware in 1953 after his father struggled to find work in Pennsylvania. The future vice-president became a US senator for the state in 1973.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ec5895df634992907e701ebd5042c0b8ac704c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ec5895df634992907e701ebd5042c0b8ac704c1/0_0_4615_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden gets a hug from a supporter after he laid out his economic policy plan at the Scranton Cultural Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden gets a hug from a supporter after he laid out his economic policy plan at the Scranton Cultural Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Loomis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump swept into communities like Scranton in 2016, wooing disenchanted working-class voters who had previously voted for Democrats with his hazy promise to Make America Great Again. He<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/pennsylvania\"> won Pennsylvania</a> by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 47.5%, and he narrowly triumphed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, too.</p> <p>In 2020, that means Biden\u2019s background is a key part of his case to be the Democratic nominee. If he is chosen, it could prove crucial in recapturing those states and the White House. Biden\u2019s case for being the nominee is based, in part, around his ability to win in the midwest, and he will point to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/10/us/elections/results-michigan-president-democrat-primary-election.html\">his convincing win in Michigan</a> on Tuesday as supporting evidence.</p> <p>That success in the rust belt was a long time in the making, and came after a concerted effort to make people aware of his upbringing: in the space of two weeks at the end of 2019 Biden was still pumping out shamelessly Scranton-specific advertisements, including \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pr_NcJK5Tw\">Scranton Values</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98mI1tTkVM\">A Kid from Scranton</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In those ads, as in person, Biden looks good for his 77 years. Straight-backed and easily 6ft tall, he looks little different from the decade-old cardboard version of him at Hanks, which apparently is a popular gift.</p> <p>\u201cI have the same cardboard cut-out. I got it for my mom,\u201d said Ailish Renton, who was buying a sandwich.</p> <p>\u201cShe likes him.

During his years in the Senate Biden voted for the Iraq war and<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html\"> opposed</a> bussing African American children to predominantly white, better performing, schools, and he supports moderate policies that are anathema to the 18-29 crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/bernie-sanders-stay-in-drag-biden-left-movement-lives-2020-democratic-election\">Sanders stays, so his movement can live on by dragging Biden leftward</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday Sanders said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/11/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-democratic-primaries-michigan-live-coverage\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/11/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-democratic-primaries-michigan-live-coverage\">was staying in the race</a>, and his fervent youth support may be the only thing troubling Biden. Younger people, who already make up a relatively small slice of the electorate, are turning out in lower numbers than in 2016, when Sanders ran Hillary Clinton close, however, and it would take something unprecedented for Sanders to change that in the next few weeks.</p> <p>If Biden can overcome his young people problem, and perhaps even if he can\u2019t, then he will probably be the Democratic candidate for president. Win the election, and given his frequent visits to Scranton, it is likely the town will experience a visit by a president at some point.</p> <p>Given his affinity with his hometown, however, it\u2019s likely that even if Biden loses, he will always be welcome in Scranton.</p> <p>Particularly by one young woman\u2019s mother.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Scranton store where a young Joe Biden used to buy his candy is still in operation today, a stone\u2019s throw from the wood-slatted house where the presidential candidate grew up. It\u2019s called Hank\u2019s Hoagies now, in honor of the idiosyncratic Pennsylvania term for a sandwich on a long bread roll, and almost 70 years since Biden left Scranton, his presence lives on \u2013 in the form of a lifesize cardboard cut out lurking behind the store\u2019s front door. \u201cWe love him,\u201d Tom Owens, the owner of Hanks, said by way of explanation. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. I think he\u2019d be a great president.\u201d Biden\u2019s dream of becoming president had looked to be over at the end of February. The 77-year-old had lost, by some distance, the first three states of the Democratic primary, was running out of money, and had sagged badly in the polls. Yet Biden won South Carolina, the fourth state to vote, on 6 March with a surprisingly strong showing. Even so, few predicted what came next. Biden won 10 out of the next 14 states, on Super Tuesday picking up more delegates than anyone else. On the less super, but still delegate-heavy, Tuesday that followed, Biden won four out of six states and established a delegate lead that looks unassailable. Speaking after his first big win, Biden seemed as surprised as anyone, and not just because an anti-dairy protester had rushed him on the stage. \u201cThey don\u2019t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!\u201d Biden told his supporters in Los Angeles. \u201cTo those who\u2019ve [been] knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead.\u201d Biden wasn\u2019t exaggerating. The influential, and frequently accurate, US polling site FiveThirtyEight had given Biden just a one in 12 chance of winning the nomination outright. Bernie Sanders was considered the most likely nominee \u2013 but not any more. Media coverage has shifted from talk of a contested convention, where neither Biden nor Sanders have enough delegates to win the nomination, to whom Biden will pick as his running mate and what a Biden-Trump election will look like. Meanwhile, the ashes of Sanders\u2019 campaign are being sifted through to work out what went wrong. Super Tuesday not only handed back Biden the frontrunner status he held for much of 2019 \u2013 it handed him a big pot of money, too. His campaign said it had raked in $22m in the five days following that vote, a colossal amount considering it took Biden three months to raise $23.2m at the end of 2019. Biden\u2019s surge has little to do with Pennsylvania, which only votes on 28 April, and much more to do with his strong support among African Americans in the south. Nevertheless, Biden\u2019s perceived earthy nature, which his Scranton childhood symbolizes, is a big selling point for voters hoping he could win back midwest states from Donald Trump in November. \u201cHe\u2019s an honest guy, the kind of guy you respect, which we seem to be lacking a little bit in our leadership now,\u201d Owens said. \u201cHe\u2019s down to earth. I think he\u2019d be a great president.\u201d Biden is never shy of leaning into his Scranton background, having visited the city frequently while campaigning for Barack Obama, and Owens said Biden\u2019s place of birth was visible in his persona. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blue collar people here. We talk a lot here. We know he has a tendency sometimes to maybe go on a little too much \u2013 that would be from living around here,\u201d Owens said. It is, in part, Biden\u2019s talking that has been a major weakness. He turned in a series of lackluster debate performances through the end of 2019 and into 2020, sometimes stumbling over his words and at times looking like a relic of a bygone era. In the past three weeks alone, Biden has mistakenly claimed: \u201cTomorrow is Super Thursday\u201d, on the day before Super Tuesday; stated 125 million people had been shot dead in the US since 2007 \u2013 the actual figure is less than 500,000 \u2013 and launched into an expletive-laced row with an auto-worker about \u201cAR-14\u201d guns, when a years-long debate has actually taken place over the appropriateness of AR-15 weapons. Donald Trump picked up on Biden\u2019s gaffes when the president himself appeared in Scranton in the days after Super Tuesday. Appearing at the Scranton Cultural Center \u2013 on the street where Biden grew up \u2013 Trump didn\u2019t hold back just because he was in Biden\u2019s hometown. Instead, Trump \u2013 who has faced much scrutiny over his own mental acuity \u2013 attacked Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive abilities, listing Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes and suggesting there is \u201csomething going on\u201d with the former vice-president. Biden didn\u2019t respond to Trump, who wasn\u2019t appearing in Pennsylvania by accident. Scranton, a town of 77,000 nestled in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s Wyoming Valley, is firmly a part of America\u2019s rust belt \u2013 a band of towns and cities stretching nearly a thousand miles from Wisconsin in the west all the way through Pennsylvania in the east. The communities in the rust belt suffered more than most from de-industrialization, as coalmines, steel plants and car factories closed, and some areas still suffer from chronic unemployment. Scranton was once home to the coal industry, and the city and region boomed in the 1930s and 40s, but the decline was just as swift. As the US turned to oil and gas for its energy, mines closed and jobs were lost. Biden and his family moved to Delaware in 1953 after his father struggled to find work in Pennsylvania. The future vice-president became a US senator for the state in 1973. Trump swept into communities like Scranton in 2016, wooing disenchanted working-class voters who had previously voted for Democrats with his hazy promise to Make America Great Again. He won Pennsylvania by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 47.5%, and he narrowly triumphed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, too. In 2020, that means Biden\u2019s background is a key part of his case to be the Democratic nominee. If he is chosen, it could prove crucial in recapturing those states and the White House. Biden\u2019s case for being the nominee is based, in part, around his ability to win in the midwest, and he will point to his convincing win in Michigan on Tuesday as supporting evidence. That success in the rust belt was a long time in the making, and came after a concerted effort to make people aware of his upbringing: in the space of two weeks at the end of 2019 Biden was still pumping out shamelessly Scranton-specific advertisements, including \u201cScranton Values\u201d and \u201cA Kid from Scranton\u201d. In those ads, as in person, Biden looks good for his 77 years. Straight-backed and easily 6ft tall, he looks little different from the decade-old cardboard version of him at Hanks, which apparently is a popular gift. \u201cI have the same cardboard cut-out. I got it for my mom,\u201d said Ailish Renton, who was buying a sandwich. \u201cShe likes him. She also likes the way he looks,\u201d Renton, 22, said of her mother. \u201cShe says he\u2019s very handsome. And that she would kiss him.\u201d Unfortunately for Biden, few young people share Renton\u2019s mother\u2019s enthusiasm. Sanders won 61% of voters under 30 on Super Tuesday, compared with Biden\u2019s 17%, and also handily beat Biden in the 30-44-year category. Last week, on less-super Tuesday, Sanders won more than 70% of voters under 30 in both Michigan and Missouri. Ironically, given Biden\u2019s experience is cited by his supporters as a positive that could help him navigate government, it is his longevity that frequently turns off young voters. During his years in the Senate Biden voted for the Iraq war and opposed bussing African American children to predominantly white, better performing, schools, and he supports moderate policies that are anathema to the 18-29 crowd. On Wednesday Sanders said he was staying in the race, and his fervent youth support may be the only thing troubling Biden. Younger people, who already make up a relatively small slice of the electorate, are turning out in lower numbers than in 2016, when Sanders ran Hillary Clinton close, however, and it would take something unprecedented for Sanders to change that in the next few weeks. If Biden can overcome his young people problem, and perhaps even if he can\u2019t, then he will probably be the Democratic candidate for president. Win the election, and given his frequent visits to Scranton, it is likely the town will experience a visit by a president at some point. Given his affinity with his hometown, however, it\u2019s likely that even if Biden loses, he will always be welcome in Scranton. Particularly by one young woman\u2019s mother.",

In Italy, where the crisis is much more advanced, all mortgage repayments have been suspended. Williams says she hopes more lenders follow the lead set by the banks here not just in home loans but on credit cards and catalogue debt as well. If someone is experiencing difficulty with their repayments, they should talk to their creditors. \u201cIf your income has dropped because of coronavirus, whether you are ill, you have been told to self-isolate, you are caring for someone ill or children not at school, your hours have been cut or your self-employed income has dropped a lot, tell your creditors and ask for a payment break,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for your lender to make an announcement.

      "bodyText": "As coronavirus grew from a Chinese outbreak to a global pandemic, the aviation industry was at the leading edge of the accompanying financial crisis. Since the extraordinary intercontinental travel ban imposed by President Trump last week, the disastrous potential extent of the crisis for airlines has become clear. A drop-off in demand, as businesses cut back on travel and passengers deferred holidays, is being replaced by government decrees and mandatory public health measures. If much lost trade has so far come in the quiet months for western carriers in the northern hemisphere, the prospect of losing spring and summer bookings is another scale of financial loss altogether. Already, major airlines \u2013 even the likes of British Airways and German carrier Lufthansa, let alone the financially precarious Norwegian \u2013 have made it clear that this is now a challenge to their very survival. The speedy escalation of the crisis, with major hubs such as Madrid now following Rome in being declared off-limits to non-essential travel, makes it impossible to predict whether this is a hiatus \u2013 or if measures announced as temporary could last for much longer. As British Airways\u2019 boss, Alex Cruz, told 45,000 staff on Friday, for airlines this is already bigger than the Sars epidemic, the aftermath of 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis. In extraordinary times, the normal rules will no longer apply. Flag carriers have swiftly appealed for state aid. Layoffs could be temporary, or permanent. Already a glut of planes are mothballed. The withdrawal of most scheduled international air travel, even for a short time, no longer looks improbable as much of Europe approaches the kind of shutdown so far seen only in Italy. Indeed, the idea of shuttling vast numbers of people anywhere, let alone between infected countries, has rapidly started to look reckless. Yet it is worth noting that public transport continues to function in Italy; people still need services, food and goods. And a plane flying in Chinese medics and supplies was warmly welcomed to Rome on Friday. That flight was another reminder of how aviation remains an essential part of our world; why governments have long subsidised flag carriers, at vast expense.

A world haunted by viruses arguably needs globalised structures more than ever, but is meanwhile ever more ready to slam international doors. Airlines, so often the canary in the coalmine for the global economy, may never fly quite so high again. Saudi ruthlessness on display once more It was not so long ago that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hoped to convince the global financial community that Saudi Arabia was a respectable modern economy, home to Saudi Aramco \u2013 the world\u2019s most profitable listed company \u2013 and a power broker in stabilising oil markets. But if Prince Mohammed had expected to establish a reputation as a moderniser and visionary, then waging an oil price war during a deadly pandemic might not have been his most considered move. The world\u2019s largest oil exporter triggered the worst day in the financial markets since 1987 last week after firing the starting gun on a race to pump more oil than the global market can absorb. The benchmark price fell by its fastest rate since the 1991 Gulf war to lows not seen in four years, wiping billions from the market value of companies across the energy sector. These companies form the pillars of global equity markets, which buckled under the pressure of plummeting share prices and fears that the economic contagion of the Covid-19 virus might trigger a worldwide recession. The decision of the Saudi crown prince to wreak havoc on the global markets is both shocking and true to form. Prince Mohammed is never far from accusations of extortion, torture and even murder, all denied. If the oil market is a game of money and power, he is playing for the latter. By flooding the world with cheap Saudi oil, the kingdom will corner the global market and reassert its dominance against the rise of Russia and American shale production. It is a race Russia is willing to run, but there is no doubt that this is a race to the bottom. At least there is one constant in the markets: the ruthless impetuousness of the Saudi regime. Intu must auction off the crown jewels Shopping centre owner Intu is unlikely to last until the end of the year in its current form, despite boasting nine of the UK\u2019s top 20 malls, including Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex. A \u00a32bn loss, postponement of an emergency cash call, questions about its status as a going concern, and a share price down more than 90% over the past year \u2013 the group\u2019s debt problems are mounting. Hovering below 5p, Intu shares can now be purchased for less than the cost of a \u201cbag for life\u201d in the shops that rent space in its centres. Struggling retail chains have taken their toll on Intu\u2019s rental income, all while the shopping-centre company groans under \u00a34.5bn of debt, compared with a market value of about \u00a360m. For it to access its new overdraft facility in October 2021, its banks have demanded that it raise at least \u00a31.3bn from investors. Most analysts believe Intu won\u2019t reach that date without drastic action. The company\u2019s management is putting on a brave face, insisting they have options.

      "body": "<p>The inspiration for Cormac McCarthy\u2019s bleakly apocalyptic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/26/fiction.features\" title=\"\"><em>The Road</em></a> sprang from a surprisingly domestic source. McCarthy found himself, late in life, a new father. Recognising that the time he and his son would have together was limited, he wrote a book about the tribulations the next generation were likely to face, about the courage needed for a son to press on without his dad. Tim Dee\u2019s <em>Greenery</em>, a joyful, poetic hymn to spring, could hardly be less like McCarthy\u2019s dystopian novel, but its impulse is the same. At the end of the book, we discover Dee has Parkinson\u2019s disease, and that his wife, the ornithologist Claire Spottiswoode, is pregnant with their first child.</p> <p>All this makes a book full of echoes and allusions doubly effective and affecting. For while it celebrates spring \u2013 what the poet Louis MacNeice calls the \u201cnotwithstanding unique all over all again\u201d nature of it \u2013 it sets against the cyclical nature of the seasons the linear unspooling of our own lives. As Dee notes early in the book: \u201cSpring means more to me with each year that passes and takes me deeper into my own autumn.\u201d This knowledge \u2013 of the proximity of death and new life \u2013 also serves to explain several of the motifs that run throughout the book.</p> <p>Dee, a former BBC radio producer now established as one of our greatest living nature writers, urges us to view his three major books (he rather passes over 2018\u2019s superb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/24/landfill-by-tim-dee-review\" title=\"\"><em>Landfill</em></a>) as a trilogy. <em>Greenery</em> joins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/birdwatching-tim-dee-book-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Running Sky</em></a>, which was about \u201cbirds and the sky they occupy\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/15/four-fields-tim-dee-review\" title=\"\"><em>Four Fields</em></a>, about \u201cthe elemental matter that we stand on\u201d. He tells us that <em>Greenery</em> is a book about \u201cbirds in time and in movement\u201d, and \u201chow lovable the world is, above all, when those living things are moving in the world\u2019s morning and not dead\u201d.</p> <p>That idea of birds in time and movement is powerfully expressed in several passages. At the start, Dee writes of being in one of the places he calls home \u2013 Scarborough, on the western edge of South Africa\u2019s Cape Peninsula. He sees a swallow and it leads him to think of the way he has arranged his life around the movement of the birds. Through swallows, he says: \u201cI have learned to love the world, and watching them fly, and trying to travel with them, has made the world they know and live in seem lovelier still.\u201d One is immediately reminded of Horatio Clare\u2019s beautiful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/28/single-swallow-horatio-clare-review\" title=\"\"><em>A Single Swallow</em></a>, in which the author tried (and largely failed) to follow the migration paths of swallows up through Africa to Britain. Here, though, Dee\u2019s thoughts are turned towards the seasons. \u201cSpring moves north through Europe at a speed comparable to the swallows\u2019 flight \u2013 the right speed for life,\u201d Dee writes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The book journeys from Africa, ending in Norway, driven by the author\u2019s wish to be in springtime for as long as possible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, as if playing a variation on a theme, he figures the movement of spring a different way. Grass begins to grow and insects emerge at a temperature of 10C, he says. The 10C isotherm \u201cmoves across the landmass of Europe from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean at roughly 50km a day between the winter solstice and the summer solstice\u2026 Spring, therefore, moves north at about walking pace.\u201d It\u2019s a beautiful, hopeful image, and provides a loose kind of template for the book, which journeys idiosyncratically north from South Africa, through Chad and Ethiopia, central Europe and Britain, to Scandinavia, ending up in the far north of Norway, all driven by the author\u2019s wish \u201cto be in springtime for as long as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Later, Dee imagines birds as envoys of spring, \u201cflying green flags through the seasons\u201d. The book\u2019s chapters are arranged by month, then further sub-divided by place, and at the beginning of May, in the deep heart of spring, Dee finds himself in a reed bed in Somerset at dawn, recording the chorus. \u201cIt is always dawn somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIn early May, the dawn chorus moves around the northern hemisphere at about 1,300 kilometres per hour. If there is such a thing as godspeed that is it.\u201d Like so many passages in <em>Greenery</em>, it\u2019s hard to read this without cheering.</p> <p><em>Greenery</em> is an education in looking at, and loving, nature. As Dee moves through the world, and the fact of his illness gradually stalks up on him, birds make the strange familiar, the foreign homely. Seeing birds emerge at dusk in a valley in Chad, \u201cthe space that lived globally a minute ago became intimate\u201d; Dee\u2019s guide there, Pier Paolo, was \u201ca domesticator of the harshest places\u201d; in his company \u201cthe desert was made homely\u201d. Later, buntings warm themselves on the \u201cblack barrows\u201d of neolithic tumuli, \u201cmaking homely the accommodation for the long dead\u201d.</p> <p>The book\u2019s pages set up a kind of conversation between spring and autumn, between life and death. Dee laces through his writing the work of others who were creating even as they died: the tubercular DH Lawrence is everywhere, beset by the same ataxic shiftlessness as Dee (\u201cComes over one an absolute necessity to move,\u201d Lawrence says). There\u2019s the singer Kathleen Ferrier, Rimbaud, Katherine Mansfield, Chekhov \u2013 all dead before their time, all producing great work to the last.</p> <p>Dee makes a trip to Denmark to visit the site of the Tollund Man. It\u2019s another, older burial that strikes him most powerfully though: a young woman, who most likely died in childbirth, in a grave with her baby lying on a swan\u2019s wing: \u201cHer baby had the white swan\u2019s wing for his death-bed\u2026 The swan\u2019s wing is difficult to see and hard to configure in the gentle scatter and sift of shells and teeth and bones. It is like trying to pick out a constellation in the crowded night sky. But when you know it is there, it is what you want to see \u2013 to see love.\u201d</p> <p>This love is what the book leaves you with, a gift to the son Dee may not know for long. It is a lesson in how to love the world, in how to look at it, and behind everything there beats a deeper message: that spring cannot exist without winter, that life needs death to define it. At the end of the book, at the end of spring, even in Troms county in the far north of Norway, the birds have stopped singing. Dee sees a family party of willow warblers by a lily pond and writes. \u201cSinging was now in their heads only.

      "bodyText": "The inspiration for Cormac McCarthy\u2019s bleakly apocalyptic The Road sprang from a surprisingly domestic source. McCarthy found himself, late in life, a new father. Recognising that the time he and his son would have together was limited, he wrote a book about the tribulations the next generation were likely to face, about the courage needed for a son to press on without his dad. Tim Dee\u2019s Greenery, a joyful, poetic hymn to spring, could hardly be less like McCarthy\u2019s dystopian novel, but its impulse is the same. At the end of the book, we discover Dee has Parkinson\u2019s disease, and that his wife, the ornithologist Claire Spottiswoode, is pregnant with their first child. All this makes a book full of echoes and allusions doubly effective and affecting. For while it celebrates spring \u2013 what the poet Louis MacNeice calls the \u201cnotwithstanding unique all over all again\u201d nature of it \u2013 it sets against the cyclical nature of the seasons the linear unspooling of our own lives. As Dee notes early in the book: \u201cSpring means more to me with each year that passes and takes me deeper into my own autumn.\u201d This knowledge \u2013 of the proximity of death and new life \u2013 also serves to explain several of the motifs that run throughout the book. Dee, a former BBC radio producer now established as one of our greatest living nature writers, urges us to view his three major books (he rather passes over 2018\u2019s superb Landfill) as a trilogy. Greenery joins The Running Sky, which was about \u201cbirds and the sky they occupy\u201d, and Four Fields, about \u201cthe elemental matter that we stand on\u201d. He tells us that Greenery is a book about \u201cbirds in time and in movement\u201d, and \u201chow lovable the world is, above all, when those living things are moving in the world\u2019s morning and not dead\u201d. That idea of birds in time and movement is powerfully expressed in several passages. At the start, Dee writes of being in one of the places he calls home \u2013 Scarborough, on the western edge of South Africa\u2019s Cape Peninsula. He sees a swallow and it leads him to think of the way he has arranged his life around the movement of the birds. Through swallows, he says: \u201cI have learned to love the world, and watching them fly, and trying to travel with them, has made the world they know and live in seem lovelier still.\u201d One is immediately reminded of Horatio Clare\u2019s beautiful A Single Swallow, in which the author tried (and largely failed) to follow the migration paths of swallows up through Africa to Britain. Here, though, Dee\u2019s thoughts are turned towards the seasons. \u201cSpring moves north through Europe at a speed comparable to the swallows\u2019 flight \u2013 the right speed for life,\u201d Dee writes. Then, as if playing a variation on a theme, he figures the movement of spring a different way. Grass begins to grow and insects emerge at a temperature of 10C, he says. The 10C isotherm \u201cmoves across the landmass of Europe from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean at roughly 50km a day between the winter solstice and the summer solstice\u2026 Spring, therefore, moves north at about walking pace.\u201d It\u2019s a beautiful, hopeful image, and provides a loose kind of template for the book, which journeys idiosyncratically north from South Africa, through Chad and Ethiopia, central Europe and Britain, to Scandinavia, ending up in the far north of Norway, all driven by the author\u2019s wish \u201cto be in springtime for as long as possible\u201d. Later, Dee imagines birds as envoys of spring, \u201cflying green flags through the seasons\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders had just dominated the Nevada caucuses, after strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, when the Vermont senator thundered on stage at the Cowboy Dance Hall in San Antonio to declare victory before a crowd of thousands. His speech that night was hardly different from the hundreds of speeches he had made before \u2013 and all the speeches he would make after. But he looked different. Famously irascible, Sanders smiled deeply and laughed easily. The future of his political revolution was as bright and clear as the big Texas sky. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody. I don\u2019t wanna get them nervous,\u201d the 78-year-old democratic socialist boasted, dropping his voice as if sharing a secret. \u201cWe are gonna win the Democratic primary in Texas.\u201d But the next 10 days would wipe away every trace of that optimism. Sanders not only lost Texas but a string of other contests that stripped him of his briefly held status as frontrunner, returning him to a more familiar role: long-shot insurgent chasing the establishment favorite. In frank but defiant remarks on Wednesday, Sanders acknowledged that he was \u201closing\u201d to Joe Biden after a stunning reversal of fortune. Biden, snatched only days before from the jaws of defeat, had just racked up four more victories, including in Michigan, a state that revived Sanders\u2019 presidential bid four years ago and where he had pinned his hopes of a comeback. Later that evening, Sanders folded himself into an armchair on the set of NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show in New York City. \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d host Jimmy Fallon asked gingerly. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Sanders sighed. \u201cCould feel better.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Bernie Sanders had promised to build an unprecedented \u201cmulti-generational, multi-racial coalition\u201d of young people and working-class voters that would \u201csweep this country\u201d and transform American politics. \u201cYou cannot beat Trump with the same old same old kind of politics,\u201d he told supporters at a Super Tuesday rally in Vermont, where he had expected a celebration. But that night, voters in 10 of the 14 states holding primary contests disagreed, choosing instead a candidate who represents a return to the pre-Trump years. It was Biden, not Sanders, who expanded the Democratic electorate, bringing in non-voters and suburban voters while boosting turnout among African Americans. Sanders\u2019 commanding support among Latinos helped him notch two consequential victories in Nevada and California. But his appeal among young people, liberals and politically independent voters was not enough to realize the revolution he envisioned. \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 challenge always in the race was to expand his support,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a lead strategist on Sanders\u2019 2016 team who split with the campaign early last year. \u201cAnd he just never found a way electorally to attract voters outside of his coalition.\u201d In the critical days between his victory in Nevada and Super Tuesday, Sanders continued to rail against old foes \u2013 the Democratic establishment and the \u201ccorporate media\u201d \u2013 instead of reaching out to the members of the party he hoped to lead. In a 60 Minutes interview the day after the caucuses, Sanders told the host Anderson Cooper that he didn\u2019t have an estimate for the total cost of his sweeping economic agenda. In the same interview, he reiterated past remarks that were complimentary of certain aspects of Fidel Castro\u2019s communist government, sparking backlash among Democrats in the battleground state of Florida. \u201cOne of Bernie\u2019s strengths is his consistency \u2013 he\u2019s been delivering the same message to some degree since the 70s,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cBut it also inhibited him in the sense that it limited his potential for growth.\u201d Sanders\u2019 ascent set off panic among party officials and leaders. Swing-district Democrats warned Sanders would hurt their chances of re-election, while members of the Democratic National Committee plotted to stop him if he arrived at the convention shy of the delegates needed to win the nomination outright. \u201cFrom the beginning, we knew this was going to be the fight of our lives,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019re taking on not only the corporate elite of this party but the billionaire class, the pharmaceutical industry, the prison industrial complex, Wall Street, the insurance companies.\u201d Even so, the rapid alignment behind Biden, first by his former rivals and then by millions of voters, caught the campaign off guard.

His name recognition was sky high, he had an enviable list of small-dollar donors, an unshakable base of support and the experience of having just run a presidential campaign.

With Warren on the march and Sanders slumping, his candidacy appeared to be in freefall. But his loyal troops rallied to his side. A strong debate performance and a coveted endorsement from the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez paved the way for a remarkable comeback. It proved to be a clarifying moment for the campaign. Sanders used the experience to connect more deeply with his supporters. At intimate town halls and on social media, his team elevated the economic struggles of people who couldn\u2019t afford medical treatment or prescription drugs. It was the foundation of the campaign ethos, \u201cNot me, us.\u201d But political reality set in after voting began.

      "bodyText": "For fans of children\u2019s literature, it is an unmissable sight: Philip Pullman\u2019s own alethiometer, a detailed realisation of the magical symbol reader described in Northern Lights, gleaming with secrets \u2013 or possibly even particles of \u201cDust\u201d \u2013 on display at the new Story Museum in Oxford. An unforgettable peek at the mysterious compass-like device is just one of the unique literary experiences on offer when the children\u2019s museum reopens next month, after a \u00a36m redevelopment. The opening, on 4 April, will mark the climax of a 20-year project to celebrate stories in all their forms in Oxford. Although the city has a rich literary heritage as the home of famous children\u2019s authors such as Pullman, Lewis Carroll, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Diana Wynne Jones and Katherine Rundell, Oxford has high levels of child illiteracy and was the lowest-ranked district in the country for reading and writing in 2010. \u201cAll the various projects we\u2019ve done over the years have shown the impact we can have,\u201d said the museum\u2019s founder, Kim Pickin. \u201cWe can help children to get more interested in stories and motivated to read. That can have a really big effect on children\u2019s vocabulary, and this also feeds through to their writing and reading.\u201d Permanent exhibitions include a \u201cwhispering wood\u201d, where children can listen to trees telling fables and fairytales from all over the world, and an \u201cenchanted library\u201d, where visitors can step inside iconic scenes from the pages of famous British children\u2019s books. \u201cI wanted to create that feeling you get when you\u2019re reading a book and cease to be aware you\u2019re looking at marks on a white page, as you\u2019re moving around in that world,\u201d said Pickin. \u201cIt\u2019s fully imagined in your head and you\u2019re immersed in the story.\u201d Visiting the museum is a highly interactive experience: visitors can brush past fur coats in a wardrobe to emerge in Narnia, cut open a portal to Pullman\u2019s Oxford using the Subtle Knife, play Poohsticks on a bridge over a hi-tech river, peer down an earth-filled rabbit hole in Wonderland, sit on the Snowman\u2019s sofa and explore Horrid Henry\u2019s bedroom. It also offers inviting spaces for live storytelling session by speciallytrained guides as well as by the children and their family members. \u201cWhen you see an adult and a child curled up on our giant bed with a book and cuddly toys related to the story, you know they\u2019re having a very special moment together,\u201d said Pickin, adding that inspiring parents and children to connect other through stories is part of the museum\u2019s mission. \u201cWe\u2019re very keen to turn our visitors into storytellers in some form or other while they\u2019re here.\u201d As well as a fun day out that triggers \u201cfeelings of wonder and delight\u201d in readers of all ages, she hopes the museum will help transform the way digital-savvy children perceive stories and books. \u201cWe hope people will discover that stories are important and very rich and varied, and that it\u2019s great to grow up with a range of stories in different forms and from different places and times.\u201d She is critical of the government\u2019s approach to children\u2019s literature in schools. \u201cThere are really inspiring teachers out there, but they\u2019re pushed for time and resources, and school library budgets are being cut.\u201d Her co-director, Caroline Jones, is also concerned: \u201cWhen you think about what teachers face on a day-to-day basis, the thing that is most easily engineered out of the classroom experience is any notion of imagination or creativity. How do you squeeze the joy out of a book? You ignore the story and concentrate on the phonics and mechanics of it.\u201d The mantra of the museum is: if in doubt, start with the story. \u201cActually, if you concentrate on the story, it does the hard work for you. But somehow, we\u2019ve lost our way with that.\u201d The museum is carefully monitoring advice from Public Health England and hoping the coronavirus outbreak does not affect its opening date. \u201cParticularly when things are alarming \u2013 as well as this virus, we\u2019ve had a year of fire and floods \u2013 I\u2019m hoping people can have a two-hour holiday in the world of story when they visit here,\u201d says Pickin. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to get away from it all. Come on your own or come with people you love. We\u2019ve had tears of joy when people step through the wardrobe.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The international travel industry faces a widespread shutdown over coronavirus fears after airlines announced new flight reductions and more countries introduced travel bans and isolation requirements. Travel businesses were hit with multiple doses of bad news on Saturday and Sunday, with the US expanding its Europe travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, a number of South American countries bringing in flight restrictions and Australia joining New Zealand in requiring all people entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days. American Airlines, the second biggest in the world, said on Saturday that it would start implementing a phased suspension of nearly all long-haul international flights from Monday, amid reduced demand and travel restrictions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The cruise industry also suffered another setback when two ships were placed in quarantine in Chile after an elderly British man aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced on Saturday. The US government said on Saturday that it would \u201cimmediately\u201d begin working on ways to help the coronavirus-hit aviation and cruise industries as they scramble to stem losses and protect jobs. The crisis facing the industry has been accelerated by the latest extension of the US ban on incoming travel, with US vice-president Mike Pence announcing at the White House on Saturday that British and Irish travellers would also be barred from entering the US for 30 days. At the same press conference, Donald Trump revealed that he had taken a test for the virus, with the White House later revealing that he had proved negative. In Spain, the wife of prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has tested positive as her husband formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus. Spain is now the fourth-worst affected country in the world after it recorded more deaths to take the total to 196. S\u00e1nchez said the country would be placed in lockdown for two weeks and ordered people to stay at home unless they had to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The outbreak also worsened in the UK on Saturday with the total of deaths nearly doubling from 11 to 21 amid continued controversy about whether the government\u2019s policy aimed at creating \u201cherd immunity\u201d from the disease would work or not. Around the world, varying measures of control continued to be imposed on populations from the Philippines, where the capital Manila was in the process of being sealed off, to Argentina where flights from countries badly hit by the virus have been halted. The prospect of a shattering blow for the airline industry was foreshadowed by the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, as he announced that all international passenger arrivals from midnight Sunday would be legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. The flights would dry up \u201cvery, very quickly\u201d, he said, and set up serious concerns for the country\u2019s $3.5bn cruise industry by adding that passenger ships from foreign ports would be banned for an initial 30 days. Even before the new curbs were announced, the chief executive of British Airways told staff that the airline was in a \u201cfight for survival\u201d. US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government would \u201cimmediately\u201d start working with Congress to support the afflicted industries. The US restrictions on travel to the UK and Ireland will begin on Monday at midnight, Pence said. Most non-US citizens who have been in those countries within the last 14 days will be barred from entering America. The restrictions do not bar flights to and from the US, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel. As the curbs were revealed, United and Delta airlines said they would start cutting flights to the UK and Southwest, one of the few US airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was \u201cseriously considering\u201d cutting flights. United said it would suspend flights to London from Houston and Denver starting Monday. The airline expects to fly three daily flights to London and one daily flight to Dublin through the end of April.

The US Chamber of Commerce on Friday called on the government to \u201cturn next to a package to assist impacted employers ... No business should go bankrupt because of a temporary loss in revenue as a result of the coronavirus.\u201d In Europe, the situation for the sector was increasingly dire. Norwegian Air, which has built up large debts to establish itself as a low-cost transatlantic operator, said on Saturday that it had \u201cweeks not months\u201d to avert collapse. KLM, the Dutch subsidiary of Air France-KLM, plans to slash up to 2,000 jobs, cut working hours by one-third for its entire staff and ask for government support. German flagship carrier Lufthansa said on Friday it was considering a request for state aid. In Bolivia, a ban on direct flights to and from Europe went into effect on Saturday. Travellers from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain are also banned from entry. Panama banned flights from Asia, one day after blocking flights from Europe. Chile, meanwhile, has quarantined more than 1,300 people aboard two cruise ships after an elderly Briton aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced Saturday. The 85-year-old man, who is reportedly in good condition in a hospital in the city of Coyhaique, showed symptoms of the virus after getting off the Silver Explorer ship in the far southern port of Caleta Tortel, 2,400 kilometres (1,500 miles) from Santiago. The other ship, the Azmara Pursuit was currently near the port of Chacabuco after authorities banned it from landing passengers there, on grounds that it was carrying suspected cases of the coronavirus.

It just accelerated and I don\u2019t think anyone foresaw that. I think they thought they would be able to get it over and done with. Bear in mind five days before the GP we had 86,000 in the MCG watching the T20 final and that is a lot more confined than the open space of Albert Park.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the cancellation, the opening of the F1 season is in tatters. The first four races, Australia, Bahrain, Vietnam and China have all been called off. The next three, all in Europe, the Dutch GP, Spain, and Monaco look highly unlikely to happen.

The same year Jones won the Australian Grand Prix, then a non-championship race and he remains the last Australian to have done so.</p> <p>He had gone to England in 1967 to pursue his motor racing career. Initially Jones earned a living selling VW camper fans in what he calls \u201cKangaroo Valley\u201d \u2013 London\u2019s Earl\u2019s Court, to \u201cpoor unsuspecting Kiwis and Aussies\u201d.</p> <p>With dogged determination he went after a place in F1. He had his first drive with Hesketh in Spain in 1975 and was hugely impressive in returning a win from 14<sup>th</sup> on the grid for the Shadow team at the \u00d6sterreichring in 1978.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I was going well in a Shadow, people were saying: \u2018Look at Jonesy, he\u2019s doing well in that old shitbox, isn\u2019t he?,\u201d he later recalled. A drive with Ferrari almost materialised but when the Scuderia opted for Gilles Villeneuve, Jones went to Williams.</p> <p>He, team founder Frank Williams and designer Patrick Head made a formidable, close-knit lineup. In 1980 Williams and Jones emerged triumphant after a strong fight with Nelson Piquet in the Brabham. Jones has retained close ties with Williams ever since and still has great fondness for the team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/two-more-haas-team-members-tested-for-covid-19-on-eve-of-australian-grand-prix\">'Cash is king': Lewis Hamilton criticises Australian GP green light amid Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They have just endured their worst two seasons, last in both years, in their 42-year history but Jones, who spent time with the team in the paddock in Melbourne was confident they would come back.

I spoke to a pommie on Friday and he had flown from bloody England to come here, how bad would that be?\u201d We Poms, among others, have been critical of F1 for attempting to run the race in the first place given the virulent spread of the coronavirus. Jones however insists that given the information they had, F1 were right to try and stage the meeting. \u201cTwenty-twenty hindsight is a lovely thing to have,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t fault them for coming here. It just accelerated and I don\u2019t think anyone foresaw that. I think they thought they would be able to get it over and done with. Bear in mind five days before the GP we had 86,000 in the MCG watching the T20 final and that is a lot more confined than the open space of Albert Park.\u201d In the wake of the cancellation, the opening of the F1 season is in tatters. The first four races, Australia, Bahrain, Vietnam and China have all been called off. The next three, all in Europe, the Dutch GP, Spain, and Monaco look highly unlikely to happen. The Australian Grand Prix corporation has not ruled out attempting to reschedule but with so little time on the calendar, the chances are negligible. \u201cMy personal opinion is no they can\u2019t run it again this year,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIf I was a betting man I would advise against it.\u201d In 1980 Jones took the title for Williams, their first of seven drivers\u2019 championships and the first of nine constructors\u2019. The same year Jones won the Australian Grand Prix, then a non-championship race and he remains the last Australian to have done so. He had gone to England in 1967 to pursue his motor racing career. Initially Jones earned a living selling VW camper fans in what he calls \u201cKangaroo Valley\u201d \u2013 London\u2019s Earl\u2019s Court, to \u201cpoor unsuspecting Kiwis and Aussies\u201d. With dogged determination he went after a place in F1. He had his first drive with Hesketh in Spain in 1975 and was hugely impressive in returning a win from 14th on the grid for the Shadow team at the \u00d6sterreichring in 1978. \u201cBecause I was going well in a Shadow, people were saying: \u2018Look at Jonesy, he\u2019s doing well in that old shitbox, isn\u2019t he?,\u201d he later recalled. A drive with Ferrari almost materialised but when the Scuderia opted for Gilles Villeneuve, Jones went to Williams. He, team founder Frank Williams and designer Patrick Head made a formidable, close-knit lineup. In 1980 Williams and Jones emerged triumphant after a strong fight with Nelson Piquet in the Brabham. Jones has retained close ties with Williams ever since and still has great fondness for the team. They have just endured their worst two seasons, last in both years, in their 42-year history but Jones, who spent time with the team in the paddock in Melbourne was confident they would come back. He was particularly dismissive of the criticism that deputy team principal, Claire Williams, Frank\u2019s daughter has received. \u201cEveryone is jumping on the bandwagon blaming Claire which is terribly unfair,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is easy pickings for them because she is female which is very, very unfair. She is doing a good job and they will come good.\u201d Jones is sure the Australian Grand Prix will return next year stronger than ever, at which he intends to renew the very personal attachment he has with the team where he made his name forty years ago. \u201cFor Williams, from being no-ones and I mean that, to being a front-running F1 team is an extraordinary feat,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope to Christ they do come good because that\u2019s my family.\u201d",

There\u2019s a pillow of dried lemon verbena leaves overlaid with greaseproof paper upon which perch four curving, layered pieces of pearly kohlrabi, interleaved with sorrel leaves. The kohlrabi, we are told, has been marinated in quince vinegar. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of chilled salad in finger-food form,\u201d Greene says, cheerfully. He\u2019s not wrong: it\u2019s crisp and boldly refreshing. It\u2019s also clever without being irritatingly, look-at-me distracting. Most importantly it tastes nice. Important, that.</p> <p>I was directed to Bastible, the name of a traditional Irish cooking pot, by Lisa Cope, who writes for the <em>Irish Times</em> and edits <a href=\"https://www.allthefood.ie/\" title=\"\">All the Food</a>, a website covering the joys of eating and drinking in the Irish capital. This is the first time I\u2019ve reviewed in Dublin and she gave me the impression that now is the time to get there.

Some people, those who like ideology more than lunch, got the wrong end of the Norway spruce stick over all this. They saw Noma as somehow defining the correct agenda for all restaurants. In a globalised world, that\u2019s absurd. We can find such notions interesting in Dublin or Copenhagen, while still craving the flavours of Provence or Malaysia and being grateful they are available nearby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f415a48526084a779671241f9f6f682c46cb1cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f415a48526084a779671241f9f6f682c46cb1cd/278_1927_4147_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grilled, compressed ox tongue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierced tongue: grilled, compressed ox tongue cured with juniper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, the agenda is utterly pointless unless, like Redzepi, you\u2019re also an exceptionally gifted chef. The same applies to Greene. The man is bursting with good taste and technique. Bastible was opened four years ago in Portobello to the south of Dublin\u2019s city centre by Barry Fitzgerald and Claire-Marie Thomas. Greene arrived last spring and is now throwing everything on to the table. Usually, the prospect of a tasting menu makes my left eye twitch, but here on a Sunday lunchtime it becomes a joyful dance. Those of us who arrive early \u2013 lunch trails on until darkness falls \u2013 get to watch those a few courses behind, jealously, knowing the joys they have to come.</p> <p>It starts, as ever, with an addictive, hard-crusted sourdough, with a crunch like crackling, and whorls of whipped, salty cultured butter that demand to be finished. That\u2019s followed by a cube of thinly sliced and then compressed ox tongue. It arrives pierced on the still-smoking twig on which it was grilled. It has been cured with juniper. It is seasoned with dried, powdered mushrooms and the seaside briskness of dried kelp. It has the soft meatiness of the very best pastrami.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23cbcd91343058701d8e4cfb0482dde66a333923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23cbcd91343058701d8e4cfb0482dde66a333923/0_2658_4480_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swede cooked in ginger, with pumpkin seeds and kelp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swede sensation: cooked in ginger, with pumpkin seeds and kelp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next, there\u2019s a rough-chopped tartare of Dexter beef under the forest floor earthiness of an artichoke cream, thickly dusted with more dried, powdered ceps and layered with a few green leaves. It\u2019s a rugged dish in all ways. Against it, the kohlrabi acts as a palate cleanser and sets us up for the arrival of sweet and sticky Connemara prawns served raw, with thin slices of broccoli stem and leaves of marigold perched on top of each piece so that, arranged in a curve, they look like a Roman senator\u2019s garland. It sits in a pool of a deep green broth made with the juices from the kohlrabi, fig leaf oil and the punch of horseradish. These are the ingredients that are available now, shown as good a time as possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebbdf0272183397df9d1528ac66c5574a80c6054\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebbdf0272183397df9d1528ac66c5574a80c6054/119_325_4361_6359/686.jpg\" alt=\"Cooking to thrill: chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooking to thrill: chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As is the next dish. It\u2019s a \u201ccelebration of the humble swede\u201d as Greene puts it. (There are waiters working the simple square box of a dining room, but he does serve some of the dishes himself straight from the open kitchen to the tables.) The semi-circular discs of swede have been cooked slowly in ginger oil to a gentle piquancy. Alongside, is what he calls a pumpkin seed mole, a deep savoury sauce glowing with jewel-like dots of more oil. Tiny square pieces of slightly jellied kelp form a pattern across the swede along with hyper savoury pumpkin seeds roasted in yeast. Gosh. And, oh.</p> <p>I ask Greene about the ginger, which seems to break the regional frame. He agrees it does, but says he\u2019s not doctrinaire. For the most part, though, lunch comes from hereabouts and right now. We are presented with a slab of cured sea trout to share. It\u2019s a deep, appealing shade of dirty orange. It\u2019s been brushed repeatedly with a quince glaze and is warm so that the oils are just running. We are told to treat it like smoked salmon; to pull it away from the skin below. There\u2019s a farl of bread made with new potatoes, its undulating surface rendered dark and sticky courtesy of a cider-vinegar glaze. To mitigate the sweetness of the fish, we have a boisterously sour gooseberry compote, plus a bowl of yogurt dusted with powdered dried herbs. How you put these together is up to you. It has become the best kind of buffet.</p> <p>To finish we have a sweetened and set sheep\u2019s milk yogurt with a sauce of fermented plum. Better still, is an intense milk chocolate mousse hiding a scoop of yeast ice-cream, sprinkled with dried plum skins and blackcurrant, in a sweet, nutty syrup made from beer. Oh, and would you like a chewy caramel wrapped in blackcurrant leather and dusted with salt? Yes please.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd7e28a703dcdc3abfd095c7bc2f26c8f982b93c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7e28a703dcdc3abfd095c7bc2f26c8f982b93c/0_2817_4480_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milk chocolate mousse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intense and complex: milk chocolate mousse hiding a yeast ice-cream, with dried plum skins, blackcurrant, and a nutty beer syrup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This has been my most detailed account of the food I was served in a long while, but Bastible warrants it. Even so I know I have left out details. It\u2019s that kind of place. Given this menu is just \u20ac45 (\u00a339), I would argue it warrants a weekend in Dublin. Just be aware that, courtesy of some the most savage duties in Europe, the wine list is a nightmare, with nothing below \u20ac36 (\u00a331). Don\u2019t worry. C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene\u2019s cooking will make you thrillingly giddy and euphoric all by itself.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>The night before my lunch at Bastible in Dublin, I ate at <a href=\"https://www.jamesstandco.com/hadskis\">Hadskis</a>, a favourite haunt when I\u2019m in Belfast. The menu at chef Niall McKenna\u2019s clamorous urban brasserie, sister restaurant to <a href=\"https://www.jamesstandco.com/james-street\">James St</a>, boasts some great non-meat cookery. But inevitably the action lies with the steaks, sourced from <a href=\"http://www.hannanmeats.com/\">Hannan Meats</a> because it\u2019s the law in these parts. A 1.2kg sharing tomahawk for \u00a368, including two sides, comes seared and pink in all the right places and leaves a serving dish full of juices perfectly designed for mopping. </p> <p>I\u2019ve reported a lot of closures in this column recently, so let\u2019s have some cheer from\u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/greggs\">Greggs</a>. The high street bakery company has reported an exceptional year to the end of 2019. Another 138 shops have opened, sales are up 13.5% to over \u00a31.1 billion and pre-tax profits have surged by 27.2% to \u00a3114 million. Vegan sausage rolls all round.</p> <p>New product news: Simon Hulstone, chef-proprietor of <a href=\"https://www.elephantrestaurant.co.uk/\">The Elephant in Torquay</a>, has worked with the <a href=\"https://www.chickencrackling.com/\">Original Chicken Crackling</a> company to launch a new range of crisped chicken skin snacks.

It has become the best kind of buffet. To finish we have a sweetened and set sheep\u2019s milk yogurt with a sauce of fermented plum. Better still, is an intense milk chocolate mousse hiding a scoop of yeast ice-cream, sprinkled with dried plum skins and blackcurrant, in a sweet, nutty syrup made from beer. Oh, and would you like a chewy caramel wrapped in blackcurrant leather and dusted with salt? Yes please. This has been my most detailed account of the food I was served in a long while, but Bastible warrants it. Even so I know I have left out details. It\u2019s that kind of place. Given this menu is just \u20ac45 (\u00a339), I would argue it warrants a weekend in Dublin. Just be aware that, courtesy of some the most savage duties in Europe, the wine list is a nightmare, with nothing below \u20ac36 (\u00a331). Don\u2019t worry. C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene\u2019s cooking will make you thrillingly giddy and euphoric all by itself. News bites The night before my lunch at Bastible in Dublin, I ate at Hadskis, a favourite haunt when I\u2019m in Belfast. The menu at chef Niall McKenna\u2019s clamorous urban brasserie, sister restaurant to James St, boasts some great non-meat cookery. But inevitably the action lies with the steaks, sourced from Hannan Meats because it\u2019s the law in these parts. A 1.2kg sharing tomahawk for \u00a368, including two sides, comes seared and pink in all the right places and leaves a serving dish full of juices perfectly designed for mopping. I\u2019ve reported a lot of closures in this column recently, so let\u2019s have some cheer from\u2026 Greggs. The high street bakery company has reported an exceptional year to the end of 2019. Another 138 shops have opened, sales are up 13.5% to over \u00a31.1 billion and pre-tax profits have surged by 27.2% to \u00a3114 million. Vegan sausage rolls all round. New product news: Simon Hulstone, chef-proprietor of The Elephant in Torquay, has worked with the Original Chicken Crackling company to launch a new range of crisped chicken skin snacks. They come in sea salt, habanero and Sunday roast flavours. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

Though the ruling applies to all clubs now, the 12% margin has made a life-or-death difference for queer spaces throughout the city. The model that Berghain perfected shows there is a way to protect queer spaces in major cities. Can we help more spaces adopt that model? As we danced inside Griessmuehle\u2019s underground pit for the last time, I felt sad that we as a queer community have let another one of our spaces slip away, just as happened in New York and London. It\u2019s all the more sad, then, to see marketing materials for luxury apartment buildings or corporate event planners selling clients a Berlin lifestyle that they are so instrumental in damaging. If they continue to close the clubs that the queer community and its allies helped create, the city they so eagerly market will no longer exist. \u2022 Michael Scaturro is a journalist based in Berlin",

      "body": "<p>Life as we know it is about to change dramatically. And when the world eventually emerges from this pandemic, it is likely to be irrevocably altered. In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p086hjgc\" title=\"\">words of one public health expert</a>, Professor Graham Medley: \u201cThis is the kind of event that is going to live on for decades.\u201d It will either cause illness or death on a scale most of us have not experienced in our lifetimes, or it will take huge changes to the way we live our lives in order to avoid that. The social impact will be more momentous than anything Britain has experienced since the two world wars.</p> <p>This weekend, ministers have warned that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-boris-johnson-tougher-restrictions\" title=\"\">stringent measures</a> will be introduced on people\u2019s movements in the coming days and weeks, and that they are likely to be in place for months. More of us will be asked to self-isolate or to reduce the contact we have with other people for long periods of time. Many will be asked to work from home for weeks, if not months. Travelling abroad will become increasingly restricted. Major sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled, with others likely to follow. In an unprecedented move, local and mayoral elections have been delayed by a year. But by far the most devastating likely impact of this pandemic was hinted at by the prime minister last Thursday. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\" title=\"\">Many more families are going to lose loved ones,</a>\u201d he said at a press conference. This is the frightening truth about what the government\u2019s top scientists believe is to come.</p> <h2>Policy under scrutiny<br></h2> <p>Amid rising public anxiety, there is more scrutiny than ever of the government\u2019s decision to move from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\" title=\"\">\u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase </a>of its strategy. The emphasis has shifted from tracing and testing all those who have been in contact with people confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, to asking all those with symptoms to self-isolate. The government also announced some further limited measures to limit social contact: from next week, mass events with more than 500 people will be banned. But it has faced strong criticism from some public health experts for not taking more stringent action, such as larger-scale closures of places where people congregate, restrictions on public transport, closure of schools and asking more people to self-isolate.</p> <p>The government says it will phase in more stringent restrictions in the coming days and weeks, and that it is not looking at this point to suppress the spread of the virus altogether. There appear to be two interrelated reasons for this. The first is that the government\u2019s experts are concerned that asking people to observe strict social distancing measures for long periods of time, such as widespread self-isolation even for those with no symptoms, could backfire. Like all governments, it is trying to minimise the extent to which demand for critical care exceeds maximum capacity in the NHS, in order to keep death rates from the virus as low as possible and to give the NHS time to do what it can to extend that capacity, already low by European standards. There is clearly a worry that it is untenable to ask people to fundamentally alter their lifestyles for very long stretches of time and that to introduce some measures now would be to risk a significant peak in cases further down the line if people were to abandon those lifestyle changes later on, for example, because they no longer believed they were needed, or could not afford to do so.</p> <p>Second, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said that its strategy is driven by the objective of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">developing herd immunity</a>, which occurs when a sufficient number of people in a population are immune to a disease, to offer some level of protection to everyone. He has said that the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-millions-of-britons-will-need-to-contract-covid-19-for-herd-immunity-11956793\" title=\"\">working assumption</a> is that about 60% of the population will need to catch the disease in order to achieve that.</p> <p>This implies the government is assuming that, even with social distancing measures in place, it is inevitable that a large proportion of the population will contract coronavirus before a treatment or vaccine becomes available, and the best it can do is to manage the flow of people requiring hospitalisation in order to protect those who are most vulnerable. This sits in stark contrast to the strategy deployed by a country such as South Korea \u2013 whose lead most other countries are following \u2013 which is to delay the rate at which the virus spreads as much as possible, using much more stringent social distancing measures and a more comprehensive testing and isolation regime.</p> <h2>Public confidence<br></h2> <p>This difference has prompted serious questions about why the government\u2019s strategy differs from much of the rest of the world. Would 60% of the population contracting the virus be enough to offer any meaningful level of population immunity? Is it even right to assume that people contracting the virus will develop long-term immunity? On what sort of evidence is the government basing its assumption that the public will only tolerate stringent social distancing for so long? Why does it appear that there have been few measures and little guidance to protect those most vulnerable to the symptoms of Covid-19 \u2013 older people and those with underlying medical conditions \u2013 as the disease spreads? On the other hand, there are huge uncertainties and risks involved in trying to halt the spread of the disease as much as possible at this time. What would happen if people broke quarantine before a treatment or vaccine was developed? What might be the impact on the NHS of a large peak in cases as we move into next winter? What would be the impact of immediately closing schools, given that grandparents are likely to pick up the childcare slack and children are more likely to mix outside school the longer closures go on? This would significantly affect the availability of those doing critical jobs in the NHS, care homes and the food supply chain.</p> <p>This is why anyone who expresses with absolute certainty that the government has got this entirely wrong should be treated with some scepticism. There is no surefire way to combat the virus: there are too many unknowns for that. It is however, absolutely right that public health experts are asking questions about why this strategy is so divergent from the overall recommendations of the World Health Organization. The government must be far more transparent about the evidence and assumptions on which it is basing its decisions, or risk undermining public confidence in its actions.</p> <p>There are other problems beyond a lack of transparency. Ministers have said they will seek to legislate for sweeping emergency powers that will last for two years, including giving the police the power to detain suspected victims of the virus, and reducing standards in care homes to allow for staff shortages. Such powers should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and should initially be introduced on a more temporary basis to avoid significant incursions on our liberty and a watering down of basic standards becoming the new norm. Moreover, after a decade of austerity that has put services like the NHS and social care under intolerable strain, and eroded tax credits for families, there are questions to be asked about whether last week\u2019s budget went far enough in terms of channelling additional resources to public services and protecting low-income families from the forthcoming massive economic shock.</p> <h2>International cooperation<br></h2> <p>The contrast between the approach taken by the UK and the rest of the world has also prompted questions about the lack of coordination at an international level, both in relation to the public health or the economic response. \u201cOur willingness to cooperate is becoming inversely related to our need to do so,\u201d Gordon Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">wrote last week</a>. He is right: this pandemic is exposing the extent to which the international organisations and networks that exist to promote global cooperation are fraying as a result of the spread of populism. At a moment when the US might once have provided global leadership, President Trump is flailing; having spent weeks denying the existence of a looming pandemic, he has now politicised the crisis, erratically introducing measures that seem designed to bolster his America First re-election campaign rather than protect citizens. Coronavirus may be the most pressing and immediate global challenge we face; but there are plenty more to come, from microbial resistance to the climate crisis. Effective solutions will only be found if countries rediscover a willingness to work in concert.</p> <p>International cooperation may be proving elusive, but we should take hope from one comfort that might emerge from this crisis: it is heartening to see so many individuals pitching in to help neighbours, or offering to support older people who may be isolated and lonely. This pandemic may leave us a legacy of social action and civic engagement that we should seek to sustain long after its worst threat has subsided. Life may be about to change immeasurably in a way most of us would not have dreamed of just weeks ago. But by looking out for each other, by following government advice even as we question it with healthy scepticism, and by acting for the greater good, we can collectively try to minimise the pain that will undoubtedly be wrought by this pandemic.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, where millions have been under lockdown for the last two months, Hubei residents have been coping with uncertainty, anxiety and stress.</p> <p>As the virus spreads around the world, people living in the province spoke to the Guardian about how they coped with prolonged confinement, isolation and panic, and the strategies they used to protect their mental health.</p> <h2><strong>Guo Jing, 29, Wuhan: \u2018</strong>Make yourself a point of connection\u2019</h2> <p>At the beginning, the decision to close the city was so sudden that everyone was at a loss. I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn\u2019t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent.</p> <p>Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better.</p> <p>Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social. So I have been going out every day to interview sanitation workers. I have asked them about their problems and working conditions. This connection has been very real. Talking online to friends has also been a kind of mutual support.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"47d8f79f0eba5e5ca68f2550de497986b56a66d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47d8f79f0eba5e5ca68f2550de497986b56a66d0/0_61_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"woman looks outside from the balcony at a residential compound in Wuhan, the centre of the novel coronavirus outbreak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Wuhan resident stands at her balcony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REUTERS/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also a sense of anxiety from not knowing when it would end. I have looked at the numbers every day.</p> <p>It has also been very difficult to be locked in the community. It deprives you of some sense of control. Food has been bought by the residential community. I can\u2019t even control what I want to buy. It feels like I have had to rely on other people to live.</p> <p>By writing a diary online, I have connected with other people. People have sent masks to me that I have donated to sanitation workers or to a hospital. [I recommend] making yourself a point of connection and forming a network to serve the needs of different groups.</p> <p>It is very important to rebuild your daily life, to maintain social connection, to connect with friends and the people around you. If you can participate in some volunteer work this can alleviate the sense of powerlessness in the face of a huge disaster. Caring for others, seeing their needs and doing what you can to help, is also a way of helping yourself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">'American coronavirus': China pushes propaganda casting doubt on virus origin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chatting with my friends we have all commented on what a luxury it is to talk every day. We have shared what we have done every day. Some people have started to exercise while others have started studying. Some people who normally don\u2019t like to go out are now going out every day. It has felt precious.</p> <h2><strong>Werther Huang, 22, Wuhan: \u2018Ask for help\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to describe. Never-ending anxiety and heart palpitations. Most recently, I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate on my work. I don\u2019t absorb what I\u2019m reading. I\u2019m constantly looking at Weibo to see the latest developments. Really, it just makes things worse, but I can\u2019t help it.</p> <p>I have tried to shift my attention. I have played games online with my friends. When I need to work, I have used the time-management app, Forest. But when I look at the news again, all this effort is for nothing.</p> <p>If you feel stressed, you can communicate with your relatives and friends, or ask a psychologist for help. Take advantage of this time to care for yourself and your family.</p> <h2><strong>Shen Miao, 30, Tianmen city, Hubei province: \u2018</strong>I write every day\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"361c353bee0645b226355fc5ee4a95a0a490deeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/361c353bee0645b226355fc5ee4a95a0a490deeb/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man looks out of the window at a residential compound in Wuhan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man looks out of the window at a residential compound in Wuhan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REUTERS/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I came home from Wuhan the day before the lockdown. Like most people, I didn\u2019t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family.</p> <p>I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted.</p> <p>Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn\u2019t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people\u2019s requests for help online. Reading the news and these posts, I felt despair and like my heart could not bear that much.</p> <p>I feel like I am a survivor. It\u2019s a privilege to be healthy. I have read books, watched plays and movies. I have watched the news. I started writing a \u201clock down\u201d diary, and plan to write until the end of the lockdown. I have written every day. Sometimes I just have just posted a picture. Several of my posts have been deleted but it has helped me. It has provided a channel for me to express emotions. Seeing other people reply has let me know that I am not alone. Everyone is in this situation. I am not special.</p> <h2><strong>Hu, 22 Huanggang city, Hubei: \u2018Talking with friends is really important\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I have documented what was happening through conversations with people or by going out. I have also volunteered in the hospitals. This has kept me busy, and allowed me to relax while also helping some of the rescue efforts. It has helped relieve some of the mental and emotional pressure.</p> <p>Talking with friends is also really important. On the night of 6 February [when the Chinese doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang died], I spent all night reading the news on Weibo and WeChat. Like me, my friends didn\u2019t sleep. Every update someone saw, they would immediately share.</p> <p>This was the hardest time for me. There\u2019s no way to really deal with this except to remember it. Also, in late January when the outbreak first exploded \u2026 seeing all the messages online of people asking for help and the huge gap between what was being reported in the news and what was really happening also caused a lot of mental pressure.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, where millions have been under lockdown for the last two months, Hubei residents have been coping with uncertainty, anxiety and stress. As the virus spreads around the world, people living in the province spoke to the Guardian about how they coped with prolonged confinement, isolation and panic, and the strategies they used to protect their mental health. Guo Jing, 29, Wuhan: \u2018Make yourself a point of connection\u2019 At the beginning, the decision to close the city was so sudden that everyone was at a loss. I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn\u2019t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent. Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better. Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social. So I have been going out every day to interview sanitation workers. I have asked them about their problems and working conditions. This connection has been very real. Talking online to friends has also been a kind of mutual support. There was also a sense of anxiety from not knowing when it would end. I have looked at the numbers every day. It has also been very difficult to be locked in the community. It deprives you of some sense of control. Food has been bought by the residential community. I can\u2019t even control what I want to buy. It feels like I have had to rely on other people to live. By writing a diary online, I have connected with other people. People have sent masks to me that I have donated to sanitation workers or to a hospital. [I recommend] making yourself a point of connection and forming a network to serve the needs of different groups. It is very important to rebuild your daily life, to maintain social connection, to connect with friends and the people around you. If you can participate in some volunteer work this can alleviate the sense of powerlessness in the face of a huge disaster. Caring for others, seeing their needs and doing what you can to help, is also a way of helping yourself. Chatting with my friends we have all commented on what a luxury it is to talk every day. We have shared what we have done every day. Some people have started to exercise while others have started studying. Some people who normally don\u2019t like to go out are now going out every day. It has felt precious. Werther Huang, 22, Wuhan: \u2018Ask for help\u2019 It\u2019s hard to describe. Never-ending anxiety and heart palpitations. Most recently, I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate on my work. I don\u2019t absorb what I\u2019m reading. I\u2019m constantly looking at Weibo to see the latest developments. Really, it just makes things worse, but I can\u2019t help it. I have tried to shift my attention. I have played games online with my friends. When I need to work, I have used the time-management app, Forest. But when I look at the news again, all this effort is for nothing. If you feel stressed, you can communicate with your relatives and friends, or ask a psychologist for help. Take advantage of this time to care for yourself and your family. Shen Miao, 30, Tianmen city, Hubei province: \u2018I write every day\u2019 I came home from Wuhan the day before the lockdown. Like most people, I didn\u2019t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family. I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted. Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn\u2019t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people\u2019s requests for help online. Reading the news and these posts, I felt despair and like my heart could not bear that much. I feel like I am a survivor. It\u2019s a privilege to be healthy. I have read books, watched plays and movies. I have watched the news. I started writing a \u201clock down\u201d diary, and plan to write until the end of the lockdown. I have written every day. Sometimes I just have just posted a picture. Several of my posts have been deleted but it has helped me. It has provided a channel for me to express emotions. Seeing other people reply has let me know that I am not alone. Everyone is in this situation. I am not special. Hu, 22 Huanggang city, Hubei: \u2018Talking with friends is really important\u2019 I have documented what was happening through conversations with people or by going out. I have also volunteered in the hospitals. This has kept me busy, and allowed me to relax while also helping some of the rescue efforts. It has helped relieve some of the mental and emotional pressure. Talking with friends is also really important. On the night of 6 February [when the Chinese doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang died], I spent all night reading the news on Weibo and WeChat. Like me, my friends didn\u2019t sleep. Every update someone saw, they would immediately share. This was the hardest time for me. There\u2019s no way to really deal with this except to remember it. Also, in late January when the outbreak first exploded \u2026 seeing all the messages online of people asking for help and the huge gap between what was being reported in the news and what was really happening also caused a lot of mental pressure.

Sexy, not sexist!</p> <p>Sarah Shotton, creative director at the British lingerie brand, describes the apparel as \u201cunder-armour\u201d and the women \u201cfeminine as well as athletic\u201d. The athletes don\u2019t make eye-contact with the viewer, but the gaze remains external (it\u2019s worth noting that the creative team behind the ad are all women, and that the women in the adverts all chose what they wore). This is sex rebranded as empowerment, or empowerment reframed as sex.</p> <p>Delivered with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, it also serves as a reminder, in case we needed one, that there really is no movement \u2013 in this case female empowerment \u2013 that can\u2019t be commodified.

It\u2019s an intense, often scabrously funny series about the perils of parenthood, yet as far from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/01/how-we-made-outnumbered-claire-skinner-interview\" title=\"\">Outnumbered</a></em> \u2013 even from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/13/spiral-7-review-motherland-the-name-of-the-rose-the-capture-zomboat-review\" title=\"\">Motherland</a></em> \u2013 as it\u2019s possible to get and still have a related premise.</p> <p>Paul (Freeman) hates his kids.

But it\u2019s just sometimes \u2013 rather often, in fact, of late \u2013 he finds himself swearing with unaccountable venom and many, many words of the F variety at them.

Paul and Ally\u2019s basic dilemma is, of course, little more than parents have struggled with for long decades, as mores, and attitudes to children, have changed tiresomely fast \u2013 but writers Simon Blackwell, Chris Addison (and Freeman) have taken some not-new premises (the near-crashes when kids wriggle from seatbelts, the quirks of simpering teachers) and dialled them all up to 11. That <em>Tap</em> reference surely is the ideal time to note that Ally\u2019s wayward, charming father is played by Michael McKean: in fact all the supporting cast, including the children and Paul\u2019s father Jim (Alun Armstrong, vouchsafed some drily wonderful lines) are finely cast. Yet it\u2019s to Haggard and especially to Freeman our eyes are constantly drawn: you can see the skull beneath the skin, practically feel the iron band tightening round the head, of Paul. It\u2019s a triumph; but it\u2019s not a cosy watch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38ec67340227a70e6d5c69abe15cc1e50f9845e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38ec67340227a70e6d5c69abe15cc1e50f9845e8/0_331_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Hesmondhalgh and Dawn French in The Trouble With Maggie Cole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A simple waste of a great cast\u2019: Julie Hesmondhalgh and Dawn French in The Trouble With Maggie Cole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joss Barrett/ITV/Genial Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What <em>is</em> unfortunately a cosy watch is <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/the-trouble-with-maggie-cole/2a5883a0001\" title=\"\">The Trouble With Maggie Cole</a></strong>. Its heart might be in the right place but its brain\u2019s in a jar. The title character is played by either Dawn French or, seemingly, Pam Ayres, depending on where the light falls; we\u2019re obviously meant to warm to her, as the well-meaning, nose-poking busybody in a gorgeous little Cornish seaside hamlet, but I\u2019ve warmed more to busy bluebottles. Self-important Maggie, anyway, has spilt the beans, drunkenly, on local radio about six village characters with secrets, and is thus racked with guilt for her pointless gossip.

      "bodyText": "Breeders | Sky One The Trouble With Maggie Cole (ITV) | ITV Hub Child of Our Time (BBC Two) | iPlayer Better Call Saul | Netflix Inside No 9 (BBC Two) | iPlayer Mrs Fletcher | Sky Comedy Breeders burst scatologically on to our screens, with Martin Freeman proving, if he has to prove anything now, that he\u2019s something of a whiz back where we first encountered him \u2013 comedy. It\u2019s an intense, often scabrously funny series about the perils of parenthood, yet as far from Outnumbered \u2013 even from Motherland \u2013 as it\u2019s possible to get and still have a related premise. Paul (Freeman) hates his kids. Don\u2019t get him wrong; he would die for them. But it\u2019s just sometimes \u2013 rather often, in fact, of late \u2013 he finds himself swearing with unaccountable venom and many, many words of the F variety at them. Is there something wrong with him, or is he simply a career-stalled dad negotiating the appalling complexities of conflicting dad advice \u2013 be their friend/don\u2019t be their friend; set them boundaries/set them free \u2013 in the irksomely fraught third decade of the 21st century? Daisy Haggard plays long-term partner Ally (and mother to Luke and Ava) no less superbly: it\u2019s surprisingly rare for an on-screen pairing to be able to convince that they actually have S.E.X. with each other, and their tight-knit, witty bitching about rival, \u201cperfect\u201d schoolgate parents is a delight that never flags. Paul and Ally\u2019s basic dilemma is, of course, little more than parents have struggled with for long decades, as mores, and attitudes to children, have changed tiresomely fast \u2013 but writers Simon Blackwell, Chris Addison (and Freeman) have taken some not-new premises (the near-crashes when kids wriggle from seatbelts, the quirks of simpering teachers) and dialled them all up to 11. That Tap reference surely is the ideal time to note that Ally\u2019s wayward, charming father is played by Michael McKean: in fact all the supporting cast, including the children and Paul\u2019s father Jim (Alun Armstrong, vouchsafed some drily wonderful lines) are finely cast. Yet it\u2019s to Haggard and especially to Freeman our eyes are constantly drawn: you can see the skull beneath the skin, practically feel the iron band tightening round the head, of Paul. It\u2019s a triumph; but it\u2019s not a cosy watch. What is unfortunately a cosy watch is The Trouble With Maggie Cole. Its heart might be in the right place but its brain\u2019s in a jar. The title character is played by either Dawn French or, seemingly, Pam Ayres, depending on where the light falls; we\u2019re obviously meant to warm to her, as the well-meaning, nose-poking busybody in a gorgeous little Cornish seaside hamlet, but I\u2019ve warmed more to busy bluebottles. Self-important Maggie, anyway, has spilt the beans, drunkenly, on local radio about six village characters with secrets, and is thus racked with guilt for her pointless gossip. But she somehow seems to have hit a seam of truth about at least two or three, and thus the stage is set for confrontations and reckonings. The trouble with The Trouble With\u2026 is that it\u2019s billed as a comedy-drama, and one of its main sins is that it\u2019s relentlessly unfunny. To say it falls short of The Vicar of Dibley is not a compliment. It might have worked as a simple drama (a big \u201cmight\u201d) but as it stands it is a simple waste of a grand cast, including Julie Hesmondhalgh.

On Tuesday, with coronavirus doing what a virus does, meaning going viral, the on-air chat was of little else. And although everyone kept insisting that we should just follow governmental advice, the calls from listeners to <em>Your Call</em> revealed how confused people are. Should a listener with sciatica stop taking her immune-suppressant medication? (No, she should take it.) Should someone who\u2019s been to Basel in Switzerland and has a few mild symptoms go to work? (No, stay home and call 111, because then you will be logged somewhere on the NHS system, so that if you do get ill, you have a contact.) So said <a href=\"https://www.thethirdwayofevolution.com/people/view/frank-p.-ryan\" title=\"\">Dr Frank Ryan</a>, a virus specialist who didn\u2019t seem to agree with governmental advice about very much at all. The BBC has rushed out a coronavirus podcast <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p085f9hw\" title=\"\">on Sounds</a>, by the way, which includes this show.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, with the news that Nadine Dorries had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/health-minister-nadine-dorries-diagnosed-with-coronavirus\" title=\"\">tested positive</a> for the virus, Barnett welcomed the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who\u2019d recently had a meeting with Dorries and so, after calling 111, decided to self-isolate. Maskell stays with her sister when working as an MP in London, she said. Barnett, always alert to detail, pounced. How was that working? Maskell has \u201ccreated a barrier\u201d, she said. \u201cHow have you done this?\u201d wondered Barnett, and we discovered that Maskell was, essentially, sitting in her bedroom, texting, calling and using her computer, only emerging to use the bathroom and, possibly, make cheese on toast. Listener Steve wondered if Maskell was getting full pay or sick pay, but she confessed she hadn\u2019t even asked as yet.</p> <p>Later, we got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/key-points-from-budget-2020-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/key-points-from-budget-2020-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">budget</a>, which was the usual shouting and sneering fest. Why were MPs going to the Houses of Parliament at all, wondered many 5 Live listeners, given that one of them had tested positive? Why couldn\u2019t they all just stay at home and listen to the radio for the chancellor\u2019s speech? \u201cWe\u2019d take it wherever Rishi Sunak was,\u201d agreed Barnett. \u201cWe\u2019d just link up the mics.\u201d If unnecessary gatherings are to be cancelled for health reasons, I do hope that parliament leads by example. All MPs should immediately self-isolate in their bedrooms, eat delivery pizza and attempt a spot of online work, before getting distracted by the internet, spraying around some disinfectant and spending three hours bitching about the state of the world on social media. Finally, they\u2019ll start to understand the youth of today.</p> <p>Or they could catch up on <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qpgr\" title=\"\">The Archers</a></strong>, which has gone tonto this week. Not a peep about Covid-19, but a surprise explosion at Grey Gables, which took out Lynda Snell (oh no!) and a random builder called Blake.</p> <p>A soil pipe was leaking under the kitchen floor, throwing the country hotel into some disarray: Fallon had to send over some emergency quiche. Philip agreed to have some of his builder lads sort out the kitchen \u2013 his son, Gavin, was one of them \u2013 and something must have gone wrong because the whole place exploded, just as Tracy was having a heart to heart withEmma about Emma divorcing Ed Grundy, and Lynda was telling the builders to stop making so much noise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62503ebe40c08250103cd3841af8be446d711f7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62503ebe40c08250103cd3841af8be446d711f7b/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carole Boyd as Lynda Snell in The Archers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beating heart of Ambridge\u2026 Carole Boyd as Lynda Snell in The Archers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Gary Moyes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The explosion was a genuine shock. No foreshadowing, nothing to indicate it might happen: such is the way of unplanned explosions, I suppose. Silly Freddie Pargetter, who had spent the previous episode being cross with Lynda (it happens), ended up being trapped beneath the rubble with her, and had to try and drag her out, poor lad. Lynda said nothing at all: this did not bode well.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s episode, in the hospital, was very well done. Robert, Lynda\u2019s husband, was in bits, with Jim trying to talk him down: beautiful acting from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/31/surrey-gp-reveals-archers-character-robert-snell-graham-blockey\" title=\"\">Graham </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/31/surrey-gp-reveals-archers-character-robert-snell-graham-blockey\" title=\"\">Blockey</a> and John Rowe. And Freddie\u2019s talk to his auntie Shula (Toby Laurence and Judy Bennett) was also very moving: he didn\u2019t save Lynda, he said, he\u2019d given up. \u201cThe fire was right by her feet.\u201d</p> <p>Lynda Snell, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2SBf17mJq4P9jsvHgJlZLlS/lynda-snell\" title=\"\">played by Carole Boyd</a>, is an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thearchers/entries/824f33c7-e2dd-3812-ace7-9d9896c5c8c6\" title=\"\">immensely popular</a> <em>Archers</em> character \u2013 a meddling busybody, a know-all snob \u2013 and I do hope she\u2019s OK. But with a collapsed lung, fractured pelvis and \u201cfull-thickness burns\u201d, it doesn\u2019t sound good.

We get the facts \u2013 only around 1 in 12 people actually panicked when they heard it; we hear from those who believed it; and we also get consideration of whether such a broadcasting event could happen again. \u201cIt\u2019s the way that the story unfolded, step by step by step,\u201d says presenter Jad Abumrad\u2026</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.werealive.com/\" title=\"\">We\u2019re Alive/Goldrush</a></strong><br><em>We\u2019re Alive</em>, one of the best and earliest drama podcasts, ran from 2009-14, and is considered the gold standard of contemporary apocalypse shows.

Plus, the company that made <em>We\u2019re Alive</em> has just put out a 10-part follow-up, <em>Goldrush</em>, set 17 years after <em>We\u2019re Alive</em>\u2019s main events. <em>We\u2019re Alive</em> is an imaginative teenagers\u2019 dream and nightmare rolled into one.

It\u2019s a spin-off from <em>Ash Tales</em>\u2019s main website, which showcases new writing about various end-of-the-world scenarios: super plagues, nuclear disasters, you know the stuff.

      "bodyText": "Your Call (Radio 5 Live) | BBC Sounds The Emma Barnett Show (Radio 5 Live) | BBC Sounds The Archers (Radio 4) | BBC Sounds Live radio is always the best medium in a crisis. If you want to know what\u2019s going on, tune to 5 Live, LBC or your local radio station. Rolling news, expert opinion, plus listener reaction and listeners\u2019 questions are often surprising and insightful. So this week I\u2019ve been listening to Your Call, with Rachel Burden, and to Emma Barnett, both on 5 Live, as well as LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari (a bit) and James O\u2019Brien. On Tuesday, with coronavirus doing what a virus does, meaning going viral, the on-air chat was of little else. And although everyone kept insisting that we should just follow governmental advice, the calls from listeners to Your Call revealed how confused people are. Should a listener with sciatica stop taking her immune-suppressant medication? (No, she should take it.) Should someone who\u2019s been to Basel in Switzerland and has a few mild symptoms go to work? (No, stay home and call 111, because then you will be logged somewhere on the NHS system, so that if you do get ill, you have a contact.) So said Dr Frank Ryan, a virus specialist who didn\u2019t seem to agree with governmental advice about very much at all. The BBC has rushed out a coronavirus podcast on Sounds, by the way, which includes this show. On Wednesday morning, with the news that Nadine Dorries had tested positive for the virus, Barnett welcomed the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who\u2019d recently had a meeting with Dorries and so, after calling 111, decided to self-isolate. Maskell stays with her sister when working as an MP in London, she said. Barnett, always alert to detail, pounced. How was that working? Maskell has \u201ccreated a barrier\u201d, she said. \u201cHow have you done this?\u201d wondered Barnett, and we discovered that Maskell was, essentially, sitting in her bedroom, texting, calling and using her computer, only emerging to use the bathroom and, possibly, make cheese on toast. Listener Steve wondered if Maskell was getting full pay or sick pay, but she confessed she hadn\u2019t even asked as yet. Later, we got the budget, which was the usual shouting and sneering fest. Why were MPs going to the Houses of Parliament at all, wondered many 5 Live listeners, given that one of them had tested positive? Why couldn\u2019t they all just stay at home and listen to the radio for the chancellor\u2019s speech? \u201cWe\u2019d take it wherever Rishi Sunak was,\u201d agreed Barnett. \u201cWe\u2019d just link up the mics.\u201d If unnecessary gatherings are to be cancelled for health reasons, I do hope that parliament leads by example. All MPs should immediately self-isolate in their bedrooms, eat delivery pizza and attempt a spot of online work, before getting distracted by the internet, spraying around some disinfectant and spending three hours bitching about the state of the world on social media. Finally, they\u2019ll start to understand the youth of today. Or they could catch up on The Archers, which has gone tonto this week. Not a peep about Covid-19, but a surprise explosion at Grey Gables, which took out Lynda Snell (oh no!) and a random builder called Blake. A soil pipe was leaking under the kitchen floor, throwing the country hotel into some disarray: Fallon had to send over some emergency quiche. Philip agreed to have some of his builder lads sort out the kitchen \u2013 his son, Gavin, was one of them \u2013 and something must have gone wrong because the whole place exploded, just as Tracy was having a heart to heart withEmma about Emma divorcing Ed Grundy, and Lynda was telling the builders to stop making so much noise. The explosion was a genuine shock. No foreshadowing, nothing to indicate it might happen: such is the way of unplanned explosions, I suppose. Silly Freddie Pargetter, who had spent the previous episode being cross with Lynda (it happens), ended up being trapped beneath the rubble with her, and had to try and drag her out, poor lad. Lynda said nothing at all: this did not bode well. Tuesday\u2019s episode, in the hospital, was very well done. Robert, Lynda\u2019s husband, was in bits, with Jim trying to talk him down: beautiful acting from Graham Blockey and John Rowe. And Freddie\u2019s talk to his auntie Shula (Toby Laurence and Judy Bennett) was also very moving: he didn\u2019t save Lynda, he said, he\u2019d given up. \u201cThe fire was right by her feet.\u201d Lynda Snell, played by Carole Boyd, is an immensely popular Archers character \u2013 a meddling busybody, a know-all snob \u2013 and I do hope she\u2019s OK. But with a collapsed lung, fractured pelvis and \u201cfull-thickness burns\u201d, it doesn\u2019t sound good. If coronavirus brings too many infectious patients into Borchester General, Lynda may well be a goner. Which would be, for many Archers listeners, the absolute end. Three great apocalyptic podcasts War of the Worlds Orson Welles\u2019s wireless dramatisation of HG Wells\u2019s The War of the Worlds famously caused widespread panic across the US after it was broadcast one evening in 1938. The wonderful Radiolab celebrated this event in one of its live episodes, and it\u2019s a lovely listen, as always. We get the facts \u2013 only around 1 in 12 people actually panicked when they heard it; we hear from those who believed it; and we also get consideration of whether such a broadcasting event could happen again. \u201cIt\u2019s the way that the story unfolded, step by step by step,\u201d says presenter Jad Abumrad\u2026 We\u2019re Alive/Goldrush We\u2019re Alive, one of the best and earliest drama podcasts, ran from 2009-14, and is considered the gold standard of contemporary apocalypse shows. It\u2019s a full-on zombie affair, set in downtown Los Angeles, and there are 143 episodes, so you\u2019re in for a nice long binge-listen, if you happen to be stuck indoors for a long time. Plus, the company that made We\u2019re Alive has just put out a 10-part follow-up, Goldrush, set 17 years after We\u2019re Alive\u2019s main events. We\u2019re Alive is an imaginative teenagers\u2019 dream and nightmare rolled into one. Perfect for these crazy days. Ash Tales A fairly recent podcast, Ash Tales is a story show: we hear new short fiction about the end of the world, nicely narrated by presenter Ryan Law, with each episode coming in under 20 minutes. It\u2019s a spin-off from Ash Tales\u2019s main website, which showcases new writing about various end-of-the-world scenarios: super plagues, nuclear disasters, you know the stuff. It could perhaps do with a different narrator from time to time, and some added audio atmosphere, but the stories are great and this is a small, interesting British show that\u2019s worth supporting.",

In America, the word \u201cpublic\u201d \u2013 as in public health, public education or public welfare \u2013 means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good.</p> <p>Contrast this with America\u2019s financial system.

Local and state health departments are already bare bones, having lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials.</p> <p>Healthcare in America is delivered mainly by private for-profit corporations which, unlike financial institutions, are not required to maintain reserve capacity.

Vast numbers of self-employed workers cannot afford sick leave.

      "bodyText": "Dr Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and just about the only official in the Trump administration trusted to tell the truth about the coronavirus, said last Thursday: \u201cThe system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now \u2026 It is a failing, let\u2019s admit it.\u201d While we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s admit something more basic. The system would be failing even under a halfway competent president. The dirty little secret, which will soon become apparent to all, is that there is no real public health system in the United States. The ad hoc response fashioned late Friday by House Democrats and the White House may help a bit, although it\u2019s skimpy, as I\u2019ll explain. As the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it. Instead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job. At their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word \u201cpublic\u201d \u2013 as in public health, public education or public welfare \u2013 means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good. Contrast this with America\u2019s financial system. The Federal Reserve concerns itself with the health of financial markets as a whole. Late last week the Fed made $1.5tn available to banks, at the slightest hint of difficulties making trades. No one batted an eye. When it comes to the health of the nation as a whole, money like this isn\u2019t available. And there are no institutions analogous to the Fed with responsibility for overseeing and managing the public\u2019s health \u2013 able to whip out a giant checkbook at a moment\u2019s notice to prevent human, rather than financial, devastation. Even if a test for the Covid-19 virus had been developed and approved in time, no institutions are in place to administer it to tens of millions of Americans free of charge. Local and state health departments are already bare bones, having lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Healthcare in America is delivered mainly by private for-profit corporations which, unlike financial institutions, are not required to maintain reserve capacity. As a result, the nation\u2019s supply of ventilators isn\u2019t nearly large enough to care for projected numbers of critically ill coronavirus victims unable to breathe for themselves. Its 45,000 intensive care unit beds fall woefully short of the 2.9 million likely to be needed. The Fed can close banks to quarantine financial crises but the US can\u2019t close workplaces because the nation\u2019s social insurance system depends on people going to work. Almost 30% of American workers have no paid sick leave from their employers, including 70% of low-income workers earning less than $10.49 an hour. Vast numbers of self-employed workers cannot afford sick leave. Friday\u2019s deal between House Democrats and the White House won\u2019t have much effect because it exempts large employers and offers waivers to smaller ones. Most jobless Americans don\u2019t qualify for unemployment insurance because they haven\u2019t worked long enough in a steady job and the ad-hoc deal doesn\u2019t alter this. Meanwhile, more than 30 million Americans have no health insurance. Eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps and other public assistance is now linked to having or actively looking for work. It\u2019s hard to close public schools because most working parents cannot afford childcare. Many poor children rely on school lunches for their only square meal a day. In Los Angeles, about 80% of students qualify for free or reduced lunches and just under 20,000 are homeless at some point during the school year. There is no public health system in the US, in short, because the richest nation in the world has no capacity to protect the public as a whole, apart from national defense. Ad-hoc remedies such as House Democrats and the White House fashioned on Friday are better than nothing, but they don\u2019t come close to filling this void.

The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has proposed the Morrison government allow the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security to review the criteria to ensure they are fit for purpose. The massacre of 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch in March 2019 prompted calls for greater social cohesion in Australia and a renewed focus on extreme rightwing terrorism, particularly by the Labor party. In October Australia\u2019s spy agency warned extreme rightwing terrorism had become \u201cmore cohesive and organised\u201d \u2013 a warning repeated in February. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was soon after criticised for promoting a false equivalence between radical far-right groups and \u201cleftwing terrorism\u201d. The United States and Britain have listed extreme rightwing groups as terrorist organisations. Dutton has said he will do the same if the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation recommends it. Listing an organisation on the terrorism list criminalises membership or association with the group. Keneally has told Nine newspapers that Asio\u2019s warnings about rightwing extremists seemed inconsistent with the fact no rightwing groups were on the terrorist list. \u201cIt may be that the criteria for listing organisations in Australia isn\u2019t fit-for-purpose when it comes to rightwing extremism,\u201d Keneally reportedly said. \u201cFor example, the definition of terrorism in Australia and the UK is similar but with a stark difference: the UK definition of terrorism explicitly extends to violent acts or threats made for the purpose of advancing a racial cause. \u201cThe Australian government and all federal parliamentarians must now take the terrorist threat of rightwing extremism seriously and respond.\u201d Keneally suggested the joint committee could review the criteria for listing terrorist organisations, a bipartisan move that would ensure parliamentarians don\u2019t \u201cplay politics or engage in culture wars over such issues\u201d. \u201cKeeping Australians safe is too important for that.\u201d In a statement on Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia \u201cstands in unity and solidarity with New Zealand on the first anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks in Christchurch\u201d. \u201cNew Zealanders responded to hate with love in the aftermath of this terrible incident, and that powerful message endures today,\u201d he said. \u201cOur two nations share an ongoing commitment to peace and freedom and we continue to reject those who seek to spread division and hatred. \u201cGlobally, whether it\u2019s the Christchurch Call to Action or last year\u2019s G20 and G7 resolutions to stamp out online hate and violence, New Zealand and Australia will continue our work to ensure something like this does not happen again.\u201d In April Australia passed world-first legislation to crack down on violent videos on social media, to prevent a reoccurrence of the Christchurch attacker\u2019s video spreading on social media faster than it could be removed.

      "bodyText": "School closures and stockpiling a fortnight\u2019s food to prepare for coronavirus self-isolation are \u201cpremature\u201d for the general population, the health minister, Greg Hunt, and chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, have said, though all options are on the table. Appearing alongside Hunt on ABC\u2019s Insiders on Sunday, Murphy said that federal authorities are currently recommending that returned travellers socially distance themselves although others should begin \u201cpractising\u201d to do the same, especially at-risk groups such as the elderly. Both reiterated these settings may change in future, with Hunt confirming that all options are on the table in the event a more general lockdown is required. Public concern about the consistency of advice about responding to coronavirus has grown as schools and universities prepare for shutdowns and the Victorian chief medical officer has suggested stockpiling a fortnight\u2019s worth of food. Labor and medical experts who do not report directly to governments have suggested Australia has been too slow to roll out a public information campaign and to advise in favour of more drastic social distancing. On Friday the Council of Australia Governments agreed that from Monday non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled. Scott Morrison said the advice did not apply to attendance at work, childcare, schools, university lectures, public transport, airports \u201cor things of that nature\u201d. On Sunday Hunt told Insiders the government\u2019s best estimate is that the coronavirus will reach its peak in Australia in a \u201csix-month window\u201d although it \u201cmight be longer\u201d. Asked about general lockdowns, Murphy replied they may be used although they may focus on one part of the country and not others. \u201cIt \u2013 it is potential that could be the case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.\u201d Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: \u201cPotentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.\u201d \u201cThere are no options that are off the table,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThe paramount goal, and the prime minister said this to me at the outset, is protecting health.\u201d Murphy said authorities were \u201cstrongly suggesting that returned travellers should practise what we call \u2018social distancing\u2019. \u201cSo that\u2019s keeping a distance of 1.5 metres, if possible, from people, not getting in close contact \u2026 not shaking hands [and] avoiding all public gatherings.\u201d Murphy said that advice relating to gatherings of 500 people or more \u201cmay well change\u201d but Australia, which he said had \u201conly 250 cases\u201d, was still \u201cahead of the curve\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re over 70 you should be more careful, particularly if you have chronic disease, you should \u2026 [exercise] more social distancing,\u201d he said, and \u201cavoid things that aren\u2019t essential\u201d. Murphy said for others the risk of attending public places with fewer than 500 people, such as a cinema, was still at this stage \u201crelatively low\u201d and at the moment authorities were not recommending people stop taking the train. As case numbers increase, the medical advice will respond to recommend greater social distancing, he said. \u201cI think the gym is fine but everybody at the moment needs to practise very good hygiene. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the gym, I would be very focused on hand washing, using hand sanitisers, all of those social distancing, good hygiene measures, we want everybody in the community to start practising those.\u201d Asked about the Victorian chief medical officer\u2019s suggestion people should stockpile a fortnight\u2019s worth of food, Murphy replied it was \u201ca little bit premature at the moment\u201d. \u201cFor most people we don\u2019t want to encourage major panic buying at the moment \u2013 we\u2019ve seen that with the supermarket chains. But I think it is probably sensible to have a few days of supply.\u201d Asked about school closures, Hunt said the government was keeping all options on the table and would be guided by medical advice. He said governments did not want to \u201cmove too early\u201d because of the risk of children being at home with their grandparents and \u201ctaking parents out of the workforce who might be in the health and medical sector, [and] disrupting supply chains\u201d. Murphy said there was \u201cno question we have a range of social distancing measures that we will not hesitate to recommend to government but they\u2019ve got to be proportional and they might last for a long time\u201d. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to move too early.\u201d Murphy said there were \u201cvery few reports of symptomatic infection in children\u201d and authorities don\u2019t know \u201cwhether children are getting infected but just don\u2019t get symptoms [and] they can still spread it or they\u2019re not getting infected\u201d. \u201cThe former is probably more likely.\u201d Murphy also suggested children getting infected may contribute to herd immunity. Hunt said the government had started rolling out its first information campaign about coronavirus, and advice can be accessed at health.gov.au. The campaign urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they\u2019re feeling unwell. Murphy said Australian authorities define \u201cclose contact\u201d \u2013 which requires self-isolation \u2013 as \u201csomeone who has been in contact with someone who is symptomatic at any stage or up to 24 hours before\u201d. He then clarified that only people with contact with someone with coronavirus who had symptoms in the last 24 hours needs to self-isolate because they are \u201cvery, very unlikely to have been infectious\u201d. On Sunday Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, said he was \u201caghast\u201d at the lack of clarity and structure in the coronavirus response. Bowtell told Sky News that Murphy\u2019s advice on hand shaking was \u201cinconsistent with what New South Wales Health is saying\u201d and argued there is \u201cno coherent advice\u201d about whether schools should open from Monday. Bowtell said the government appeared to \u201chave no plan\u201d for the fact people whose wages are at threat will be unlikely to get tested, and said it was \u201cimperative\u201d to address the issue. The Morrison government has trimmed the waiting period for sickness allowance by one week, but rejected calls to introduce paid leave for casuals. Earlier, Hunt and Murphy addressed the revelation on Friday that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had been infected with coronavirus, after attending cabinet on Tuesday. Murphy suggested commonwealth offices in Sydney may have been cleaned out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d and Hunt suggested Qantas may have contacted passengers near Dutton on an earlier flight because the time period had not been determined. Hunt said Queensland Health had now determined \u201cthe relevant time for contact with Peter Dutton was the 11th of March\u201d, meaning cabinet members did not need to self-isolate as a result of Tuesday\u2019s meeting. On Friday Coag agreed to weekly meetings of a \u201cnational cabinet\u201d made up of Morrison, the six premiers and two chief ministers, as well as key federal ministers such as the treasurer. The first meeting will be held at midday on Sunday. So far Australia has responded to the coronavirus through travel bans from the worst-affected countries, a $2.4bn health package to create 100 fever clinics and boost telehealth consultations and a $17.6bn stimulus package to prevent a major economic downturn. The Morrison government has set up a new coronavirus business unit in the Treasury to support business confidence, employment and business continuity.",

      "bodyText": "The Vivid Sydney light festival has been cancelled due to measures put in place to limit public gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus, as the number of diagnoses in Australia continues to rise. However, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition \u2013 without crowds \u2013 into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. The number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New South Wales rose by 22 in 24 hours to 134, with more than 250 cases nationally. In Victoria, the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said eight new cases had been confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 57. In Tasmania, passengers and crew were barred from disembarking from a cruise ship that docked in Hobart. The NSW tourism minister, Stuart Ayres, said the decision to cancel Vivid was made after recommendations from the federal government to limit non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people. Vivid, now in its 11th year, was scheduled to run from 22 May to 13 June. \u201cVivid Sydney is a bright star of Sydney\u2019s event calendar so the decision to cancel was not taken lightly. As the event owner, we must follow the advice of health officials to ensure the health and safety of our citizens and everyone involved with Vivid Sydney,\u201d Ayres said. \u201cWe have taken the decision early in consideration of those planning to travel to Sydney for the festival, our commercial partners, artists, and volunteers so as to minimise the disruption and impact on them. \u201cWe are currently working through the full implications of the cancellation and will provide further information and advice as soon as it\u2019s available.\u201d In 2019, a record 2.4 million attended Vivid, bringing $172m into the NSW economy. Ayres said the decision to cancel was \u201canother body blow\u201d for the tourism industry, which has already endured challenges as a result of the bushfire crisis. In NSW an additional 22 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 between 11am on Saturday and 11am on Sunday, NSW Health said in a statement. The new cases include three people who recently returned from the United States, one who had returned from Singapore and another from the Philippines. Five people caught the infection after contact with other confirmed cases of COVID-19. The source for the remainder of the 22 new cases is under investigation, however two of those had also travelled overseas recently, including one to the United States. NSW Health said of the 134 cases, 60 were acquired overseas while 38 were infected after contact with a confirmed case. The remaining were either unknown or under investigation. A further 1,924 cases in NSW were being investigated as possible Covid-19 cases while 20,511 people have been tested and cleared. Meanwhile, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand\u2019s NRL\u2019s team the Warriors will stay in Australia after travel restrictions were announced by the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. The second round will go ahead as scheduled without crowds. \u201cIn the interim we will continue round two. At this stage we will play round two and assess the situation,\u201d the Australian Rugby League commission chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, said. In Hobart, passengers and crews were told not to leave a cruise ship that docked in the city on Saturday. About 1,400 passengers and staff aboard the MSC Magnifica were told they could not return to the ship if they disembarked, an MSC Cruises spokeswoman told the Mercury. No one on the ship has the illness but the captain made the call as a precaution to protect passengers\u2019 health. The ship left Italy in early January before the coronavirus became a global concern. Tasmania\u2019s acting director of public health, Scott McKeown, said on Saturday the state now had its sixth confirmed case of Covid-19 after a woman in her 60s tested positive. She was identified as a close contact of a previous Tasmanian case, who had recently travelled overseas, McKeown said on Sunday. The woman and all the other five cases in Tasmania were in a stable condition and remained in isolation receiving medical care. The state\u2019s Public Health Services had identified and contacted the woman\u2019s close contacts. These people will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days and receive daily follow-up from PHS staff. The new cases in Victoria this weekend include six men and two women with ages ranging from their teens to 60s. One is a student \u2013 a known contact of case 17, a teacher from Carey Grammar. The student was not at school during their infectious period. The school will remain closed until the holidays. And as a precaution, 12 classmates will home-isolate. Sutton said all cases were recovering at home in isolation. All had acquired the infection from either overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19. At present, there remained only one case in Victoria that may have been acquired through community transmission.",

Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</li> \n   <li><strong>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus. </strong>The NHS is to form <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">an unprecedented partnership</a> with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients. </li> \n   <li><strong>A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. </strong>The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital.</strong> The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follows in the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure all public places \u201cnon-essential\u201d from midnight on Saturday. </li> \n   <li><strong>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus. </strong>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</li> \n   <li><strong>Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. </strong>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy.\u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. </strong>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions.

on the situation in Colombia and Venezula from my Bogota-based colleague <strong>Joe Parkin Daniels</strong> :</p> \n  <p>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation, a move that is likely to have lasting ramifications given the scale of Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis.</p> \n  <p>About 4.5 million people have fled Venezuela which, despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela.</p> \n  <p>Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home.</p> \n  <p>The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning.</p> \n  <p>The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the country\u2019s legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders.</p> \n  <p>Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. </p> \n  <p>\u201cColombia\u2019s overnight decision to \u2018close\u2019 its porous border with Venezuela won\u2019t stop the flow of people,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GRamsey_LatAm/status/1238832345916071936\">tweeted</a> Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBut it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, Colombia\u2019s president, described the closure in a statement as \u201ca measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].\u201d</p> \n  <p>M\u00e1rquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents.</p> \n  <p>All measures are expected to last until 30 May.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:41:21.305Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d11628f085c6327bbff36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:21:57.821Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/newborn-baby-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-london\">earlier today</a>. </p> \n  <p>The child\u2019s mother, who was taken to a north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.</p> \n  <p>Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises \u201cconcerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He told PA Media:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. </p> \n   <p>It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected.</p> \n   <p>Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation.</p> \n   <p>The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. </p> \n   <p>The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d10118f088d75755936d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:14:19.548Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data.

The son developed symptoms a fortnight after returning to India. Officials are trying to trace the 1,500 people he may have been in contact with at the large plant where he worked. </p> \n  <p>Her family complained that the cemetery they took her to refused to cremate her. Crematoriums in India tended to be crowded and the staff felt at risk. It was only when doctors arrived to prescribe the right protocol that her last rites were performed. The number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 84.</p> \n  <p>With no hand sanitisers available, the New Delhi government has designated them \u2018essential commodities\u2019 so that anyone hoarding them or selling them at inflated prices can be punished by law.</p> \n  <p> As stories trickle in of some people concealing their travel history to affected areas or refusing to be tested and, if necessary, isolated, the Delhi government has also invoked the Epidemic Act. This allows district magistrates to take coercive action to isolate high-risk people. </p> \n  <p>The wife of a Google employee in Bengaluru, for example, fled her home and vanished last week. Officials found that she had flown to Delhi \u2013 at the other end of the country - and travelled by train to Agra to her parents\u2019 home.</p> \n  <p>Across many states, social life is being curbed with weddings, engagement ceremonies and birthday parties banned in the south Indian state of Karnataka. The message to Indians is to stay at home and avoid large gatherings. Several states have closed swimming pools, gyms, cinemas, night clubs, and theatres. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccf648f088d7575593533\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:40:21.340Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A petition calling for the UK to go into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus has reached more than 110,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for parliamentary debate. </p> \n  <p>It encourages the UK to follow the containment procedures of countries that have been widely affected by the outbreak, by restricting unnecessary travel and discouraging public gatherings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is time the government should prioritise the health of the public and should consider how vital it is to implement effective containment now,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIt is better to spend money to contain the virus and treating the relatively low numbers who are ill now rather than wait for more casualties.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The government responds to all petitions with more than 10,000 signatures, and considers any petition with more than 100,000 signatures for parliamentary debate.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:41:07.909Z\">at 12.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccdf18f085c6327bbfd82\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:29:53.448Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This video explores how Islam has been impacted by coronavirus.

Summary Donald Trump given coronavirus all clear. Donald Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time). NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus. The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients. A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group said that enforcing social distancing now could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d. The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follows in the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure all public places \u201cnon-essential\u201d from midnight on Saturday. Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus. The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement. Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy.\u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said. Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned. Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday. Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. While Morocco has banned flight to and from as many as 25 countries. Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths. As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University. The institution runs a live tracker of coronavirus cases, based on official figures, meaning that the true figures may be somewhat higher. That is from me in London this evening. One of my colleagues will soon get going on a new liveblog to bring you all the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak. A White House physician has issued a statement confirming that Donald Trump does not have Covid-19. It comes after the US president confirmed he had been tested for the virus at a press briefing earlier on Saturday. The Spanish government has just announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement. Earlier this week, two of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s ministers also tested positive for the virus. Here is more heartening footage of a neighbourhood in Madrid spontaneously breaking into a round of applause in support of Spain\u2019s healthcare workers. It comes shortly after the Spanish government announced a nationwide lockdown would come into effect on Monday morning. The video is filmed by student Sam Llewellyn Smith, who is set to fly back to the UK tomorrow before the lockdown comes into effect. For more on the latest in Spain, read this report: Scientists warn against UK government\u2019s \u2018herd immunity\u2019 strategy More than 245 scientists and mathematicians have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading, saying acting now would save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d. It comes as the NHS announced an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector in an emergency plan to combat the coronavirus crisis, as fears grow that publicly funded hospitals will soon be unable to cope with the number of patients suffering from the virus. My colleagues Denis Campbell, Toby Helm, Robin McKie and James Tapper have the full report: More details on the scientists\u2019 letter to the government, urging it to immediately enforce social distancing, can be found here: Details continue to emerge of Israel\u2019s plans to use anti-terrorism tracking technology to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. Cyber tech monitoring would be deployed to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus, subject to cabinet approval, Netanyahu told a news conference in Jerusalem. \u201cWe will very soon begin using technology ... digital means that we have been using in order to fight terrorism,\u201d Netanyahu said. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. The Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security service, confirmed that it was examining the use of its technological capabilities to fight coronavirus, at the request of Netanyahu and the Health Ministry. Avner Pinchuk, a privacy expert with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said such capabilities could include real-time tracking of infected persons\u2019 mobile phones to spot quarantine breaches and backtracking through meta-data to figure out where they had been and who they had contacted. \u201cI am troubled by this announcement. I understand that we are in unique circumstances, but this seems potentially like over-reach. Much will depend on how intrusive the new measures are,\u201d Pinchuk told Reuters news agency. The governor of Louisiana has confirmed the states\u2019 first coronavirus-related death \u2013 a 58-year-old with underlying health conditions. Twitter has created a new emoji to encourage handwashing during the coronavirus outbreak. Here is what they look like: Among the manufacturing firms taking part in Johnson\u2019s call will be Unipart Group, which makes precision parts and also manages large parts of the NHS warehousing and logistics chain. Unipart chairman John Neill said: \u201cThis is a critical initiative \u2013 there are a lot of talented people already working at a great speed on this, it has my and others\u2019 full-hearted support.\u201d Boris Johnson is calling on British manufacturers to boost production of ventilators and other medical equipment to prepare for a significant increase in the number of coronavirus cases. The prime minister has also warned private hospitals to prepare for an overspill of patients from the public health service. In a conference call on Monday, Boris Johnson will urge manufacturers to join a \u201cnational effort\u201d to tackle the virus. Engineers have already been asked to draw up plans to quickly produce more ventilators in the UK amid concerns that critical care facilities will come under intense pressure as the Covid-19 crisis intensifies. In Monday\u2019s call, the prime minister will confirm that the government will buy up stocks of new ventilators that can be produced. Sportswriter Jonathan Liew, in London, reflects on the dearth of sporting events amid the coronavirus pandemic. He writes: Things move pretty fast in the corona-verse: in the space of a fortnight we\u2019ve gone from ironic elbow-bumps in the pub to the postponement of virtually the entire sporting schedule, Euro 2020 potentially becoming Euro 2021, Mikel Arteta in quarantine. Every day, every hour seems to bring more jolts to a system that on some level we all took for granted. Read the full story: Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Serraj also said, in a broadcast address, that his internationally recognised government had earmarked 500 million Libyan dinars ($360.54 million) to combat the disease if it reached Libya, though no cases had been confirmed so far. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday. Ecuador has announced sweeping restrictions, hours after the second person to die from Covid-19 in the Andean country was reported. Starting tonight, foreigners will be banned from entering Ecuador, whether that is by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned. The bodies of those that die from the disease will be cremated. Ecuador\u2019s vice president Otto Sonnenholzner announced the measures \u2013 the strictest in South America \u2013 on Saturday. \u201cThis a problem for all of Ecuador, which could affect all of us,\u201d Sonnenholzner said at an emergency operations committee meeting in Quito on Saturday afternoon. The country has confirmed 28 cases and two deaths. From Madrid correspondent Sam Jones: Just had a wonderful moment at 10pm local time as neighbourhoods across Spain applauded and cheered all the people who work in the country\u2019s healthcare system. A bright moment amid the lockdown. Ireland\u2019s foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney has issued a travel advisory warning against all but essential travel to Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Malta, Poland, and Slovakia. He has also issued a telephone number for all Irish citizens impacted by flight cancellations. The Swedish government is advising its citizens against all non-necessary trips abroad, it said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cDue to the widespread spread of the new coronavirus and the rapidly changing and uncertain situation that exists for travellers, the ministry of foreign affairs advises against unnecessary travel to all countries,\u201d the government said. Madrid correspondent Sam Jones has the latest from Spain: The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. Speaking after a seven-hour cabinet meeting on Saturday evening, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said \u201cextraordinary decisions\u201d needed to be taken as Spain grappled with a \u201chealth, social and economic crisis\u201d. Spain is the country most affected by the coronavirus in Europe after Italy, and has so far confirmed 6,251 cases of the virus and 193 deaths. Italy has already taken similar measures. S\u00e1nchez said the central government would direct the response and that all the local, national and regional police forces would come under the command of the interior ministry. He also said that the army was standing by and ready to help with the emergency response. The prime minister confirmed that people would be required to stay home from Monday morning and that all non-essential shops would close, along with bars, restaurants, cafes and cinemas. Supermarkets, small food shops, pharmacies, petrols stations and pet supply shops are among those businesses that will remain open. He said: \u201cDuring the state of emergency, people will only be allowed out on to public streets for the following reasons: to buy food, basic or pharmaceutical items; to attend medical centres; to go to and from work; to look after children, older people or those with disabilities or who are especially vulnerable, and to attend financial or insurance offices on force majeure grounds.\u201d S\u00e1nchez acknowledged that the measures needed to tackle the coronavirus would have a \u201cbig economic impact\u201d but said the government was committed to mitigating its effects. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. The statement said all public gatherings, such as weddings and social events, will also be banned. Meanwhile, Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. In case you missed it, here is a video from Saturday\u2019s White House briefing in which Donald Trump revealed he has been tested coronavirus. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has also announced that medium-distance rail transport will be reduced as part of the government\u2019s state of emergency measures. This restriction on freedom of movement will come into effect on Saturday. Sanchez added that it would not be reasonable to hold planned regional elections in Galicia and the Basque country amid the coronavirus lockdown. My colleague Oliver Holmes has the latest in Israel: Similar to France, Israel has announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Speaking on Saturday night at a news conference, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said pharmacies, supermarkets and banks should continue to operate. He added people should remain two metres apart to prevent the spread of the virus. In an unclear move that raised immediate privacy issues, Netanyahu announced the government also intended to use technology developed for counter-terrorism to track people with the virus digitally. He said the decision depended on approval from the justice ministry. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said. There have been 193 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Israel, with no deaths, according to the health ministry. Spain to be placed under 15-day nationwide lockdown \u2013 Sanchez Spain is to be placed under nationwide lockdown as part of state emergency measures to control the spread of coronavirus, prime minister Pedro Sanchez has announced. Following in the footsteps of France, Sanchez said that shops will close for 15-days. Pharmacies and those selling other basic necessities will be exempted. He added that the crisis requires \u201cextraordinary decisions\u201d and confirmed that the government has agreed a state of emergency. Armed forces will be available to help in the response effort if needed. In case you are just tuning in, here is a round-up of the biggest developments in the coronavirus outbreak as of this evening. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve missed, please drop me a message on Twitter (@aaronwala). Due to the enormous interest in coronavirus, I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I will do my best to take a look Morocco has suspended flights to and from at least 25 countries as the country\u2019s total number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 17. On Saturday Morocco\u2019s foreign ministry announced it would extend an earlier travel ban that covered China, Spain, Italy, France and Algeria. Other countries with which air travel is now suspended are Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chad, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Jordan, Lebanon, Mali, Mauritania, Netherlands, Niger, Norway, Oman, Portugal, Senegal, Switzerland, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey and the UAE. Morocco has closed all schools and cancelled gatherings of more than 50 people to stop the coronavirus spreading. One person has died and another has recovered from the virus. Dubai said on Saturday it was temporarily suspending operations at four major theme parks and tourist attractions until the end of March amid coronavirus concerns. The emirate\u2019s government media office said in a statement that Motiongate Dubai, Legoland Dubai, Legoland Waterpark Dubai and Bollywood Parks Dubai would be closed to ensure the health and safety of guests and employees. My colleague Kim Willsher has the latest from France: France has announced the closure of all places \u201cnon essential\u201d to public life including restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos from midnight Saturday. \u201cWe must absolutely limit movement, meetings and contacts,\u201d French prime minister Edouard Philippe said on Saturday evening. Food shops, tobacconists, banks and public transport will remain open, he said. Philippe said the measure was being imposed after another meeting with the country\u2019s scientific committee. The announcement came as J\u00e9rome Salomon, director of the French health authority, confirmed the WHO\u2019s assessment, that Europe is \u201cthe epicentre of the epidemic\u201d. \u201cIn France, we are confronted with the start of a national epidemic with a rapid and intense spread in numerous zones,\u201d Salomon said. The first round of the municipal elections will still go ahead on Sunday. The UK\u2019s Foreign Office has said it is working to support Britons affected by the US\u2019s extended travel ban, which comes into effect from midnight on Monday (EST). \u201cThis is a decision for the US. We are working to provide as much information and support to affected British nationals as possible,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe continue to coordinate closely with the US and other international partners on the global response to coronavirus.\u201d The Embassy of Ireland in the USA tweeted to confirm the travel from the US to Ireland will continue: Irish airline Aer Lingus said: \u201cWe\u2019re assessing the impact of new US government restrictions announced today on travel from Ireland and the UK to the United States. \u201cWe will communicate directly with affected guests as soon as possible. \u201cAll travel before 31 May can be changed to a later date and/or destination. No change fees apply. A fare difference may apply.\u201d Lithuania will shut its borders to foreigners from Monday to try stop the spread of coronavirus, the government has said in a statement. France to close most shops, cafes, restaurants and cinemas \u2013 Philippe France will shut down cafes, shops, restaurants and cinemas to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe has announced. Philippe said public transport will be kept open but asked citizens to limit their use, Reuters news agency reported. The closures will come into effect at midnight on Saturday. He told a news conference that exceptions on the shop ban would include food stores, pharmacies and gas stations. Spain\u2019s government failed to agree on Saturday on a new package of economic and social measures to mitigate the impact of the fight against the coronavirus, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters. With schools shut across Spain and a first package of economic steps announced on Thursday, the government was expected to go further on Saturday. The source said ministers disagreed in a seven hour cabinet meeting on Saturday on what the new measures should be. The source added that the government would aim to agree on them on Tuesday. Prime minister Pedro Sanchez is due to announce emergency measures including the shutting down of most shops in a news conference scheduled for 8pm local time. France has reported a total of 4,499 confirmed coronavirus cases \u2013 up from 3,661 on Friday, according to official figures. Slovenia has recorded its first coronavirus-related death, according to national broadcaster TV Slovenia. A second patient has died of the Covid-19 virus in Ireland, the country\u2019s chief medical officer Tony Holohan told journalists on Saturday. The total number of confirmed cases in the country has increased to 129 from 90. Two people in the Seychelles have tested positive for coronavirus, the country\u2019s health commissioner has confirmed. Donald Trump confirmed that he had taken the test for coronavirus at a White House briefing today \u2013 although the result was not yet available. The news came just before vice-president Mike Pence clarified the existing US travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Read the full report from my colleagues in the US here. Norway will temporarily shut all its airports from Monday in a move to curb the spread of coronavirus the country\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, said on Saturday. The government is ready to do all that is needed to secure Norway\u2019s economy, hit by business shutdowns due to the outbreak, and would seek to import medical equipment from China, Solberg told a news conference. The coronavirus death toll in Spain reached 190 on Saturday, up from 120 the day before. Kind-hearted people in the UK have been shrugging off the sense of apocalypse by offering to lend a helping hand to those in need, notifying them by dropping leaflets through their letterboxes. My colleague Simon Murphy reports: Here\u2019s the latest on the situation in Colombia and Venezula from my Bogota-based colleague Joe Parkin Daniels : Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation, a move that is likely to have lasting ramifications given the scale of Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis. About 4.5 million people have fled Venezuela which, despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela. Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the country\u2019s legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders. Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. \u201cColombia\u2019s overnight decision to \u2018close\u2019 its porous border with Venezuela won\u2019t stop the flow of people,\u201d tweeted Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBut it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\u201d Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, Colombia\u2019s president, described the closure in a statement as \u201ca measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].\u201d M\u00e1rquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents. All measures are expected to last until 30 May. In the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital earlier today. The child\u2019s mother, who was taken to a north London hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus. Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises \u201cconcerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred\u201d. He told PA Media: It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected. Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation. The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 21,157 from 17,660 over the same period. The filming in Mexico of a big budget Steven Spielberg-produced Amazon mini-series, starring Spanish actor Javier Bardem, has been suspended due to concerns about the coronavirus, according to a letter sent to cast and crew on Friday and seen by Reuters. The production entitled Mexica, which centers on the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, began filming two weeks ago on location in Mexico City. Mexico has so far confirmed 26 cases of coronavirus. Only a skeletal wrap crew will continue working through next week, and cast and crew were informed that production might resume in December depending on how the public health crisis develops. The project\u2019s budget is believed to be tens of millions of dollars, and dozens of local contractors will be affected by the suspension. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Latvia will also close its borders to all foreigners from Tuesday to stop the spread of the outbreak. Latvia has banned all public gatherings of more than 50 people, its prime minister, Arturs Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, has announced. There are more than 2,200 coronavirus cases in the US but the country has not yet \u201creached peak\u201d of the outbreak, according to top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci. US vice-president Mike Pence has confirmed the country\u2019s travel ban will be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday EST. He said: \u201cIn our taskforce meeting today the president has made a decision to suspend all travel to the UK and Ireland, effective midnight Monday night, eastern standard time.\u201d Mr Pence said there had been a \u201cunanimous recommendation\u201d from health experts to extend the travel ban. \u201cAmericans in the UK or Ireland can come home, legal residents can come home ... they will will be funnelled through specific airports and processed.\u201d Houthi rebels in control of northern Yemen have said that all passenger flights to and from the capital Sana\u2019a will be suspended for two weeks to prevent Covid-19 from reaching the country, where five years of war have already decimated healthcare infrastructure. The announcement is particularly painful for many Yemenis in poor health since medical evacuation flights have only just restarted after years of negotiations with the Saudi-led military coalition, which controls the country\u2019s airspace. Yemen, Libya and Syria - all of which have significant populations of displaced people and failing healthcare systems - are yet to announce any cases of the novel coronavirus. Warring parties have insisted that the three Middle Eastern nations remain free of the pandemic, despite fears from aid agencies that cases may be being covered up or the virus may already be present but undetected. For Yemen in particular, where over 3 million people are displaced and over a third of the population needs humanitarian aid, an outbreak of coronavirus could be catastrophic. Iran, one of the worst hit countries, has close ties to both the Houthi administration in Yemen and Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government in Syria. The Syrian regime said on Friday that schools would close and most public events are cancelled until further notice as a precautionary measure. Unconfirmed reports from doctors in Damascus suggest the Syrian capital may already be dealing with the virus. Here is the latest from Martin Pengelly, who is at the White House press conference: Donald Trump attended the press briefing and spoke first, wearing a blue \u201cUSA\u201d baseball cap and a suit and shirt but no tie. Eventually, he said he had taken a coronavirus test \u2013 a subject of contention for days after he had contact with a number of people who have since tested positive. The president opened by praising state and local measures around the coronavirus and the US taskforce, members of which were ranged behind him at the podium. He also thanked members of Congress for passing a coronavirus economic relief bill on Friday night. It still has to pass the Senate. Trump thanked Steven Mnuchin, his treasury secretary who negotiated the bill with Nancy Pelosi. He did not directly thank the House speaker. He also boasted about the effect on the stock markets of his Friday Rose Garden press conference, in which he declared a national emergency and announced measures to prepare for the pandemic, but also made a series of claims which were immediately questioned and attacked a reporter who asked about cuts to White House pandemic preparedness teams. Behind Trump stood surgeon general Jerome Adams, Dr Deborah Birx, housing secretary Ben Carson and Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verma and Dr Anthony Fauci, all for the most part expressionless. Trump tried to leave without answering questions but was kept in the room. \u201cBy the way, I had my temperature taken coming into the room \u2026 and I also took the test,\u201d he said. He did not reveal the result. Trump also explained why he continues to shake people by the hand, as he did conspicuously in the Friday press conference. \u201cMaybe people shouldn\u2019t be shaking hands for the long term,\u201d the famous germaphobe said, though he said he still did it because he had to, as president, as people expected it. Donald Trump is asked whether he is going to extend the Europe travel ban to the UK and Ireland. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it very seriously because they have had a little bit of activity unfortunately. We actually have looked at it already and that is going to be announced.\u201d Donald Trump has been asked why he has still been shaking people\u2019s hands at press conference, contrary to official guidance. He said: \u201cPeople come up to me \u2026 they put their hands out. It\u2019s sort of a natural reflex. We\u2019re all getting out of that.\u201d The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Lombardy, the Italian region that has been worst affected by the crisis, rose by 76 to 966 on Saturday, according to the region\u2019s senior health official Giulio Gallera. The number of new cases rose by 1,865 to 11,685, he told a news conference. The latest national death toll is due to be released later in the day. On Friday, the Italy-wide tally stood at 1,266. Denmark has confirmed its first coronavirus-related death, according to Reuters. Vice-president Mike Pence is about to speak at a press briefing at the White House. Reporters had their temperatures taken as they arrived and one was turned away, US media said. Ahead of the press conference, Reuters reported that the US government was set to announce an expansion of its travel ban on most European countries to include the UK and Ireland. Donald Trump originally announced the 30-day ban for travellers from 26 countries, which took effect at midnight on Friday. Hi, it\u2019s Aaron Walawalkar here taking over the coronavirus live blog in London. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak, as Reuters reports that US travel restrictions on Britain and Ireland are likely to come into effect on Monday night. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter @aaronwala. Due to the enormous interest in coronavirus, I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I will do my best to take a look. Thanks in advance! I\u2019m handing over the blog now. Thank you very much to all those who got in touch with information. Here\u2019s some of the key updates so far: Syria has shut schools and cancelled events, but still insists it has no cases. A further 10 people have died in the UK since yesterday, almost doubling the death toll from 11 to 21. Jordan is stopping all flights in and out of the country. The Spanish government is set to announce a national lockdown, which would require all citizens to stay at home unless they need food, medical supplies or emergencies. Authorities in Madrid have told residents to stay at home, as Seville cancel Holy Week celebrations. India has announced that it will treat coronavirus as a notified disaster, which will enable it to take greater measures as part of the state disaster response fund. In China, the number of new coronavirus cases brought to the mainland from overseas has exceeded the number of locally transmitted infections, for the first time. Indonesia\u2019s capital, Jakarta, will shut schools and organise remote teaching for a minimum of two weeks. Cambodia has banned entry of visitors from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the US. Austria has announced a 4bn euros ($4.4bn) aid package available to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus. Here is the most recent summary of confirmed cases and deaths from Reuters, and this article gives a slightly deeper summary with the biggest stories as of a few hours ago: As concerns are growing amongst tenants, who fear they might be unable to pay rent if they can\u2019t work due to coronavirus, renters\u2019 organisations in the UK have called for a suspension of rent payments during the outbreak. London Renters Union has sent an open letter to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urging him to join them in fighting to end rent payments and evictions, housing the homeless to protect them against the pandemic, and ensuring that homes are fit for people to self-isolate in. In Edinburgh, the city\u2019s tenants union has highlighted that landlords with buy-to-let mortgages could be allowed to stop paying their mortgage during the outbreak, but still claim money off tenants. They are concerned that renters may be forced to work during the pandemic to keep a roof over their heads. Here is the latest from Greece, from my colleague Helena Smith. Greece has announced it is halting all remaining flights to Italy following a mini-cabinet meeting chaired by prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. It was also decided to further bolster Greece\u2019s health system by hiring hundreds more doctors and nurses to cope with demands posed by coronavirus. Hospitals nationwide were at the sharp end of budget cuts ordered by international creditors in return for rescue loans during the country\u2019s long-running debt crisis. Greek authorities have confirmed 190 Covid-19 cases so far but the number is likely to rise when new figures are released later today. The death toll rose to three this morning. The government spokesman, Stelios Petsas, announced he was going into self-imposed isolation and would be working from home after his wife was diagnosed with the virus. Almost all of downtown Athens now resembles a ghost town. Streets in the ancient Plaka district beneath the Acropolis were eerily empty with cafes and tavernas boarded up and closed. Archaeological sites were also shut until 30 March. The Olympic flame, which was lit in ancient Olympia on Thursday for the Tokyo 2020 games \u2013 and in more normal times would now be on a cross-country relay \u2013 arrived at Athens\u2019 Kallimarmaro stadium this afternoon, five days ahead of schedule after the race was cancelled because of public health fears. It will remain in the stadium until it is handed over to the Organising Committee Tokyo 2020 on 19 March. Like other archaeological sites, the stadium is closed. Egypt is set to close all schools and universities for two weeks, Reuters are reporting. Hundreds of members of the scientific community have sent two open letters to the British government, voicing their concerns about the response to the coronavirus outbreak. One comes from 198 academics in the field of maths and science, calling for urgent measures of social distancing across the UK. It says: \u201cGoing for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 at this point does not seem a viable option, as this will put NHS at an even stronger level of stress, risking many more lives than necessary.\u201d Another letter has been signed by 164 behavioural scientists. It raises concerns about the idea of \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d \u2013 the idea that if the public are instructed to take preventative measures too early, they\u2019ll eventually revert back to prior behaviour. The letter suggests that this has been a cornerstone of British government policy on coronavirus and sheds doubt on the evidence behind this. \u201cWhile we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about \u2018behavioural fatigue\u2019 or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,\u201d it says. \u201cIf \u2018behavioural fatigue\u2019 truly represents a key factor in the government\u2019s decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision. If one is lacking, we urge the government to reconsider these decisions,\u201d it ends. Here\u2019s another video from Italy, where neighbours are playing music together from their apartment, whilst they are in quarantine. Syria has shut schools, cancelled most public events, and reduced public sector hours to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Health Ministry said the steps were \u201cpreventative\u201d and \u201cprecautionary\u201d and intended to raise the health sector\u2019s readiness to control the virus should it emerge, and says there have been no cases in the country. There\u2019s a very sweet video on Twitter showing a young boy in Milan, Italy, shouting from the balcony of his home to the Red Cross, who are are bringing food to doctors. It translates roughly as \u201cthanks and good job\u201d. Northern Ireland schools will be closed for \u201cat least 16 weeks\u201d but they will they will not be shutting immediately, the region\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, has said after a summit with the Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. The disclosure gives a glimpse of the scale of coronavirus crisis to come and will lead to questions as to whether a four-month schools closure is being planned for the rest of the UK. Foster confirmed that schools in Northern Ireland will close at some point in an effort to stem the spread of the virus but it was a matter of timing. We\u2019ll have a full report soon. The Middle Eastern kingdom Jordan says it will suspend all passenger flights in and out of the country from Tuesday, according to a government statement just issued. Schools and universities will be closed and so will tourist sites including Petra as part of a number of proposals to limit public gatherings in the country. The measures may seem onerous, given Jordan has a single confirmed case of the virus - a citizen who returned from Italy and was identified as being infected on 2 March. But earlier today the Canadian government announced that one of its citizens who recently returned from Jordan had tested positive, raising the possibility there are undetected cases here. The tour guide who showed the woman around has been quarantined but there\u2019s no idea yet how the Canadian contracted the disease. Jordan will would stop all incoming and outgoing passenger flights into the country from Tuesday, the prime minister, Omar Razzaz, has confirmed. He also said that universities and schools would be closed for two weeks, with all tourist sites, sports and cinemas also set to close. Jordan had one confirmed Covid-19 case, but this was successfully treated and the patient left hospital on Friday. It had already closed its borders with Egypt, Iraq, Syria and the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa has risen to 38, up from 24 a day earlier, the ministry of health has said. As of 9am on Saturday, there were 1,140 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, and 21 deaths, Public Health England has confirmed. This is an increase of 342, and ten further deaths, since yesterday. 37,746 people have been tested, of which 36,606 were confirmed negative. Ten more patients who tested positive for the coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll in the UK to 21, NHS England has said. The first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, has said that when schools in Northern Ireland are closed, they will remain shut for a minimum of 16 weeks. The Welsh Rugby Union has suspended all events until the 30 March. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll is at the press conference with Irish politicians following their meeting on coronavirus. She is live tweeting the event, and you can follow her @lisaocarroll for breaking updates from there. All parties have said they accept that schools will close, it is now a matter of when. The health minister has said that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are going to launch joint \u2018awareness campaigns\u2019, and added that individuals must take personal responsibility to stop the spread of the virus. The number of coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has risen by 155 to 959, with two further deaths. Dubai has cancelled all events planned in March and has banned hotels from hosting weddings, Reuters is reporting. The Spanish government have drafted a decree to put the country into lockdown, according to reports in the Spanish media. The reports say that Spaniards will be told to stay home except to buy food or medical supplies, go to hospital, work or in the case of other emergencies. I\u2019ll update you when we get official confirmation on this. Germany is urging people returning from Italy, Switzerland and Austria to self-isolate for up to two weeks, in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus. \u201cEspecially travellers and skiers returning from Switzerland, Italy and Austria should stay at home as far as possible for up to two weeks, even without symptoms,\u201d the health minister, Jens Spahn tweeted. As of Friday, there were 3,062 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Germany, with five deaths, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said. This photograph of a Tesco store, in Colney Hatch, London has been circulating on Twitter. Michelle Davies, who took the photograph, described the scene as looking \u201clike there\u2019s been a riot\u201d. \u201cThe selfishness of some people filling their trolleys with multiple packs and leaving none for others is staggering,\u201d she said. However, others have suggested that many of the products on the floor could be waiting to be restocked. Thanks to all those sending information. Just a reminder that if I miss anything, you can drop me a message on Twitter @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to all of the messages, but will endeavour to read them! Authorities in Madrid have told residents to stay at home, as Seville cancel the Holy Week celebrations. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s government have come under fire for getting off to a slow start with coronavirus. They only began to introduce serious measures this week as numbers of coronavirus rates soared. The opposition has criticised the government for letting events like International Women\u2019s Day marches go ahead a week ago. As well as urging people to stay at home, Madrid city council has just announced that all parks in the capital will be closed from 4pm local time today. \u201cGiven the crowds of people who are unfortunately ignoring all the warnings and congregating in Madrid\u2019s public spaces, the mayor has given the order to close all of the city\u2019s parks and gardens from 4pm,\u201d it said in a tweet. There are now 5,753 cases and 136 deaths in Spain. 2,940 of the cases are in the Madrid region India has recorded its second coronavirus death \u2013 a 68-year-old woman in Delhi who caught the virus from her son who had travelled to Italy and Switzerland. The son developed symptoms a fortnight after returning to India. Officials are trying to trace the 1,500 people he may have been in contact with at the large plant where he worked. Her family complained that the cemetery they took her to refused to cremate her. Crematoriums in India tended to be crowded and the staff felt at risk. It was only when doctors arrived to prescribe the right protocol that her last rites were performed. The number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 84. With no hand sanitisers available, the New Delhi government has designated them \u2018essential commodities\u2019 so that anyone hoarding them or selling them at inflated prices can be punished by law. As stories trickle in of some people concealing their travel history to affected areas or refusing to be tested and, if necessary, isolated, the Delhi government has also invoked the Epidemic Act. This allows district magistrates to take coercive action to isolate high-risk people. The wife of a Google employee in Bengaluru, for example, fled her home and vanished last week. Officials found that she had flown to Delhi \u2013 at the other end of the country - and travelled by train to Agra to her parents\u2019 home. Across many states, social life is being curbed with weddings, engagement ceremonies and birthday parties banned in the south Indian state of Karnataka. The message to Indians is to stay at home and avoid large gatherings. Several states have closed swimming pools, gyms, cinemas, night clubs, and theatres. A petition calling for the UK to go into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus has reached more than 110,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for parliamentary debate. It encourages the UK to follow the containment procedures of countries that have been widely affected by the outbreak, by restricting unnecessary travel and discouraging public gatherings. \u201cIt is time the government should prioritise the health of the public and should consider how vital it is to implement effective containment now,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIt is better to spend money to contain the virus and treating the relatively low numbers who are ill now rather than wait for more casualties.\u201d The government responds to all petitions with more than 10,000 signatures, and considers any petition with more than 100,000 signatures for parliamentary debate. This video explores how Islam has been impacted by coronavirus. It follows Kuwait changing the call to prayer to tell people to pray in their homes, rather than at a mosque. More from Sam Jones, our correspondent in Madrid: Seville has announced that it will be cancelling the city\u2019s world famous Holy Week processions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Andaluc\u00edan capital\u2019s mayor, Juan Espadas Cejas, said it was the hardest decision he had taken in his five years in office, but added: \u201cThe declaration of the state of emergency, together with the need to safeguard public health and to allow enough time for a return to normality in the city, justify this move.\u201d Espadas said he was confident that the people of Seville would understand why the decision had been taken. The cancellation of the spectacular but sombre parades, which draw huge crowds of foreign visitors, comes as tourist bookings plummet. Last year, nearly 84 million people visited Spain, 18 million from the UK. Tourism is the nation\u2019s third biggest industry, accounting for 11% of GDP. Even before the severe restrictions, including schools closures and bans on large public events, announced in the Madrid area, bookings were down. According to the Spanish hoteliers\u2019 confederation, reservations were already down 20-30%, in particular for holidays in Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic and Canary Islands, in February compared with last year. Hotel bookings were down 24% in Madrid and 20% in Barcelona. The government in India has announced that it will treat coronavirus as a notified disaster, which will enable it to take greater measures as part of the state disaster response fund. The Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy is set to call for an aid package like that delivered after the second world war. Speaking at the National Union of Mineworkers in Barnsley today, Nandy will call for greater transparency about the expert advice received by the government, more social care funding to protect older people, and a Covid-19 workers\u2019 taskforce to ensure that workers with insecure and low paid jobs don\u2019t arrive at work unwell. She will also call for a consultation with council and community leaders, along with support for charities that tackle loneliness, to address the risks of self isolation. \u201cWe need the equivalent of a Marshall Plan to protect our older people. After a decade of underfunding, a virus that could affect up to 80% of the population will not be dealt with by our NHS alone,\u201d she will say. In China, the number of new coronavirus cases brought to the mainland from overseas has exceeded the number of locally transmitted infections, for the first time. This occurred on Friday, data from the National Health Commission showed. Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those, all in Hubei province, were locally transmitted. The other seven \u2013 four in Shanghai, one Beijing and two in Gansu \u2013 came from travellers coming into China from Italy, the United States and Saudi Arabia. This indicates a slowing of the virus in China, which has been at the centre of the outbreak. Japan has said it will take \u201cbold, unprecedented\u201d steps to protect the economy, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said. Abe urged international cooperation to combat the impact of coronavirus on the global economy. Abe also said Japan would consider various options, including a proposal by ruling party lawmakers to temporarily cut the country\u2019s sales tax rate, to support an economy suffering \u201cquite a big blow\u201d from the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe near-term focus is on containing the virus. After that, we need to put Japan\u2019s economy back on a solid footing. We will take bold, unprecedented steps to achieve this,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cThe impact of the coronavirus [on the global economy] has been enormous and markets are suffering disruptions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government will closely coordinate with other countries as well as with the Bank of Japan. If necessary, we\u2019ll respond appropriately in line with agreements made by the G7 and G20.\u201d There have been another 22 positive cases in Wales overnight, bringing the total number of people infected with coronavirus to 60. Indonesia\u2019s capital, Jakarta, will shut schools and organise remote teaching for a minimum of two weeks in an attempt to halt the spread of coronavirus. The announcement was made today by Jakarta\u2019s governor, following reports of 27 more cases, bringing the total to 96. The number of deaths increased to five. While most case are in Jakarta, cases were also reported in cities in western and central Java, Manado on Sulawesi island and Pontianak on Borneo island. \u201cWe must massively, in an integrated way and without panic, search and find, and isolate positive cases,\u201d Yurianto said. He added that \u201ca community-based approach\u201d was set to be adopted to prevent healthy people from getting sick. Leo Varadkar and Arlene Foster are to meet on Saturday to discuss an all-of-Ireland approach to combatting coronavirus. With mass gatherings including sporting events and concerts to be banned across the UK from next weekend, pressure was growing on Northern Irish leaders to close schools in line with the move south of the border. The caretaker taoiseach and first minister will meet in Armagh as part of a wider delegation involving Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, who has been acting on Irish as well as EU modelling. You can read the full story here: In Brunei, 38 of the total 40 coronavirus cases in the country had been linked to the religious gathering, as of Saturday. A total of 85 Bruneians were present at the the gathering, 18 of whom went on to test positive. The remainder of the 38 are their immediate family members, friends or co-workers, the health ministry said. New cases in Brunei include a nine-month-old baby, the child of a man who attended the religious event. The speaker of Brunei\u2019s legislative council called for the current session to end on Saturday, a week ahead of schedule, because of coronavirus concerns. Malaysia has confirmed 41 new coronavirus today. Most of the cases are connected to a religious event which occurred on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and was attended by around 10,000 people. This brings the total number of cases in Malaysia to 238, 81 of which were linked to the same event held at a mosque between February 27 and March 1. The prime minister, Muyiddin Yassin, said on Friday that the country was facing a \u201csecond wave\u201d of infections, and warned of an impact on economic growth. To contain the spread of the virus, all gatherings including international meetings, sports, social and religious events would be cancelled or postponed until after April, he said. Reuters initially reported this as \u2018all\u2019 cases, but they\u2019ve corrected this to \u2018most\u2019. Sorry for any confusion! Namibia has announced that it is suspending travel to and from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany for 30 days, with immediate effect. It comes after the country confirmed its first cases of coronavirus. Here is an update from Brazil, from my colleague Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent: Rio de Janeiro is starting to go into shutdown mode because of the coronavirus crisis, which looks set to worsen in Brazil in the coming days. On Friday night Rio\u2019s governor, Wilson Witzel, announced that theatres, cinemas, sports stadiums and nightclubs would be shuttered here for a fortnight while beaches could also be sealed off to prevent large numbers of people coming together. \u201cThis is a moment to stay at home so we can control this epidemic,\u201d Witzel told reporters. A hospital in western Rio is reportedly being prepared to deal with the anticipated spike in coronavirus cases here. \u201cOne thing is for sure: depending on the speed with which the epidemic spreads, the stress on our health system could be brutal,\u201d a prominent Brazilian doctor, Drauzio Varella, wrote in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper on Friday. Reuters news agency have compiled this very comprehensive (albeit very long) list of the current number of coronavirus cases across the world.

You can read more from my colleague Simon Murphy here: Cambodia has banned entry of visitors from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the US. The ban will last for 30 days, beginning on 17 March, the ministry of health has announced. The ban came after Cambodia confirmed two new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number in the country to seven. The patient were both foreign nationals, a 49-year-old Canadian teacher and a 33-year-old Belgian man on Friday. The Canadian national\u2019s two children tested negative for the virus though his school has been closed, the ministry and the school said. Schools in the capital Phnom Penh and Siem Reap province, where coronavirus cases had been detected, were ordered closed on Saturday, the ministry of health said. However, the country hasn\u2019t banned travellers from China, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe kingdom of Cambodia has subsequently detected the Covid-19 virus on different foreign nationals, which requires immediate measures to prevent the spread and importation of the Covid-19 virus into Cambodia,\u201d the minister of health, Mam Bunheng, said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, the ministry of health takes measures to ban foreigners from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the United States from entering the country for 30 days, effective 17 March 2020,\u201d he added. Sam Jones, our correspondent in Madrid, has the latest on the situation in Spain: The Spanish government is meeting this morning to decide what urgent measures to take under the state of emergency that was announced yesterday and will be declared later today. The emergency powers, set out in article 116 of the constitution, allow the government to limit the movement of people and vehicles in specified places, to temporarily requisition goods, to take over factories and businesses, to ration the consumption of basic items, and to issue the necessary orders to ensure the provision of services. The article has not been used since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers\u2019 strike. The state of emergency will initially apply for two weeks, but can be extended with parliamentary approval. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is due to speak at 2pm local time once the cabinet meeting is over. Meanwhile, all non-essential shops in the Madrid and Galicia regions have shut on the orders of the regional governments. All non-food shops, caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and non-food shops have been ordered shut for a fortnight in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus. The only businesses permitted to remain open are supermarkets, bakeries, butcher\u2019s shops, fishmongers, greengrocers, petrol stations, pharmacies, tobacconists and newspaper kiosks. On Friday night, the Catalan president, Quim Torra announced plans to close off the north-eastern Spanish region and called on the central government to assist by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways. \u201cThe evolution of the contagion calls for most drastic action,\u201d Torra said on Friday night. \u201cWe need to restrict entry and exit to protect ourselves.\u201d While Catalonia is one of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions, major transport routes and hubs come under the mandate of the central government. Spain, the European country most affected by the virus after Italy, has reported more than 5,200 cases and 132 deaths. For those just joining us, you can see an overview of the recent updates here: Austria has announced a 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) aid package available to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said on Saturday. Kogler said the money would provide \u201cfresh blood\u201d for the economy, and would include bridge loans and credit guarantees for businesses. The death toll from coronavirus in Iran has risen to 611, with 12,729 confirmed cases, state TV said. On Friday, Iran, the death toll stood at 514, with 11,364 confirmed infections. Here is an update from my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent on the situation in the Philippines: The number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines has jumped by 34 to 98, it was confirmed on Saturday, as the national capital region prepared for major travel restrictions to be imposed tomorrow. The country also recorded two more fatalities, bringing the death toll to eight. The Philippines has witnessed a wave of cases over the past week, and there are fears the disease could spread quickly through overcrowded slum areas in the capital, Manila. Officials announced on Saturday that a night curfew would be introduced in Manila, and said that people should only leave their homes during the daytime for work or urgent errands. \u201cIf you\u2019ll go to work, go. If you need to go out for medical treatment, go. If you\u2019ll buy food, go, but other than that, stay home,\u201d the interior secretary, Eduardo A\u00f1o, told a news conference. He said the public should \u201cpractice social distancing\u201d, though doing so will be a struggle for the poorest residents who live in cramped housing with poor sanitation. Metro Manila, which includes 16 cities, has an official population of 12 million but the real figure, including informal settlers, is believed to be much higher. The curfew is in addition to wider measures due to be introduced on Sunday, including a ban on domestic land, sea and air travel to and from Metro Manila. Mass gatherings will be stopped and schools closed. Foreigners traveling from countries where there is local transmission of the disease \u2013 at least 65 nations, including the UK \u2013 will also be banned from entering the country. Kuwait authorities have temporarily closed mosques and changed the Muslim call to prayer, which normally tells people to come to mosque, to instruct them to pray at home. The announcement came on Friday, when the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs said that the five daily prayers usually held at mosques had been cancelled. Below is footage showing the new call to prayer ringing out in Kuwait. Low budget airline Jet2 have cancelled all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. In a statement posted on Twitter, the low budget airline said: \u201cIn response to local measures introduced throughout Spain to prevent the spread of Covid-19, including the closure of bars, restaurants, shops and activities including any watersport, we have taken the decision to cancel all flights to Mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. \u201cWe know these local measures will have a significant impact on our customers\u2019 holidays, which is why we have taken this decision,\u201d it said. The airline said it was contacting customers who were currently in those destinations, and who were set to travel to them, to advise them of their options. It urged customers not to call, and said it was \u201creviewing\u201d its programme \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. \u201cThe health and safety of our customers is our number one priority,\u201d it added. Two more people have died in Greece from coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to three. The deceased were two men, aged 67 and 90. They both had serious underlying health problems, the health ministry said. There were 190 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Greece by Friday evening. Italians quarantined in their own home have been singing from their balcony to support one another during the country\u2019s lockdown. You can read the full story here: Abu Dhabi has announced the temporary closure of large tourist sites including the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum. The Ferrari World theme park will also be shut under the new measures, which will be in place from 15 to 31 March. The announcements were made in tweets from the Abu Dhabi government media office. The Philippines capital, Manila, has announced night curfews, and urged shopping malls to close for a month. The health department made the announcement today, as three new fatalities were confirmed, bringing the death toll in the country to eight. It came as the Philippines experienced its biggest single day increase, with 34 new cases bringing the total number to 98. The president, Rodrigo Duterte, has raised the country\u2019s health emergency status to the highest level and issued quarantine measures in Manila, along with land and air travel restrictions in and out of the capital. These will take effect from 15 March. School closures were extended school until 12 April. The nighttime curfew will begin on 15 March 15 and continue until 14 April, but some employees will be exempt, Garcia said. People who violated the curfew would be turned back, he said, but would not be reprimanded or arrested. \u201cTo limit the spread of the virus, we need to limit the movement of people. We are slowing down the movement of people in Metro Manila,\u201d Jose Arturo Garcia, general manager of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, told a news conference. The health ministry has announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Rwanda. The patient is an Indian citizen who arrived in Rwanda from Mumbai on 8 March, the health ministry said on Saturday. \u201cHe is currently under treatment in stable condition, isolated from other patients,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThe tracing of all contacts has been conducted for further management.\u201d RwandAir, Rwanda\u2019s national airline, announced it was suspending all flights to India until 30 April and would refund customers. Rwanda\u2019s case means that 19 African countries have now got coronavirus cases. Other African nations to have reported cases of the virus include Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. British GP Sarah Jarvis has said she is doubtful about the UK government\u2019s response to coronavirus. Herd immunity works on the idea that if enough of the population become infected with a disease, they will become immune, and unable to transmit further. \u201cWe\u2019ve traditionally said we need about 90% herd immunity for it to work,\u201d she said, speaking on Sky News. The government have put the estimated figure for coronavirus at 60% of the population. \u201cThe issue we\u2019ve got is this is a new virus and we don\u2019t know if people will retain immunity,\u201d she said. Whilst it is thought not to be possible to get infected twice, it is unclear how long immunity lasts. The herd immunity approach is unlike that used in other parts of Europe, and has been thrown into doubt by the WHO. What does coronavirus mean for pregnant women? Jarvis said there was no evidence that the virus could be transmitted from parent to baby while the mother was pregnant, but could be transmitted once the baby was born. She urged women who have been infected with coronavirus and are going in to labour to let hospitals know before they arrive. Jarvis said that there had been some reports in China of pregnant women with coronavirus giving birth prematurely. However, she said that it was unclear whether this was due to labour being induced early because the mother was sick, or because of the virus directly. Zara owner Inditex will temporarily close all of its stores in Spain from Saturday, Europa Press said. Spain has the largest network of Zara stores, and makes about a sixth of group sales. Spain is the fashion retailer\u2019s largest network of stores by far, accounting for about a sixth of group sales. It also owns Massimo Dutti and Pull &amp; Bear. On Friday, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, declared a state of emergency but did not specify what emergency powers he would use, or what support businesses who are forced to close would receive. Some regions, such as Madrid and Catalonia, have decided to close bars, restaurants and shops apart from those selling essential items such as food, but this is not a nationwide policy. Spain has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe after Italy, with 4,231 cases and 120 deaths. The Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, Helena Smith, has this update: Greece has confirmed two more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the death toll to three in a country where the number of cases rose to 190 \u2013 a jump of 73 and the biggest rise yet on Friday. A 92-year-old from Ptolemaida, close to Kastoria in western Macedonia, died this morning after being diagnosed with the virus three days ago. At the heart of the fur trade in Greece, Kastoria has been hard hit by coronavirus with a growing number of confirmed cases in the town among people connected to the industry. According to state-run TV many locals has recently visited Milan for the fashion show. Health authorities reported that a third man, aged 67, who had been on life support in a specialised hospital unit on the Ionian island of Zakynthos, also died today. Greece, which has closed all of its archaeological sites and museums, introduced its most draconian measures yet to curb the spread of the disease, announcing late Friday that every bar, restaurant, cafe and eatery will have to close for at least two weeks. Malls, shopping centres, hairdressers, betting shops and brothels are among others that have also been ordered shut. Super markets, pharmacies, take-aways and hotels have been permitted to stay open. Norway has advised its citizens not to travel abroad during the next month, and urged Norwegians currently abroad to consider returning home. \u201cCountries can quickly introduce travel restrictions, quarantine at arrival from countries with coronavirus, and borders can close, flights could be cancelled or other measures initiated,\u201d the foreign minister, Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide, said on Saturday. Oslo\u2019s main airport stopped admitting foreign travellers on Friday, a local municipality said. A day prior, the government invoked emergency powers to shut a range of private and public institutions, including schools and restaurants, and asked the majority of citizens to work from home where possible. The country has also announced emergency economic measures, including the central bank making an emergency rate cut on Friday and pumping more money into banks. The government has announced a package of fiscal and regulatory measures to support the economy. The Philippines has confirmed 34 new cases, bringing its total to 98.

The Czech government has announced it will shut most shops and restaurants for 10 days, and ban foreigners from entering the country. From Monday, foreign travel will be banned and foreigners will be barred from arriving in the country. Food stores, pharmacies, banks, post offices, gas stations and takeaway food establishments will be exempt from the closures. The measures come after other restrictions including closing schools and banning public events such as sports games or concerts, were announced in recent days. \u201cWe wanted to avoid people going to shopping centres today,\u201d the prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161, told a news conference on Saturday, broadcast on television. The interior minister, Jan Ham\u00e1\u010dek, said the government\u2019s aim was to spread out the rise of infections over time to reduce the strain on the health system. \u201cWe need people to go to work but stay home afterwards,\u201d Ham\u00e1\u010dek said. \u201cThose (countries) who have managed to do something about the situation say ... limit interaction among people.\u201d The Czech Republic had 150 cases as of Saturday morning, with no deaths. It had tested 3,094 people as of Friday evening, with 741 tests taken on Friday, according to the health ministry. The government has been criticised for taking a heavy-handed approach, and not testing widely enough. Health workers have reported shortages of protective gear such as face masks and respirators at hospitals, senior care centres and pharmacies. The government has said it aimed to ramp up testing by involving more laboratories and ordering 100,000 rapid-result test kits for delivery next week. Babi\u0161 said 51,000 respirators were distributed to health facilities on Friday. Morocco has suspended flights to and from Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal to try and halt the spread of coronavirus, the foreign ministry announced on Saturday. It has also suspended all flights with China, Spain, Italy, France and Algeria. The total number of coronavirus cases in Morocco has risen to 8, including one death and one recovery. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, has been working from home and avoiding the White House after coming into contact with an Australian politician who later tested positive for coronavirus. The Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who has been infected with the virus, was in Washington DC last week and met with Trump\u2019s daughter and the US attorney general, William Barr. The White House and justice department have been quick to downplay the situation, saying Ivanka\u2019s decision came out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d. \u201cExposures from the case were assessed and the White House medical unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine,\u201d the White House deputy press secretary, Judd Deere, said in a statement. \u201cShe worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given,\u201d Deere added. Barr\u2019s spokesman also said the attorney general was not showing coronavirus symptoms. \u201cHe is staying home today and has consulted with CDC,\u201d Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \u201cCDC is not recommending he be tested at this point.\u201d It is possible that the president himself has been exposed to the virus. A Brazilian official tested positive just days after posing for a photo with the Mr Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. rump said he was not showing symptoms, though conceded he will \u201cmost likely\u201d get a test. Dutton woke up on Friday morning with a temperature and sore throat. He admitted himself for a test which came back positive and he has remained in hospital in Queensland. \u201cI feel fine and will provide an update in due course,\u201d Dutton said in a statement. World Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris has questioned the UK\u2019s approach to developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d against Covid-19. Dr Harris told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today: \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about the science of this virus, it hasn\u2019t been in our population for long enough for us to know what it does in immunological terms. \u201cEvery virus functions differently in your body and stimulates a different immunological profile. We can talk theories, but at the moment we are really facing a situation where we have got to look at action.\u201d You can read more about herd immunity, and its use with coronavirus, here: Europe now the epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, WHO says \u201cEurope has now become the epicenter [sic] of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China,\u201d World Health Organization (WHO) director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has tweeted. \u201cOur message to countries continues to be: you must take a comprehensive approach to fight. Not testing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe are at a critical point in the #COVID19 response \u2013 we need everyone to get involved in this massive effort to keep the world safe.\u201d He also mentioned the Covid-19 solidarity response fund, which was announced yesterday, and praised those who worked to create it. The fund \u201cwill raise money from a wide range of donors to support the work of the WHO and partners to help countries respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d \u201cThe fund, the first-of-its-kind, enables private individuals, corporations and institutions anywhere in the world to come together to directly contribute to global response efforts, and has been created by the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, together with WHO.\u201d Hello, this is Molly Blackall taking over the blog in London. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak, as the global death toll reaches 5,429, with 145,369 confirmed cases. As of today, 71,694 people have recovered, according to figures from the Johns Hopkins University. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter @mollyblackall. Due to the enormous interest in coronavirus, I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I will do my best to take a look. Thanks in advance! Multinational tech company Apple has just announced it will close all stores. In a statement the company said: In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. That means team members should work remotely if their job allows, and those whose work requires them to be on site should follow guidance to maximize interpersonal space. Extensive, deep cleaning will continue at all sites. In all our offices, we are rolling out new health screenings and temperature checks. The global spread of COVID-19 is affecting every one of us. We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27. Our online stores are open ... All of our hourly workers will continue to receive pay in alignment with business as usual operations. We have expanded our leave policies to accommodate personal or family health circumstances created by Covid-19. Here\u2019s a summary of the main points of the liveblog coverage so far. Australia has launched a public education campaign including information on hygiene as 200 cases have been reported around the country. It comes as the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy wrote to doctors to implore them to use testing kits and protective gear responsibly. \u201cUnfortunately, the extreme pressure on our personal protective equipment stocks continues, and the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country,\u201d Murphy wrote. After declaring coronavirus a national emergency US president Donald Trump said he would free up $50bn in federal resources for the states to tackle the virus. The US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package that will provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices. The US travel ban for 26 European countries has come into force, banning travel from the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the United States. The travel restrictions are set to last for 30 days but do not apply to the UK or Ireland. Saudi Arabia has banned all flights into the kingdom for two weeks, starting Sunday, state news agency SPA reported. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said all people arriving in the country, including returning citizens, will be required to isolate themselves for a fortnight. Only people arriving from the Pacific, were there are virtually no cases, are exempt from the rule. Ardern also cancelled Sunday\u2019s memorial commemorating the first anniversary Christchurch mosque shootings. Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Paraguay and Peru have all suspended European flights. Argentina also announced it would suspends links with the most badly affected countries and Guatemala said it will ban arrivals from the United States and Canada. Cambodia announced it would refuse entry to citizens from Italy, Germany, Spain, France, and the United States, according to local media. Vietnam will also stop issuing tourist visas to citizens from Europe\u2019s Schengen area and Britain, starting from Sunday. In South Korea, for a second day in a row the daily number of recovered people on Saturday (204) exceeded that of new confirmed cases (107). Meanwhile in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, officials reported just five new cases on Friday, the second day in a row the tally has been less than 10. The global death toll reached 5,429, with 145,369 cases confirmed. So far 71,694 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The institution draws from official figures, and so it possible that actual figures are higher. Jakarta\u2019s governor Anies Baswedan has told a broadcasted news conference that Indonesia\u2019s capital city will close all schools and has ordered remote teaching for at least two weeks starting next week to curb the spread of the virus. Baswedan said out of 69 confirmed coronavirus cases nationwide, an unspecified number of people were detected in many places across Jakarta, a city of 10 million people. The number of people under surveillance in the city had jumped to 586 people as of 12 March, compared to 129 at the beginning of the month. The number of patients suspected of having Covid-19 had surged to 261 from 39 in the same period. The chief justice of Victoria\u2019s supreme court, Anne Ferguson, said the state\u2019s supreme and county courts have decided to suspend all new jury trials from Monday 16 March until further notice. She said: This means that the jury empanelment process, in which hundreds of potential jurors gather at Court, will not take place until further notice. This precautionary decision was made after consideration of the latest expert health and government advice and recognises that members of the community may hold concerns about attending court in large groups. This suspension does not apply to trials in which the jury has already been empanelled, which will continue as usual. The courts acknowledge this is an unprecedented decision and we are confident it is in the best interests of the Victorian community. As we mentioned a bit earlier, the Australian government has launched a community education campaign around Covid-19 following criticism from the public and the shadow minister Chris Bowen that people have been receiving mixed-messages about what to do. Here is the video launched as part of the public education blitz, which focusses on hygiene. We\u2019ve seen and heard the wonderful sound of Italians making music in their towns as an antidote to the misery of coronavirus. And here is Yo-Yo Ma with his little contribution. Supermarket giants have put limits on purchases of food staples to prevent panic buying sparked by the coronavirus, AAP reports. Coles and Woolworths have introduced a limit on some goods to ensure there is enough for everyone, especially the elderly, by preventing people stockpiling.

But Guardian Australia\u2019s podcast editor Miles Martignoni reports that now fruit and vegetables appear to be out-of-stock as well, at least in Sydney\u2019s inner-west. Thirteen new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Victoria, the state\u2019s health department said in a statement just issued, bringing the total number of cases in Victoria to 49 and the Australian total to at least 200. The new cases include 11 men and two women aged between 20 and 69. All cases are recovering at home in isolation, except for one person who was admitted to hospital and is stable. All new confirmed cases were acquired overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19. Thailand has reported seven new coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 82, health officials said. The Australian government will release a national publicity blitz aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 from tomorrow (Sunday). It comes after criticism of the government\u2019s response to the crisis and an acknowledgement by the chief medical officer that the country\u2019s supply of crucial medical equipment including personal protective gear and pathology test kits was \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d. From Sunday, the government will release two separate television advertisements which encourage stringent personal hygiene and warn people who have recently been overseas or in contact with someone who has the virus to \u201cseek medical advice\u201d and self-isolate if they develop symptoms. The campaign, which will also include outdoor advertising on buses, at train stations and in shopping centres, includes the slogan \u201ctogether we can help stop the spread and stay healthy\u201d. It also advises people to only be tested for the virus \u201cif you are experiencing flu or cold-like symptoms, and have recently returned overseas or have been indirect contact with someone who is known to have contracted coronavirus\u201d. Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of the coronavirus Friday, deepening anxiety in a crisis-stricken nation where many hospitals struggle to treat even basic ailments. The announcement prompted president Ivan Duque of neighbouring Colombia to order his nation\u2019s border with Venezuela closed. It will also stop visitors who have been in Europe or Asia from entering the country. Colombia reported its first case of coronavirus on 6 March, which has risen to 16 cases. Meanwhile Bolivia, Venezuela, Paraguay and Peru have suspended European flights. Argentina also announced it will suspends links with the most badly affected countries. Guatemala will from Monday widen travel restrictions, banning arrivals from the United States and Canada, president Alejandro Giammattei said. Panama\u2019s health minister Rosario Turner on Friday said the number of confirmed cases has risen to 36, and includes three foreigners. Brazil\u2019s two biggest cities \u2013 Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo \u2013 contain most of the country\u2019s 107 coronavirus cases registered so far. No deaths have been reported, but government officials say they expect the number of people affected to soar in the next couple of weeks. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has tested negative. And in Mexico \u2013 Latin America\u2019s number two economy \u2013 economic turmoil sparked by the outbreak threatens to deepen a recession that started last year. The number of cases remains low. I\u2019ve just been getting some reaction from the Australian medical bodies to the letter sent by the chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy to doctors warning them of extreme pressure on personal protective equipment stock, and shortages of testing kits. Murphy wrote that \u201cPathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing\u201d. The head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone told Guardian Australia that people needed to take some personal responsibility and to stop pushing doctors for Covid-19 testing unless they met the criteria or were severely unwell. He said: It\u2019s clear that there is a significant amount of people who are being tested at the moment for no other reason than just fear, anxiety or personal interest. The criteria that have been clearly outlined in the letter are in the interest of ensuring adequate supply at this crucial time while we\u2019re facing a significant pressure on reagents and kits. We are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases. We can\u2019t just be testing to relieve anxiety. We can\u2019t just be relieving anxiety in a population with no contact with a confirmed case.\u201d Bartone said the rush to hospitals and doctor clinics for testing was an extension of panic buying being seen in supermarkets. He urged people to think of vulnerable people including the elderly before asking for tests. The US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package that will provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices, Reuters reports. By a bipartisan vote of 363 to 40, the Democratic-controlled House passed a multi-billion dollar effort that would expand safety-net programs to help those who could be thrown out of work in the weeks to come. Donald Trump said he supported the package, raising the likelihood that it will pass the Republican-controlled Senate next week. The 110-page bill is the product of extensive negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin has pressed for tax cuts, while Pelosi had pushed to expand safety-net spending. It does not include the $1 trillion payroll tax cut that Trump had called for. Earlier in the day, Trump had accused Democrats of \u201cnot doing what\u2019s right for the country\u201d. Amongst other measures, the bill will provide two weeks of paid sick and family leave for those affected by the virus. Businesses will get a tax credit to help cover the expense. More on Australia\u2019s chief medical officer\u2019s letter to doctors... Brendan Murphy said he was seeking doctors\u2019 help in \u201cstrictly applying the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) National Guidelines in deciding whether to refer a patient for a COVID-19 pathology test\u201d. He said the current guidelines only recommend testing \u201cwhere a patient meets both the current epidemiological and clinical criteria for testing\u201d. The epidemiological criteria include international travel in the 14 days before illness onset OR close or casual contact in the 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of Covid-19. Murphy said the last point needs to be interpreted \u201csensibly\u201d, adding: \u201cWe do not have sufficient testing kits to test everyone who attends the same large concert as a person with Covid-19.\u201d Murphy said clinical criteria included fever OR an acute respiratory infection, with or without fever. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer has written to doctors urging them for help as Australians rush out to get tested for Covid-19, including those who don\u2019t need it. The letter says there has been \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on personal protective equipment stocks continues. Meanwhile, he wrote, \u201cthe situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country\u201d. He told doctors: Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing. He implored doctors to stick to testing guidelines. That is, only testing those who meet both clinical and epidemiological criteria. You can read more about Murphy\u2019s letter here. From Naples to Tuscany, Italians have been singing from their balconies across the country, in an effort to boost morale during its nationwide lockdown that began this week, due to Covid-19. Videos of Italian neighbours singing together have been appearing on social media after Italy\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the restrictions that shut down virtually all daily life. Social media posts with messages from China have also appeared, expressing solidarity with Italians. You can read The Guardian\u2019s full story below: The premier of Western Australia Mark McGowan is giving a press conference. Another three cases of the virus have been detected in Western Australia on Saturday, all travellers from overseas. That brings the state to a total of 17 cases. McGowan is talking about the agreement reached between the states, territories and federal government for a national cabinet of Australia. McGowan said: This means all of the leaders of each of the governments of Australia will form a group to meet regularly and to form important decisions in relation to coronavirus. This has never been done before in Australia. This is an Australian-first, since Federation. So this didn\u2019t happen in wartime, this is the first time that we have done this as a nation. I want to make sure that there is collaborative decision-making, that we are making decisions on behalf of the entire nation. The states are as one on this. The states need to work together. The boundaries are dropping away in relation to confronting this, and we are working together as Australians to confront this threat to our nation. Secondly, a range of decisions were made on policy issues, and I just want to go over those again. Firstly, we are now advising all Australians not to travel overseas. That is very firm advice to all Australians, don\u2019t travel overseas. Have your holidays at home. Only travel overseas if it is absolutely critical. He added the states and territories would begin sharing medical supplies. McGowan said: This is a very significant issue for Australia, and we want to work together. We have been through was together, we have been through depressions, we have been through all sorts of national upheavals. Australians can withstand this if we work together, if we co-operate, if we are reasonable to each other. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern says while the country only has only seen six Covid-19 cases, the government was enforcing border control measures to contain it. At a press conference on Saturday Ardern told reporters: As of midnight Sunday, every person entering New Zealand, including returning New Zealand citizens and residents, will be required to enter self-isolation for 14 days. Everybody. The Pacific Islands are exempted from this measure. They are the only ones. Anyone from this country, though, will be required to automatically self isolate should they exhibit any Covid-19 symptoms upon arrival in New Zealand. All of these restrictions will be reviewed in 16 days\u2019 time... this decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world. We are also encouraging New Zealanders to avoid all non-essential travel overseas. As of midnight tonight, we\u2019re issuing to all cruise ships not to come to New Zealand until at least 30 June 2020, that is for incoming cruise ships, at which time the directive will be reviewed. Countries across Southeast Asia are stepping up travel restrictions for citizens from Europe and countries with high numbers of cases. Cambodia has announced that it will refuse entry to citizens from Italy, Germany, Spain, France, and the United States, according to the Khmer Times. The ban, to be introduced on Tuesday, will last for 30 days. The country has so far recorded seven cases of the virus. Vietnam will also stop issuing tourist visas to citizens from Europe\u2019s Schengen area and Britain starting from Sunday, the state-run newspaper Hanoimoi reported. Tens of tourists are in quarantine in the country, following a recent cluster of cases linked to a London flight that arrived in Hanoi on 2 March. The country has so far recorded 47 cases. Meanwhile, Thai officials have added the UK to the list of countries with ongoing local transmission, which means travellers may need to monitor their health for 14 days and report symptoms to the health authorities. This applies to anyone who has travelled from or transited through the UK in the 14 days prior to their arrival in Thailand. The Philippines had earlier announced a travel ban for all foreign nationals coming from the more than 60 countries reporting local transmission of coronavirus. This includes the UK, according to the British government\u2019s travel advice. The New Zealand government has tightened its border restrictions and included Australia on the list of countries from which those entering New Zealand would be subjected to a mandatory 14-day self-isolation period. This comes into effect on Sunday. New Zealand Cricket [NZC] has announced in a statement that as a consequence, \u201cwe need to get our team back to New Zealand before the restriction is imposed, meaning it will not be able to participate in the two remaining Chappell-Hadlee fixtures\u201d. The statement says: Arrangements are at this moment being made to fly the bulk of the squad home this evening. This development also means the three-match T20I series scheduled for New Zealand cannot proceed as the mandatory self-isolation period would also apply to the Australian squad as soon as it crossed the border into New Zealand. NZC believes both these series can be replayed in their entirety at a later and more appropriate date. NZC understands and supports the government\u2019s position. This is a time of unprecedented risk and peril, and the personal health and well-being of our players is paramount. After initially calling coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d and following widespread criticism that the US government failed to act quickly enough to test for and contain coronavirus, president Donald Trump has taken to Twitter, saying; \u201cI want you to know that your Federal Government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people\u201d. His Tweet was met with some scepticism. Trump on Friday announced a national emergency and billions in funding to tackle the pandemic. \u201cIt gives tremendous powers for things that we need,\u201d Trump said in a White House Rose Garden press conference on Friday. \u201cTremendous power actually.\u201d The Australian home affairs minister Peter Dutton has just done an interview from his sickbed at the Royal Brisbane Hospital with Chris Smith from Sydney radio station 2gb. Dutton, who on Friday confirmed he had tested positive for coronavirus, said he was feeling \u201cmuch better this morning\u201d. \u201cFever has gone this morning, temperature is down, my throat was very mild to start with so probably still a bit sore but very mild in that sense. I\u2019ve had asthma since I was a child so I guess they were a bit worried about that, but they think my lungs are clear so all pretty good at the moment,\u201d he said. Dutton, who said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning, attended a cabinet meeting with senior government ministers including the prime minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday and before that was in the US where he met with Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president. But he said that he\u2019d spoken to Queensland Health authorities on Friday night who had begun contact tracing back to Wednesday morning and were not concerned about his earlier contacts. His wife and children had not displayed symptoms but were self-isolating. \u201cTheir advice to me is they\u2019re concerned with people that I\u2019ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th. So beyond that, it\u2019s not further back, there\u2019s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there\u2019s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That\u2019s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.\u201d Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings - which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises - has just announced a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages embarking between 13 March and 11 April. The temporary suspension is aimed at containing the virus spread, with the company saying the measure was being taken \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d and that it had not experienced any confirmed cases across its fleet. Guests on voyages that are underway will end and guests will be disembarked as soon as possible and assisted with travel arrangements, the company said in a statement. All guests on impacted voyages will receive a 125% refund of the fare paid in the form of a future cruise credit, which can be applied toward any future cruise through to 31 December, 2022. Alternatively travellers can ask instead for a 100% refund of the fare paid. Saudi Arabia has suspended all international flights for two weeks, starting on Sunday, to prevent the spread of coronavirus, state news agency SPA said on Saturday, citing an official source at interior ministry. Reuters reports the period will be considered as an exceptional official holiday for citizens and residents who are unable to return due to the suspension of flights or if they face quarantine after their return to the Kingdom, SPA cited the official as saying. Saudi Arabia has reported 86 coronavirus cases. On Saturday the federal department of health published a fact sheet for the general public titled \u2018Coronavirus (COVID-19) \u2013 what you need to know\u2019. Health workers and the public have been calling out for consistent and clear information about the virus. However, given the situation has been evolving rapidly, the advice too has changed over time. This is the thirteenth version of the public fact sheet. The latest advise states that to protect those most at risk and slow the rate of community transmission: Non-essential organised gatherings should be kept to fewer than 500 people Non-essential meetings or conferences of health care professionals and emergency services should be limited, and Reconsider if you need to visit residential care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. These precautions are most important for people over 60, particularly if they have a chronic disease, the department said. Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to reassure Americans over the coronavirus, saying the government will \u201cunleash every authority\u201d to fight the outbreak. It marks the end of a momentous day in the US, in which the president declared a national emergency and plans to dramatically increase the availability of testing kits. Meanwhile, the defence correspondent from PBS\u2019s Newshour programme, reported that the Pentagon was banning all domestic travel for anyone associated with the defence department. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has tested negative for the coronavirus, according to his former aid, senator Christopher Go. Duterte, who was not showing symptoms of the disease, was tested on Thursday after a number of cabinet members announced that they had been in contact with a person confirmed to have the virus, and that they would isolate themselves. Duterte has also suspended all foreign trips. The number of cases recorded in the Philippines has risen to 64, following a wave of new infections this week. The country reported its sixth death on Saturday morning. Metro Manila, home to 12 million people, will placed under lockdown from tomorrow, with schools shut and mass gatherings banned. Domestic land and sea travels to and from Manila will also stop. There is particular concern about the disease spreading rapidly in the capital\u2019s crowded housing settlements. A tourist in the Philippines, Helena Peacock, told The Guardian she found out last night that the island she is on, Coron, is being locked down from tomorrow. \u201cAll tourists have until then to leave but there is not enough flights or boats out,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of us have been at the airport on standby, approximately 300 tourists and more arriving every minute. The UK embassy in Manila is being as helpful as they are able to be. People are scared and confused because there is no information coming out. I did hear that someone has fainted inside the terminal building as it\u2019s hot and cramped. \u201cThere are rumours of private planes but no one can tell you how much it will cost or when it would leave. Airlines were still flying people in to here this morning from other areas without telling them, they found out when they arrived.\u201d South Korea has recorded 107 new coronavirus cases on Saturday compared with 110 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 8,086. In contrast, 204 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment. It\u2019s the second day in a row, the daily number of recovered people exceeded that of new confirmed cases since South Korea\u2019s first patient was confirmed on 20 January. It marks the continuing trend of a steady drop in the number of new cases, raising hopes that the outbreak may be slowing, just weeks after it became the biggest centre of infections outside China (now a title held by Italy). Of the latest 107 cases, 62 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where the Christian church at the centre of the epidemic is located, while 15 and 13 were in Gyeonggi and Seoul, respectively. There has been debate about whether schools in Australia should close in light of the ban on gatherings of more than 500 people commencing from Monday. Major events have been cancelled throughout Australia. But except for schools and universities where there have been cases of the virus, the ban will not apply to educational institutions. Earlier on Saturday chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said wider school closures were \u201cnot on the horizon\u201d. He said: They are certainly something that could be considered if there\u2019s a community outbreak. The interesting aspect about schools is that children don\u2019t seem to get much in the way of infection and if they do, they get very mild infection. At this stage we don\u2019t feel that school closures are warranted. NSW education department secretary Mark Scott told ABC news that even in large schools it was rare to have 500 people in one place at the same time. Scott said: That\u2019s part of the social distancing advice we\u2019re going to be providing. So if you have a big school that runs big school assemblies, now is not the time to be doing that. Australian Primary Principals Association president Malcolm Elliott said schools were on \u201ctenterhooks\u201d. We are all unsure about what the spread of the virus will be when it might strike particularly schools or how widespread this might become and how quickly. It is a very difficult thing to plan for in any really meaningful way. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has announced a ban on public events with more than 500 people, Reuters reports, as the government tries to curtail the spread of coronavirus. Pinera also said people arriving in Chile from countries considered high-risk for the virus, including China, Italy and Spain, would have to quarantine for 14 days. Chile has confirmed 43 cases of the coronavirus. The ban on large public events, which will begin on Monday, could have implications for upcoming planned protests. Demonstrations began late last year over the high cost of living and inequality, in some cases attracting tens of thousands of people. We are just getting the latests Chinese figures, which show 11 new cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths. Four of the new cases were in Wuhan \u2013 the centre of the outbreak \u2013 as were 10 of the deaths. Of the total 80,824 confirmed cases in China, 65,541 have recovered. On Friday the Chinese Health Commission reported just 8 deaths - the lowest since they began giving daily briefings on 25 January. Tasmania Ports has announced about 400 passengers on the MSC Magnifica are being kept on board after arriving in Hobart. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said the government had acted on the advice of Australian Border Control, and \u201c... also the advice of our own health experts and the director of public health.\u201d The ABC has more on the cruise ship here. Covid-19 has now taken a foothold in 19 countries in Africa, a continent authorities are particularly worried about due to a lack of health services. Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Guinea and Mauritania all confirmed their first cases of the coronavirus on Friday. Most of Africa\u2019s reported cases were foreigners or people who had travelled abroad. Cases were previously reported in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. The numbers of cases in most of the countries are still in single figures. Mauritania\u2019s health ministry says its first coronavirus patient is a European man, whose nationality was not specified, had returned to Nouakchott on 9 March and had since been in quarantine. Senegal confirmed 11 new cases, raising the total in that West African nation to 21. Its health ministry said 16 had been infected by the same man who had returned from Italy. Kenya\u2019s health minister, Mutahi Kagwe, said the country\u2019s first case, a 27-year-old Kenyan, was diagnosed on Thursday after travelling home via London on 5 March. Meanwhile in the US: According to the US Centers for Disease Control there have now been 49 deaths throughout the country, with more than 2,200 total cases. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state had more cases than any other in the US. The cluster of cases in New York has now surpassed Washington. Cuomo said; The number one thing we have to do in this state to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus is to increase testing, and the federal government has created a testing bottleneck nationwide with their slow response in lifting restrictions for states to authorise testing. We\u2019re dealing with the virus, but we\u2019re also dealing with the fear and anxiety New Yorkers are facing, and we\u2019re taking new actions every day as this situation evolves to address both. Following reports that vulnerable people including the elderly are struggling to buy essential items such as toilet paper as Australians rush to panic buy, supermarket giant Woolworths has announced a deal with Meals on Wheels in New South Wales to help deliver toilet paper directly to the elderly in the community. In a statement Woolworths said the first delivery of toilet paper was dropped off at the Meals on Wheels Central Coast branch in Tuggerah with more deliveries across NSW to follow in the next week. Woolworths managing director Claire Peters said: Due to the unprecedented demand on certain products in our stores, we\u2019ve heard that many elderly and vulnerable people in the community are missing out on items they may need when they shop. While we\u2019ll continue to do our very best to continue restocking our stores, we encourage all Australians to be mindful of those in your community at this time who might need help and ensure that we continue to support each other. Three more coronavirus cases have been confirmed in South Australia, the premier Steven Marshall said on Saturday. The people infected there including a student from Sacred Heart College. This means Australia has now reached 200 cases. Earlier on Saturday the shadow health minister Chris Bowen responded to the news that home affairs minister Peter Dutton had tested positive with the virus by saying the Australian government had been inconsistent in its response. He criticised Morrison for not getting tested for the virus or self-isolating following Dutton\u2019s diagnosis. But chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said Morrison and other ministers had not been in close contact with Dutton and did not need to undergo testing. Murphy said: No member of cabinet was in contact with minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period Meanwhile in the US, president Donald Trump said the UK could be added to the list of European countries included in the US travel ban. PA Media reports: The US president announced a state of emergency on Friday to combat the coronavirus pandemic, freeing up billions of dollars in funding and promising a screening website and drive-through tests. He told reporters during a White House press conference afterwards that the UK exemption had been made after being \u201crecommended to me by a group of professionals\u201d but he said the UK\u2019s rising number of cases could result in a rethink of that decision. On Wednesday night, Trump announced that the US would temporarily suspend most travel from the European Union. The restrictions, which began on Friday and are set to last 30 days, do not currently apply to US citizens or to travellers from the UK or the Republic of Ireland. The restrictions apply to most foreign nationals who have been in the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the US. The World Health Organization [WHO] has announced a Covid-19 \u2018Solidarity Response Fund\u2019, which it describes as a first-of-its-kind fund to raise money from a range of donors. The money will be used to help WHO and its and partners assist countries to respond to the pandemic. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the fund marked \u201ca critical point in the global response\u201d to the virus. He said; \u201cA lot of people and institutions have been saying they want to contribute to the fight against the novel coronavirus. Now they can\u201d. He has declared Europe as the epicentre of the virus. \u201cMore cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,\u201d he said. The latest WHO figures show more than 132,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in 123 countries. Ghebreyesus said; We have shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to 56 countries, we\u2019re shipping to a further 28 countries, and we\u2019ve sent almost 1.5 million diagnostic tests to 120 countries. Our message to countries continues to be: you must take a comprehensive approach. As Australia prepares to ban mass gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, the chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the government has modelling that says an infection could take some months to go right through the community \u201cwith a flattened curve\u201d. He said: But it depends how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day. One of the most important areas of preparation is to make sure we have sufficient critical care capacity. If we get a number of people who have severe disease and there is a lot of planning in that space. I do reiterate that if you did have a large outbreak in this country, probably 80% of people would be treated at home because they are so mild. But those who might need hospital, we have plans to stop elective surgery, expand open beds, find extra workforce, all of those plans are well advanced. I think we have a very well-prepared health system, there is clearly more preparation that is ongoing and we have clearly got to make sure in this worldwide situation that we can maximise the resources available in Australia such as those testing equipment. If we get a large outbreak and we can flatten the curve, it could go well into the middle of the year before it peaks. But there are some countries ... which seems to have peaked quite early and controlled the outbreak. One of the things we know about outbreaks and epidemics as they are very hard to predict. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m the Guardian\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief Melissa Davey, and I\u2019ll be keeping you up to date on all the latest developments. You can contact me at melissa.davey@theguardian.com or on Twitter. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points so far on the Covid-19 outbreak. The global death toll reached 5,359, while 142,557 cases have been confirmed. In addition, 70,176 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The institution draws from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. The US president declared a national emergency. Donald Trump, who started out by dismissing coronavirus as a hoax, took the major step of designating it a national emergency. That allowed him to sweep aside a host of rules and regulations in order to try to stop its spread. But he repeatedly refused to accept any responsibility for his own administration\u2019s response to the outbreak. Europe is now the centre of the pandemic, the WHO said. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the continent has more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined apart from China. The UK is set to ban mass gatherings \u2013 a significant U-turn by Downing Street. A Whitehall source briefed reporters that ministers are working on a plan to stop \u201cvarious types of public event, including mass gatherings, beginning next week\u201d. The government has thus deemed such measures unnecessary. The UK could be added to the US\u2019 travel ban, Trump said. Responding to news of a significant uptick in the number of UK cases, Trump indicated he was thinking of extended his ban to a country he has thus far protected, while taking others off the list. UK sporting events and elections were postponed. Almost all professional football in Britain, including a significant portion of the grassroots game, was suspended. Rugby fixtures were put off and the London marathon was postponed. In golf, the Masters, which is played in the US, was also cancelled. Local and mayoral elections due to take place in the UK later this year were put back to 2021. Spain declared a state of emergency, while a host of other countries announced strict new measures. Among them were France, Canada and Cyprus, as well as Bosnia, Switzerland and a string of others. Ivanka Trump working from home after contact with Australian government minister who has the virus. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, who serves in the White House, will not self-quarantine despite coming into close contact with the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. In Australia the Victorian government will soon reveal more details about event cancellations following the cancellation of the Grand Prix on Friday.",

      "body": "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Donald Trump given coronavirus all clear</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. A memo from Conley said that the president had agreed to be tested for the virus following an \u201cin-depth discussion\u201d on Friday night. A week earlier he had dinner with a Brazilian official who later tested positive. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</p> <h2>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus</h2> <p>The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of patients. Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</p> <h2>Lockdown announced in Spain</h2> <p>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follow the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential\u201d public places from midnight on Saturday. Restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos will be closed under the measures. Pharmacies and places selling other basic necessities will be exempted.</p> <h2>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus</h2> <p>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</p> <h2>Israel proposes use of anti-terrorism tracking tech</h2> <p>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <h2>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners</h2> <p>Colombia closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela \u200bconfirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela \u2013 with fewer cases \u2013 as a possible centre\u200b of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</p> <h2>State of emergency announced in Libya</h2> <p>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.</p> <h2>Number of African countries to report Covid-19 cases rises</h2> <p>Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. Morocco has banned flights to and from as many as 25 countries.</p> <h2><strong>Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths</strong></h2> <p>As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>. The institution runs a live tracker of coronavirus cases, based on official figures, meaning that the true figures may be somewhat higher.</p>",

The new governor is no stranger to baptisms of fire as he prepares to replace Mark Carney in the hot seat, having started his last job \u2013 as boss of the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 a week after the Brexit vote. This time around, the challenge appears far greater, following the biggest stock market crash since Black Monday in October 1987, as countries around the world step up their efforts to contain the coronavirus, with dramatic consequences for households and businesses. On his agenda from day one at Threadneedle Street will be the task of calming the markets and shoring up confidence in the British economy, amid rising levels of concern about the path ahead.
