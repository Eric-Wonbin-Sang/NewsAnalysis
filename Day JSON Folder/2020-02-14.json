Lampard\u2019s team host Manchester United on Monday and Tottenham the following Saturday in matches that could prove decisive in the race for the Premier League\u2019s top four. Chelsea\u2019s manager wants his players to embrace this challenge and that includes the \u00a371m Arrizabalaga, who looks set to return to the side after being dropped for the last match against Leicester. \u201cIt was just a selection on that day, but I want everyone\u2019s reaction to be spot on and he came out of the team,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI know how that feels and what it would have meant to him.

This week the EU has added the British overseas territory to its blacklist of tax havens. Use of tax havens is legal.</p> <p>However, Degorce was also the founder of Theleme Partners, a hedge fund which Sunak helped to start in 2009. Degorce was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d09520b4-6f42-11e4-8d86-00144feabdc0\">ordered to repay about \u00a38m in tax</a> after he was found to have used a film investment partnership tax avoidance scheme.</p> <p>McDonnell said: \u201cClearly Mr Sunak has questions to answer about his past activities and associations.\u201d</p> <p>A Treasury source said: \u201cWe will take no lectures from the Labour party, who seem to be stuck playing the same old political games rather than listening to what the public wants. The chancellor is focused on levelling up and delivering on the promises made to the British in last years election.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s demands for more information about Sunak\u2019s past career came as the government was unable to say on Friday whether the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/14/cabinet-reshuffle-boris-johnson-to-chair-first-meeting-of-new-cabinet-after-reshuffle-live-news\">budget would still go ahead</a> as planned on 11 March following Javid\u2019s unexpected departure.</p> <p>Experts said that the government must still put forward a finance bill \u2013 which typically comes alongside the budget \u2013 in order to continue collecting taxes from workers and businesses in the next financial year.</p> <p>Gemma Tetlow, chief economist at the Institute for Government thinktank, said: \u201cI was somewhat surprised the question was raised [about the budget going ahead]. Presumably the budget planning process is pretty advanced already.\u201d</p> <p>As chief secretary to the Treasury before his rapid elevation to chancellor, Sunak had been central to the preparations as the key minister responsible for gathering budget submissions from Whitehall departments.</p> <p>Despite growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/rishi-sunak-banker-uk-chancellor\">expectations for a rise in government spending following his promotion</a>, it is understood that Sunak had warned several departments in the past few weeks that the Treasury had to remain within strict limits.</p> <p>The new chancellor has previously talked-up the importance of spending rules.

      "bodyText": "The new chancellor Rishi Sunak has been challenged by Labour to provide more details about his former career as a City hedge fund manager before entering politics. Following Sunak\u2019s rapid promotion to replace Sajid Javid in the wake of the former chancellor\u2019s dramatic resignation on Thursday, Labour said the new chancellor had questions to answer over his past career and business dealings. In a challenge from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, Labour said Sunak\u2019s former close associate Patrick Degorce had participated in a multimillion-pound tax avoidance scheme. Degorce and Sunak both worked for the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Management, a hedge fund run by the billionaire Sir Chris Hohn, which also had links to companies in the Cayman Islands, Labour said. This week the EU has added the British overseas territory to its blacklist of tax havens. Use of tax havens is legal. However, Degorce was also the founder of Theleme Partners, a hedge fund which Sunak helped to start in 2009. Degorce was ordered to repay about \u00a38m in tax after he was found to have used a film investment partnership tax avoidance scheme. McDonnell said: \u201cClearly Mr Sunak has questions to answer about his past activities and associations.\u201d A Treasury source said: \u201cWe will take no lectures from the Labour party, who seem to be stuck playing the same old political games rather than listening to what the public wants. The chancellor is focused on levelling up and delivering on the promises made to the British in last years election.\u201d Labour\u2019s demands for more information about Sunak\u2019s past career came as the government was unable to say on Friday whether the forthcoming budget would still go ahead as planned on 11 March following Javid\u2019s unexpected departure. Experts said that the government must still put forward a finance bill \u2013 which typically comes alongside the budget \u2013 in order to continue collecting taxes from workers and businesses in the next financial year. Gemma Tetlow, chief economist at the Institute for Government thinktank, said: \u201cI was somewhat surprised the question was raised [about the budget going ahead]. Presumably the budget planning process is pretty advanced already.\u201d As chief secretary to the Treasury before his rapid elevation to chancellor, Sunak had been central to the preparations as the key minister responsible for gathering budget submissions from Whitehall departments. Despite growing expectations for a rise in government spending following his promotion, it is understood that Sunak had warned several departments in the past few weeks that the Treasury had to remain within strict limits. The new chancellor has previously talked-up the importance of spending rules. Speaking at an event held by the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies thinktank at the autumn Tory party conference in October, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong moral underpinning for why we think we should run sound finances.\u201d However, he also warned that dry, accountant-like and wonkish language used by previous Tory chancellors risked alienating voters. Ending austerity and splashing additional funding on transport projects was a priority, he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to a place where borrowing is under control so its right to invest in what people care about.\u201d Economists said the new chancellor could break with the restraint of the past in order to please his benefactor, Boris Johnson, as Sunak had hitched his career to Johnson by handing him support to become prime minister last year. The pound rallied to a two-month high on Thursday amid growing expectations for a spending splurge. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe PM has a \u2018yes man\u2019 in position at the Treasury, who won\u2019t resist pressure to spend more, if the economy starts to buckle under the strain of Brexit.\u201d Sunak attended his first cabinet meeting as chancellor on Friday and addressed staff at the Treasury in an internal meeting. He also said in a tweet that he had a \u201cshared mission \u2013 to unite and level up the country\u201d as chancellor. A backer of Brexit, Sunak is a keen advocate of freeports \u2013 special economic zones with lower tax requirements or border controls \u2013 as a means to promote growth in different parts of the country. Following in the footsteps of George Osborne as a chancellor from a northern seat \u2013 yet who also grew up in the south, attended public school and Oxford university \u2013 Sunak has previously spoken about the importance of narrowing the north-south divide and fixing Britain\u2019s lopsided economy. Sarah Longlands, director of IPPR North, a left-leaning thinktank based in Manchester, welcomed his appointment as an opportunity to tackle regional inequality. \u201cThe new chancellor\u2019s first budget next month needs to give the north a chance to take control by devolving significant budgets to the north and investing in the region\u2019s cities, towns and rural areas,\u201d she said. A spokesman for TCI Fund Management declined to comment. The Guardian contacted Theleme Partners and the Treasury declined to comment. Sunak\u2019s parliamentary office did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Conor Coady speaks \u201cI thought we were fantastic and we should have won the game. It\u2019s a point, we move on and we keep going. I don\u2019t really wanna speak about [VAR] too much \u2013 I don\u2019t think the referee knows what\u2019s going on, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Did you think it was offside? Look, I don\u2019t really want to talk about it because it doesn\u2019t really get you anywhere.\u201d Another goalless draw between Wolves and Leicester, then. Wolves will feel they should have won the match \u2013 Willy Boly was VARed, Raul Jimenez missed a great chance and Leicester played the last 15 minutes with 10 men after Hamza Choudhury was sent off. Peep peep! 90+5 min Another chance for Wolves, with Soyuncu making a superb block to divert Jimenez\u2019s shot over the bar. He\u2019s been excellent. 90+4 min Traore almost wins it for Wolves! He ran at Chilwell, who hasn\u2019t a clue how to handle him, before cutting inside and hitting a fierce left-footed shot that was beatan away at the near post. by Schmeichel. 90+3 min Wes Morgan replaces Harvey Barnes for Leicester. 90+2 min A Leicester free-kick is headed clear to the edge of the area, where Praet\u2019s stinging shot is blocked. 90+1 min Five minutes of added time. 90 min: What a chance for Jimenez! Moutinho\u2019s corner from the left found him completely unmarked at the far post, eight yards out, but he planted a downward header just wide. That was the best chance of the match. 89 min Matt Doherty\u2019s noggin is bleeding again. Wolves have used all three subs so he is being patched up on the touchline. 88 min Chilwell is booked for pulling down Traore, who was about to scoot away from him down the right. 86 min The return match, on the opening weekend of the season, ended 0-0 as well. 85 min Moutinho moves neatly away from Praet before shooting well wide from 25 yards. 83 min \u201cUnsurprising red cards,\u201d is the subject of Matt Dony\u2019s email. \u201cHas anyone tried to suggest Choudhury is \u2018not that sort of player\u2019?\u201d I think even Choudhury\u2019s mother would agree that he is emphatically that sort of player. 82 min Joao Moutinho replaces Ruben Neves. 81 min Coady drives a good pass out to Traore, who teases Chilwell and stands up a cross that is headed over from 12 yards by Jimenez. It was a decent chance, though there was no pace on the ball. 78 min Wolves make another change, with Diogo Jota replaced by the new signing Daniel Podence. 76 min Leicester are down to 10 men. Choudhury, booked earlier in the half, slips over and deliberately brings down Dendoncker to stop a Wolves break. It was a clear yellow card. 75 min Leicester make another change, with Dennis Praet replacing Youri Tielemans. 75 min \u201cI wonder,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201chow much Traore can bench?\u201d At least three Bobby Bacalas is the word on the street. 73 min Traore has three runs at Chilwell in quick succession, winning a corner with the third. Nothing comes of it. 71 min Traore\u2019s introduction has changed the mood, which had been a bit flat after that VAR business. 70 min Here\u2019s Paul Hobson. \u201cAs I now know you can be offside from a corner, then why doesn\u2019t the defending team line up all their players near the half-way line when defending a corner, as any opposing team player in front of them will be offside?\u201d Because you can\u2019t be offside from a corner. He was offside from the return pass, having taken the corner himself. 68 min Leicester make their first change, with Marc Albrighton replacing the largely anonymous Ayoze Perez. 66 min Barnes\u2019 snapshot is crucially blocked by Coady. Wolves break through Traore, who overhits his pass to Jimenez. 64 min Pedro Neto is replaced by the exhilarating hunk of masculinity named Adama Traore 62 min Jimenez stands up a dangerous cross to the far post, where Tielemans does superbly to get in front of Dendoncker and head clear. That was an admirable piece of defending. 60 min Maddison swerves past Saiss in the area before bouncing off the defender and going over. Mike Dean decides there wasn\u2019t enough contact for a penalty, and Team VAR agree. 59 min \u201cHappy VAR-entine\u2019s Day?\u201d hoots Simon McMahon. \u201cWolves are in gold, Leicester are blue. Was it offside? We don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d 58 min Tielemans\u2019 long-range shot bounces up into the loving embrace of Rui Patricio. Leicester are looking really dangerous now though. 57 min \u201cAlways SO thrown by these Friday night games, though it is a nice way to ease into a holiday weekend\u2026\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cI am so sorry your professional life seems to be 90 per cent VAR bitching ;)\u201d VAR and a smiley in the same sentence. Modern life was made for people like me. 55 min Leicester have been more incisive since half-time. Barnes breaks away from Dendoncker, who pulls him back and is booked. 54 min \u201cIf that offside had been given at the time by the assistant, we would all have looked at the replay and agreed it was a great decision,\u201d says Joe Matthews. \u201cI don\u2019t see why it\u2019s an outrageous decision because it\u2019s given by VAR and most people don\u2019t understand the rules.\u201d 52 min Saiss\u2019s free-kick hits the wall. 51 min Choudhury is booked for fouling Jimenez on the edge of the D. He got the ball, so Mike Dean must have decided that he came through Jimenez to do so. 50 min Ricardo Pereira almost scores a brilliant goal. He beat Jonny all ends up with a lovely trick, shifted the ball to the side of Coady and then blasted it wide from a narrow angle. 49 min Doherty\u2019s head is bleeding again. While he is treated, Perez has a close-range shot smothered by a couple of defenders. 47 min To clear up some of the mud: it was Neto, who took the corner, who was offside when the ball was returned to him by Jota. You can\u2019t be offside from a corner. At least I don\u2019t think you can. I don\u2019t know nuthin\u2019 any more. I\u2019m like King Midas in reverse. 46 min The second half begins. Not sure anyone cares now. I should stress that it was the correct decision, in accordance with the laws. You can be offside even if the ball is played backwards. \u201cLove is blind, they say,\u201d says Justin Kavanagh. \u201cAnd so were old-fashioned referees. Now football is blinded by technology and pedantic decision-makers sitting in front of screens. Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d I can\u2019t be bothered. It\u2019s so boring. The players are booed off the field, a response to the latest VAR incident. Conor Coady is talking to Mike Dean, asking why it was offside even though the ball went backwards. He\u2019s fuming. 45+2 min Ruben Neves is booked for dissent. Jota was offside from the short corner, apparently. He took the original corner and his heel was ahead of the last defender when the ball was returned to him, even though the ball was played backwards. VAR are checking for lord knows what. Wolves take the lead on the stroke of half-time! It came from a short corner on the right. A very deep cross was headed back across goal by Doherty, and Boly got in front of Tielemans to head past Schmeichel from four yards. 42 min Jimenez misses an even better chance! Jonny\u2019s deflected cross found him in space at the far post, six yards from goal, but he mistimed his header back across goal and well wide. He\u2019s normally lethal in situations like that. 41 min Pedro Neto misses a good chance! He did really well to pick the pocket of Choudhury, who was given a dodgy pass by the keeper Schmeichel, but then rushed his shot and sliced the ball miles wide. 40 min Yep, Doherty is back on the field. 39 min Doherty gets to his feet and accepts Maddison\u2019s apology. I think he\u2019s going to continue. 36 min Maddison is booked for kicking Doherty in the head. It was accidental, a blind kick at a high ball, and he apologised immediately. Doherty is struggling - he is lying on his side, with a lot of blood coming from the top of his head. He looks pretty groggy as well. 35 min \u201cWith Man City banned from the Champions League,\u201d says John, \u201cdoes that mean the fifth-placed team in the Premier League get a spot?\u201d In theory, yes, though it hasn\u2019t been confirmed. That said, I\u2019d expect City to play in next year\u2019s competition - I doubt their appeal will be heard before the start of the season. 34 min Chilwell\u2019s cross is headed away by Coady. Vardy, who was lurking, has had no joy so far. I think he\u2019s only touched the ball a couple of times. 29 min Wing-backs of the Wolves unite: Doherty moves down the right and crosses towards the penalty spot, where Jonny gets in front of Ricardo Pereira and flicks a header over the bar. 29 min Leicester\u2019s slightly sterile domination continues. It\u2019s all very pretty and accomplished, but there\u2019s been no penetration in open play. 26 min ... and he smashes it into the wall. 26 min Jimenez wins a free-kick 30 yards from goal after an essentially harmless challenge from Tielemans. Ruben Neves will hit this... 24 min Leicester\u2019s first chance. Maddison\u2019s deep free-kick from the right is headed straight at the keeper by Soyuncu. He might have been unsighted by Chilwell jumping in front of him, but it was still a good opportunity. 23 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cLike a lot of men, I\u2019m spending Valentine\u2019s Day with the love of my life. I can\u2019t ever remember feeling like this about anyone. It\u2019s so intense I\u2019m getting emotional just typing this. I don\u2019t say it often enough, but I love you. And of course once Dundee United - Alloa is over, I\u2019ll go home to Mrs McMahon. Happy Valentine\u2019s Day!\u201d 21 min Wolves look the more dangerous team, despite their limited possession. Leicester haven\u2019t really got behind the defence. 17 min Jota wins a corner for Wolves. Neto drives it deep towards Dendoncker, whose header from 15 yards drifts just wide of the far post. Schmeichel had it covered. 15 min After a sluggish start, Wolves have come to life. It\u2019s a good game now, a contrast in both formation and style. 12 min Leicester break dangerously from the resulting Wolves corner. Tielemans has good options to his left but tries to go alone and is crowded out. 11 min Schmeichel makes a fine save from Diogo Jota! The chance came after a scintillating sprint down the right by Pedro Neto. He was tackled just inside the area by Soyuncu but picked up the loose ball and slid an angled pass to Diogo Jota, whose crisp low shot was kicked behind by the stretching Schmeichel. 9 min Tielemans\u2019 deflected long-range shot is beaten away by the diving Rui Patricio. It was a comfortable enough save once he scrambled across his line, but it\u2019s a reflection of Leicester\u2019s dominant start. 7 min Leicester continue to dominate possession, though so far everything has been in front of the Wolves defence. 4 min Coady\u2019s long free-kick from the halfway line is headed on by Boly on the edge of the area, and Schmeichel comes from his line to grab the ball in front of Dendoncker. 3 min It\u2019s been a confident start from Leicester, with some smooth passing and movement. You\u2019d expect them to dominate possession; Wolves won\u2019t mind that. 1 min Peep peep! Leicester, in blue, kick off from left to right. Wolves are in the old gold. When it comes to atmosphere, Molineux is one of the more old-fashioned Premier League grounds. People cheer and everything, and there\u2019s plenty of noise as the teams emerge from the tunnel. Molineux by night is a beautiful place. \u201cAn early email to an MBM on Valentine\u2019s tells you all you need to know about tonight\u2019s plans for romance,\u201d weeps Ian Copestake. Pre-match reading Here\u2019s more on the news that Pep Guardiola\u2019s agent will be working the weekend after all. Adama Traore is only on the Wolves bench, presumably with next week\u2019s Europa League match against Espanyol in mind. Joao Moutinho is also a substitute, with Leander Dendoncker replacing him. That aside, both teams are as expected. Wolves (3-4-2-1) Rui Patricio; Saiss, Coady, Boly; Doherty, Neves, Dendoncker, Jonny; Neto, Diogo Jota; Jimenez. Substitutes: Ruddy, Buur, Kilman, Podence, Gibbs-White, Moutinho, Traore. Leicester (4-1-4-1) Schmeichel; Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell; Choudhury; Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes; Vardy. Substitutes: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Praet, Iheanacho. Referee Mike Dean. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Wolves v Leicester from Molineux. These are two of the best teams outside the Big Six (not to be confused with the actual top six), with so much desirable attacking talent on both sides: Adama Traore, James Maddison, the still underrated Raul Jimenez, Youri Tielemans, Diogo Jota, Harvey Barnes and more. Both teams have been in iffy form of late, but what\u2019s past is prologue and all that. A win for Leicester would lift them to second; victory for Wolves would move them from ninth to sixth. With the news that Manchester City have been banned from Uefa competitions for the next two seasons, a Champions League place suddenly feels attainable. Kick off is at 8pm.",

      "body": "<p>Is old the new new? That was the question at London fashion week yesterday, where, alongside headline names such as Mulberry and Vivienne Westwood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/14/london-fashion-week-opens-coronavirus-hits-attendance-chinese\">the five-day fashion event</a> launched its first clothes swap.</p> <p>Clothes swapping has become increasingly popular in recent years, as the appetite for dressing inexpensively and sustainably has boomed. But the practice has never before had such high-profile fashion industry approval.</p> <p>Among the first to donate items were industry heavyweights including the sustainable fashion campaigner Livia Firth and Sarah Mower, a critic and British Fashion Council (BFC) ambassador.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1bc111356998af97daef4291665b1dea424cfce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1bc111356998af97daef4291665b1dea424cfce/0_202_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models on the catwalk in Yuhan Wang\u2019s show yesterday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models on the catwalk in Yuhan Wang\u2019s show yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two Burberry coats and a retro Puma zip-up top were highlights on the rails as the first few curious visitors milled around the shop on the Strand at lunchtime yesterday.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment. It\u2019s never been done before. It fits in with the way the world\u2019s moving, towards experiences, rather than consuming,\u201d said Patrick McDowell, a young designer presenting a \u201ccurated, evolving\u201d collection made from donated pieces as part of the clothes swap, some of which will be decorated with upcycled Swarovski crystals. No money will change hands because, in a swap, McDowell explained: \u201cThe clothes on your back are your currency.\u201d</p> <p>The swap shop is one of a number of sustainability initiatives unveiled this fashion week, as the industry continues to be targeted by environmentalists.</p> <p>Mulberry, for example, has launched an initiative to collect and repurpose vintage handbags while Ashley Williams used fabric from past samples in her new collection and Alexander McQueen announced a drive to donate its old, unused fabric to fashion students.</p> <p>Though only open to attendants of London fashion week \u2013 those working in the industry as well as about 2,500 members of the ticket-buying public \u2013 the swap shop has a broader aim of promoting the \u201csharing economy\u201d, which many believe could help the fashion industry drastically reduce its carbon footprint. Patrick Duffy, one of the event\u2019s organisers, and founder of sustainability consultancy Global Fashion Exchange, said 150bn items of clothing were made each year, \u201cbut so much is sent to landfill \u2013 300,000 tonnes each year in Britain. And that is growing every year. We have to remember the environmental social impact of that.\u201d</p> <p>There are many who are sceptical of attempts towards sustainability from within the fashion industry. Extinction Rebellion, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/13/do-or-die-extinction-rebellions-die-in-london-to-end-with-fashion-funeral\">is calling for London fashion week to be shut altogether</a> and has protests planned. The group has urged the BFC to \u201cpropose the legislation needed to stop the fashion industry\u2019s exploitation of planet, people and animals\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is no emergency action but tweaks to business as usual. We need to know how emissions and the loss of biodiversity will be addressed.\u201d</p> <p>One of the founders of fashion week, Lynne Franks, also chimed in, saying: \u201cI believe now is the time for drastic change in how we do things. We\u2019re in a different world, a world of emergency and there is a need for drastic action.\u201d</p> <p>For Duffy, however, working with fashion week can be an effective route to change. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be shameful to buy something new,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should educate people about the process behind their clothes. If people knew what they were buying, like they do with food, it would be very different.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Is old the new new? That was the question at London fashion week yesterday, where, alongside headline names such as Mulberry and Vivienne Westwood, the five-day fashion event launched its first clothes swap. Clothes swapping has become increasingly popular in recent years, as the appetite for dressing inexpensively and sustainably has boomed. But the practice has never before had such high-profile fashion industry approval. Among the first to donate items were industry heavyweights including the sustainable fashion campaigner Livia Firth and Sarah Mower, a critic and British Fashion Council (BFC) ambassador. Two Burberry coats and a retro Puma zip-up top were highlights on the rails as the first few curious visitors milled around the shop on the Strand at lunchtime yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment. It\u2019s never been done before. It fits in with the way the world\u2019s moving, towards experiences, rather than consuming,\u201d said Patrick McDowell, a young designer presenting a \u201ccurated, evolving\u201d collection made from donated pieces as part of the clothes swap, some of which will be decorated with upcycled Swarovski crystals. No money will change hands because, in a swap, McDowell explained: \u201cThe clothes on your back are your currency.\u201d The swap shop is one of a number of sustainability initiatives unveiled this fashion week, as the industry continues to be targeted by environmentalists. Mulberry, for example, has launched an initiative to collect and repurpose vintage handbags while Ashley Williams used fabric from past samples in her new collection and Alexander McQueen announced a drive to donate its old, unused fabric to fashion students. Though only open to attendants of London fashion week \u2013 those working in the industry as well as about 2,500 members of the ticket-buying public \u2013 the swap shop has a broader aim of promoting the \u201csharing economy\u201d, which many believe could help the fashion industry drastically reduce its carbon footprint. Patrick Duffy, one of the event\u2019s organisers, and founder of sustainability consultancy Global Fashion Exchange, said 150bn items of clothing were made each year, \u201cbut so much is sent to landfill \u2013 300,000 tonnes each year in Britain. And that is growing every year. We have to remember the environmental social impact of that.\u201d There are many who are sceptical of attempts towards sustainability from within the fashion industry. Extinction Rebellion, for example, is calling for London fashion week to be shut altogether and has protests planned. The group has urged the BFC to \u201cpropose the legislation needed to stop the fashion industry\u2019s exploitation of planet, people and animals\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is no emergency action but tweaks to business as usual. We need to know how emissions and the loss of biodiversity will be addressed.\u201d One of the founders of fashion week, Lynne Franks, also chimed in, saying: \u201cI believe now is the time for drastic change in how we do things. We\u2019re in a different world, a world of emergency and there is a need for drastic action.\u201d For Duffy, however, working with fashion week can be an effective route to change. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be shameful to buy something new,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should educate people about the process behind their clothes. If people knew what they were buying, like they do with food, it would be very different.\u201d",

Just hours before the deadline closed on Friday night it became apparent that she would fail to get the backing from the required 33 constituency Labour parties to send her through to the last round. It leaves the leadership contest as a three-way race between Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has struggled throughout the contest to get support despite her seniority in the party, receiving no union or socialist society backing \u2013 which is another way that would-be leaders can get through to the ballot. By Friday night the Islington South and Finsbury MP only had the backing of 31 local parties and it appeared no more would declare before the deadline.

Starmer had 374, Long-Bailey had 164 and Nandy had 72. Labour\u2019s leadership rivals will significantly increase their campaigning efforts this weekend as they get access to party data allowing them to call thousands of members in an attempt to secure their votes. The three remaining hopefuls are assembling an army of volunteers to help them reach the party\u2019s grassroots. Nandy won a major boost when members of the Labour affiliate Jewish Labour Movement gave her their backing after a hustings, saying she understood the need to change the party\u2019s culture. A source for Starmer\u2019s campaign said: \u201cKeir has been building a grassroots campaign with thousands of supporters across the country.

Despite social media being an area of expertise for the leftwing group, it is said to be anxious about rivals ploughing significant resources into online campaigning. A source said they were expecting her rivals Starmer and Nandy to \u201cunleash big Facebook advertising operations\u201d. Nandy\u2019s team includes the MPs Stella Creasy, Louise Haigh and Jonathan Ashworth, who will be helping to run phone contact sessions. To make it on to the final ballot, the leadership hopefuls needed nominations from either 5% of constituency Labour parties, or affiliated unions and socialist societies. Starmer won the backing of five trade unions, including a last-minute endorsement from the TSSA transport union. He also has Unison, Usdaw, Community and the Musicians\u2019 Union.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of the key points from today\u2019s coronavirus coverage as governments and health leaders continue to battle to control the spread of the disease: Africa has its first confirmed case of coronavirus after a person in Egypt tested positive for the disease, it has emerged. The person, who is not Egyptian, is in hospital isolation, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Eight Heathrow flights were delayed earlier amid coronavirus concerns. Government health officials were responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling unwell. Two MPs who were among more than 200 attendees at a London conference alongside a delegate who has since tested positive for coronavirus have gone into self-isolation. Nearly 3,000 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus, according to the government. But officials warn the number of people who have the disease in the UK \u2013 currently nine \u2013 is highly likely to rise in the coming days. More from the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan due to coronavirus, as my colleague Justin McCurry reports how passengers are spending Valentine\u2019s Day. Travellers, who have been stuck on board for nearly two weeks now, are being treated today with Californian wine and a dinner menu including \u201cCupid\u2019s avocado and shrimp\u201d, coq au vin and a \u201csurprise dessert of the day\u201d. As the boredom sets in for passengers on the luxury cruiser \u2013 which has seen more than 200 confirmed cases of the disease \u2013 individuals posted photos of their meals, tackled sudoku puzzles and played hopscotch during brief and restricted forays on to the deck. Africa has its first confirmed case of coronavirus after a person in Egypt tested positive for the disease, it has emerged. The person, who is not Egyptian, is in hospital isolation, the country\u2019s health ministry said. The ministry said it had immediately informed the World Health Organization and taken all necessary preventative measures. No other details are known yet about the individual who caught the disease. Airline passengers who have sat within two rows of a person suspected to have caught coronavirus should be quarantined, according to guidance published by the government today for transport staff. The guidance released by the Department for Transport states: \u201cAny contacts of a possible case need to be isolated or quarantined. In practice for passengers who have travelled via airplane, this will include all passengers in the 2 rows in front and behind of where the possible case was sat.\u201d Staff working on planes, trains or ships are recommended to cooperate with emergency medical services at airports or ports if a passenger becomes symptomatic on board. Meanwhile, transport staff should not wear face masks but instead stick to good hygiene to avoid the risk of coronavirus, according to the guidance. It advises staff not to wear masks as \u201cthey do not provide protection from respiratory viruses\u201d. Instead, the best way of reducing risk is \u201cgood hygiene\u201d and to avoid getting within two metres with a potentially infected person. The World Health Organization (WHO) will join forces with China to start its investigation into the coronavirus outbreak in the country this weekend, the organisation\u2019s director has announced. The joint-mission will probe how the disease is spreading and its severity, seeking more precise details on the circumstances surrounding how more than 1,700 health workers have been infected. \u201cWe expect the full team to touch down over the weekend,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \u201cParticular attention will be paid to understanding transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures.\u201d A British man stuck with his wife onboard a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan because of the coronavirus outbreak has criticised Boris Johnson and appealed to billionaire Richard Branson to save them. David Abel, who is on the Diamond Princess ship with his wife Sally where more than 200 people have been diagnosed with the disease, said despite being a \u201cstaunch Tory\u201d he had \u201cno confidence\u201d in the prime minister. Abel said: \u201cWhen he [Johnson] just says \u2018keep calm, don\u2019t panic\u2019 - I\u2019d like to see you in this situation, mate. I really would.\u201d In a Facebook live video, he also appealed for Virgin boss Branson to charter a plane to fly all British nationals on the ship home to carry out their quarantine. He appealed directly to Branson, saying: \u201cIf you and your family were in this situation, what would you do? And please don\u2019t say \u2018chill out, stay calm\u2019, that\u2019s not what we want to hear. I\u2019m asking, what would it cost to hire one of your smaller planes, put all the Brits onboard, no flight attendants, packaged food? Take us to Brize Norton, take us straight into the medical facility and let us do our quarantine there by people who can speak our language.\u201d Abel added: \u201cI\u2019m serious, Richard Branson, absolutely serious. I think he is the man, he\u2019s not afraid to speak his mind. He\u2019s the guy who could resolve this for the Brits.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhatever the cost, we will somehow find a way of paying for that plane. Don\u2019t know how but we wouldn\u2019t want you to be out of pocket on that. But this is just how damned desperate some of the passengers are becoming.\u201d The couple said previously that they had declined the offer to leave the ship and continue their quarantine ashore if they test negative for the virus. The vessel was quarantined when it arrived in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, at the start of the month after it emerged that a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong in late January had tested positive for the disease. As many as eight flights at Heathrow Airport were said to have been caught up in delays or checks as a result of government health officials responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling unwell. United Airlines confirmed that staff in London had been providing assistance to a flight from San Francisco which had landed at Heathrow following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard. A man who had been on the flight said a passenger had been taken to the back of the plane ahead of the arrival of health officials before passengers were allowed to disembark after half-an-hour. \u201cThere was an initial announcement that someone had taken ill and would be taken off,\u201d said Andy West, a public relations executive at Hotwire, told the Guardian. \u201cShortly afterwards he said that there was a suspected case of coronavirus and that the passenger had been isolated at the back of the plane.\u201d Alex Sobel, one of two MPs who has gone into self-isolation over a virus scare, called on the government to do more to track down those who may have come into contact with those with coronavirus. Speaking to Sky News, the Labour MP revealed he found out through media reports that he was at the same event \u2013 a Bus Summit \u2013 as someone who has since been tested positive for coronavirus. He said: I hope the government do properly put the resources into public health and tracking people. I found out through the media. I do think there needs to be a stepping of the resource and support for this, because it has got the potential to be a pandemic.\u201d Sobel said he was not on the official list of delegates at the 6 February event but he did attend a fringe event outside the QEII Centre at which several buses were on show. He said he has since been in contact with Public Health England which is trying to track everyone at the event. Public Health England gave the advice that I should take reasonable precautions. Right now I should be at surgeries with constituents. We thought it a reasonable caution to self isolate until next Wednesday evening. I\u2019m still at the office as it all blew up this morning. I\u2019m in the end meeting room in the office away from everybody else. Once I\u2019ve finished all these media reviews, I\u2019ll be going home, and then I\u2019ll be isolating myself. Like most MPs I\u2019ve got a pile of things to do, things to read, things to write, Netflix to watch, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine. It is obviously much more important that I isolate myself in case I am a risk than being a bit bored or being a little bit stir crazy The advice that we\u2019ve been given is that as long you feel well, then you can carry on as normal. Because myself and Lilian another MP, come into contact with a lot of people ... we\u2019ve taken this additional precautions.I\u2019m not showing any symptoms. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve got no fever. I\u2019ve got no flu-like symptoms. I\u2019ve gotten to respiratory issues. But as you can present after up to 14 days, I\u2019ve taken these precautionary measures.\u201d Professional golf tournaments in China and Malaysia have both been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, organisers have announced. The Volvo China Open, in Shenzhen, and the Maybank Championship, in Kuala Lumpur were due to take place in April. Organisers are looking at rescheduling the tournaments for later this year. Keith Pelley, Chief Executive of the European Tour, said: The well-being of our players, spectators and staff is always our absolute priority. While it is therefore regrettable that the Maybank Championship and Volvo China Open have been postponed, we feel this is the correct course of action at this time. We are currently investigating alternative dates for both events.\u201d Datuk Abdul Farid Alias, Group President &amp; CEO of Maybank, said: The decision to postpone the Maybank Championship was made after intense deliberation and careful consideration in the interest of all the players, visitors, working teams and partners. The postponement of the Maybank Championship was not an easy decision to make, however, the safety of all stakeholders takes precedence, and we want to ensure that any risk of possible exposure to Covid-19 is mitigated. We will monitor the situation and work closely with the European &amp; Asian Tours, as well as our other partners, as we plan for our return in the future.\u201d Here\u2019s a dispatch from the opening day of London fashion week by my colleague Hannah Marriott, who reports that the coronavirus outbreak has dealt a blow to the numbers in attendance. The majority of press and buyers from China, which is responsible for a third of global luxury sales, are not at the five-day event, she reports. The British Fashion Council\u2019s chief executive, Caroline Rush, has announced that heightened hygiene measures are in place at the central London venue on the Strand, with a \u201cdeep clean\u201d each night and antibacterial hand sanitisers handed out. Two MPs who went to a London conference alongside a delegate who has since tested positive for coronavirus are among more than 200 attendees who have been contacted by health officials. A letter has been sent by Public Health England (PHE) to those who went to the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre in Westminster on February 6. The attendee who has caught the disease is among nine people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK. Dr Yimmy Chow, consultant in health protection at PHE, said: One of our main priorities has been to identify any people who we think have been in close contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19 to provide public health advice, as they may be at slightly increased risk of catching the virus. While the degree of contact conference delegates may have had with the case is unlikely to have been significant, we have taken a precautionary approach and informed them of the situation.\u201d People trapped in Wuhan have been volunteering and checking in on the animals whose owners are stuck outside the city. A second MP who was speaking at the Bus Summit attended by someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus has also gone into self-isolation. Lilian Greenwood, the MP for Nottingham South, joined her Labour colleague Alex Sobel in cancelling her engagements until next week as a precaution (see earlier) In a Twitter post, Greenwood shared a letter from Public Health England which has been trying to contact all those who attended the conference last week at London\u2019s QEII Centre. It advise that if she develops symptoms she should \u201cstay indoors and avoid contact with other people\u201d. Nearly 3,000 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus, according to the latest daily update from the Department of Health and Social Care. Of the 2,964 tests conducted in the UK, those who have tested positive still stands at nine. But officials have said it highly likely there will be more in the coming days. A Labour MP has cancelled all his engagements after admitting that he was one of 200 delegates at a summit attended by someone who has since tested positive for the virus. Alex Sobel, the MP for Leeds north west, said he attended the Bus Summit in central London on 6 February. Public Health England has been trying contacted everyone who came into close contact with someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus, including fellow attendees at the Bus Summit (see earlier). Sobel said he had been informed he was \u201cvery low risk\u201d but cancelled engagements until next Thursday as a precaution and is waiting to be assessed. A spokesman for Sobel said he was not unwell and had no symptoms, but had decided to self-isolate at home until next week as a precaution. Taiwan has accused China of dragging its feet over the evacuation of citizens stranded in the province at the centre of the outbreak, in the latest spat between the two neighbours, AFP reports. Multiple countries have successfully arranged evacuation flights for nationals stuck in Hubei province where the epidemic is at its most intense and deadly. But nearly 1,000 Taiwanese have been waiting for the best part of two weeks for a flight out. On Wednesday, Chinese state media quoted local officials accusing Taiwan\u2019s government of \u201crepeatedly delaying\u201d their return. The reports said \u201cpolitical manipulation\u201d was behind the delay but gave no concrete details. For days Taiwanese officials gave few clues on what was behind the hold up as officials tried to broker an agreement behind the scenes. But on Friday health minister Chen Shih-chung ended that silence, saying Beijing had \u201crefused to cooperate\u201d. \u201cThe Chinese side has used all kinds of reasons to stall and refused our plans and recommendations. We deeply regret this,\u201d he told reporters. Taiwanese stuck in Wuhan said they have no idea what was causing the delays. \u201cMost people who are still in Wuhan and Hubei are very anxious and worried and we want to go back to Taiwan,\u201d Hsiao Yung-jui, head of the Wuhan Taiwan Enterprises Association, told AFP. Here\u2019s a summary of events so far today: A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe are a little disappointed that we haven\u2019t been invited in and we\u2019re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council. One of the people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK attended a central London conference last week with more than 200 delegates. Public Health England is trying to identify anyone who had close contact with the unnamed individual, including those who attended the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre on 6 February. A Channel 4 employee was taken to hospital to be tested for coronavirus on Thursday after being met at the channel\u2019s London headquarters by health officials in protective clothing. The person is understood to have been on holiday recently in China in the last month and had some concerns about feeling unwell. China has reported another 121 deaths from the virus taking death toll in mainland China to 1,380. The lates figures remove 108 deaths from a previously issued count due to double-counting. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China rose to 63,851, a rise of 5,090 new cases. Six healthcare workers are among those who have died from the virus, Chinese health officials have disclosed. They were among 1,716 healthcare workers who have been infected. In Cambodia, more than 2,000 passengers and crew of the Westerdam cruise ship finally disembarked, after passengers were cleared of the virus. The ship had been refused entry to five different countries. A cruise ship, docked in Sydney, was also given the all clear after a person tested negative for the virus. Japan recorded its first death from the new coronavirus. It is the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. A Harvard academic has defended research suggesting a possible underreporting of coronavirus cases in Indonesia, following fierce criticism from the health minister in the world\u2019s most fourth most populous country, which insists it has no cases. Professor Marc Lipsitch analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report last week that Indonesia might have missed cases. On Tuesday the Indonesian health minister Terawan Agus Putranto called the report \u201cinsulting\u201d and said the country had proper testing equipment. On Thursday, health officials in Indonesia, which has a population of 272 million and is a popular destination for Chinese tourists, said they were retracing the movements of a Chinese tourist who was diagnosed with coronavirus upon his return from Bali. No-one in Bali has yet been found with symptoms. Hong Kong will give handouts worth HK$25 billion (\u00a32.4m) to hospitals and businesses in a bid to revive the city\u2019s ailing economy which has been hit by the coronavirus outbreak. Announcing the relief package earlier, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the government would give HK$4.7 billion (\u00a3460m) to the Hospital Authority, as well as other one-off payments to businesses \u2013 including restaurants and travel agents \u2013 hurt by the spread of the disease. It comes after Lam has been under fire, accused of mishandling the crisis, with figures showing Hong Kong has 56 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with one reported death. \u201cMy biggest concern now is really for us to overcome this public health crisis together so that we could then focus on re-launching Hong Kong and rebuilding Hong Kong\u2019s economic strength,\u201d Lam said. The package will need to be approved by the city\u2019s Legislative Council, Reuters reports. Travel restrictions have hampered the city\u2019s economic prospects. Hong Kong\u2019s economy contracted for the first time in a decade last year as the city has seen months of anti-government protests. One of the latest coronavirus scares was on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Heathrow. In a statement the airline said: \u201cOur team at London Heathrow Airport is providing assistance related to United flight 901 (San Francisco-London Heathrow) today, following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard. \u201cThe safety of our customers and employees is our highest priority and we continue to work closely with local authorities.\u201d North Korea is one of several countries with close ties to China which has not formally reported any coronavirus cases, but may already be battling the disease. Officials there are clearly extremely worried about the danger of an outbreak, and have have effectively put the entire country into quarantine to try and prevent one, sealing the borders and stopping all international trains and flights. Despite these precautions, there have been reports of cases in the north, and in the capital Pyongyang, said Jiro Ishimaru, the head of Osaka-based Asia Press, who runs a secret network of citizen journalists inside North Korea. Speaking to the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, Ishimaru said: \u201cThere are lots of rumours flying around that some people have been infected near Dandong, just on the Chinese side of the border, and Rason special economic zone (on the North Korean side),\u201d \u201cI have heard from our contacts that some people in Rason have been put in isolation for 20-30 days to prevent an outbreak. There is an unconfirmed report that one man in isolation was arrested and shot after he escaped.\u201d The US state department has said it would \u201csupport and encourage\u201d international efforts to help North Korea fight the disease, despite stringent sanctions on the country because of its nuclear weapons programme. \u201cThe United States is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement, adding that they would back the work of both American and international aid and health groups. \u201cThe United States is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organisations,\u201d she added. North Korea has only a rudimentary health system and in a bid to ward off the disease the government has tried to seal off the population from the rest of the world. It has suspended international tourism, cancelled international flights and cross border trains, summoned officials back from abroad and sent home some South Koreans posted to a \u201cliaison office\u201d. Pyongyang has also closed the land border with China, normally a somewhat porous frontier that people and goods are smuggled across in both directions. The border closure has already had a dramatic impact on the economy, which is spreading news of the disease in a society where state media offer little reliable information. \u201cGiven the North\u2019s huge dependence on China for things like food, cooking oil and gasoline, there are shortages of daily necessities. People are asking why that is happening, and that\u2019s how they heard about the coronavirus,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe authorities can deny that the coronavirus has reached North Korea, but inflation and shortages are a fact of life.\u201d Another cause for concern has been the apparent disappearance from public life of leader Kim Jong-un. This Sunday is his father\u2019s birthday, when he would be expected to pay his respects to Kim Jong-il, the country\u2019s previous ruler, at a mausoleum in Pyongyang. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t do that on Sunday or Monday, then it might be a sign that he is concerned about the coronavirus,\u201d Ishimaru said. Vietnam has turned away a German-owned cruise ship with more than 1,000 passengers on board over fears of coronavirus infections on board, Reuters reports citing state media. Authorities in Quang Ninh province, home to the Unesco world heritage site Ha Long Bay, decided on Tuesday not to allow passengers of the ship AIDAvita to disembark on Thursday, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported. \u201cThe vessel has docked in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, which have all reported coronavirus cases,\u201d VNA said. \u201cNot allowing AIDIvita\u2019s passengers to disembark is just a temporary solution to prevent the intrusion of diseases,\u201d VNA cited a local official as saying. Germany\u2019s AIDA Cruises, the owner of the AIDAvita, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The cruise liner left the Philippines port of Coron on 10 February bound for Vietnam via the South China Sea, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website. It had been scheduled to visit Ha Long Bay, in northern Vietnam, on Saturday, then proceed to the Vietnamese ports of Da Nang, Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City from Feb. 16-20, according to CruiseMapper, a website which tracks cruise ships. The AIDAvita was 176 km (109 miles) south of the Thai capital Bangkok, according to Marine Traffic. The virus\u2019 impact on global travel was clear to see on a flight from Sydney to Hong Kong. Belfast born ex BBC journalist Letitia Maria Fitzpatrick posted this image on board her flight to Hong Kong on her long haul way back to Europe. The Australian based Belfast woman said the planes she normally takes back to see loved ones at home is full to its 270 capacity. This one had just 70 passengers on board. Catering staff on the quarantined Diamond Princess where more than 200 people have been diagnosed with the virus have recorded a dance video intended to raise spirits on cruise ship. This ship, which is docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, will remain quarantined until at least 19 February. Older passengers and those with chronic health conditions not connected to the virus have been allowed to leave. Here\u2019s footage from Sihanoukville in Cambodia today, as 1,455 passengers and 802 crew were finally allowed to disembark from the Westerdam cruise ship. The ship had been refused port by five countries over Covid-19 fears, but tests by Cambodian doctors said no passengers had the new virus. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen greeted the passengers with roses as they left the ship. A Channel 4 employee was taken to hospital to be tested for coronavirus on Thursday after being met at the channel\u2019s London headquarters by health officials in protective clothing, it has emerged. The person is understood to have been on holiday recently in China in the last month and had some concerns about feeling unwell. They are not a journalist and had not been to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. The person, who works at the Channel 4\u2019s office in Horseferry Road, London, has now returned home and are expected to get their test results in the coming days. They are understood to have had a light cough and had not been displaying any more than one symptom but opted to contact health authorities as a precaution. A Channel 4 spokesperson said: \u201cOn Thursday a member of staff at Channel 4 who had travelled to Asia within the last month felt unwell.\u201d \u201cAs a precautionary measure they decided to seek medical advice and, in line with the latest public health advice regarding the Coronavirus, they were taken to hospital for a precautionary test. We have informed our staff of this and continue to follow all the latest public health guidance.\u201d While there are commissioning editors at Horseferry Road, Channel 4 News is based at ITN\u2019s headquarters elsewhere in London. Singapore has reported nine new coronavirus cases \u2013 its biggest daily increase, according to the Straits Times. The new cases take Singapore\u2019s virus tally to 67. Six of the new cases are linked to the Grace Assembly of God church which is now the biggest cluster of cases in Singapore with 13 in total. Here\u2019s a picture of last week\u2019s Bus Summit at the QEII Centre which was attended by someone who has since diagnosed been with coronavirus. Transport Times, which organised the conference, said all questions about the event should be directed to Public Health England. One of the people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK attended a central London conference with more than 200 delegates, PA reports. The person, who has not been named, attended the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre in Westminster on 6 February. Transport Times, the conference organiser, emailed attendees on Thursday afternoon informing them that a person confirmed to be suffering from coronavirus illness - also known as Covid-19 - had been at the event. Dr Yimmy Chow, consultant in health protection at Public Health England (PHE), said: \u201cOne of our main priorities has been to identify any people who we think have been in close contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19 to provide public health advice, as they may be at slightly increased risk of catching the virus. \u201cWhile the degree of contact conference delegates may have had with the case is unlikely to have been significant, we have taken a precautionary approach and informed them of the situation.\u201d The case is not linked to the ninth patient with coronavirus in the UK - a woman from China. The Transport Times email attached a letter from PHE saying delegates should take no action if they were well but to stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call NHS 111 if they developed symptoms such as a fever or cough. \u201cWhile the degree of contact you may have had with the case at the summit is unlikely to have been significant, we are taking a precautionary approach and informing you,\u201d the letter said, as reported by the Financial Times. The bus conference listed about 250 delegates from the nationwide bus and transport industry. It comes after a coronavirus expert warned that the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories could lead to more cases in the UK. We\u2019ve updated our coronavirus (or should that now be covid-19?) Q&amp;A: Authorities in Taiwan have put out an appeal to locate three people who travelled from Hong Kong to Taipei on February 8 and who went missing during home quarantine. Xinqi Su, an AFP correspondent in Hong Kong, has tweeted that authorities in the Taiwanese capital has publicised information about the individuals and asked the public to help search for them. A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak amid moves by Chinese authorities to expand \u2018wartime\u2019 measures to limit its spread. Here\u2019s footage of Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, expressing US \u201cdisappointment\u201d in the response of China to the coronavirus outbreak. He said it was a concern for the wellbeing of people in China, adding that the virus had been contained in the US. Japan has vowed to step up testing and efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus after suffering its first death and finding new cases, including a doctor and at least one taxi driver, in different parts of the country. The biggest cluster of coronavirus infections outside China is linked to a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people from the ship confirmed as infected and taken off to hospital. On Friday, some of the ship\u2019s passengers were allowed to disembark - with priority given to older passengers who have been confined to windowless cabins - to complete their quarantine on shore. Japan\u2019s NHK public television network said that a female taxi driver on the southern island of Okinawa had tested positive for the virus, and the chances were high she had contact with passengers from the ship during a February 1 call at a port. \u201cWe will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves. Investors have reassessing the potential economic impact of the virus, it appears from movement in gold trading. Gold dropped off a more than one-week high on Friday as hopes for global measures to counter the coronavirus outbreak increased appetite for equities, according to Reuters. However, analysts said that interest in gold remains undimmed as the death toll in China\u2019s Hubei province continues to rise. Florists across Hong Kong say their business is down as much as 50 percent compared with last year, but masks and alcohol sanitisers have emerged as new favourite Valentine gifts for lovers, reports Verna Yu in Hong Kong for the Guardian. A survey conducted by dating agency HK Romance on 572 men and women shows that masks and alcohol sanitisers are the most wished for Valentine gifts for women this year, with 30 percent wanting those, compared with 18 percent wanting flowers, 14 percent wanting jewelry or watches and 9 percent for flights and hotel stays. For men, 32 percent want masks and alcohol sanitisers, while 19 percent don\u2019t want anything and 11 percent want electronic products. The dating agency says it plans to host classes showing people how to make DIY masks as many simply cannot get hold of them. Masks, alcoholic sanitisers, disinfectants and even toilet rolls and rice have become prized commodities in Hong Kong for days amid the coronavirus outbreak. Even public hospitals are running out of masks and protective gear, prompting widespread anxiety. The coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 1,350 in China, with one fatality in Hong Kong, while nearly 64,000 people have been infected. Amid the grim atmosphere, 31 percent of men and 32 percent of women say they will stay home this year to avoid infection while 27 percent say they will go out for dinner anyway. Concerts and events across Hong Kong have been cancelled due to the outbreak while many shops and restaurants close early. Chinese health officials have been talking about the impact of the outbreak on frontline health workers, 1,716 of whom have been infected. Six had died as of Tuesday, with the number of infected staff rising, according to the Chinese health commission vice minister, Zeng Yixin, \u201cThe duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great, and the risk of infection is high,\u201d Zeng told a news conference. Chinese officials and hospitals have repeatedly spoken of a shortage of protective equipment, including face masks. Footage earlier this month of government officials in Wuhan appearing to take face masks intended for health workers has fuelled a growing wave of anger over how Chinese authorities have handled the outbreak. Images of medical staff making protective equipment out of rubbish bags, sleeping in hospitals, and crying in frustration and exhaustion have dominated Chinese social media over the last two weeks, inspiring an outpouring of sympathy and donations of supplies. Concern about the impact on Asian financial hubs has been heightened by the news that HSBC and Royal Dutch Shell have been sending staff home in Hong Kong and Singapore after contact with people infected by the coronavirus. HSBC, which employs 21,000 people in Hong Kong, said on Friday that one of its employees has been placed in government quarantine after \u201cclose contact\u201d with relatives diagnosed with the coronavirus. The bank is also making contact with staff who may have recently come in close contact with the person and will advise them to observe 14-day self-care at home, according to the Straits Times, which referred to a memo confirmed by a Hong Kong-based spokesman. \u201cAll employees have been reminded to be mindful of hygiene procedures and to stay at home or see a doctor if they feel unwell in any way,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cHSBC will continue to closely monitor the development of case and stay in close contact with health authorities.\u201d A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Chinese authorities expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to limit its spread, reports Lily Kuo is the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief Casualties from coronavirus reached nearly 1,400, with more than 5,000 new cases reported on Friday, dampening optimism that the virus will soon be contained. At a meeting of senior leaders in Beijing leading the government\u2019s response to the crisis, officials called for other areas to \u201cadopt quarantine and rescue measures equal to that of Wuhan\u201d, which has been under lockdown for more than two weeks, including centralising and quarantining patients. The meeting, held on Thursday and chaired by premier Li Keqiang called on Wuhan to \u201cspeed up\u201d classifying and quarantining residents suspected or confirmed of contracting the virus. It came as a top White House official called on Beijing to be more open. The first group of French nationals repatriated from China due to the coronavirus outbreak returned to the outside world today after two weeks in quarantine, Reuters reports. None of the 181 involved - who had been flown home from Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic - tested positive for the virus, local health officials said. \u201cThere have been no problems ...but people are happy that it\u2019s over,\u201d Marc Zyltman, Red Cross head at the southern holiday resort of Carry-Le-Rouet where they were quarantined, told reporters. A further 157 people remain in quarantine in southern France, of whom 122 will be allowed home on Feb. 16 and the remainder on Febuary 23. France has recorded 11 cases of the virus, out of a global total of 63,851, of whom the vast majority are in China. The epidemic has killed close to 1,400 people. China\u2019s public broadcasting network, CCTV, has been showing images of what it reports is \u201cthe third batch\u201d of 35 patients transferred to the Leishenshan (Thunder God Mountain) Hospital in Wuhan, one of two new hospitals built over the course of a few weeks as the official face of the country\u2019s struggle against coronavirus. Four days after its opening, this week the larger Leishenshan hospital had only 90 patients, on wards designed for 1,600, but was reporting no spare beds, Wuhan city health data, first reported by the Chinese magazine Caixin, showed. The other facility, Huoshenshan, had not yet filled its 1,000 beds a week after opening. This is Ben Quinn (@BenQuinn75) picking up the blog now in London. Reuters reports that 1,716 health workers have been infected by the coronavirus and six of them have died, as of Tuesday. China National Health Commission Vice Minister Zeng Yixin said on Friday that, at a press conference about protecting medical workers, said the number of infected medical staff is increasing. Chinese officials and hospitals have repeatedly noted a shortage of protective equipment, including face masks, as the disease took hold in Hubei and spread throughout the country. Lily Kuo has the latest from China, where wartime measures are being expanded to more cities, as a US official has questioned whether Beijing is being transparent over the outbreak. Read the full story here: So far today: The total death toll in mainland China rose to 1,380 \u2013 after 121 new deaths were recorded on Thursday, but also after 108 deaths were removed due to supposed double-counting. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China rose to 63,851, a rise of 5,090 new cases. A cruise ship, docked in Sydney, has been given the all clear after a person tested negative for the virus. Earlier, media reports erroneously claimed the ship was in lockdown. In Cambodia, the more than 2000 passengers and crew of the Westerdam cruise ship finally disembarked, after 20 of its passengers were tested and cleared of the virus. The ship had been refused entry to five different countries. A 78-year old man and an 18-month old toddler are still among the Australian citizens still stranded in Wuhan. Japan recorded its first death from the new coronavirus, which is the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. It was confirmed that yesterday\u2019s large spike in recorded deaths and cases was due to China changing the methodology of confirming cases, and broadening the definition. An explanation here for shifting numbers. China\u2019s National Health Commission has said it removed 108 deaths from its national total because it made a statistical error, according to Agence France-Presse. On Friday, Hubei\u2019s health commission said an extra 116 people had died in the province overnight, and more than 4,800 new cases were reported. However, it also removed 108 deaths from the running total, saying they had been double counted. That leaves the total number of deaths so far, in mainland China, at 1,380. Three people have died outside of China: in Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines. The number of cases and deaths was also revised upwards yesterday, when China announced it was changing its methodology for registering Covid-19 cases. Previously, the government was only counting cases that had been confirmed in a laboratory as the new coronavirus. Yesterday, they changed that to cases where a doctor observed a chest infection on a CT scan. This led to a jump of 13,300 extra cases, which go back retrospectively days or weeks. 254 new deaths were also added. Michael Ryan, the head of World Health Organisation\u2019s health emergencies programme, said this \u201cdoes not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak\u201d \u2013 because it was retrospective. Meanwhile, Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council, said he was \u201cdisappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese\u201d. Reports here of lockdowns and quarantine measures that have begun to start in Shanghai. In broader medical news, generic drugmakers from India may face shortages and price hikes due to the knock-on effect of the Covid-19 outbreak, analysts say. Indian companies procure almost 70% of their active pharmaceutical ingredients from China, Reuters report. \u201cWe are comfortably placed with eight to 10 weeks of key inventory in place,\u201d said Debabrata Chakravorty, head of global sourcing and supply chain for Lupin Ltd, adding that the company does have some local suppliers for ingredients. An extended outbreak that limits the volume of active ingredients and drugs available for export from China could lead to drug shortages and price increases, particularly in the United States - where prices are subject to market forces - according to rating agency Moody\u2019s. India supplies nearly a third of medicines sold in the United States. Daara Patel, secretary general of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association, which represents over 900 drug producers, said he expects supplies to be disrupted from April. Patel said vitamins and antibiotics are likely to be among the hardest hit as India is a major global producer of both. Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance trade group, said there are no API shortages at the moment because drugmakers had stocked up on inventory ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in China, which was later extended to contain the virus. A person has been tested for the new coronavirus on a cruise ship moored in Sydney and does not have the virus, NSW Health have confirmed. Earlier this morning, media reports in other outlets incorrectly said a man had a confirmed case on board the Norwegian Jewel, which had sailed from New Zealand. NSW Health had said earlier that \u201cnone [of the passengers] had been in China in the previous 14 days and there was no outbreak of any disease on board\u201d. Three people were transferred to hospital from the cruise ship, but this was not due to Covid-19, and were in fact \u201cpre-booked by the cruise ship\u201d But NSW Health said they did test one person, but this was \u201ca precaution and \u201cthere is no indication that the person is at particular risk of Covid-19.\u201d \u201cThere is no concern for other passengers or people in and around Circular Quay,\u201d they said. Ketchup and cola factories are partially closing across China, as confirmed by the Kraft Heinz company and PepsiCo. Pepsi has closed one of its six Chinese factories ever since the Chinese New Year, but it is expected to open again soon, Bloomberg reports. But both companies say disruption will be minimal, and Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said only 2% of its sales came from China. Some odd scenes in Sihanoukville in Cambodia today, as 1,455 passengers and 802 crew were finally allowed to disembark from the Westerdam cruise ship. The ship had been refused port by five countries over Covid-19 fears, but tests by Cambodian doctors said no passengers had the new virus. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen greeted the passengers with roses as they left the ship. Anna Marie Melon, from Queensland, said that Hun Sen had \u201ca wonderful heart\u201d as he handed a rose to her. \u201cCambodia alone, even the United States, Guam, did not let us land, but Cambodia did, so thats wonderful,\u201d said American Joe Spaziani to Associated Press. \u201cWe appreciate it very very much. Its been a long struggle and we appreciate everyone being here.\u201d Domestically, Hun Sen has been criticised for arresting political opponents, and was described a \u201cfully fledged military dictator\u201d by Human Rights Watch. The former Khmer Rouge member has been in power for 35 years, making him the world\u2019s longest-serving prime minister. And here\u2019s some much needed explanation on why the figures and death toll have changed so rapidly recently. The big spike in confirmed cases and deaths yesterday was the result of the Chinese government changing the way it classifies new cases. Previously, the government was only counting cases that had been confirmed in a laboratory as the new coronavirus. Yesterday, they changed that to cases where a doctor observed a chest infection on a CT scan. This led to a jump of 13,300 extra cases, which go back retrospectively days or weeks. 254 new deaths were also recorded. Japan has vowed to step up testing and containment of Covid-19 after the country recorded its first death, Reuters report. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s health ministry confirmed a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, just to the west of Tokyo, had died. \u201cWe will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread of the illness,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up new measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves. But chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Sugaand health minister Katsunobu Kato said there was no evidence the new coronavirus, was spreading widely in Japan. The latest national government figures are in \u2013 there have been a total of 1,380 deaths in mainland China since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. This comes after 116 new deaths were recorded just in the Hubei province. That is a drop in the rate of new deaths and new cases, compared to yesterday. There are now a total of 55,748 confirmed cases across mainland China. Figures on the unofficial Tencent tracker are still higher than these government figures, by about 100 deaths. And more on cruises, Royal Caribbean \u2013 whose ships have not yet been hit by either a Covid-19 case or Covid-19 scare \u2013 is still cancelling 18 of its cruises. As reported by Bloomberg News, this will reduce its earnings by 65 US cents a share this year. Today so far: 116 new deaths, and 4,823 new cases were confirmed in Hubei \u2013 which is a drop in the rate of new deaths and cases. Japan recorded its first death, only the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. In Cambodia, the Westerdam cruise ship has been cleared of coronavirus cases by the Cambodian health ministry. 20 tests came back negative, the cruise operator said. Passengers have now started disembarking. In Sydney, NSW Health said there was no confirmed coronavirus, and no \u201coutbreak of disease\u201d on a cruise ship docked in Sydney harbour. One person is being tested for the disease as a precaution, but they had not been in China over the past 14 days. China\u2019s chicken shipments have been diverted to other countries, due to a lack of freezer space at its ports, as lockdowns lead to lower food consumption. An elderly Australian man, from Perth, has reportedly tested positive for the new coronavirus while on another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, which has multiple confirmed cases \u2013 unlike the Westerdam and the Norwegian Jewel. His daughter told ABC radio that her father, Val, had tested positive and would be taken to hospital in Japan. The woman, Marcelly, did not give her surname to the ABC. Passengers from the Westerdam \u2013 the cruise ship denied entry to five countries \u2013 have begun disembarking in Cambodia after tests for coronavirus came back negative. China\u2019s incoming chicken shipments have also been disrupted, according to Reuters This is due to consumption slowing down due to so many cities under lock down. As a result, freezer space is running out in China\u2019s ports. Reuters report: \u201cShips carrying refrigerated cargo containers of chicken from the United States to China are being diverted to ports in Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a U.S. poultry export trade group. \u201cChinese ports have run out of space for refrigerated containers, Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council, told Reuters on Thursday. \u201cFrozen and refrigerated product is starting to spoil because of the lack of available power, a manager for a Los Angeles port terminal operator said.\u201d Speaking of, researchers from East Anglia University in the UK say that misinformation and conspiracy theories about on coronavirus could cost lives \u2013 because people stop following actual health advice. Further statement from Norwegian Cruise Line: \u201cDuring Norwegian Jewel\u2019s sailing from Auckland to Sydney, a few guests on board experienced a stomach-related illness. To mitigate any impact of this rare occurrence, we implemented stringent sanitation procedures. \u201cThere are various false inflammatory media reports regarding the ship...The vessel remains in operation, and all guests onboard are in good health.\u201d The official NSW Health statement is in, on the conflicting reports around a cruse ship docked in Sydney, the Norwegian Jewel. \u201cNone [of the passengers] had been in China in the previous 14 days and there was no outbreak of any disease on board,\u201d NSW Health said. \u201cThere were 3 routine medical transfers, none related to respiratory illness.\u201d However, \u201cone person has been tested for respiratory illness on board with results expected this afternoon\u201d. But NSW Health say this was \u201ca precaution and \u201cthere is no indication that the person is at particular risk of Covid-19.\u201d \u201cAt this point there is no concern for other passengers or people in and around Circular Quay.\u201d Earlier, the operator of the ship said media reports about coronavirus on board were false. \u201cThis morning there were various false media reports related to an illness on board our ship,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this. The vessel remains in operation, and all guests onboard are in good health.\u201d The Norwegian Jewel, registered in the Bahamas, is a 15-year-old cruise ship with a capacity of nearly 2,400 passengers. It departed from Dunedin four days ago, having been sailing between ports in New Zealand. In other cruise ship news, the Westerdam \u2013 which has been turned away from five different countries over coronavirus fears \u2013 has said that 20 of its passengers have been tested and do not have the new virus. The ship has always maintained that it has no sick passengers, but was it was refused entry by multiple countries because it had been in Hong Kong two weeks ago. It was eventually allowed to dock in Cambodia. Just now, the cruise operator, Holland America Line announced: \u201c20 samples taken onboard Westerdam have all been confirmed as negative for coronavirus by the Pasteur Laboratory in Phnom Penh\u201d. \u201cAs stated in previous communications, there were never any suspected cases of coronavirus on board.\u201d The ship has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, and Cambodian authorities have given the ship permission to disembark its passengers. \u201cWe sincerely thank all those in Cambodia who have demonstrated a willingness to welcome us with an open mind and make decisions based on facts,\u201d Stein Kruse, the CEO of Holland American Line said. \u201cThis has all been a terrible and unfortunate misunderstanding that has impacted 2,257 people on board and hundreds of others shoreside,\u201d he said. A 78-year old, former Royal Australian Air Force engineer is the latest Australian to be confirmed as still stranded in the Wuhan, as reported exclusively by myself and my colleague Ben Doherty. This comes after we revealed that an 18-month old toddler, also an Australian citizen, was still in the Hubei province, under lockdown, and had not been given a place on one of the Australian evacuation flights. The flights were supposed to prioritise the elderly, the young and the \u201cisolated and vulnerable\u201d. Now Garry Ridder has spoken to us as well, saying that when he asked if 78 qualified as old, he got \u201cno response but a quiet chuckle.\u201d Earlier, other stranded Australians said the priority process was unclear, and they felt they were being \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d. Desmond Lim, whose wife is still trapped in Wuhan, said he felt like they were being punished for following the process. \u201cThe mantra of most army units in the world is \u2018Leave no one behind\u2019,\u201d Ridder told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis is obviously not in the Australian government\u2019s playbook.\u201d The US state department has issued a statement saying it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about North Korea\u2019s vulnerability to the new coronavirus. \u201cThe US is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak...The US is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organisations\u201d. If you\u2019re struggling to keep up with the news on coronavirus, the fabulous team at Full Story (Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast) has made a podcast that traces the outbreak and reviews the public health response, both in China and Australia. You can listen here: At the very end you can also hear some snippets of my interview with Moko Yong, a photographer from Melbourne who is still trapped in Wuhan, along with many other Australians. That latest figures out of China show that there has been a drop in the number of new deaths and new infections, but the toll does continue to rise. There have been 116 new deaths, and 4,823 new cases in the Hubei province, where the virus first emerged. That is a total of 51,986 cases in the province, according to Reuters. However, this is a smaller increase than yesterday, when there was a dramatic 240 new deaths and nearly 15,000 new cases. The operators of a Norwegian cruise ship docked in Sydney Harbour say there\u2019s \u201cno truth\u201d to reports of a potential coronavirus case amongst its passengers. Norwegian Cruise Line, operators of the Norwegian Jewel, said the vessel remained in operation and all the passengers were healthy. \u201cThis morning there were various false media reports related to an illness on board our ship,\u201d a Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman said in a statement to AAP on Friday. \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this. The vessel remains in operation, and all guests onboard are in good health.\u201d NSW Health told AAP on Friday that while no passengers of the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship had visited mainland China in the past 14 days they were being screened for the illness for precautionary reasons. A passenger on board a cruise ship that docked in Sydney harbour Friday morning has reportedly been taken for testing for a possible case of novel coronavirus. The Singaporean national fell ill with a respiratory illness and was taken from the Norwegian Jewel shortly after it docked at the international passenger terminal at Circular Quay at 6am this morning. The man is being tested as a precaution. He has not yet been confirmed as having the virus. Other passengers have been allowed to disembark from the ship, after earlier being kept on board as a precaution. The Norwegian Jewel, registered in the Bahamas, is a 15-year-old cruise ship with a capacity of nearly 2,400 passengers. It departed from Dunedin four days ago, having been sailing between ports in New Zealand. The cruise ship operator has been contacted for comment. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the latest coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. These are the top developments: A surge in recorded cases in China\u2019s Hubei province is caused by a new reporting method, not an increase in the severity or mortality of the disease. Japan recorded its first death, only the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. Meanwhile, Singapore recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with eight new infected patients. The first British coronavirus evacuees flown back to the UK from Wuhan, China, have left quarantine, shouting \u201cwe\u2019re free\u201d and thanking staff for their compassion \u201cin our time of turmoil\u201d. A Wuhan evacuee became the 15th coronavirus case in the US. Oil demand is set to fall year on year in the first quarter for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. The WHO chief has said the outbreak could still go in \u201cany direction\u201d. You can get in touch with me on naaman.zhou@theguardian.com or on Twitter @naamanzhou",

She portrayed the producer of such Oscar-winning favourites as Pulp Fiction and The King\u2019s Speech as a callous man who showed a \u201cwanton lack of human empathy\u201d towards the six women who have testified against him. Mimicking the defendant, the prosecutor said: \u201cThe universe is run by me and they don\u2019t get to complain when they get stepped on, spat on, demoralised and yes raped and abused by me \u2013 the king.\u201d Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women but in court he faces five counts: two of rape alleged to have occurred against an aspiring actor in 2013, one that he forced oral sex on a then Project Runway producer, Miriam Haley, in 2006, and two of predatory sexual assault that claim a pattern of attacks on multiple victims. He has denied all claims of non-consensual sex. The charges relate to two central accusers: the woman who alleges she was raped, who the Guardian is not naming as she has not indicated that she wishes to be publicly identified, and Haley. Four other women \u2013 the Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young \u2013 also testified. Illuzzi-Orbon repeatedly returned to the vast imbalance of power between Weinstein, \u201cthe master of his universe\u201d, and alleged victims she characterised as \u201cants he could step on without consequences\u201d. She kept referring to one phrase, like a mantra: \u201cHarvey Weinstein everything, witness nothing.\u201d Weinstein was worried from the beginning about Sciorra, who was already a movie star by the time he allegedly raped her in her Manhattan apartment in the winter of 1993-94, Illuzzi-Orbon said. \u201cAnnabella is in his industry, she\u2019s having dinner and talking to Uma Thurman who dates Gary Oldman.\u201d But the remaining five accusers, she said, were nobodies. \u201cThey were never in his world, they were never going to be strong enough, bold enough or brave enough to tell.\u201d To make sure his crimes were not exposed, the prosecutor said, Weinstein humiliated the women. \u201cStupid and belittled people do not complain, they don\u2019t stick up for themselves and they sure as hell don\u2019t complain about their shame in a public place like a courtroom.\u201d He kept them isolated, Illuzzi-Orbon said, convincing them they were the only ones going through the alleged abuse. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the only one and he\u2019s a giant not only in his own industry but he\u2019s someone who gets presidents on the phone, you know what, you do not report and you do not go to the police.\u201d And, the prosecutor said, he cowed them with his anger.

On Thursday, lead Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno portrayed the six accusers as the manipulators in the case, recasting the movie mogul as their victim. Rotunno produced a welter of emails and text messages between the witnesses and the movie producer that for some went on for years. \u201cMiss you big guy,\u201d the accuser who alleges rape wrote to Weinstein six months later. \u201cNot words you say to your rapist,\u201d Rotunno told the jury. The rape charges relating to the unnamed aspiring actor have been a particular target of Weinstein\u2019s defence team. Rotunno gave the witness such a grilling over nine hours of cross-examination that the woman collapsed into a panic attack. Illuzzi-Orbon was at her most impassioned when she rebutted defence criticisms of the accusers. She ridiculed the suggestion Sciorra had come forward as a way of reviving her career. \u201cHow marketable do you think it makes her to come here in this courtroom in front of the entire world and admit to having been in such pain?\u201d the prosecutor asked. \u201cHow good is it for a movie star that [after the alleged rape] she cut herself and then dabbed the blood with tissue, smearing it on the wall?\u201d As for the anonymous rape accuser, Illuzzi-Orbon said, she was not in a loving consensual relationship with Weinstein, as Rotunno claimed. \u201cWhere are the gifts, where the jewellery, where the vacations, where the cars, where are all those things \u2013 they don\u2019t exist.

That made me think that athletics was something I could go into \u2013 and the following year I won the English schools championships.\u201d What kind of cross-country runner was she? \u201cI did it for a couple of years \u2013 I think I made it to Anglians but I never made it to English schools,\u201d she admits. \u201cI hated every second!\u201d Luckily life in the fast lane has proved much more to Hunt\u2019s liking.",

The first game in the series wasn\u2019t just a classic cliffhanger \u2013 it has teed up the remaining two by giving the underdog the lead. South Africa\u2019s inexperienced side should never have been able to restrict England to five runs off the last seven balls when there were five wickets in hand, but they managed it by taking four of those wickets, with Lungi Ngidi\u2019s offcutter proving to be the lethal weapon. </p> <p>South Africa, though, have been 1-0 up twice against England this season, and they lost one of those series and drew the other. England should still have the wit and firepower to win this one, but they can\u2019t afford to make mistakes now, and they made plenty in East London - starting with the decision to drop Dawid Malan, whose T20i record is unreal, for Joe Denly. </p> <p>It looked very much like a punishment for not running a bye off the last ball after Malan had made a barnstorming hundred <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19297/scorecard/1187668/new-zealand-vs-england-4th-t20i-england-in-new-zealand-2019-20\">in Napier</a>. Without anyone taking much notice, England may just have applied the most surprising penalty since Geoff Boycott was dropped for making a double hundred too slowly in 1967. It\u2019s fair enough for Eoin Morgan to be <a href=\"https://www.wisden.com/stories/international-cricket/morgan-criticises-malans-failure-attempt-last-ball-bye\">angry with Malan</a>, but having agreed to keep him in the squad, he should surely be picking him. </p> <p>The only problem it will cause is an embarrassment of top-order batsmen. In Tests, England have an overcrowded middle order, but in T20s, they have too many players who are at their best in the top three \u2013 Roy, Bairstow, Buttler, Malan and Moeen, who is lethal in the PowerPlay for Worcestershire, yet often adrift at the death for England.</p> <p>Today\u2019s game is at Kingsmead in Durban, where the one-dayer was washed out a week ago, but the forecast is good apart from a large helping of humidity. Play starts at 6pm local time, 4pm in the UK, so join me 25 minutes before that for the toss and teams. Malan, for one, will be on tenterhooks.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T15:11:07.826Z\">at 3.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cSounds like an incredibly wonderful game,\u201d says Peter Barrett. It was. \u201cSorry I\u2019m not there instead of being here in a horrible wet England.\u201d Peter, I know how you feel. Now I need to get off the telly, because my wife wants to watch Wolves v Leicester, and this game, fabulous as it was, went on longer than it was supposed to. Thanks for your excellent company as ever. I dedicate this OBO to Winnie Mae Collins, born this morning (16:01), without whom I wouldn\u2019t have got to write about a thriller. Barney Ronay\u2019s match report will be along soon and never mind reading, it will be well worth framing. Do join me on Sunday, 12.30pm in the UK, 2.30pm local time, for the final episode of this superb whowunnit. Cometh the hour, cometh Simon McMahon. \u201cEvening Tim. I know people who think cricket is boring. I genuinely feel sorry for them.\" So you have to hand it to Rashid, for the clear thinking and the safe hands, and to Tom Curran, for being bold enough to serve up a slower ball out of the back of the hand under the utmost pressure. This may be the greatest T20i series of all time. We\u2019ve had South Africa winning by one run, and England by two, as the bowling side held their nerve magnificently. The umpires seem to be checking whether Rashid was inside the circle when the ball was bowled. He may have anticipated the lap and gone too early. Fortuin laps, Rashid catches it! What a game. 19.5 overs: South Africa 202-6 (van der Dussen 43, Fortuin 0) Out comes Bjorn Fortuin, who has never batted in a T20 international. Baptism of fire. And it is, just \u2013 umpire\u2019s call. So SA will need three off the last ball. Well done Tom Curran. Curran bounces back! With a killer yorker. SA are reviewing... 19.4 overs: South Africa 202-5 (van der Dussen 43, Pretorius 25) Not out! SA need three off two, just like England the other night. And they blew it... 19.4 overs: South Africa 202-5 (van der Dussen 43, Pretorius 25) A squirt for two, a throw from Strokes, a smart take from Buttler, a dive from Pretorius which will make a great photo tomorrow... Gone upstairs, but it doesn\u2019t look out. 19.3 overs: South Africa 200-5 (van der Dussen 43, Pretorius 23) And now a four through extra cover. SA are cruising! 19.2 overs: South Africa 196-5 (van der Dussen 43, Pretorius 19) It\u2019s a six! This time the slower ball deceives no one. Nine nneeded off four balls. 19.1 overs: South Africa 190-5 (van der Dussen 43, Pretorius 13) A dot! Curran\u2019s slower ball deceives Pretorius. 19th over: South Africa 190-5 (van der Dussen 43, Pretorius 13) Jordan again, getting a hand on a straight thump from Pretorius to save three runs. Then van der D chips, precariously, but gets away with it as the ball drops into no-man\u2019s-land. A scampered two from Pretorius, as SA seem to be seeing Jordan off. They need 22 off nine balls. A miscue brings two more: 20 needed off eight, just feasible. And Pretorius finds the boundary, with an edge! Where\u2019s that slip we asked for? A single off the last ball, so SA need 15 off the last over. It\u2019s beautifully, hideously, poised. 18th over: South Africa 179-5 (van der Dussen 42, Pretorius 3) Mark Wood is back, and van der Dussen gets under a would-be yorker and slugs it for a straight six. But SA still need 37 off 15, then 36 off 15 as Wood goes wide on the crease and also wide at the other end, down the leg side. A straighter ball, and van der D flicks it for six more. Out of the ground! And then he drives, almost classically, for four. He found that phone box. 17th over: South Africa 160-5 (van der Dussen 25, Pretorius 2) Morgan turned to his death star, Jordan, and he delivered \u2013 two wickets in the over, and only five runs, so SA need 45 off three overs, which should be beyond them. Here\u2019s an interesting email, from someone who has aleready appeared on this page (17:52), but as a non-speaking character. \u201cAs the permanently outraged other half of Grace Pickering,\u201d says Mark Dean, \u201cmy response to Greg MacGregor is that I\u2019d be happy with some newfangled online thing, I just want a proper 2 hour highlights program, not some collection of 1 minute long clips which is all the ECB seem to offer. Though surely the ECB threw away a fortune by failing to cater to everyone in Britain desperately searching for a Christmas present for their aging, cricket obsessed, streaming averse, DVD loving parents?\u201d Another one! Also a yorker, so poor old Phehlukwayo first ball, and Jordan has two-in-two for the second time this week. Smuts is bowled round his legs by a middle-stump yorker. He faced 12 balls, and only got hold of one of them. 16th over: South Africa 155-3 (van der Dussen 24, Smuts 12) Morgan turns back to Tom Curran, who starts with a wide outside off, more grist for I Wilson\u2019s mill (12th over). A length ball, more accurate, gets hit for six by Smuts, whose name captures the way he treats the ball \u2013 he definitely smutted that one. Curran fights back with a loopy slower ball, for none, a yorker for one, a slower ball for one, an even slower ball for none, and another yorker for one. So an over that began horribly turns out almost respectable. \u201cWonderful skills,\u201d says Shaun Pollock, who knows all about seam bowling. 15th over: South Africa 145-3 (van der Dussen 23, Smuts 4) At last van der Dussen finds his range, driving Stokes back for a straight four that is like the MCC coaching book on speed. Next ball, he top-edges a pull, which lands short of Rashid at fine leg as fortune favours the bold. Further emboldened, van der Dussen whips a six. That\u2019s more like it. SA need 60 off 30 balls: game back on. 14th over: South Africa 130-3 (van der Dussen 10, Smuts 3) South Africa are still trying to get them in singles, which may not be the best plan. Jordan\u2019s over of all sorts goes for 1, 1, 1, 1, dot, 1, which is worth a maiden in most matches. SA need 74 off 36, and above all they need boundaries. Where have all the sixes gone? 13th over: South Africa 126-3 (van der Dussen 8, Smuts 1) Stokes\u2019s first over goes dot, dot, wicket, 1, 1, 1, and suddenly the rate required is above 11. SA need 79 off 42 balls, and van der Dussen is going to have to find a phone box to get changed in. Stokes comes on, builds pressure with a string of, er, two dots, and cashes in as Miller clonks a low full toss to long-on. The man most likely to see SA home has gone, and this game is now beautifully balanced. 12th over: South Africa 123-2 (Miller 21, van der Dussen 6) Only six off the over from Wood, who has been immense. As well as taking wickets, England need to give the strike to van der Dussen, who has six off eight balls, rather than six off one like most people today. Here\u2019s an interesting line on England\u2019s selection. \u201cI think England should consider Anderson and Broad for the T20 World Cup,\u201d says I Wilson, \u201cbecause these pace bowlers are throwing the game away, no control whatsoever.\u201d Not Wood, but perhaps that was written before he came on. 11th over: South Africa 117-2 (Miller 19, van der Dussen 2) On this slightly sticky wicket, spin ought to be just the thing, but Moeen went for 36 off three overs and his mate Rash isn\u2019t faring much better \u2013 Miller, taking up where de Kock left off, wellies it for two more sixes. Rashid does well to concede only two off the last three balls, but England have to take wickets, or the series has gone. Get a slip in! 10th over: South Africa 103-2 (Miller 6, van der Dussen 1) So Wood takes another wicket, concedes only two off the over, and has the scalps of both openers, which are worth a five-for on a normal day. Wood has another one! He bowls a cross-seam bouncer, at a useful 148 kph, and Bavuma can only feather his hook to the keeper. That probably makes England favourites again, even though SA are ahead of the rate. 9th over: South Africa 101-1 (Bavuma 27, Miller 5) Better from Rashid, who celebrates the demise of de Kock by going for only nine off the over. David Miller has been shrewdly promoted, presumably by Mark Boucher, and he gets going with a whip for four. 8th over: South Africa 92-1 (Bavuma 27, Miller 0) Mark Wood comes on and guess what? His first ball is clubbed for six by de Kock. It was nearly a catch for Ben Stokes, who flew along the boundary, missed the ball and did very well to miss a small ball boy. The ball boys, wisely, are wearing helmets. This game is ridiculous, but also sublime. de Kock thumps a four, tries for another six \u2013 and is caught by Stokes this time, right on the rope. So de Kock\u2019s 65 came off 22 balls, which means his strike rate was a bit sluggish compared to Moeen\u2019s \u2013 295 as against 354. But de Kock stayed in for twice as long. Verdict: they were both amazing. Given out, very narrowly. That\u2019s the end of the innings of the day, which is saying something. de Kock is caught by Stokes off a Wood full toss, which is now being tested for possibly being too high... 7th over: South Africa 80-0 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 54) When even Rashid goes for 11 off an over, you know England are in trouble. But at least it was a dot. Up goes the finger, but Bavuma, who was sweeping, is convinced this has hit his glove, so he reviews. Adil Rashid comes on, de Kock pulls him into the stand, and that\u2019s the fastest fifty ever by a South African batsman. He has 53 off 17 balls, and if England don\u2019t get rid of him soon, this isn\u2019t even going to be close. 6th over: South Africa 69-0 (Bavuma 24, de Kock 45) Tom Curran is back for an early second spell, but the carnage continues He dishes up a full toss and de Kock flips it into the stand at square leg. A length ball, same result, and de Kock has 45 off 15 balls, six of which have gone for six. Anything Mo can do, he can do for slightly longer. Here\u2019s an alternative view of the great DVD rumpus. \u201cIsn\u2019t the location of the Wold Cup DVD,\u201d says Greg MacGregor, \u201csomewhere between the mid 90s and about 2010?\u201d 5th over: South Africa 53-0 (Bavuma 22, de Kock 31) Now de Kock plays a trick on Moeen, shaping to go down the track, then rocking back and hitting a long hop out of the ground. And de Kock follows up with a flat six, off the very bottom of the bat, that just clears the rope at square leg, and another six, down the ground. Mo is getting a taste of his own medicine, de Kock has 31 off 11, and South Africa are up with the rate required. More on the strange case of the missing DVD (17:52), from Max Harrison. \u201cAs someone who wasn\u2019t in England when the World Cup was on and who missed the C4 coverage of it because by the time I got back to England C4 had removed it, I entirely concur. I even emailed C4 about the matter three months ago regarding the strangely absent DVD but there\u2019s been no reply. I thought there might have been a Christmas release of it. Instead, nothing. \u201cWhat do I have instead? Ah yes, about 8 minutes of iffy highlights on YouTube.\u201d 4th over: South Africa 33-0 (Bavuma 21, de Kock 12) Chris Jordan comes on and drops a catch, for once in his life. Bavuma blasts it back at Jordan\u2019s left hand and he can\u2019t cling on. Ten off the over, with de Kock again finding the rope at backward square. \u201cThe reason for no CWC 2019 DVD,\u201d says Bunny Corcoran, \u201cis that it was too dull and there were insufficient highlights.\u201d Of course. 3rd over: South Africa 23-0 (Bavuma 18, de Kock 5) Bavuma, facing Moeen, chips again, but this time Stokes chases the ball down like a demon, and de Kock joins in the fun with the last ball, playing a slog-lap for four. SA are ahead at this stage, as England had only 18-1. The person on the PA celebrates by playing Bohemian Rhapsody, for some reason. 2nd over: South Africa 12-0 (Bavuma 12, de Kock 0) Morgan, like de Kock, adheres to the international convention whereby you don\u2019t open with two spinners, so it\u2019s Tom Curran. He lets Bavuma chip a slower ball for four, but otherwise does OK. If South Africa are going to compete here, the openers may have to get most of the runs. 1st over: South Africa 5-0 (Bavuma 5, de Kock 0) Moeen begins with two dots, which is two more than there were in his innings. Then Bavuma improvises, lofting a cut over backward point, before Mo tucks up de Kock with two more dots. Here is Moeen\u2019s innings in full, in case you don\u2019t believe it was that good. It went 1, 6, 1, 1, 3 wides, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, out \u2013 so the only ball he didn\u2019t score off, until the last, was the bouncer that went over his head for three wides. That first single, by the way, nearly led to a run-out. And now Mo\u2019s about to open the bowling. That was fabulous entertainment, and there will be more to come if South Africa can take this game to the wire. Victory, if they secure it, will be a famous one. One person isn\u2019t happy, though. \u201cI\u2019m writing for nothing really related to today\u2019s match,\u201d says Grace Pickering, \u201cbut because my other half is in a seemingly permanent state of outrage that there is no official DVD of the 2019 World Cup. Where is the DVD? Where is the outrage about the lack of DVD? WHY, TIM, WHY?\u201d It sounds like a fair cop. Does anyone know the answer? 20th over: England 204-7 (Stokes 47, T Curran 0) Stokes, who seems to have been batting for several days, launches Ngidi for an enormous six and is well caught by the gentleman in the second tier, one-handed. And then he adds two twos, the second of them leg byes, to round off a towering total. So England, who flirted with disaster twice in that innings, go to the break as favourites, thanks to sizzling cameos from Bairstow and Moeen and a steady performance from the leading man, Stokes, who made his highest score in T20 internationals. See you in a few minutes. There have been a few near-misses in the deep, and now Bavuma holds a screamer at long-off, diving, rolling, clinging on and raising the finger himself, as well he may. 19th over: England 189-6 (Stokes 34, Jordan 7) Chris Jordan comes to the party, smelling the slower ball from Phehlukwayo and smashing it for yet another six. 18th over: England 176-6 (Stokes 28, Jordan 0) Before he floated away again, Moeen had treated us to six, four, four \u2013 with a lofted slice, a lofted glance and a cover drive. The slice was the best thing since the invention of the ramp. The partnership with Stokes was 51 off 17 balls, at a strike rate of 300. A phenomenal cameo comes to an end as Moeen chips to the midwicket boundary. He made 39 off 11 balls in what may well have been the most elegant firework display ever seen on a cricket field. 17th over: England 157-5 (Stokes 23, Moeen 25) Desperate times, desperate measures. Stokes tries a ramp, off Hendricks, and only succeeds in getting rapped on the funny bone. A bouncer goes for three wides after being loftily ignored by Moeen, who then chips for six, slaps for four to long-off, and swings another six. That\u2019s Moeen at his sumptuous best: he has 25 from seven balls. 16th over: England 136-5 (Stokes 22, Moeen 8) At least Denly\u2019s demise gives Moeen a chance to shine. He duly lofts his second ball for the most languid six since David Gower retired. Well this is a weird one. A slow long-hop outside leg, which is crying out to be walloped or called wide, hits Denly\u2019s glove and gets deflected onto the stumps. That has to be nemesis for the hubris of playing Denly ahead of Malan. 15th over: England 125-4 (Stokes 19, Denly 0) Things had just been looking up for England as Stokes, seeing the problem, did what he normally does after a few hours \u2013 he went big, launching Pretorius into the second tier of the stand at midwicket. Stokes is such a powerful hitter that it\u2019s odd he doesn\u2019t try it more often: it\u2019s as if he was Freddie Flintoff, operated by Jonathan Trott. Morgan holes out for the second time in 48 hours, chipping Pretorius\u2019s slower ball to long-off. He departs berating himself. 14th over: England 115-3 (Morgan 26, Stokes 11) Stokes finally hits a four \u2013 but only because the man running in from long-on misjudges a tough low chance and misses it altogether. This partnership has yielded just 25 off 27 balls, thin pickings by T20 standards. \u201cConstantly perplexed by England\u2019s selectors always appearing to want to be too clever,\u201d splutters Adam Giles. \u201cSure, Buttler is a destructive batsman, but in Roy and Bairstow you have the most destructive opening partnership in limited overs cricket, and I\u2019m sure Jos would be able to play his explosive style much more liberally coming in at 4 or 5 with 100+ already on the board. We should be playing the players we have in their best positions, rather than all these ridiculous experiments that never pay off. Currently just wasting the ace in the hole, wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Rashid given the gloves and YJB bowling bouncers later on.\u201d 13th over: England 108-3 (Morgan 24, Stokes 6) Pretorius continues, and his military medium is proving impossible to hit \u2013 this over goes 1..111. The man is bowling in binary. 12th over: England 104-3 (Morgan 22, Stokes 4) Rob Key, on commentary, has spotted that the ball is sticking in the pitch, which may explain why 160 tends to be a winning score here. Stokes still can\u2019t get going, so Morgan has to have a dart. He manages it, slog-sweeping Shamsi for six, then cutting for two. 11th over: England 93-3 (Morgan 13, Stokes 2) On comes Dwaine Pretorius, with both third man and fine leg up, so he\u2019ll have to bowl very straight. And he does, conceding only three. Stokes, who prefers to play himself in, takes two comfy singles down the ground, but also misses with a reverse waft. South Africa have grabbed the steering wheel here. 10th over: England 90-3 (Morgan 12, Stokes 0) Shamsi follows up the wicket with three dots to Morgan, so that over was a triumph for South Africa. Ben Stokes is back up to no.5, which may be a grudging admission from England that they messed up by putting Joe Denly there on Wednesday. \u201cAdding to the oeuvre of bad cricket thrillers,\u201d says Brian Withington, \u201chow about: The Buttler Desperandum, The Warne Supremacy, and for Nasser, Funeral in Brisbane?\u201d Another big one! Roy fancies another six but can only hit it straight to David Miller at long-on. England may be throwing that good start away. 9th over: England 88-2 (Roy 39, Morgan 11) Phehlukwayo continues and after all that drama in his first over, this one is a series of ordinary events until Morgan biffs a four over mid-off. 8th over: England 78-2 (Roy 35, Morgan 6) So Eoin Morgan is at the crease again. It only seems about five minutes ago that he was holing out, with uncharacteristic dimness, to start the collapse that did for England in East London. He flirts with danger here too, lofting Shamsi close to the cover sweeper, but then shovels him away for four to long leg to keep up the momentum. 7th over: England 69-2 (Roy 32, Morgan 0) Bairstow clonked Phehlukwayo\u2019s second ball for six down the ground, and mullered his third for six over midwicket. But then an old failing resurfaced. Still, his 35 came off only 17 balls, and got England going by adding 52 with his mate Roy in 4.1 overs flat. That\u2019s a big one. Bairstow, who has just greeted Phehlukwayo with consecutive sixes, misses a straight one, as so often, and loses his off bail. 5th over: England 55-1 (Roy 31, Bairstow 22) Bairstow\u2019s on fire. Facing Hendricks, he lofts the first ball over mid-off and caresses the second past backward point. He races to 22 off 12 and briefly overtakes Roy, who retorts with a tennis shot for none (cross-court smash, since you ask), a flail for six and a Harrow poke for four. And suddenly a bad start has become quite a good one. 5th over: England 38-1 (Roy 21, Bairstow 15) Ngidi again, and Roy plays the shot Buttler was attempting \u2013 a flail through the vacant slips for four. Always good to see a captain pay for not having a slip. Bairstow, still bothered by the run rate, chips, a little unconvincingly, but it still goes for six. Throw in a pull for two and a cut for a single, and that\u2019s 14 off the over. Jonny B making a difference. More baby talk. \u201cFirst and foremost, I would like to extend my congratulations to Mr Collins and his family on being blessed with a new life,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. coming off his full run. \u201cFor it to happen on this date \u2013 a celebration of love \u2013 gives great joy to the soul. Wishing the best of luck to Winnie Mae Collins, whose name also seems to be fitting for a children\u2019s author! \u201cAs for the game at hand, Mr Morgan and his men would love to make a point themselves, with T20s never being their strongest suit. The debate rages on \u2013 should Buttler be opening? Has Malan earned a spot in this side? [Yes!] And who is the designated finisher if the skipper comes out at No4? Hopefully they address a few of these questions batting first today.\u201d 4th over: England 24-1 (Roy 16, Bairstow 6) Fortuin is back, giving us another chance to admire his beard, which is impressively rectangular. He is testing again, but he drops Bairstow when a hard low chance comes his way. realising that England need some boundaries, Bairstow lofts the last ball for four. There\u2019s a hold-up, for reasons I can\u2019t quite fathom. So back to the OBO baby (16:01). \u201cCongratulations to the newly expanded Collins family,\u201d says Tom Atkins. \u201cIn lieu of knitting the new arrival a hat or something, could your readers perhaps welcome her by offering nuggets of advice gained from following OBO cricket over the years? Mine would be this: if you win the toss on a hot sunny morning in Brisbane, for the love of all that is holy do NOT put the opposition in.\u201d Ha. First, Winnie will have to work out which side she\u2019s on \u2013 Adam is an Aussie. 3rd over: England 18-1 (Roy 15, Bairstow 1) The Fortuin experiment, which sounds like a bad thriller, came to an end as de Kock summoned Ngidi, who coolly carried on where he left off the other night by taking a big wicket and conceding only a couple of singles. Great stuff. Gone! The man of the moment, Lungi Ngidi, has done it again, bowling a few dots to build the pressure and then persuading Buttler to nick a cross-seam ball that holds its line outside off. Buttler\u2019s miserable tour continues. 2nd over: England 16-0 (Roy 14, Buttler 2) The new ball is shared by Beuran Hendricks, as de Kock follows the convention that says you can only open with one spinner. Hendricks, aiming at leg stump, nearly has Roy bowled round his legs, but Roy survives and glances for four past short fine leg. Jos Buttler has had only two balls so far, both worked for singles. 1st over: England 9-0 (Roy 8, Buttler 1) Bjorn Fortuin is straight into the action, opening the bowling with his slow left-arm, in a blatant bid to rattle Jason Roy. Fortein starts tidily as Roy takes a couple of sighters \u2013 and then launches a six over long-on. Today\u2019s OBO was going to be brought to you by Adam Collins, but he sent a text this morning containing quite a good excuse: he\u2019s just become a dad. Adam\u2019s other half, Rachel, gave birth this morning \u201cafter a marathon labour\u201d, to Winifred (Winnie), who is \u201c7lbs 3 oz in old money and 51cm long in the new\u201d. \u201cShe is already everything to me,\u201d Adam wrote, \u201chaving arrived a couple of hours ago!\u201d All our congratulations to him and Rachel, and a big welcome to Winnie Mae Collins, who sounds like a great blues singer waiting to happen. SA change a winning team, as their golden oldie Dale Steyn takes a breather and Bjorn Fortuin steps up. England stick with a losing team, so still no Malan, who must be fuming. England 1 Roy, 2 Buttler (wkt), 3 Bairstow, 4 Morgan (capt), 5 Denly, 6 Stokes, 7 Moeen, 8 T Curran, 9 Jordan, 10 Rashid, 11 Wood. South Africa 1 Bavuma, 2 de Kock (capt, wkt), 3 van der Dussen, 4 Smuts, 5 Miller, 6 Pretorius, 7 Phehlukwayo, 8 B Hendricks, 9 Shamsi, 10 Ngidi, 11 Fortuin. Eoin Morgan calls wrong, and Quinton de Kock would rather chase. Afternoon everyone. Well this is mouthwatering. The first game in the series wasn\u2019t just a classic cliffhanger \u2013 it has teed up the remaining two by giving the underdog the lead. South Africa\u2019s inexperienced side should never have been able to restrict England to five runs off the last seven balls when there were five wickets in hand, but they managed it by taking four of those wickets, with Lungi Ngidi\u2019s offcutter proving to be the lethal weapon. South Africa, though, have been 1-0 up twice against England this season, and they lost one of those series and drew the other. England should still have the wit and firepower to win this one, but they can\u2019t afford to make mistakes now, and they made plenty in East London - starting with the decision to drop Dawid Malan, whose T20i record is unreal, for Joe Denly. It looked very much like a punishment for not running a bye off the last ball after Malan had made a barnstorming hundred in Napier. Without anyone taking much notice, England may just have applied the most surprising penalty since Geoff Boycott was dropped for making a double hundred too slowly in 1967. It\u2019s fair enough for Eoin Morgan to be angry with Malan, but having agreed to keep him in the squad, he should surely be picking him. The only problem it will cause is an embarrassment of top-order batsmen. In Tests, England have an overcrowded middle order, but in T20s, they have too many players who are at their best in the top three \u2013 Roy, Bairstow, Buttler, Malan and Moeen, who is lethal in the PowerPlay for Worcestershire, yet often adrift at the death for England. Today\u2019s game is at Kingsmead in Durban, where the one-dayer was washed out a week ago, but the forecast is good apart from a large helping of humidity. Play starts at 6pm local time, 4pm in the UK, so join me 25 minutes before that for the toss and teams. Malan, for one, will be on tenterhooks.",

      "bodyText": "The US attorney general, William Barr, delivered a remarkable public rebuke of Donald Trump on Thursday, saying that the president\u2019s tweets about the Roger Stone case \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and that he would not be \u201cbullied or influenced\u201d over justice department decisions. In an interview with ABC News, the attorney general acknowledged his comments could leave him open to backlash from the president, who is notoriously intolerant of criticism from his aides. But Barr said he was determined to lead the justice department without being influence by outside forces, including the president. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr said. Ignoring Barr\u2019s criticisms, Trump tweeted on Friday morning, denying that he had attempted to interfere in the case but claiming he could have if he wanted to: \u201c\u2018The President has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.\u2019 A.G. Barr [\u2013] This doesn\u2019t mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!\u201d Barr\u2019s interview came as he faces fierce criticism from Democrats over his intervention in the case of Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of Trump who was convicted in November. Barr this week overruled prosecutors who had recommended that Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. The move prompted a crisis of credibility for the US justice system, as top lawyers warned it could undermine the integrity of federal prosecutors, politicize the legal handling of Trump\u2019s friends and enemies, and ultimately threaten democracy itself. The sense of crisis at the justice department continued to build through Friday, as multiple news outlets reported that Barr has appointed an outside prosecutor to look at the criminal case against Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Last month, Flynn asked a judge to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea to charges he lied to the FBI during the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian election collusion, accusing prosecutors of \u201cbad faith, vindictiveness, and breach of the plea agreement\u201d. Flynn\u2019s petition was denied this week. According to NBC News, justice department officials have already intervened to help change Flynn\u2019s sentencing recommendations from a six-month sentence to probation. But the appointment of outside prosecutors to examine cases normally handled by justice department career staff \u2013 in Flynn\u2019s case reportedly US attorney for St Louis, Jeff Jensen \u2013 points to a broader breakdown of normal procedure. The New York Times, which first reported the Flynn development, said that over the past two weeks outside prosecutors have begun grilling Washington-based prosecutors over a number of cases. The move corresponds with another Barr decision to allow outside prosecutors to consider material sourced by Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, on what Trump and his lawyer have claimed points to corrupt activities concerning Joe Biden and his family in Ukraine. The justice department also announced Friday that former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe would not be charged over lying to investigators about a media disclosure. McCabe, who had approved the investigation into alleged links between the 2015 Trump election campaign and Russia-linked operatives, leading to Mueller\u2019s investigation and report, has long been accused of playing partisan politics by the president, who also repeatedly called for McCabe\u2019s prosecution. In his interview with ABC, Barr emphasized that Trump \u201cnever asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d, but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority. Despite Barr insisting he will not be \u201cbullied\u201d by Trump on justice department matters, some commentators were skeptical that Barr was actually trying to distance himself from the president or was working to protect the justice department from interference. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit for the office because I think what he\u2019s done is undertake a campaign to undermine the Department of Justice,\u201d former deputy attorney general Donald Ayer, told MSNBC. Ayer, who preceded Barr as deputy attorney general under George HW Bush, added that Barr\u2019s \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d since becoming attorney general involves \u201cintervening out of usual course to protect Donald Trump\u201d. Former US attorney Preet Bharara tweeted: \u201cI think Bill Barr is shrewd, deliberate, smart, calculating, careful, and full of it.\u201d An Obama-era justice department official, Matthew Miller, wrote on Twitter: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by this one, people. Barr is telling the president that his impulsiveness is making it politically harder for him to deliver the results he wants. If Trump would just shut up, Barr could take care of him much more effectively.\u201d \u201cThe best indicator of future performance is past performance,\u201d wrote the US congresswoman Val Demings, of Florida. \u201cAttorney General Barr\u2019s past performance was to mislead the American people (about the Mueller Report) in order to cover up wrongdoing by the president. Why shouldn\u2019t we believe that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing now?\u201d In his interview with ABC, Barr added that public statements and tweets about the department and its pending cases \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we\u2019re doing our work with integrity\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it\u2019s Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president. I\u2019m gonna do what I think is right. And you know \u2026 I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\u201d The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, responded by saying the president \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by Barr\u2019s comments: \u201c[Barr] has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions. President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country.\u201d The attorney general\u2019s comments come amid an intensifying fallout over the Stone case, after the justice department overruled its own prosecutors who had recommended that Stone, a longtime Trump ally and confidant, be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. The four prosecutors on the case subsequently resigned in protest. The department has insisted the decision to undo the sentencing recommendation was made on Monday night before Trump\u2019s tweet calling the recommended sentence \u201cvery horrible and unfair\u201d. Barr, a Trump loyalist, is also under fire for the reversal, which has drawn fierce condemnation from former justice department figures and leading Democrats who have warned of an \u201cabuse of power\u201d. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, speaking on Fox News, said the president should heed Barr\u2019s advice. \u201cI think the president should listen,\u201d McConnell told the host Bret Baier. \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d Barr is not the only high-profile figure to have criticized Trump this week. On Wednesday, the former White House chief of staff John Kelly spoke out against the treatment of the fired impeachment inquiry witness Alexander Vindman. Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. Agencies contributed reporting",

They\u2019d go out to see live acts like Frenzal Rhomb, Powderfinger, Something for Kate and other 90s Australian bands. \u201cWe were going to lots of all-ages shows because it\u2019s all I could go to,\u201d says Kirsty.</p> <p>But their connection was deeper. They\u2019d both grown up in Campbelltown and didn\u2019t have much money, but they felt like \u201ca different kind of misfit\u201d. Kirsty says: \u201cWe wanted to get out as soon as we could. We found Campbelltown dull. There was no good food to eat and there\u2019s no culture. There\u2019s nothing to do except get drunk in a paddock on a Friday night. It was really not fulfilling to either of us to be living there. We were curious about the world and we were curious about what was beyond living with our parents in the suburbs.\u201d</p> <p>Christian agrees: \u201cWe just didn\u2019t feel like [our siblings or friends].

Then they got married quietly for visa purposes when they moved to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> in October 2016.</p> <p>They were both excited about the opportunities in Japan, but it was a challenging experience, particularly for Kirsty. Often Christian worked long hours in Tokyo, leaving her alone to manage with their daughter. \u201cIt was very isolating for me because I had to leave my career behind, whereas Christian moved there because of work. I had to give up working and become a stay-at-home parent and that was something I had never pictured for myself.

It\u2019s not until [you] live [overseas] that you realise how big and how exciting and how diverse [it is]. They were the things that we always wanted.

      "bodyText": "Names: Kirsty Brown and Christian Moraga Years together: 20 Occupations: Contemporary music specialist and marketing executive There are all sorts of things that draw a couple together: shared interests, shared values, friends or family. And while Kirsty Brown and Christian Moraga have plenty of those, there\u2019s something even stronger. \u201cWe hate the same stuff,\u201d Kirsty says with a great big laugh. \u201cWe like heaps of things in common for sure, but it\u2019s the stuff that we hate, we both hate equally and together.\u201d That stuff includes politics, current affairs, the disheartening Democratic debate in the US where they currently live, and the Oscars. \u201cHe supports me \u2013 I can be like, \u2018Have you seen this shit?\u2019 and just rant about something and I know he\u2019s going to be on the same page as me.\u201d The couple, now in their 30s, met when they were teenagers. They both worked at the Lone Star restaurant in Campbelltown, western Sydney. He was 19, working in the kitchen, while she was 16 and a front-of-house host. Kirsty remembers thinking he was funny, charming and very popular. \u201cThis is the story of his life. He\u2019s good at everything, and everyone likes him. And he\u2019s just that guy. So I did like him. I hadn\u2019t really thought about a relationship with him, but I definitely wanted to make out with him.\u201d Christian remembers feeling the same way: each night the restaurant staff did line dancing to entertain patrons and he remembers Kirsty catching his eye then. Even though there was an age gap, there was plenty of flirting and they bonded over music. They\u2019d go out to see live acts like Frenzal Rhomb, Powderfinger, Something for Kate and other 90s Australian bands. \u201cWe were going to lots of all-ages shows because it\u2019s all I could go to,\u201d says Kirsty. But their connection was deeper. They\u2019d both grown up in Campbelltown and didn\u2019t have much money, but they felt like \u201ca different kind of misfit\u201d. Kirsty says: \u201cWe wanted to get out as soon as we could. We found Campbelltown dull. There was no good food to eat and there\u2019s no culture. There\u2019s nothing to do except get drunk in a paddock on a Friday night. It was really not fulfilling to either of us to be living there. We were curious about the world and we were curious about what was beyond living with our parents in the suburbs.\u201d Christian agrees: \u201cWe just didn\u2019t feel like [our siblings or friends]. They were ready to put their roots into the ground where they were, that\u2019s not what we wanted, so that was very much a thing that we spoke about.\u201d Kirsty also had family difficulties: \u201cLife was shitty for me around that age. My family was not the easiest of families to grow up in. It was tough. And you know, all families are complicated, of course, but I always felt really welcomed into Christian\u2019s family immediately.\u201d This helped the couple bond. \u201cWe went through a few life moments together early on,\u201d says Christian. \u201cThat also bought us a lot closer \u2013 maybe earlier than the expected.\u201d They took the relationship seriously right from the beginning and both say it never occurred to them to break up because they enjoyed their time together so much. \u201cWhen I\u2019m thinking about our relationship, it has just always been to me solid as a rock,\u201d says Kirsty. \u201cThere may be, like, seasons of our relationship [which] have been a bit patchy, but it is not a bell curve. It\u2019s just like a big black line, really solid.\u201d That didn\u2019t mean they wanted to follow the traditional route. There was a stage when many of their friends were getting married and Christian thought about proposing \u2013 but Kirsty had other plans. \u201cI was like: don\u2019t ask me. Because I\u2019m going to say no, but it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to be with you. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to spend $40,000 on a stupid wedding,\u201d she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel the need to conform and have a party that\u2019s for everybody else, not for you and me.\u201d Initially this was confusing for Christian, who comes from a traditional South American Catholic family, with a mother who was particularly keen for her son to get married and have children. But he understood Kirsty\u2019s position, which helped him, too. \u201cI remember this was a real significant point of our life where, being the good Catholic son, there was definitely a lot of guilt coming my way ... but Kirsty helped me understand it\u2019s OK to say no, you can say what you want to do. You can say if that doesn\u2019t work and they\u2019ll understand.\u201d Eventually the family did understand and stopped asking \u2013 although the couple surprised everyone when their daughter Zadie arrived in 2015. Then they got married quietly for visa purposes when they moved to Japan in October 2016. They were both excited about the opportunities in Japan, but it was a challenging experience, particularly for Kirsty. Often Christian worked long hours in Tokyo, leaving her alone to manage with their daughter. \u201cIt was very isolating for me because I had to leave my career behind, whereas Christian moved there because of work. I had to give up working and become a stay-at-home parent and that was something I had never pictured for myself. And it was really more about the shock of the loss of my identity.\u201d They loved living in Japan, but knew it couldn\u2019t be a long-term solution. Yet both still wanted to explore the world and didn\u2019t want to return to Australia just yet. \u201cThat comes back to Campbelltown and the want to be somewhere bigger,\u201d says Christian. \u201cWe were in a smaller suburban town and we wanted to be in the bigger city and we then got a taste of what that was. It\u2019s not until [you] live [overseas] that you realise how big and how exciting and how diverse [it is]. They were the things that we always wanted. So that was always, again, another thing that drove us \u2013 to make the most of the opportunity while we had it.\u201d Fortunately he was offered a job in Los Angeles, so the family moved again in October 2018. It\u2019s meant they have more time together as a couple. \u201cThat was more of a challenge in Tokyo. We were fortunate to find a babysitter, a Kiwi-Japanese girl who was great, but now with [Zadie at] school, there are more opportunities for us to spend time together, whether it\u2019s going to a movie or somewhere to eat or exploring downtown or going to a gallery. We just take more of those quiet moments now.\u201d They also understand how the other expresses their feelings even in the simplest ways. \u201cMy love language to Christian is cooking and I want to make nice food for the family, so we eat dinner together every night. And I know his love language to me is he\u2019s very happy to indulge my desires to sleep in and have breakfast made for me and to take Zadie away and give me some time, and he\u2019s very considerate of me like that.\u201d Even though they were young when they came together, their commitment to each other is so strong that they almost don\u2019t think about it any more. Kirsty says there are many levels of commitment for her: \u201cMy commitment to him is like my family \u2013 I have commitment to him as the father of my daughter, commitment to him as my partner. And in any of those areas, I don\u2019t ever want to hurt him.\u201d Christian agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s like equity \u2013 we\u2019ve built it up over time.

      "bodyText": "One of Australia\u2019s richest families is fighting a supreme court siblings\u2019 battle over the inheritance of an iron ore fortune. Julian Wright is suing his billionaire sister Angela Bennett and the estate of his late brother Michael Wright for fraud, claiming they hid the size of the family\u2019s true wealth and duped him out of millions in mining royalties. It is one of the biggest fraud cases in the nation\u2019s history and is being heard three years after Julian Wright filed an explosive writ alleging that his siblings \u201cfraudulently misrepresented\u201d the future value of Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd (WPPL) following the unexpected death of their father, Peter Wright, in September 1985. Bennett is estimated to be worth almost $2bn and was labelled Australia\u2019s fourth-richest woman in 2017 by Forbes. Julian Wright and Bennett\u2019s older brother, Michael Wright, bequeathed $1.2bn to his children Alexandra Burt and Leonie Baldock when he died in 2012. At core of the case is the jarring fact that Julian Wright sold his one-third share in the family business for $6.8m in 1987 \u2013 two decades before a mining boom catapulted the company\u2019s finances into the stratosphere. But as fast as the millions have rolled in, so have the legal battles. For more than a decade, the Wright family has been in and out of court fighting each other and their former business partner, Hancock Prospecting, over shares and rights to its mining interests in the red, dusty Pilbara region of north-west Western Australia. This latest case follows a successful claim by Julian Wright\u2019s children, Tim and Natalie Wright, in 2008 that netted them close to $70m from their estranged uncle and aunt. Meanwhile, the company is still mired in a years-long legal saga with Hancock Prospecting over a range of iron ore assets and royalty streams. In his opening address to court, Julian Wright\u2019s lawyer Pat Zappia QC claimed his client was deliberately misled by his older siblings into thinking that Wright Prospecting\u2019s mining tenements \u201cdid not have any value\u201d, before he made his fateful decision to sell his stake in the company. \u201cImmediately following Peter\u2019s death, Michael and Angela assumed control of WPPL and together plotted to acquire all of Julian\u2019s interests in the company and any interest that he held in Peter\u2019s estate,\u201d Zappia told the court. \u201cThey did not want Julian to have any future interest in the company\u2019s significant and highly valuable mining assets. Their objective was to get rid of him one way or another.\u201d Julian Wright claims Michael Wright and Bennett \u201ctrapped him like a rat in a bottle\u201d, keeping him away from the mining business and providing only negative information about its workings. \u201cMatters that would otherwise have been highly material to Julian\u2019s decision to sell were concealed from him by his siblings and those engaged on his behalf,\u201d Zappia said. \u201cThose royalty entitles today are worth many, many millions of dollars and they were not disclosed to Julian.\u201d But Wright Prospecting denies any impropriety, arguing that Julian Wright needs to live with a decision he clearly regrets and stop retrospectively trying to undo binding agreements. The firm\u2019s senior counsel Kristina Stern called for the case to be dismissed on Thursday and for costs to be awarded against Julian Wright. \u201cThe evidence falls well short of proof of fraud,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThere is no evidence of misrepresentation or concealment on the part of Michael Wright or Angela Bennett.\u201d Stern referred to a previously submitted signed deed, which she labelled \u201cutterly fatal\u201d to Julian\u2019s case. The deed was part of the 2008 legal settlement between Bennett, Michael Wright, Julian Wright and his two children. It contains a pledge that the siblings would not bring further legal action about the family inheritance. The warring siblings owe their immense wealth to their late father, Peter Wright, who together with school buddy and business partner Lang Hancock, signed three agreements in the 1960s, carving out a river of royalties that still flows today. Both Hancock and Wright are patriarchs of Perth\u2019s richest mining families and are credited as pioneers of WA\u2019s lucrative iron ore industry. Hancock\u2019s daughter, Gina Rinehart, who has also previously been embroiled in legal battles with immediate family, is Australia\u2019s richest woman, worth $15.2bn according to Forbes. WA is the world\u2019s largest supplier of iron ore. Most of the metal extracted is sold to China to be turned into steel, according to the WA Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety. Australia\u2019s decade-long resources boom can be credited to a once-in-a-century explosion in construction projects in China that saw iron ore prices skyrocket by a factor of 10 in the early 2000s. Families like the Wrights and Hancocks became billionaires as a result. The boom may have waned but iron ore is still big business in WA. Iron ore sales reached a record 790m tonnes and were valued at $63bn in 2016 to 2017, according to the state government. While WPPL does not mine the ore, it brokered an ongoing royalty deal with mining giant Rio Tinto. But according to Zappia, a statement of assets lodged as part of the processing of Peter Wright\u2019s will in April 1986 did not detail this massive royalty agreement over WPPL\u2019s Pilbara mining interests. \u201cThat asset was not disclosed to Julian,\u201d Zappia said. The defence claimed to have documents refuting Julian Wright\u2019s claim that he was kept in the dark about potential mining royalties. Stern said there was evidence that Julian Wright was aware of his father\u2019s involvement in previous legal proceedings relating to a royalty dispute. The case continues.",

Morton is the patron or member of four clubs in his Western Australia electorate of Tangney that won $38,800 in Stronger Communities grants, a scheme that allows local MPs to shape where money goes. Morton, a close confidant of Morrison\u2019s, has told Guardian Australia he took steps to avoid any conflict and was not a patron or member of two of the clubs at the time they expressed interest in the grants or when they were deliberated upon. The Stronger Communities scheme gives $150,000 to each of Australia\u2019s 151 electorates, which is then doled out in portions of up to $20,000 to individual projects that \u201cdeliver social benefits\u201d. Local MPs are integral to the process. They help decide which groups are able to apply and which are shut out. Politicians identify applicants, set up community consultative committees to consider their merits and formally invite organisations to bid for a grant. Only those invited by an MP are eligible for grants, which are later assessed against the program\u2019s criteria by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, the administering body. As the local MP, Morton\u2019s invitation was required for any organisation in his electorate of Tangney to be eligible. Four clubs in Tangney that Morton has personal or professional associations with were successful. That includes the Lions Club of Bull Creek, of which Morton is a member. It won $8,200 to buy new chairs and tables. The Ferndale Lynwood Cricket Club, the Willetton Baseball Club, and the Rostrata Junior Football Club were also successful. Morton lists himself as a patron of all three of those clubs on his register of interests. When it won its grant, the Rostrata Junior Football Club posted a \u201cmassive\u201d thank you to Morton. \u201cThe Rostrata Rhinos would like to send a massive thank you to Ben Morton and his staff for their amazing assistance in obtaining a grant for $15,000 from the federal government\u2019s stronger communities program,\u201d the club said on Facebook. The club later told Guardian Australia that Morton only became its patron after he had provided the invitation for it to apply for the grant. It said there was no conflict and that Morton\u2019s role in alerting community groups to such grant programs was critical, because they\u2019d otherwise be unaware of much-needed funding opportunities. \u201cBen is a great supporter of many local groups and in my view has acted with great integrity, especially considering his own children play at a different club to ours,\u201d the club said. The scheme\u2019s guidelines say steps must be taken to identify and avoid conflicts of interest, which include any \u201cprofessional, commercial or personal relationship with a party who is able to influence the application selection process\u201d. Organisations and MPs must declare potential conflicts, and the department can remove people from consultative committees if it deems potential conflicts as a \u201ccause for concern\u201d. Morton told Guardian Australia he took the appropriate steps to avoid such conflicts. He said he did not participate in any of the consultative committee\u2019s deliberations on any of the four grant applications. Morton said he was not a member or patron of Ferndale Lynwood Cricket Club and the Willetton Baseball Club when they expressed interest in the program or when the consultative committee deliberated on the grants. He also said he disclosed his association with the Rostrata Junior Football Club and the Lions Club of Bull Creek to the consultative committees when they were deliberating on their grant applications. \u201cLike many local MPs I am a patron or member of numerous organisations in my electorate. It\u2019s what being a good MP is all about \u2013 being connected to your community,\u201d Morton said. \u201cIn line with Stronger Communities program guidelines, my memberships and patronages of sporting and community groups in Tangney under consideration are disclosed to the committee during their deliberations.\u201d The infrastructure department, which has policy responsibility for the program, said it does not prescribe how MPs promote the program or identify potential applicants. But it does provide \u201cdetailed guidance\u201d to MPs on their responsibilities, including how to manage and declare \u201cactual or perceived\u201d conflicts of interest through the nomination process. \u201cAs part of the online project nomination process, MPs are asked to declare any actual or perceived conflicts, or that to the best of their knowledge no conflict exists, for each project nomination submitted,\u201d the department said. Morton said he was fulfilling his role as a local MP by making local community organisations aware of grant opportunities to improve their facilities and grow their membership. \u201cThat is the role of hard-working local MPs and the local community should expect that of their elected representative,\u201d he said.",

Forgive this indulgence, I need to get this off my chest.</p> <p>Politics watchers will know that prime ministers and opposition leaders intone with all the sobriety of an undertaker that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/24/malcolm-turnbull-final-remarks-australian-prime-minister\">\u201cdisunity is death\u201d</a>.

Rather than harbouring a grudge about political instability being out and proud, a majority of voters looked past the cycles of revenge tragedy perpetrated in full public view.</p> <p>Now, perhaps the result last May isn\u2019t any kind of step change in our country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/13/labor-denies-breakaway-pro-coal-group-points-to-division-on-climate-policy\">Labor denies breakaway pro-coal group points to division on climate policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Voters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/07/tony-abbott-new-prime-minister\">did toss out the Rudd/Gillard Labor government</a>, the folks who pioneered the art of civil war at taxpayer expense. There was punishment for that self-indulgent behaviour, only a few years back. So perhaps 2019 is just the conservative centre of gravity in Australian politics asserting itself.</p> <p>But I do wonder whether that May result has revealed something other than the \u201ccome to Daddy because Labor will spend all your money\u201d default in our polity. I wonder whether we are now so saturated in conflict that people in politics trying to take one another out just seems normal.</p> <p>Technology has pushed us into tribes. Our shared reality, rather than being a commons, is increasingly animated by fealty rather than agreed facts and a spirit of inquiry. Conflict has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/02/clickbait-and-gotcha-moments-how-political-conflict-became-a-commodity\">the pulse and the respiration of our harried and hyperconnected lives</a>.</p> <p>So perhaps, without us noticing, Australia, like some other democracies, has been picked up and set down in a different place, a place where disunity, rather than \u201cdeath\u201d, has become what is expected in public life.</p> <p>I think it is at least possible that collective expectations have bent to that new normal.</p> <p>Another quick observation before we move on. Disunity also furnishes spectacle, which is addictive. On the day Barnaby Joyce \u2013 with all the swaggering self-confidence a mediocre, middle-aged white bloke can deploy without having to be asked \u2013 attempted to unseat Michael McCormack on the first day of parliament for 2020, I was on a plane to Sydney.</p> <p>I have to be honest with you: I struggle to be gripped by Joyce versus McCormack. This pitched battle of the under-performers feels entirely low stakes, and particularly nasty, shitty and petty. I\u2019m impatient with it because there are so many important things drifting now, obscured in the cacophony of legends in their own lunchboxes asking radio hosts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/feb/13/government-could-fail-surplus-test-says-labor-politics-live?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:block-5e44d62e8f08e133247425ed#block-5e44d62e8f08e133247425ed\">when was the last time they had a nookie.</a></p> <p>But my fellow passengers were gripped. The moment the plane landed, everyone was on their phone and a person across the aisle reported reasonably loudly: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/michael-mccormack-barnaby-joyce-national-party-leadership-spill\">\u201cIt\u2019s McCormack!\u201d</a> in the expectation that other passengers would need to know the result of the leadership spill. Brief analytical murmuring ensued.</p> <p>Now perhaps these were public servants dreading the return of Joyce, or hoping Joyce would rise from the ashes because they are frustrated with McCormack. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t a representative sample. But if it was, it suggests our collective expectations are well on the way to being rewired.</p> <p>So I\u2019m just asking, because this is an itch I need to scratch. Is disunity in politics really death any more, or is it now the core of the enterprise?</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s drill down and look at climate and coal, where disunity and conflict is absolutely the core of the enterprise.</p> <p>After Tony Abbott chose to weaponise climate change to win an election he would likely have won anyway, the whole debate has become toxic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/09/good-climate-policy-can-no-longer-be-our-goal-its-time-to-reach-for-perfect\">'Good' climate policy can no longer be our goal. It's time to reach for perfect | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are used to the Coalition and Labor slugging it out on the national stage, with the Coalition pretending nothing has to change, and Labor proposing a succession of policies and mechanisms to reduce emissions. But now the national schism, manufactured for partisan advantage, is creating subsidiary fractures.</p> <p>There are faultlines destabilising the major parties. Obviously this phenomenon isn\u2019t brand new. The Liberal party has nursed a rolling internal struggle for more than a decade, with the naysayers winning the majority of rounds, including the most recent battle over the national energy guarantee. Liberals, both inside and outside the cabinet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/10/two-moderate-liberal-mps-say-government-should-not-back-new-coal-plants\">are beginning to test their voices post-election</a>, but some Nationals will oppose progress to the death.</p> <p>Labor, post-election, is wafting into this territory. The New South Wales rightwinger Joel Fitzgibbon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/09/mark-butler-condemns-labor-frontbenchers-plan-for-settlement-on-climate-change\">wondered, out loud, earlier this year</a>, how many more elections Labor was prepared to lose by arguing for ambitious climate action. \u201cHow many times are we going to let it kill us?\u201d the shadow frontbencher mused. \u201cIndeed, how many leaders do we want to lose to it?\u201d</p> <p>While a majority of Labor MPs believe the party should hold the line on climate action, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/13/labor-denies-breakaway-pro-coal-group-points-to-division-on-climate-policy\">some in the right faction are arguing</a> the courtship of Labor\u2019s traditional base by their political opponents, and by populist insurgents \u2013 the weaponisation of the climate debate in regional and outer suburban areas \u2013 is now so effective that it will require a defibrillator to break that cycle.</p> <p>I think the \u201clet\u2019s step back from climate action\u201d brigade is a minority group, but in the disunity complex we are mulling this weekend, small groups can wield disproportionate influence.</p> <p>Current indications suggest Labor will be able to hold it together sufficiently to articulate broad climate policy principles without much of a bunfight, and some of those early principles are expected soon.</p> <p>But there will be a bunfight once the party attempts to set a medium-term target for emissions reduction for this term. That\u2019s where things are likely to get ugly. Some will want to avoid that fight by keeping Labor\u2019s offering bigger picture.</p> <p>If you were a political scientist, you might wonder, looking at all this, whether we are standing on the brink of a fundamental realignment. The vote of the major parties is declining, the governing class is stuck in a phase of rolling conflict rather than consensus building and, when it comes to climate, some of the internal differences within the major parties look irreconcilable. You might wonder how this holds together given the stress fractures are on full public display.</p> <p>Scott Morrison is holding his fractious political Coalition together by trying to be all things to all people: a prime minister who is reducing emissions (even though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/23/australia-has-changed-its-historic-data-on-carbon-emissions-what-happened\">emissions are flat</a> because the Coalition dismantled policies that were reducing pollution), who loves solar panels (even though the Coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/18/renewable-energy-tony-abbott-signals-he-could-wind-back-or-scrap-targets\">went to war with renewables during its first term in office</a>) and who isn\u2019t scared to support coal plants and coal workers (even though Morrison is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/16/remember-morrisons-black-rock-stunt-well-look-whos-scared-now\">periodically scared enough to not be able to utter the word</a>).</p> <p>There will be pressure on Anthony Albanese to go Morrison-lite.</p> <p>But outside the universe of endless psychodrama and dissembling stands an obvious pivot point: the commitments Australia intends to make to 2050.</p> <p>Leadership would be Morrison telling the truth: that by signing up to the Paris agreement, a decision his government made, Australia has already signed on to a net zero objective. He could stop pretending, to George Christensen, and everybody else, that this is moot.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll get to the divisions on coal and climate afflicting both of the major parties shortly, but before we arrive there I want to ask a bigger question about disunity, one I\u2019ve been carrying around with me since election night last year. Forgive this indulgence, I need to get this off my chest. Politics watchers will know that prime ministers and opposition leaders intone with all the sobriety of an undertaker that \u201cdisunity is death\u201d. People in my line of work tend to amplify that line dutifully, not because we are ciphers, but because it appeared to be true \u2013 one of those truisms so true it required no rebuttal. But now, I\u2019m not so sure, because Australian voters last year re-elected a government that had burned through three prime ministers in only two terms. Rather than harbouring a grudge about political instability being out and proud, a majority of voters looked past the cycles of revenge tragedy perpetrated in full public view. Now, perhaps the result last May isn\u2019t any kind of step change in our country. Voters did toss out the Rudd/Gillard Labor government, the folks who pioneered the art of civil war at taxpayer expense. There was punishment for that self-indulgent behaviour, only a few years back. So perhaps 2019 is just the conservative centre of gravity in Australian politics asserting itself. But I do wonder whether that May result has revealed something other than the \u201ccome to Daddy because Labor will spend all your money\u201d default in our polity. I wonder whether we are now so saturated in conflict that people in politics trying to take one another out just seems normal. Technology has pushed us into tribes. Our shared reality, rather than being a commons, is increasingly animated by fealty rather than agreed facts and a spirit of inquiry. Conflict has become the pulse and the respiration of our harried and hyperconnected lives. So perhaps, without us noticing, Australia, like some other democracies, has been picked up and set down in a different place, a place where disunity, rather than \u201cdeath\u201d, has become what is expected in public life. I think it is at least possible that collective expectations have bent to that new normal. Another quick observation before we move on. Disunity also furnishes spectacle, which is addictive. On the day Barnaby Joyce \u2013 with all the swaggering self-confidence a mediocre, middle-aged white bloke can deploy without having to be asked \u2013 attempted to unseat Michael McCormack on the first day of parliament for 2020, I was on a plane to Sydney. I have to be honest with you: I struggle to be gripped by Joyce versus McCormack. This pitched battle of the under-performers feels entirely low stakes, and particularly nasty, shitty and petty. I\u2019m impatient with it because there are so many important things drifting now, obscured in the cacophony of legends in their own lunchboxes asking radio hosts when was the last time they had a nookie. But my fellow passengers were gripped. The moment the plane landed, everyone was on their phone and a person across the aisle reported reasonably loudly: \u201cIt\u2019s McCormack!\u201d in the expectation that other passengers would need to know the result of the leadership spill. Brief analytical murmuring ensued. Now perhaps these were public servants dreading the return of Joyce, or hoping Joyce would rise from the ashes because they are frustrated with McCormack. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t a representative sample. But if it was, it suggests our collective expectations are well on the way to being rewired. So I\u2019m just asking, because this is an itch I need to scratch. Is disunity in politics really death any more, or is it now the core of the enterprise? Now, let\u2019s drill down and look at climate and coal, where disunity and conflict is absolutely the core of the enterprise. After Tony Abbott chose to weaponise climate change to win an election he would likely have won anyway, the whole debate has become toxic. We are used to the Coalition and Labor slugging it out on the national stage, with the Coalition pretending nothing has to change, and Labor proposing a succession of policies and mechanisms to reduce emissions. But now the national schism, manufactured for partisan advantage, is creating subsidiary fractures. There are faultlines destabilising the major parties. Obviously this phenomenon isn\u2019t brand new. The Liberal party has nursed a rolling internal struggle for more than a decade, with the naysayers winning the majority of rounds, including the most recent battle over the national energy guarantee. Liberals, both inside and outside the cabinet, are beginning to test their voices post-election, but some Nationals will oppose progress to the death. Labor, post-election, is wafting into this territory. The New South Wales rightwinger Joel Fitzgibbon wondered, out loud, earlier this year, how many more elections Labor was prepared to lose by arguing for ambitious climate action. \u201cHow many times are we going to let it kill us?\u201d the shadow frontbencher mused. \u201cIndeed, how many leaders do we want to lose to it?\u201d While a majority of Labor MPs believe the party should hold the line on climate action, some in the right faction are arguing the courtship of Labor\u2019s traditional base by their political opponents, and by populist insurgents \u2013 the weaponisation of the climate debate in regional and outer suburban areas \u2013 is now so effective that it will require a defibrillator to break that cycle. I think the \u201clet\u2019s step back from climate action\u201d brigade is a minority group, but in the disunity complex we are mulling this weekend, small groups can wield disproportionate influence. Current indications suggest Labor will be able to hold it together sufficiently to articulate broad climate policy principles without much of a bunfight, and some of those early principles are expected soon. But there will be a bunfight once the party attempts to set a medium-term target for emissions reduction for this term. That\u2019s where things are likely to get ugly. Some will want to avoid that fight by keeping Labor\u2019s offering bigger picture. If you were a political scientist, you might wonder, looking at all this, whether we are standing on the brink of a fundamental realignment. The vote of the major parties is declining, the governing class is stuck in a phase of rolling conflict rather than consensus building and, when it comes to climate, some of the internal differences within the major parties look irreconcilable. You might wonder how this holds together given the stress fractures are on full public display. Scott Morrison is holding his fractious political Coalition together by trying to be all things to all people: a prime minister who is reducing emissions (even though emissions are flat because the Coalition dismantled policies that were reducing pollution), who loves solar panels (even though the Coalition went to war with renewables during its first term in office) and who isn\u2019t scared to support coal plants and coal workers (even though Morrison is periodically scared enough to not be able to utter the word). There will be pressure on Anthony Albanese to go Morrison-lite. But outside the universe of endless psychodrama and dissembling stands an obvious pivot point: the commitments Australia intends to make to 2050. Leadership would be Morrison telling the truth: that by signing up to the Paris agreement, a decision his government made, Australia has already signed on to a net zero objective. He could stop pretending, to George Christensen, and everybody else, that this is moot. Instead of giving coal workers false comfort, he could give them a plan for the future. Instead of glowering across the dispatch box at Albanese, and pretending that only his opponent has a problem with climate action, Morrison could acknowledge that until the Coalition stops lying and starts leading, we all have a problem.",

She fears a fall or an injury, and she fears that when she goes for an upcoming hysterectomy that she will not receive adequate pain relief. Physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, psychological treatment \u2013 all these cost money she does not have. Her chronic pain means she can only work six hours a week. She spends about half her day in bed, every single day, just to get relief.</p> <p>O\u2019Neil knew her body was reliant on the drug. She didn\u2019t mind going off it. But she didn\u2019t want to do it this way. It did not seem fair.</p> <h2><strong>Safe fix or over-use and abuse?</strong></h2> <p>For decades opioids were reserved for short-term and severe pain relief, prescribed after surgery or accident or in palliative care. But drug companies in the 1990s began to market the drugs as safe and effective for long-term pain relief, a promise welcomed by doctors keen for a safe fix for patients presenting with chronic pain.</p> <p>Prescription rates soared. In the five years between 2009 and 2014, <a href=\"https://www.painaustralia.org.au/static/uploads/files/national-action-plan-11-06-2019-wftmzrzushlj.pdf\">opioid prescribing in Australia increased by 30%</a>. In 2016-17, <a href=\"https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/sites/default/files/migrated/5.7-Text-Opioid-medicines-dispensing-all-ages.pdf\">nearly 15.5 million opioid prescriptions were dispensed</a> through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These numbers do not include codeine, which was available in pharmacies without a prescription until February 2018.</p> <p>And harms have increased too. In 2018 <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0~2018~Main%20Features~Opioid-induced%20deaths%20in%20Australia~10000\">three people died every day due to opioids</a>. That accounted for two-thirds of all drug-related deaths. Of the opioid deaths, 70% involved pharmaceutical opioids. Every day in Australia there are <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/illicit-use-of-drugs/opioid-harm-in-australia/contents/summary\">150 hospitalisations due to opioids</a>, and 14 emergency department visits \u2013 a 25% increase between 2007-08 and 2016-17.</p> <p>In response to this global trend \u2013 which is particularly prevalent in the US \u2013 researchers, governments, doctors and medical bodies started to look again at opioid prescription practices. Patient groups in the United States sued the pharmaceutical companies for promoting the use of these drugs in the treatment of chronic pain. In early 2019, the World Health Organisation <a href=\"https://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/guide_on_pain/en/\">changed its own guidance on opioids</a>, recognising that while they have a role to play, that role should be limited.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was really never enough when it came to this drug</p> <footer> <cite>Leah Dwyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Australia, concerns about misuse of opioids by patients has led to real-time prescription monitoring services being rolled out in some states. Last year, the chief medical officer <a href=\"https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/professional/government-to-warn-almost-5000-gps-over-high-rates\">wrote to 4,800 general practitioners</a> who represented the top 20% of opioid-prescribing doctors in the country, alerting them to their outlier status in a bid to reduce over-prescribing.</p> <p>But for many working in the field, there is concern that legitimate discontent about over-prescribing and harms has prompted a knee-jerk reaction, cutting patients off the drugs without adequate research, consultation or alternative. Opioid prescription growth has slowed. Between 2013-14 and 2016-17, there was just <a href=\"https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/sites/default/files/migrated/5.7-Text-Opioid-medicines-dispensing-all-ages.pdf\">a 5% increase in prescriptions</a>. Pain charities report doctors and clinics outright refusing to prescribe opioids at all, and patients who have been following doctors\u2019 orders for years being suddenly cut off or involuntarily tapered from their medicine.</p> <p>It is not possible to know exactly how many or what proportion of people coming off pharmaceutical opioids for chronic pain are doing so voluntarily or as a result of their physicians unilaterally changing or ceasing their dosage.</p> <p>What is known is that, having developed a dependence on pharmaceutical opioids, withdrawal is extremely difficult, physically and emotionally. And whether forcibly tapered or voluntarily cutting back, many people are going through that process and their post-opioid life alone and largely unsupported by the medical system that made those drugs so readily available in the first place.</p> <h2>\u2018It was hell\u2019: the voluntary taper story</h2> <p>It was when Leah Dwyer took three Mersyndol in the morning instead of two that she knew something had to change. She had been buying the drug, which contains the opiate codeine, without prescription or monitoring for eight years.</p> <p>She had tried many medications and allied health treatments for her cervical dystonia (severe muscular contractions in the neck), which was diagnosed 13 years ago. She had been very fit and active before her diagnosis. With a severely autistic son, she did not have time for pain. She found Mersyndol worked, and took tramadol for flare-ups. She did not know that Mersyndol contained the opioid codeine, nor that tramadol was a milder form of opioid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d47fa9a37b61a879ae10fc9a947cc231d650ada5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d47fa9a37b61a879ae10fc9a947cc231d650ada5/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Dwyer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An opioid ensures that your brain becomes very sensitive,\u2019 says Leah Dwyer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the beginning, they always work.

      "bodyText": "Louisa O\u2019Neil inhales deeply when she is asked about her history of pain. Then, dispassionately, like recalling a string of part-time jobs, she lists the history of surgeries, injuries, accidents and conditions that have rendered her in a near permanent state of pain for the past 16 years. Ligaments ripped off bone, regularly dislocating jaw, jaw replacement, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, separated pelvis, bone grafts, arthritis. It is a long list. It takes 10 minutes. \u201cI wake up in pain, and I go to bed with pain,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s very few moments when I\u2019m not in pain of some form or another. Its just the degrees of how much pain I\u2019m in [that] fluctuates.\u201d Over the course of the past 16 years she has been on a medical merry-go-round, and tried multiple drugs and techniques for pain management. In the end, she found that Endone, a medicine containing the opioid oxycodone, worked for her. She would take one a night. She says it would help reduce the pain sufficiently for her get to sleep. Once asleep Palexia, a slow-release form of the opioid tapentadol, would kick in to help keep her asleep. Five or six times a year she would take an additional Endone to help with what she describes as \u201cbreakthrough pain\u201d. She was told that she was managing her pain well. Then, earlier this year, she went to her GP in Melbourne for a routine prescription renewal. But this time, it was refused. She left with nothing. O\u2019Neil was told that her GP had received notice from the government that she and other patients were using Endone in a way it was not intended, which is for acute and short-term pain, \u201ceven though it was working for me\u201d. The doctor told her he could not re-prescribe. O\u2019Neil did not want him to get into trouble. She walked out of the doctor\u2019s surgery shaking. She rang her partner in tears. She knew what she facing \u2013 she had accidentally gone through withdrawals before, when forgetting to take her medication on a night away. But she was also terrified of how she would cope with her pain in the long term. \u201cWhat do I do for those nights when I don\u2019t sleep and the Palexia isn\u2019t working? So yeah, a lot of fear. I was pretty devastated actually,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like a drug addict.\u201d What followed from her Endone being cut off was three days of intense withdrawal. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone is wringing out your muscles like they would wring out a wet rag. Just this cramping in your legs. You can\u2019t get relief. So you don\u2019t sleep and you spend most of the night trying to walk off this pain because if you lie down it\u2019s just so intense,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like your muscles are being clamped, and clamped, and clamped.\u201d Without her Endone prescription she now limits what she does. She doesn\u2019t go out with friends like she used to, because she fears she\u2019ll return home in pain with no medicine to help her. She fears a fall or an injury, and she fears that when she goes for an upcoming hysterectomy that she will not receive adequate pain relief. Physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, psychological treatment \u2013 all these cost money she does not have. Her chronic pain means she can only work six hours a week. She spends about half her day in bed, every single day, just to get relief. O\u2019Neil knew her body was reliant on the drug. She didn\u2019t mind going off it.

For decades opioids were reserved for short-term and severe pain relief, prescribed after surgery or accident or in palliative care. But drug companies in the 1990s began to market the drugs as safe and effective for long-term pain relief, a promise welcomed by doctors keen for a safe fix for patients presenting with chronic pain. Prescription rates soared. In the five years between 2009 and 2014, opioid prescribing in Australia increased by 30%. In 2016-17, nearly 15.5 million opioid prescriptions were dispensed through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These numbers do not include codeine, which was available in pharmacies without a prescription until February 2018. And harms have increased too. In 2018 three people died every day due to opioids. That accounted for two-thirds of all drug-related deaths. Of the opioid deaths, 70% involved pharmaceutical opioids. Every day in Australia there are 150 hospitalisations due to opioids, and 14 emergency department visits \u2013 a 25% increase between 2007-08 and 2016-17. In response to this global trend \u2013 which is particularly prevalent in the US \u2013 researchers, governments, doctors and medical bodies started to look again at opioid prescription practices.

But for many working in the field, there is concern that legitimate discontent about over-prescribing and harms has prompted a knee-jerk reaction, cutting patients off the drugs without adequate research, consultation or alternative. Opioid prescription growth has slowed. Between 2013-14 and 2016-17, there was just a 5% increase in prescriptions. Pain charities report doctors and clinics outright refusing to prescribe opioids at all, and patients who have been following doctors\u2019 orders for years being suddenly cut off or involuntarily tapered from their medicine. It is not possible to know exactly how many or what proportion of people coming off pharmaceutical opioids for chronic pain are doing so voluntarily or as a result of their physicians unilaterally changing or ceasing their dosage.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales police minister has refused to comment on a secretive blacklist used disproportionately to target young Indigenous people with sometimes \u201ccoercive\u201d tactics because it is \u201can operational issue\u201d. On Thursday the NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC), the state\u2019s police watchdog, released the findings of its investigation into the suspect target management plan (STMP), an opaque policing practice which used \u201cunreasonable, unjust and oppressive\u201d tactics that in some cases are likely to be illegal. The two-year investigation found that while the STMP had been designed to monitor repeat offenders and prevent crime, it was often used to target children using \u201cintrusive\u201d policing tactics, \u201cunreasonable surveillance\u201d and \u201charassment\u201d that could in some cases increase young people\u2019s risk of entering the justice system. The LECC found that despite being designed to target adult offenders, the STMP was disproportionately used against Indigenous children, including some who had never been charged with an offence. NSW police said after the report\u2019s release that it had \u201cinitiated a redesign\u201d of the STMP to \u201censure it is appropriately applied to young people\u201d, but legal academics and justice advocates say its use against children should be stopped altogether. University of New South Wales law academic Vicki Sentas, who co-authored a 2017 report that sparked the LECC\u2019s investigation, said the STMP remained \u201ca troubling grey zone\u201d outside of the law. \u201cThe LECC makes a number of recommendations it considers would improve the STMP, but this tool is highly inappropriate for children and should be abandoned all together,\u201d she said \u201cBest practice in supporting children from offending requires holistic, tailored support for families from social services and culturally appropriate community-based support, not subjection to harmful forms of policing.\u201d David Elliott, the NSW police minister, refused to comment on Friday when asked whether he was concerned about the disproportionate representation of young Indigenous people on the STMP, or whether it believed children should be targeted under the policy. In a one-line statement, a spokesman said: \u201cThe minister won\u2019t be commenting on this as it\u2019s an operational issue.\u201d But the NSW shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, said the use of the STMP to target children was \u201cinappropriate\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Luke Pearce had arrived at Mannus Creek for a three-day mission to rescue the Murray catchment\u2019s last population of Macquarie perch. For 10 years Pearce had visited this spot on the edge of the Snowy Mountains that, just weeks earlier, was ravaged by fire. There had been rain and the creek was flowing fast. But as Pearce and his colleagues stood on the bank \u2013 nets at the ready \u2013 the water turned \u201cto a river of black porridge\u201d. \u201cWe got there at about midday with two teams. But we were too late,\u201d he says. Pearce is a fisheries manager in the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. A week earlier, he had caught nine of the endangered perch and taken them to the tanks at Narrandera Fisheries Centre. But Pearce says nine was not enough to be confident they could breed enough in captivity to replenish the river. About 100 specimens would be ideal, but Pearce says the fish are in such low numbers that he was hoping for 20. Hence the rescue mission on 20 January. \u201cIt was a front of black water coming down,\u201d Pearce says. \u201cThe water was pretty bad to start with, but it went from green to inky black. \u201cIt was a moment of complete despair and, really, a feeling of a missed opportunity. Maybe if we\u2019d got there four or five hours earlier we may have been able to get one or two more.\u201d An electronic probe in the water monitoring the oxygen levels dropped to show zero within hours, Pearce says. \u201cWatching those oxygen levels drop like that I had grave fears we could have lost all the fish in that system. It was devastating having worked there for such a long time to then potentially lose all this.\u201d The river was too black to see any fish, but crayfish, shrimp and mayfly larvae were crawling out. What happened at Mannus Creek is one example of what scientists have described as a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d hitting rivers on Australia\u2019s east coast and inland. Drought and a long-term drying has delivered a cascade of mass fish kills since late 2018, with low river flows, low oxygen and algal blooms. Authorities and politicians warned repeatedly in 2019 that ongoing drying would see more mass fish kills. Then Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis struck across catchments. Now heavy rain has washed sludge and ash into rivers, robbing the remaining fish of oxygen. Hundreds of thousands of fish have died in multiple events \u2013 some caused by lack of water, and some caused by downpours running over burned catchments. At one time, Macquarie perch was one of the most abundant native fish in the Murray-Darling system \u2013 prized by anglers and also commercial fishers. But a NSW government assessment of the fish in 2008 wrote the building of dams and weirs had compromised spawning areas and blocked the fish\u2019s movement. Overfishing, pollution and predation by introduced species like redfin perch had also caused numbers to plummet. Now, Pearce says there\u2019s just one known population of the fish at Mannus Creek, near the town of Tumbarumba. On 14 January, Pearce had been to the creek to see what was left after the fires. The vegetation, the animals and the usual audio backtrack of birds and bugs he was used to seeing was now a scene of carnage. The area was littered with the burnt remains of wildlife \u2013 kangaroos, wombats, possums, birds and deer. \u201cThere\u2019s wasn\u2019t a sound \u2013 nothing at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was nothing left \u2013 just black stalks. \u201cAll that spoke to me about the speed and ferocity of the fires \u2013 these animals just couldn\u2019t escape. We were really concerned about the potential impact if we had any rainfall.\u201d The rescue attempt for the Macquarie perch is part of the biggest fish rescue project the NSW government has ever attempted. Since September, with water levels low across rivers, some 4,000 native fish have been taken from rivers and placed in tanks across the state \u2013 most in government facilities and some in private hatcheries. NSW DPI\u2019s Dr Trevor Daly, a senior fisheries manager working on threatened species, says rescues of threatened fish have included 1,630 olive perchlet, 740 southern pygmy perch, 292 Oxleyan pygmy perch, 107 southern purple spotted gudgeon, 98 eastern freshwater cod, 79 silver perch and 34 eel-tailed catfish. Catchments targeted for rescues have included Gwydir, Border Rivers, Macquarie, Lachlan, and Upper Murray catchments in the Murray-Darling Basin, and in the Clarence and Richmond River catchments on the coast. \u201cWe\u2019ve been battling the worst drought on record and we know we can\u2019t save every fish, but we are doing what we can to save as many as we can,\u201d Daly says, adding the heavy rain will likely see more fish deaths. The government says the rescue efforts are \u201ccritical\u201d if populations of fish are going to recover when river conditions improve. Some fish are being held in tanks, while others have been relocated to rivers that do have some water. Prof Lee Baumgartner, a freshwater ecologist at Charles Sturt University, says the Murray-Darling Basin has gone through an extreme swing from wet to dry in just 18 months. \u201cThe climate change science tells us that this could be the new normal and, if it is, then we have to manage that transition much better and share the water in a more equitable way. \u201cFish need water in rivers. Birds can fly away if there\u2019s drought, trees can drop leaves. But fish need water.\u201d How long it will take for conditions to improve at Mannus Creek is hard to say. That initial flush of \u201cblack porridge\u201d could travel through in a matter of days, but the sediment could linger for months or even longer depending on river flows and rainfall. Last week, Pearce returned to Mannus Creek and went a little further upstream. On the banks, the black sludge was about 15cm thick, but that visit has also given him some hope. \u201cI managed to catch another two \u2013 I released one,\u201d he says. \u201cI was astounded that there were still some fish surviving \u2013 I had real fears that nothing could survive.

If you do it in Leeds, you can be in the centre in five- to 10 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Citu\u2019s development projects in the climate innovation district include the Secret Garden, where modern four-bedroom homes overlook the River Aire and eliminate the need to commute by car. \u201cOur customers from London have fallen in love with the ability to have a lifestyle that involves community, living more sustainably and that allows easy access to all the amenities of the city centre \u2013 that combination has been the real pull. Leeds offers opportunities to make really progressive changes towards a lifestyle many people don\u2019t even know they need yet.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Gamsu, 30, abandoned the capital four years ago for Meanwood, an up-and-coming suburb boasting mature woodland, a village-like vibe and close proximity to the city centre. \u201cThe food and drink scene is amazing in Leeds, as is the shopping. There\u2019s a great variety of independent food and drink places, coffee roasters, a vibrant market and pop-up food spaces, especially in the summer. The local towns use Leeds for shopping, eating and drinking so it\u2019s always really busy at the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>The director at Santander recently opened the first Work Cafe Santander in the UK, a free co-working, coffee shop and bank space in the bustling city centre, a stone\u2019s throw from the grandeur of Briggate, Leeds\u2019s historic shopping street often referred to as \u201cthe posh bit\u201d. Gamsu said: \u201cSantander chose Leeds as it\u2019s booming, attracting Channel 4, and it has a huge number of new businesses in digital and creative. Leeds has loads going on and will continue to grow and get better with more young professionals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0714d18f48647c1dfa4225e85fe13adec02d1e60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0714d18f48647c1dfa4225e85fe13adec02d1e60/630_0_4499_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellie Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellie Wilson: \u2018If we invest as much in cities like Leeds, they can be just as exciting as London.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another draw for young professionals is the city\u2019s national reputation as the leading legal hub outside of London. Trainee solicitor Ellie Wilson moved after securing a training contract in Leeds. \u201cLondon can feel like the centre of the world sometimes but if we invest as much in cities like Leeds, they can be just as exciting. I have so much more variety here in terms of clients and the matters I deal with and I have the reward of seeing an outcome for an individual or small business.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the affordability, Wilson finds Leeds has plenty to offer in the way of arts, culture and quality of life. \u201cJust outside are the Peaks \u2013 lots of lovely places to go walking and hiking, and in the city there are art and sculpture galleries, the theatre, the opera, it\u2019s great for music and there\u2019s a huge nightlife scene. It\u2019s reminded me that there is life outside of London.\u201d</p> <p>Leeds finally seems to be coming into its own as a destination for young people, according to NHS worker Anna Cale, who moved back after five years in the capital. \u201cThings are changing now for Leeds, it feels like a vibrant city \u2013 the arts scene has blossomed, there are festivals and nightlife, you get that feeling of city life but also of community.

Within a month of moving to Leeds they had bought a three-bedroom townhouse in Newlay on an estate popular with younger couples and families. With a mortgage costing less than half their London rent, Fletcher found her money was going much further and enjoyed the change of pace.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m able to save, I bought a car, I can go out and spend money and not feel stressed about it. London is such an exhausting and expensive place to live. I do miss it sometimes but I wasn\u2019t happy. Work was a slog \u2013 I was regularly leaving the office at 8 or 9 o\u2019clock, it was horrendous.\u201d</p> <p>Though Leeds public transport leaves much to be desired and doesn\u2019t have London\u2019s after work drinks culture, Fletcher said the change of pace was welcome. \u201cHere I leave on time every day. I set up a book club on our estate, we have a garden and we live right next to a canal \u2013 you don\u2019t realise how little green space there is in London until you leave.

A 10-minute walk from the station is Holbeck, popular with startups and young creatives, while Marshall Street and its surroundings make up the new \u201csouth side\u201d district where the HS2 station will be located. Quieter suburbs such as Chapel Allerton, Meanwood and Kirkstall are sought after by families and first-time buyers, and still under construction is the \u201cclimate innovation district\u201d, bringing family living back into the city centre. Jonathan Wilson, a development director at Citu, believes northern cities such as Leeds offer space and opportunities for living differently that are not possible in London. \u201cIf you develop land on the outskirts of London you have to travel 40 minutes into the centre to meet a friend for a drink. If you do it in Leeds, you can be in the centre in five- to 10 minutes.\u201d Citu\u2019s development projects in the climate innovation district include the Secret Garden, where modern four-bedroom homes overlook the River Aire and eliminate the need to commute by car. \u201cOur customers from London have fallen in love with the ability to have a lifestyle that involves community, living more sustainably and that allows easy access to all the amenities of the city centre \u2013 that combination has been the real pull. Leeds offers opportunities to make really progressive changes towards a lifestyle many people don\u2019t even know they need yet.\u201d Bella Gamsu, 30, abandoned the capital four years ago for Meanwood, an up-and-coming suburb boasting mature woodland, a village-like vibe and close proximity to the city centre. \u201cThe food and drink scene is amazing in Leeds, as is the shopping. There\u2019s a great variety of independent food and drink places, coffee roasters, a vibrant market and pop-up food spaces, especially in the summer. The local towns use Leeds for shopping, eating and drinking so it\u2019s always really busy at the weekend.\u201d The director at Santander recently opened the first Work Cafe Santander in the UK, a free co-working, coffee shop and bank space in the bustling city centre, a stone\u2019s throw from the grandeur of Briggate, Leeds\u2019s historic shopping street often referred to as \u201cthe posh bit\u201d. Gamsu said: \u201cSantander chose Leeds as it\u2019s booming, attracting Channel 4, and it has a huge number of new businesses in digital and creative. Leeds has loads going on and will continue to grow and get better with more young professionals.\u201d Another draw for young professionals is the city\u2019s national reputation as the leading legal hub outside of London. Trainee solicitor Ellie Wilson moved after securing a training contract in Leeds. \u201cLondon can feel like the centre of the world sometimes but if we invest as much in cities like Leeds, they can be just as exciting. I have so much more variety here in terms of clients and the matters I deal with and I have the reward of seeing an outcome for an individual or small business.\u201d As well as the affordability, Wilson finds Leeds has plenty to offer in the way of arts, culture and quality of life. \u201cJust outside are the Peaks \u2013 lots of lovely places to go walking and hiking, and in the city there are art and sculpture galleries, the theatre, the opera, it\u2019s great for music and there\u2019s a huge nightlife scene. It\u2019s reminded me that there is life outside of London.\u201d Leeds finally seems to be coming into its own as a destination for young people, according to NHS worker Anna Cale, who moved back after five years in the capital. \u201cThings are changing now for Leeds, it feels like a vibrant city \u2013 the arts scene has blossomed, there are festivals and nightlife, you get that feeling of city life but also of community. Graduates here are starting to choose Leeds to start their careers. It\u2019s offering a place to be as a young person.\u201d Senior account executive Rachael Fletcher lived in London for three years before making the move as she turned 26. She and her boyfriend, Ryan, a trainee NHS clinical scientist, rented a tiny one-bed flat in Angel, north London, for \u00a31,500 a month. Within a month of moving to Leeds they had bought a three-bedroom townhouse in Newlay on an estate popular with younger couples and families. With a mortgage costing less than half their London rent, Fletcher found her money was going much further and enjoyed the change of pace. \u201cI\u2019m able to save, I bought a car, I can go out and spend money and not feel stressed about it. London is such an exhausting and expensive place to live. I do miss it sometimes but I wasn\u2019t happy. Work was a slog \u2013 I was regularly leaving the office at 8 or 9 o\u2019clock, it was horrendous.\u201d Though Leeds public transport leaves much to be desired and doesn\u2019t have London\u2019s after work drinks culture, Fletcher said the change of pace was welcome. \u201cHere I leave on time every day. I set up a book club on our estate, we have a garden and we live right next to a canal \u2013 you don\u2019t realise how little green space there is in London until you leave. When I go back now and get the tube I think to myself, \u2018I don\u2019t know how I did this for so many years\u2019.\u201d",

Raw got a 17-month driving ban but successfully completed the programme in February last year and believes it changed her life. \u201cIf I lost my kids, I don\u2019t know what would happen. I live for them. I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without them,\u201d she said. Checkpoint was willing to give people a chance, she said. \u201cThey see this person has made a mistake. I made the first mistake I\u2019d made, ever. They saw that I was willing to work with them and it changed my whole outlook on life.\u201d As part of her rehabilitation, Raw was shown footage from body-worn cameras of the moment police arrived at her upturned vehicle: \u201cI cried because that\u2019s not me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a shock to see what happened around me. It was \u2026 bad.\u201d Raw is one of 2,660 offenders to have completed Checkpoint to date, most of them having been arrested for violence, theft or criminal damage. Of that 2,660, 84% have received help for \u201cconsequential thinking\u201d; more than two-thirds have received mental health support; 58% have been supported for alcohol dependency and 38% for drugs. DI Andrew Crowe, who set up the initiative, strongly believes it reduces crime and is more cost-effective, more efficient and actually tougher on criminals than dragging them through the courts. \u201cThe fact the police are holding you to account for four months is far more onerous than going to court, pleading guilty, someone speaking on your behalf, then leaving court with a fine,\u201d he said.",

Instead, the IC clearly decided that the allegations had not been refuted, and sent them for determination by Uefa\u2019s CFCB adjudicatory chamber, which is chaired by Jos\u00e9 Narciso da Cunha Rodrigues, a former general prosecutor in Portugal and judge at the European Court of Justice, and includes a leading British barrister, <a href=\"https://www.blackstonechambers.com/barristers/charles-flint-qc/\" title=\"\">Charles Flint QC</a>.</p> <p>These public responses after the charges were laid were consistent with the second element exposed by the emails: how hostile and confrontational City had been to Uefa, and to FFP itself, throughout the process of compliance \u2013 at times distastefully so. FFP applied to all top-flight clubs across Europe competing in the Champions and Europa Leagues, seeking to encourage long-term football development and dampen player wage inflation, with detailed new regulations and a sophisticated reporting system developed by Uefa with blue-chip accountants.</p> <p>City\u2019s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, was never a major supporter of FFP, seeing it as a restraint of Mansour\u2019s freedom to rebuild City by pouring money in, but the emails showed the resistance went further. It seemed as if the hierarchy had almost taken it personally, feeling that this whole FFP system was a protectionist move to stop Mansour\u2019s extravagance challenging the established superclubs. Perhaps there was something of that in the support for FFP given by Bayern Munich and the German clubs in particular, but they were trying to maintain financial sustainability in the Bundesliga where most clubs are still ultimately controlled by supporters. They and many other clubs in Europe felt it was alien to the game\u2019s traditions for Gulf sovereign investors to buy clubs and spend their way to success.</p> <p>City perceived their plans for rapid accession to the Champions League elite were challenged by FFP, and persistently threatened a legal challenge. The club\u2019s inhouse lawyer Simon Cliff wrote in one of the published emails that Mubarak had told Gianni Infantino, then Uefa\u2019s general secretary, that he would not accept a financial sanction for exceeding the permitted \u20ac45m loss in 2012 and 2013, and said: \u201cHe would rather spend 30 million on the 50 best lawyers in the world to sue [Uefa] for the next 10 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e050189e1d8f814542a814b2e352f68d7fe0ec3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e050189e1d8f814542a814b2e352f68d7fe0ec3c/0_39_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola with Khaldoon al-Mubarak, who sees FFP as a restraint of Sheikh Mansour\u2019s freedom to rebuild City by pouring money in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola with Khaldoon al-Mubarak, who sees FFP as a restraint of Sheikh Mansour\u2019s freedom to rebuild City by pouring money in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, the IC determined that City had a deficit of \u20ac180m over that two-year period, vastly in excess of the \u20ac45m permitted, and in May that year agreed a settlement which some at Uefa believed was too lenient.

      "bodyText": "More than 200 people, including several MPs, have been contacted by health officials over fears they could have been exposed to the coronavirus at a conference in central London. Public Health England (PHE) wrote to those who were at the UK Bus Summit at the QEII Centre in Westminster on 6 February after it emerged one of the delegates had tested positive. \u201cOne of our main priorities has been to identify any people who we think have been in close contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19 to provide public health advice, as they may be at slightly increased risk of catching the virus,\u201d said Dr Yimmy Chow, a consultant in health protection at PHE. \u201cWhile the degree of contact conference delegates may have had with the case is unlikely to have been significant, we have taken a precautionary approach and informed them of the situation.\u201d Two of the MPs who attended the conference said they have decided to stay at home after health officials advised people who may be suffering to self-isolate. Lilian Greenwood and Alex Sobel, the Labour MPs for Nottingham South and Leeds North West, both said they were feeling well but had decided to cancel appointments, in line with health officials\u2019 advice. The Transport Times bus summit is an annual event, but one that attracted more enthusiastic delegates this year to the heart of Westminster after major political parties raised buses up their agenda. Before and during the day-long conference, about 250 delegates mingled over refreshments among exhibits in the small adjoining Cambridge Room. As well as transport minister Lady Vere and senior civil servants, delegates came from across the UK, including from Transport Scotland, Transport for London, major bus and rail operators, manufacturers, councils and thinktanks. A sizeable delegation came from Lagos and there were representatives from Heathrow airport and MacMillan Cancer Support, whose service users are most at risk from the virus. The news comes amid growing concerns about the spread of the virus within the UK. As of Friday, a total of 2,964 people have been tested in the country, of which 2,955 were confirmed negative and nine positive. In China, where the virus originated, the number of deaths from coronavirus has reached 1,523, with more than 66,000 recorded infections, in figures announced early on Friday morning. It also emerged on Friday that a Channel 4 employee was among those being tested for coronavirus after feeling unwell following a trip to Asia. A Channel 4 spokesman said: \u201cAs a precautionary measure, they decided to seek medical advice and, in line with the latest public health advice regarding the coronavirus, they were taken to hospital for a precautionary test.\u201d Later the same evening, Facebook said it was cancelling its global marketing summit, which was due to take place in San Francisco next month, because of coronavirus concerns. As many as eight flights at Heathrow airport were said to have been caught up in delays or checks as a result of government health officials responding to coronavirus-related concerns over passengers feeling unwell. United Airlines confirmed that staff in London had been providing assistance to a flight from San Francisco which had landed at Heathrow following reports of an individual becoming unwell onboard. A man who had been on the flight said a passenger had been taken to the back of the plane ahead of the arrival of health officials before passengers were allowed to disembark after half an hour. \u201cThere was an initial announcement that someone had taken ill and would be taken off,\u201d said Andy West, a public relations executive at Hotwire, said. \u201cShortly afterwards he said that there was a suspected case of coronavirus and that the passenger had been isolated at the back of the plane.\u201d West said the pilot had said that there were seven other planes at Heathrow experiencing similar issues, including a number in front of it on the tarmac which were due to be visited. After disembarking, passengers were asked to complete a form and were questioned about their recent travel history and symptoms. \u201cThere was no sharp intake of breath when the pilot made the second announcement but I think that a lot of people, including myself, were a bit anxious and probably worried. I really hope the person doesn\u2019t have it and that if we don\u2019t hear anything then no news will be good news,\u201d he said. The United Airlines flight which was affected was United flight 901, according to the US airline. Heathrow airport, which was unable to say how many flights had been affected, said that the airport was operating as normal. It added that PHE were managing Coronavirus-related issues on the ground, which may require some aircrafts to be slightly held up when disembarking. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working closely with Public Health England officials to facilitate their access to the airport so that they can implement their enhanced monitoring measures as a precaution. \u201cIn line with the latest Public Health England advice, we are encouraging passengers and colleagues to maintain good hand hygiene and report any suspected symptoms to NHS 111.\u201d PHE said it was not commenting on individual situations and activities at airports but added that it was carrying out \u201cenhanced monitoring\u201d of direct flights from China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau. This is in addition to the usual public health response to someone becoming unwell on a plane from any destination. Enhanced monitoring includes early warning by a pilot of any passenger illness as soon as possible and formal assurance by the captain on the health of passengers prior to disembarkation. Virgin Atlantic said it had not been affected by the reports at Heathrow on Friday. British Airways, the airline with the largest number of flights using the airport, was also approached for comment.",

Last season, F1\u2019s new generation of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc showed they were not intimidated by the 35-year-old Hamilton. Verstappen, 22 , insisted recently that with the right machinery he could beat the British driver. \u201cLewis is very good,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is definitely one of the best out there but he is not God. Maybe God is with him, but he is not God.\u201d</p> <p>At Silverstone a smiling Hamilton responded dismissively with the confidence of a driver in the form of his life. \u201cI find it funny seeing that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have just always known to do my talking on the track. I tend to see that as a sign of weakness.\u201d</p> <p>With six titles, including five in the last six years, Hamilton is within touching distance of Michael Schumacher\u2019s record tally of seven. He is also only seven wins behind Schumacher\u2019s 91 and four podiums behind the German\u2019s 155, both F1 records. During a period characterised largely by Mercedes\u2019 dominance Hamilton has won at least nine races every year for the last six years.</p> <p>The team principal, Toto Wolff, believes his driver is relishing the forthcoming fight. \u201cI perceive that he feels that he is at the peak of his abilities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that he also needs constant improvement and development in order to stay on top. The most important factor is that he loves the challenge. He loves the challenge of trying to beat the next generation of potential superstars.

      "bodyText": "Lewis Hamilton brushed off recent comments from Max Verstappen as \u201cweakness\u201d and vowed to do his talking on the track as Mercedes unveiled their new car on Friday. The British driver, chasing a record-equalling seventh Formula One title, displayed a steely determination at the car launch and is clearly eager to climb behind the wheel and take the fight to F1\u2019s young guns. Hamilton and his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, both drove the new Mercedes W11 in a shakedown at Silverstone, before the serious business of testing begins in Barcelona on Wednesday. Last season, F1\u2019s new generation of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc showed they were not intimidated by the 35-year-old Hamilton. Verstappen, 22 , insisted recently that with the right machinery he could beat the British driver. \u201cLewis is very good,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is definitely one of the best out there but he is not God. Maybe God is with him, but he is not God.\u201d At Silverstone a smiling Hamilton responded dismissively with the confidence of a driver in the form of his life. \u201cI find it funny seeing that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have just always known to do my talking on the track. I tend to see that as a sign of weakness.\u201d With six titles, including five in the last six years, Hamilton is within touching distance of Michael Schumacher\u2019s record tally of seven. He is also only seven wins behind Schumacher\u2019s 91 and four podiums behind the German\u2019s 155, both F1 records. During a period characterised largely by Mercedes\u2019 dominance Hamilton has won at least nine races every year for the last six years. The team principal, Toto Wolff, believes his driver is relishing the forthcoming fight. \u201cI perceive that he feels that he is at the peak of his abilities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that he also needs constant improvement and development in order to stay on top. The most important factor is that he loves the challenge. He loves the challenge of trying to beat the next generation of potential superstars. The tougher the challenge, the happier he is.\u201d Last season Hamilton enjoyed a blistering start to his title defence, winning eight of the opening 12 races, a run that left the opposition reeling. When the W11 hit the track for the first time, however, he maintained there was no room for complacency. \u201cI\u2019ve had the best winter training yet,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the winter, I\u2019ve really been trying to analyse where we were last year and how I can grow and improve as a driver and as a human being. I\u2019ve really been trying to focus on how can I take it to another level as a driver, how can I extract more from myself and from the team, and trying to deliver something really great this year. \u201cThis is my eighth year with this team and this year\u2019s challenge is super exciting. I have no doubt every single team member will try to raise the bar within themselves and I\u2019ll be trying to do the same.\u201d Mercedes can expect to be competitive from the off once more.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe need to know more about these figures, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the same day, Egypt reported a case, making it the first country in Africa to do so. The country\u2019s health ministry said the affected person was a foreigner who had been put into isolation at hospital, adding that the WHO had been immediately informed and that all necessary preventative measures had been taken. It did not give the nationality of the affected person or any other details.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month the WHO said it was particularly concerned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/12/african-countries-braced-for-inevitable-arrival-of-coronavirus\">high-risk nations with weaker health systems</a> that may lack the facilities to identify cases.</p> \n<p>Doctors and nurses in China are having to adopt makeshift measures to try to protect themselves in the face of dire shortages of protective gowns, gloves and masks, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctors.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">according to the New York Times</a>. Eyewitnesses told of health professionals patching up damaged protective masks with tape and reusing goggles meant to be used once and thrown away. They are wrapping their shoes in plastic bags because they have no protective covers for them.</p> \n<p>Some have used their own money to buy protective gear if they could find it for sale, or begged from friends. Others told of avoiding eating and drinking for long stretches because going to the toilet meant removing and discarding safety gowns<strong> </strong>that they would not be able to replace.</p> \n<p>Tedros pointed out that the WHO had disseminated its guidelines for protecting health workers to China and other countries with Covid-19 cases, but the critical problem in coronavirus-hit Chinese hospitals appears to be obtaining protective gear.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said that it would send 3.5 tonnes of medical protective equipment to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital\u2014 one of the hospitals at the forefront of treating patients with the virus.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/04/daily-life-in-wuhan-during-the-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">lockdown in China</a>\u2019s cities is intended to stop the virus travelling but has impeded the production and delivery of essential supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks and glove, while donations have not always got through to where they are most needed.</p> \n<p>WHO is already seeking more information from the Chinese government about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/huge-rise-coronavirus-cases-raises-doubts-scale-epidemic-china\">change in the way doctors are now diagnosing</a> Covid-19, which led to a big surge in diagnoses numbers on Thursday. An extra 15,000 cases were reported from the centre of the outbreak, Hubei province, who had all been diagnosed by a CT scan of their lungs and not a lab test.</p> \n<p>On Saturday the National Health Commission announced the total number of cases in China stood at 66,492.

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organization is seeking more information from China about the large numbers of health workers falling sick because of the coronavirus after it was revealed 1,760 of them have tested positive and six have died. This is the first time China has included the specific numbers for healthcare professionals in the data it has provided on the spread of the epidemic. \u201cThis is a critical piece of information because health workers are the glue that holds the health system and the outbreak response together,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cWe need to know more about these figures, including the time period and circumstances in which the health workers became sick.\u201d On the same day, Egypt reported a case, making it the first country in Africa to do so. The country\u2019s health ministry said the affected person was a foreigner who had been put into isolation at hospital, adding that the WHO had been immediately informed and that all necessary preventative measures had been taken. It did not give the nationality of the affected person or any other details. Earlier this month the WHO said it was particularly concerned about high-risk nations with weaker health systems that may lack the facilities to identify cases. Doctors and nurses in China are having to adopt makeshift measures to try to protect themselves in the face of dire shortages of protective gowns, gloves and masks, according to the New York Times. Eyewitnesses told of health professionals patching up damaged protective masks with tape and reusing goggles meant to be used once and thrown away. They are wrapping their shoes in plastic bags because they have no protective covers for them. Some have used their own money to buy protective gear if they could find it for sale, or begged from friends. Others told of avoiding eating and drinking for long stretches because going to the toilet meant removing and discarding safety gowns that they would not be able to replace. Tedros pointed out that the WHO had disseminated its guidelines for protecting health workers to China and other countries with Covid-19 cases, but the critical problem in coronavirus-hit Chinese hospitals appears to be obtaining protective gear. On Friday, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said that it would send 3.5 tonnes of medical protective equipment to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital\u2014 one of the hospitals at the forefront of treating patients with the virus. The lockdown in China\u2019s cities is intended to stop the virus travelling but has impeded the production and delivery of essential supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks and glove, while donations have not always got through to where they are most needed. WHO is already seeking more information from the Chinese government about the change in the way doctors are now diagnosing Covid-19, which led to a big surge in diagnoses numbers on Thursday. An extra 15,000 cases were reported from the centre of the outbreak, Hubei province, who had all been diagnosed by a CT scan of their lungs and not a lab test. On Saturday the National Health Commission announced the total number of cases in China stood at 66,492. Deaths from the virus stood at 1,523. The total cases included lab-confirmed Covid-19 and clinically diagnosed cases by doctors. Tedros said they needed to know doctors were not misdiagnosing other infections as the coronavirus. \u201cWhile it is not uncommon in outbreaks for clinical definitions to change over time as more information becomes available, we are seeking further clarification on how the clinical diagnosis is being made, to ensure that other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the Covid-19 data,\u201d he said. US experts will be part of an international team that will arrive in China at the weekend to hold talks with their counterparts, the WHO said. The confirmation followed calls from a senior White House official for Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak and its change in the reported data, as Chinese authorities expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to limit its spread. \u201cWe\u2019re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council. China\u2019s national health commission\u2019s vice-director, Zeng Yixina, confirmed that more than 1,700 Chinese medical workers had been infected and six had died, adding that the commission was \u201chighly concerned about this issue\u201d and had issued guidelines for the prevention and control of infection within medical institutions. Healthcare workers accounted for about 3.8% of confirmed cases as of three days ago, Zeng said. The death toll stands at 1,383. Three deaths were outside of mainland China: in Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines. Singapore confirmed nine new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 67, while in Japan, the health ministry said 11 elderly passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess were allowed to leave the vessel after they tested negative. While public health experts have greeted the change in reporting positively, others say it raises more questions about the data. The change in diagnostic criteria has been applied only to Hubei province. \u201cIs the politburo really being honest with us?\u201d Kudlow asked, referring to communist China\u2019s top leadership body. Kudlow said President Xi Jinping had assured Donald Trump that Beijing would accept US help, but \u201cthey won\u2019t let us\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their motives are. I do know that apparently more and more people are suffering over there,\u201d he said. At a meeting of senior leaders in Beijing on Thursday, officials called for other areas to \u201cadopt quarantine and rescue measures equal to that of Wuhan\u201d, which has been under lockdown for the past three weeks.

      "body": "<p>Coup de foudre. In France, that\u2019s how we say love at first sight. Translated literally, though, it means \u201cthunderbolt\u201d, or \u201clightening strike\u201d. Good grief. Love doesn\u2019t get more dramatic than that.</p> <p>A coup de foudre is the apex love experience in romantic western myth; it\u2019s when Eros marks you out, takes aim, draws back his bow and lets his arrow fly. <em>Thunk</em>. You are struck. In the heart. A much idealised experience \u2013 why, I\u2019m not sure, because this one single love event can\u2019t be love at all. It\u2019s something else, I believe, an inner psychological phenomenon. Jung says it\u2019s when the anima or animus complex is triggered, suddenly and mysteriously, and then \u2013 shazam - you see yourself in the opposite gender. A divine narcissism. Some kind of flag is raised and some inner part of the self recognises the signal, as though a flare is shot up \u2026 into the universe: you\u2019ve sighted \u201canother\u201d as a romantic ideal. That\u2019s the version I most buy. It is when you recognise your chosen beloved, your \u201csoul mate\u201d. You think you\u2019ve met \u201cthe one\u201d \u2026 but is \u201cthe one\u201d you\u2019ve met really some complex mix of yourself in opposite and those who cared for you as a child, or didn\u2019t? Is our beloved what psychologists call <em>the imago</em>, ie, an image of the first ever one who loved us (or not): our mother or father?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A coup de foudre is not always a comfortable experience. A god has wounded you in the heart, on purpose, for his pleasure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idea is that we all have this complex ideal lover buried deep inside. We tend, in adulthood, to romantically fixate on \u201ca type\u201d of love object already buried deep, from very early on. So, it follows, the one we are waiting to meet, we actually know well. Ergo, we\u2019ve already met our beloved before we\u2019ve met him, or her, or them. We\u2019re just looking for this same person again.</p> <p>My father, for example, was an aloof, emotionally distant, charismatic alpha male. It\u2019s no surprise that this is \u201cmy type\u201d of man. When I was younger, this type of man again and again raised the flag of animus. My chakras all lit up in a row. Poof. Imagine how cute and alluring that is, a woman flashing all her chakras, involuntarily, at a man. A Shakti a-twinkling, behind a potted plant, trying to act normal and cover up a kind of outbreak from within. <em>That\u2019s him</em>. Many people blush profusely when they meet \u201cthe one\u201d (of course, we fancy the one rotten), or get flustered. Others find themselves struck dumb, unable to speak coherently. A coup de foudre is not always a comfortable experience. Why should it be? It might change the course of your life. A god has wounded you in the heart, on purpose, for his pleasure. Some people stare. The heart rate can gallop. We can be rendered stupid. Sound familiar? Never mind. I was forever oddly and embarrassingly propelled towards this surly, hard to know, alpha type of male, a man I knew very well.

      "bodyText": "Coup de foudre. In France, that\u2019s how we say love at first sight. Translated literally, though, it means \u201cthunderbolt\u201d, or \u201clightening strike\u201d. Good grief. Love doesn\u2019t get more dramatic than that. A coup de foudre is the apex love experience in romantic western myth; it\u2019s when Eros marks you out, takes aim, draws back his bow and lets his arrow fly. Thunk. You are struck. In the heart. A much idealised experience \u2013 why, I\u2019m not sure, because this one single love event can\u2019t be love at all. It\u2019s something else, I believe, an inner psychological phenomenon. Jung says it\u2019s when the anima or animus complex is triggered, suddenly and mysteriously, and then \u2013 shazam - you see yourself in the opposite gender. A divine narcissism. Some kind of flag is raised and some inner part of the self recognises the signal, as though a flare is shot up \u2026 into the universe: you\u2019ve sighted \u201canother\u201d as a romantic ideal. That\u2019s the version I most buy. It is when you recognise your chosen beloved, your \u201csoul mate\u201d. You think you\u2019ve met \u201cthe one\u201d \u2026 but is \u201cthe one\u201d you\u2019ve met really some complex mix of yourself in opposite and those who cared for you as a child, or didn\u2019t? Is our beloved what psychologists call the imago, ie, an image of the first ever one who loved us (or not): our mother or father? The idea is that we all have this complex ideal lover buried deep inside. We tend, in adulthood, to romantically fixate on \u201ca type\u201d of love object already buried deep, from very early on. So, it follows, the one we are waiting to meet, we actually know well. Ergo, we\u2019ve already met our beloved before we\u2019ve met him, or her, or them.

      "bodyText": "The House of Commons\u2019 former official photographer, responsible for famous front page images of the last two year\u2019s Brexit drama, has had his home raided by police after a clash with parliamentary authorities. Officers from the Metropolitan police turned up at Mark Duffy\u2019s London home on Wednesday morning with a court order allowing them to search for parliamentary \u201cPugin-designed furniture, candlesticks, ceramics, clocks or lamps\u201d. However, the only items police seized were a plastic sign bearing former Brexit secretary David Davis\u2019s name and a piece of fabric with the insignia of Portcullis House. \u201cIt was about 8am and I went to the door and there were eight police and a police van. They told me they were looking for furniture from the House of Commons and a lamp. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Duffy. He said the police spent two hours searching his home but the only thing that they seized were the sign, which he had \u201cretrieved from a bin\u201d, and the piece of cloth. The photographer, who lives in south London, was sacked from his post last September for allegedly bringing parliament into disrepute over social media posts and use of abstract images in an art exhibition. \u201cI like to think of myself as a decent person. That they leapt to the conclusion that I would steal after working in parliament for five years is shocking. \u201cHow did they think I got an armchair out of parliament?\u201d he said. The Met confirmed they had \u201creceived a report of theft from the Houses of Parliament\u201d on 31 January. \u201cIt was reported that a number of items had allegedly been stolen from the Palace of Westminster by a former employee. On Wednesday 12 February a search warrant was carried out an address in Lambeth. No arrests were made.\u201d Duffy says he has suffered acute stress and shock since the raid including tremors and has consulted with a lawyer over his rights. Mark Lewis of Patron Law said: \u201cI have been instructed by Mr Duffy to take action in respect of the harassment and abuse that has been dished out in a clear misuse of executive powers.\u201d The clash with his former employers is a chilling turn of events after the drama of last year when his photographs were frequently used on newspapers\u2019 front pages. His images of Theresa May, John Bercow, Boris Johnson and many others captured the tumult and highly charged exchanges of the last two years in parliament and were dubbed \u201caccidental renaissance\u201d in some quarters for their composition and dramatic content Among the most famous was one of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, education secretary, Damian Hinds, and other MPs including Jo Churchill beseeching Bercow to watch a video of Jeremy Corbyn who was alleged to have muttered the words \u201cstupid woman\u201d in a heated exchange with May. But he clashed with authorities last year who alleged his social media posts \u201cpaint parliament in a negative light and breach impartiality rules\u201d and a private art exhibition themed around Brexit that he mounted was of a \u201cpolitical nature which was breach of impartiality rules\u201d. At issue, Duffy suspects, was his determination to ensure still photographers working in the chamber in the House of Commons had the same rights as TV cameras. While he had \u201crolling permission\u201d to release photos to the media, he said things started \u201cgoing south\u201d after an argument over a photograph of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq who was forced to abandon a scheduled caesarean to vote against May\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cThey stopped us releasing that picture on the grounds she did not look well, but it was used as a screen grab from the TV filming, so it didn\u2019t make sense\u201d. Subsequently he found he was having regular arguments over what the photographers could do and felt he was rubbing up against the enormous power of the institution. Last summer he was off work due to stress-related illness and in September was sacked from his job while on leave. His letter of dismissal acknowledges that he had cited sick leave for not attending disciplinary hearings. Duffy also says that the police raid indicates the House of Commons were still monitoring his social media. \u201cIt is creepy. I have been subjected to outright harassment ever since last year and it\u2019s been exhausting,\u201d he said. A House of Commons spokesperson said it could \u201cnot comment on individual HR matters\u201d. They added: \u201cThe House of Commons has extensive policies in place to protect both staff and managers should allegations of misconduct arise.

Now more than ever we need policy coherence and an agenda that remains poverty- and people-focused.</p> <p>If we do not achieve this, the government risks undoing the decades\u2019 worth of work that the UK has done to tackle the drivers of poverty, climate change and conflict. DfID needs stability so it can get on with the job of ensuring that the world\u2019s most vulnerable people get the support they need. A healthier, more sustainable and more equal planet is in all of our best interests.<br><strong>Stephanie Draper</strong><br><em>CEO, Bond \u2013 the UK network for NGOs</em></p> <p>\u2022 In 27BC, Octavian took over a political system whose unwritten constitution had been all but broken by abuses and shenanigans that showed contempt for the essential spirit that had glued it together. In speciously claiming to be the restorer of the old ways and a true representative of the populace, he made a number of dramatic power grabs that centralised all authority in a new imperial palace.</p> <p>Plus \u00e7a change, it seems. Perhaps today\u2019s political commentators should start paying a little more attention to their classics.<br><strong>Isaac Leaver</strong><br><em>Shanghai, China</em></p> <p>\u2022 Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by Julian Smith\u2019s sacking. After all, he only played a leading role in restoring the Stormont institutions, was held in high regard by most parties in Northern Ireland and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/boris-johnson-reshuffle-whos-in-whos-out-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">as you report</a>, \u201cwas regarded as a very good secretary of state with a grip on complex problems\u201d. Clearly not the sort of person Johnson would want in his cabinet when the minor issues of leaving the EU and Northern Ireland\u2019s future status are yet to be resolved.<br><strong>Declan O\u2019Neill</strong><br><em>Oldham, Greater Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Now that our country\u2019s leader has shown such steely resolve in firing underperforming ministers, shouldn\u2019t Mr Cummings be looking at the performance of Mr Johnson? Described as the worst foreign secretary since Edward Grey, he jumped last time before being pushed, but our leader should allow him no graceful exit this time. That little list needs to be a little bigger.<br><strong>Roger Macy</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The appointment of George Eustice as environment secretary may not be good news. If you check back on what the then farming minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/brexit-spirit-crushing-green-directives-minister-george-eustice\" title=\"\">said just before the referendum</a>, you\u2019ll find he was in favour of tearing up all EU environmental directives and starting out on something more flexible to suit farmers (he is a farmer himself, of course). At the time, Boris Johnson\u2019s father spoke out against him.<br><strong>Jeffrey Butcher</strong><br><em>Morecambe, Lancashire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Slightly less than 10% of the new cabinet have a science degree. One is Alok Sharma, who did physics in the 1980s but never worked in science. The other is Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey (DWP) who has a PhD in chemistry. Anne-Marie Trevelyan read maths. A couple did not attend university and the rest did humanities. And that\u2019s it, as we confront the humanity\u2019s biggest ever science challenge.</p> <p>We worry about the gender, race and private/state-school balance.

      "bodyText": "Although much reshuffle reportage has focused on the chancellor\u2019s resignation and the revenge sackings of a number of ministers, other developments do not augur well given that our prime minister does all he can to avoid scrutiny. There should be widespread alarm that the MP appointed to the most senior legal post within government has expressed a desire to \u201ctake back control\u201d from the judiciary, especially so in the light of Boris Johnson\u2019s unlawful prorogation and the subsequent dark mutterings about treachery by judges and their interference in the conduct of government policy (Braverman wins favour with vow to \u2018take back control\u2019 from judiciary, 14 February). We must hope that opposition parties will use the half-term break to good effect to devise a joint strategy to disrupt and obstruct the drive towards removing accountability and scrutiny \u2013 oh, and when will the Russia report that Johnson has suppressed be published? Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 In the past 12 months the Department for International Development has had four secretaries of state, and DfID now has seven joint ministers. Now more than ever we need policy coherence and an agenda that remains poverty- and people-focused. If we do not achieve this, the government risks undoing the decades\u2019 worth of work that the UK has done to tackle the drivers of poverty, climate change and conflict. DfID needs stability so it can get on with the job of ensuring that the world\u2019s most vulnerable people get the support they need. A healthier, more sustainable and more equal planet is in all of our best interests. Stephanie Draper CEO, Bond \u2013 the UK network for NGOs \u2022 In 27BC, Octavian took over a political system whose unwritten constitution had been all but broken by abuses and shenanigans that showed contempt for the essential spirit that had glued it together. In speciously claiming to be the restorer of the old ways and a true representative of the populace, he made a number of dramatic power grabs that centralised all authority in a new imperial palace. Plus \u00e7a change, it seems. Perhaps today\u2019s political commentators should start paying a little more attention to their classics. Isaac Leaver Shanghai, China \u2022 Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by Julian Smith\u2019s sacking. After all, he only played a leading role in restoring the Stormont institutions, was held in high regard by most parties in Northern Ireland and, as you report, \u201cwas regarded as a very good secretary of state with a grip on complex problems\u201d. Clearly not the sort of person Johnson would want in his cabinet when the minor issues of leaving the EU and Northern Ireland\u2019s future status are yet to be resolved. Declan O\u2019Neill Oldham, Greater Manchester \u2022 Now that our country\u2019s leader has shown such steely resolve in firing underperforming ministers, shouldn\u2019t Mr Cummings be looking at the performance of Mr Johnson? Described as the worst foreign secretary since Edward Grey, he jumped last time before being pushed, but our leader should allow him no graceful exit this time. That little list needs to be a little bigger. Roger Macy London \u2022 The appointment of George Eustice as environment secretary may not be good news. If you check back on what the then farming minister said just before the referendum, you\u2019ll find he was in favour of tearing up all EU environmental directives and starting out on something more flexible to suit farmers (he is a farmer himself, of course). At the time, Boris Johnson\u2019s father spoke out against him. Jeffrey Butcher Morecambe, Lancashire \u2022 Slightly less than 10% of the new cabinet have a science degree. One is Alok Sharma, who did physics in the 1980s but never worked in science. The other is Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey (DWP) who has a PhD in chemistry. Anne-Marie Trevelyan read maths. A couple did not attend university and the rest did humanities. And that\u2019s it, as we confront the humanity\u2019s biggest ever science challenge. We worry about the gender, race and private/state-school balance. This is a far greater problem. Tim Crossley London \u2022 I agree with Polly Toynbee that the removal of Sajid Javid reveals Boris Johnson\u2019s ruthless craving for absolute power (Journal, 14 February). But the replacement of Javid by the talented Rishi Sunak (and the promotion of Alok Sharma to business and energy secretary) emphasises that, although Labour preaches equal opportunity, bizarrely it is the Tories who have produced two women PMs and readily promote ethnic minorities to positions of real power. Whoever wins the Labour leadership must ensure their actions speak louder than their words. Stan Labovitch Windsor \u2022 Good leaders keep their friends close and their enemies closer.

They\u2019d do well to remember Geoffrey Howe. Alistair Wood Oswestry, Shropshire \u2022 Polly Toynbee\u2019s effective onslaught on \u201cthe most under-brained, third-rate cabinet in living memory\u201d does seem to suggest that Michael Gove might be the one independent-minded minister capable of challenging the absolute power. But remember, it was Gove who created the svengali who ruined our education system and is now engaged in ruining our state.

Dependent on how our economy changes over time, it may be a zero-sum game or it may not, or it may fluctuate between the two. In order to assess what is happening, we must look at more than just the GDP per capita.

      "body": "<p>The life in law of Leonard Woodley, who has died aged 92, was a catalogue of the most famous British race trials of the late 20th century, from those related to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/09/riots-1981-2011-differences\" title=\"\">riots</a> in Notting Hill, Tottenham, Brixton and St Paul\u2019s, Bristol, in the 1980s, to the famous cases of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\" title=\"\">Mangrove Nine</a> (1970) and the Newham Eight (1983). The first Afro-Caribbean barrister in Britain to become a Queen\u2019s counsel, a recorder (part-time judge, 1989-2000) of the crown court and a bencher of the Inner Temple, he was a barrister adviser to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Scarman</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/24/from-the-observer-archive-1981-brixton-riots\" title=\"\">inquiry into the Brixton riots</a> and was counsel in many murder trials where racism was an element.</p> <p>On a wider canvas he also chaired the 1995 Laudat inquiry, which investigated and reported on <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/blunders-allowed-schizophrenic-to-kill-1602913.html\" title=\"\">a shocking murder</a> committed by a mentally ill patient released into the community with inadequate supervision. In 1997 he was appointed to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/feb/25/interview-stewart-sutherland\" title=\"\">royal commission on long-term care of the elderly</a>, established by the Labour government to try to find a way forward on care provision. It was a source of deep regret to him that the recommendations of the commission\u2019s report were ignored.</p> <p>Len\u2019s quiet, unshowy dedication to the improvement of civil liberties extended to the securing of equal opportunities for young black and Asian lawyers, and at the Inner Temple he established a scholarship in his name to that end. For 12 years from 1988 he was the <a href=\"https://1mcb.com/len-woodley-qc-a-tribute/\" title=\"\">head of John Benson\u2019s chambers</a>, now known as 1MCB \u2013 the most ethnically diverse chambers at the bar. He was also made a QC in 1988, and that year he invited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/nelson-mandela-obituary\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela</a>, who was then serving a life sentence, to be an honorary door tenant, giving his name a place on the board at the entrance. Mandela accepted, and it stayed there until he became president of South Africa in 1994.</p> <p>Born in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad, Len was the son of Leonard Woodley, a bandleader, and his wife, Ethel Owen Fleming, a businesswoman. They separated when he was young, and he was brought up by his strict paternal grandmother. He played the trumpet and piano in the school orchestra at the elite St Mary\u2019s college in Port of Spain and was a good all-round sportsman. However, later he occasionally spoke of his loneliness and sense of abandonment as a child, as well as his feeling that the teacher priests at his school had failed to nurture his academic ambitions.</p> <p>Initially he worked as a clerk and then a commercial administrator in Trinidad, where he met and married a work colleague, Lorna Bridgemohan; they went on to have five children. However, having long harboured the desire to study law, in 1960 he sailed to the UK. His marriage could not withstand the separation and he and Lorna were divorced not long afterwards.</p> <p>After taking a diploma in international affairs at the University of London he joined the Inner Temple as a barrister pupil and was called to the bar in 1963, working in the chambers of Dingle Foot, who, like his brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michael-foot\" title=\"\">Michael Foot</a>, was a Labour MP. In the early years of practice Len had his own experiences of discrimination on the grounds of race, most notably when two of his friends from the Caribbean, who were studying law, were arrested on charges of being \u201csuspected persons\u201d after leaving the Hampstead home of the great West Indies cricketer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/aug/08/4\" title=\"\">Sir Learie Constantine</a>. They were eventually cleared after an appeal conducted by Dingle Foot at Len\u2019s request. Thereafter Len became a regular advocate in such cases.</p> <p>He also had tales of being stopped by the police while driving his glamorous open-top car \u2013 \u201cdriving while black\u201d as he termed it \u2013 or the occasion when a senior judge asked a porter at the Inner Temple to find out why a black man was parking in the lot reserved for benchers.</p> <p>Once when sitting as a judge, Len threw on his raincoat and rushed to the bank during the lunch hour to get some cash. The teller looked at the cheque and bank card in the name of Leonard Woodley QC and slipped away; within moments the doors of the bank had been closed and he was escorted into the manager\u2019s office. No one believed he could be a QC until he opened his coat to show his court attire, told the security men to unhand him, stood to his full height and silently left the bank.</p> <p>However, his most painful experience of racism came from the father of his second wife, Jennifer Bishop. Objecting to their inter-racial marriage in the 1970s, he cut off all contact with the couple, refused to allow her family to attend the wedding, and would never agree to meet either Len or, later, their son, Jason. Len\u2019s marriage to Jenny eventually ended in divorce. He also had long relationships with Marion Cooper, with whom he had a son, Adrian, and with the actor Jane Lapotaire.</p> <p>Although a popular man with a rich cultural and sporting life \u2013 attending the Royal Opera House, watching cricket at Lord\u2019s as a member of the MCC and playing tennis at the Globe club in Hampstead \u2013 Len was a deeply private individual.</p> <p>He was greatly affected by the death of Jason in an accident on the London Underground in 1993, as well as that of Marion in 1999, and those of two of his children in Trinidad, Leslie and Lisa.</p> <p>He is survived by his sister, Judith, his children, Leonard, Lance and Laura, from his first marriage, and Adrian. </p> <p>\u2022 Leonard Gaston Woodley, barrister, born 13 September 1927; died 19 January 2020</p>",

      "bodyText": "The life in law of Leonard Woodley, who has died aged 92, was a catalogue of the most famous British race trials of the late 20th century, from those related to riots in Notting Hill, Tottenham, Brixton and St Paul\u2019s, Bristol, in the 1980s, to the famous cases of the Mangrove Nine (1970) and the Newham Eight (1983). The first Afro-Caribbean barrister in Britain to become a Queen\u2019s counsel, a recorder (part-time judge, 1989-2000) of the crown court and a bencher of the Inner Temple, he was a barrister adviser to the Scarman inquiry into the Brixton riots and was counsel in many murder trials where racism was an element. On a wider canvas he also chaired the 1995 Laudat inquiry, which investigated and reported on a shocking murder committed by a mentally ill patient released into the community with inadequate supervision. In 1997 he was appointed to the royal commission on long-term care of the elderly, established by the Labour government to try to find a way forward on care provision. It was a source of deep regret to him that the recommendations of the commission\u2019s report were ignored. Len\u2019s quiet, unshowy dedication to the improvement of civil liberties extended to the securing of equal opportunities for young black and Asian lawyers, and at the Inner Temple he established a scholarship in his name to that end. For 12 years from 1988 he was the head of John Benson\u2019s chambers, now known as 1MCB \u2013 the most ethnically diverse chambers at the bar. He was also made a QC in 1988, and that year he invited Nelson Mandela, who was then serving a life sentence, to be an honorary door tenant, giving his name a place on the board at the entrance. Mandela accepted, and it stayed there until he became president of South Africa in 1994. Born in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad, Len was the son of Leonard Woodley, a bandleader, and his wife, Ethel Owen Fleming, a businesswoman. They separated when he was young, and he was brought up by his strict paternal grandmother. He played the trumpet and piano in the school orchestra at the elite St Mary\u2019s college in Port of Spain and was a good all-round sportsman. However, later he occasionally spoke of his loneliness and sense of abandonment as a child, as well as his feeling that the teacher priests at his school had failed to nurture his academic ambitions. Initially he worked as a clerk and then a commercial administrator in Trinidad, where he met and married a work colleague, Lorna Bridgemohan; they went on to have five children. However, having long harboured the desire to study law, in 1960 he sailed to the UK. His marriage could not withstand the separation and he and Lorna were divorced not long afterwards. After taking a diploma in international affairs at the University of London he joined the Inner Temple as a barrister pupil and was called to the bar in 1963, working in the chambers of Dingle Foot, who, like his brother, Michael Foot, was a Labour MP. In the early years of practice Len had his own experiences of discrimination on the grounds of race, most notably when two of his friends from the Caribbean, who were studying law, were arrested on charges of being \u201csuspected persons\u201d after leaving the Hampstead home of the great West Indies cricketer Sir Learie Constantine. They were eventually cleared after an appeal conducted by Dingle Foot at Len\u2019s request. Thereafter Len became a regular advocate in such cases. He also had tales of being stopped by the police while driving his glamorous open-top car \u2013 \u201cdriving while black\u201d as he termed it \u2013 or the occasion when a senior judge asked a porter at the Inner Temple to find out why a black man was parking in the lot reserved for benchers. Once when sitting as a judge, Len threw on his raincoat and rushed to the bank during the lunch hour to get some cash. The teller looked at the cheque and bank card in the name of Leonard Woodley QC and slipped away; within moments the doors of the bank had been closed and he was escorted into the manager\u2019s office. No one believed he could be a QC until he opened his coat to show his court attire, told the security men to unhand him, stood to his full height and silently left the bank. However, his most painful experience of racism came from the father of his second wife, Jennifer Bishop. Objecting to their inter-racial marriage in the 1970s, he cut off all contact with the couple, refused to allow her family to attend the wedding, and would never agree to meet either Len or, later, their son, Jason. Len\u2019s marriage to Jenny eventually ended in divorce. He also had long relationships with Marion Cooper, with whom he had a son, Adrian, and with the actor Jane Lapotaire. Although a popular man with a rich cultural and sporting life \u2013 attending the Royal Opera House, watching cricket at Lord\u2019s as a member of the MCC and playing tennis at the Globe club in Hampstead \u2013 Len was a deeply private individual. He was greatly affected by the death of Jason in an accident on the London Underground in 1993, as well as that of Marion in 1999, and those of two of his children in Trinidad, Leslie and Lisa. He is survived by his sister, Judith, his children, Leonard, Lance and Laura, from his first marriage, and Adrian. \u2022 Leonard Gaston Woodley, barrister, born 13 September 1927; died 19 January 2020",

Telegraph Media Group (TMG), the parent of the titles, said it had not requested the placement change, suggesting it is being used as a negotiating tactic. In addition, WH Smith has suggested to store managers that the vacant Telegraph position in the \u201cnews\u201d section be filled with copies of its closest rival, the Times. \u201cThe Daily Telegraph is a long established newspaper with a reputation for quality journalism and should be displayed alongside other newspapers,\u201d said a spokeswoman for TMG. \u201cWe have never requested that any retailer move or sell the newspaper within its magazine section.\u201d WH Smith, which has more than 500 high street stores and 590 travel stores across the UK, refused to comment on whether the company took the decision to relocate the Telegraph titles, which was first reported by the Financial Times. \u201cThe Telegraph is easily accessible to all customers as part of our news and current affairs offering,\u201d she said. The stores have been told to keep the Telegraph in the magazines section \u201cuntil further notice\u201d. About a third of the Telegraph\u2019s total circulation, which includes subscriptions, comes from sales in newsagents, convenience stores and bigger chains such as WH Smith and supermarkets. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s circulation stands at about 317,000 copies a day, with the Sunday Telegraph at 248,288, according to the last official figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). Relations between WH Smith and the Telegraph have changed since the arrival of Nick Hugh, TMG\u2019s chief executive, in 2017 from Yahoo. In October, the Daily Telegraph scrapped its promotional deal with WH Smith in which copies of its newspaper were given away with bottles of water. Hugh has shaken up the Telegraph, moving from a focus on print sales to a subscription model, both in print and online. In October 2018, the Telegraph started to put most of its politics, business and rugby coverage behind its premium paywall as it began a process of dramatically cutting freely accessible content, in a move towards the successful model operated by the New York Times.

I think we have to generate some defensive stability, but not by defending deep. I don\u2019t like that. It\u2019s by defending high and pressing the opponent as much as possible. But the process - together as many times as possible in the most efficient way - has to be done properly from here. If not in two passes when you arrive there, that transition is impossible to control because you are too far from the opponent. So we need to do that well first to after be able to generate and sustain our attacks as many times as possible during the games.\u201d</p> \n  <p><em>What did the squad work on in Dubai, during their winter break?</em></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt was like a mini pre-season for us in Dubai, we had time to work on a lot of our principles: how we want to set up against different formations, the relevant things we need to work on [both] on and off the ball and apart from that it was great to be together and spend some time together, get to know each other, not just the players but the staff and the backroom staff as well. It was a very productive trip.\u201d</p> \n  <p><em>Has he started planning for the summer?</em></p> \n  <p>\u201cAbsolutely. We have to plan and we need to know the direction we want to head and with that we need to bear in mind different scenarios and with that in mind, I have to tell the club what we need, where we think we can improve and where we want to end. And if we all end with the same thing, we put a plan together to try and execute it and make the process as short as possible.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e46afc38f086a28115abc81\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T14:34:23.396Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The hits keep on coming</strong>, as far as press conferences are concerned.

In Germany we have four-five weeks and I\u2019m lazy! But it was good to be able to calm things down. We had three complete days off but then were back on the training pitch to prepare for the following weeks and months. We never had a full week to prepare in the Championship. Liverpool have had enough time to prepare as well and will be switched on.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnfield [where they lost 4-1 at the start of the season] was a huge task for us but we showed that when we are good at our topics we are competitive. We created chances and should have been more clinical and switched on. There is always hope. Everything can happen in one game. In 20 games Liverpool will probably win the most, but our game against Man City showed that when we\u2019re good at our topics we can beat them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to bring the mental attitude to the group, whether fighting for promotion or relegation. I\u2019m responsible for man management and leading the group. I admire J\u00fcrgen Klopp because they were so successful last season, but are still so consistent and greedy.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTeams often choose to sit deep against Liverpool, but they\u2019re too strong against that in counter-attacks. If not, they\u2019ll score from a set piece with [Virgil] Van Dijk. We have to have periods on the front foot, dominating possession and be fully aware there will be periods we have to be solid defending.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T13:52:17.574Z\">at 1.52pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e46a3a18f086a28115abc14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T13:44:19.650Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Lampard (continued) on Monday\u2019s match against Manchester United: </em>\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to open up a gap against a rival and we need to take that chance ... it\u2019s a game we want to win, you can\u2019t control certain factors, but you can control how you go into it.

Spurs, by the by, have won on their last five visits to face Villa at Villa Park at an aggregate score of 14-1. Hello all. We\u2019re on the final straight. Let\u2019s kick off with your bumper* Friday edition of the Fiver: *may not be bumper That will be all from me today - thanks for reading, and for sending love on email and Twitter - I\u2019m handing over to my colleague John Ashdown, who will steer you even closer to this weekend\u2019s footballing action. Bye for now. As reported here earlier on, Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has his Valentine\u2019s Day evening plans well sorted: \u201cSomething like Wolves against Leicester, then maybe a nice takeaway, then Love Island on ITV + 1.\u201d Lucky Christine! A couple of match previews for you here - leaders Liverpool v rock-bottom Norwich: And Southampton v Burnley, a chance for one of these clubs to climb into the top half: \u201cI say what I think and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not the easiest guy for some coaches.\u201d Get to know a bit more about new Chelsea signing Hakim Ziyech, thanks to Bart Vlietstra: Back to that Manchester United press conference ... In France - in Monaco to be precise - there is a match tonight which will have an impact on the race for Champions League qualification. Seventh-placed Monaco (35 points) host fifth-placed Montpellier (37 points). Lille, Rennes and Marseille sit fourth, third and second respectively, and of course PSG are running away with the league with 61 points - 12 ahead of nearest challengers Marseille. Suitably earth-shattering quotes from Monaco defender Fod\u00e9 Ballo-Tour\u00e9 ahead of this one: \u201cWinning? Of course it\u2019s good for the team. We have to string together the wins and we are working towards that. Now we want to get closer to the top of the table.\u201d Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r says on-loan striker Odion Ighalo may make his debut against Chelsea on Monday: \u201cHe\u2019ll be involved with us and he\u2019ll travel down with us and, obviously, now he\u2019s out of that two-week period of precaution and it\u2019s a precaution we\u2019ve made,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe\u2019ll travel with us and let\u2019s see if he\u2019s involved or not. \u201cHe\u2019s done his [training programme] and it was always going to be a case of him having to integrate into the group anyway after having been out in China. He needs to get used to the players and the team and up to speed as quick as he can. \u201cOdion can help the club. He is a very professional player, a good lad and he\u2019ll give something to the group.\u201d Quotes thanks to manutd.com Over at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s social media dept. they\u2019ve put together a Valentine\u2019s Day video which mainly consists of players kicking each other to classical music: The Axel Witsel social media dept., meanwhile, have told his fans on Twitter that Dortmund will get the result they need against Eintracht Frankfurt this evening. Third-placed Dortmund sit four points off the pace set by leaders Bayern Munich, and three behind second-placed RB Leipzig: Here\u2019s a social media snippet of Inter Milan strike duo Romelo Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez cuddling, for Valentine\u2019s Day and all that ... Words from Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be coming up as soon as humanly possible, by the way. The IOC have insisted that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be going ahead, despite the increasingly worrying Coronavirus outbreak. There are men\u2019s and women\u2019s football tournaments as part of the Olympics, of course, with 16 men\u2019s teams due to compete and 12 women\u2019s teams. Sean Ingle reports: Earlier mention of Tony Cottee (one of only two players to score on PL goals on Valentine\u2019s Day and Halloween, along with Jamie Vardy) got me thinking of my first-ever visit to a football match, West Ham v Nottingham Forest at Upton Park, all the way back in 1987. A youthful Cottee scored twice, including a fairly sensational bicycle kick: I\u2019ll be here for the next hour to serve your weekend football countdown needs. Any burning issues that need discussing? Get in touch on email or on Twitter, as above. It seems Belgium, Croatia, Portugal and Switzerland are all off to Qatar at the end of March for the inaugural \u2018Qatar Airways International Tournament\u2019: Always good to squeeze a few friendly fixtures into the sparse playing schedule, I\u2019d say. EXCLUSIVE! At the team\u2019s winter training camp in Marbella, Manchester United granted access to ... their own media team: By the way, it seems that Manchester United press conference has been shifted to 3.15pm GMT. \u201cFor me it was quite an easy conversation.\u201d Barry Glendenning has the full story on how Spurs manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho dealt with Dele Alli\u2019s recent social media controversy: Some thoughts here from Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta in his press conference - thanks to www.arsenal.com - Has he had to sacrifice attacking flair for defensive solidity since taking over? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think we have to generate some defensive stability, but not by defending deep. I don\u2019t like that. It\u2019s by defending high and pressing the opponent as much as possible. But the process - together as many times as possible in the most efficient way - has to be done properly from here. If not in two passes when you arrive there, that transition is impossible to control because you are too far from the opponent. So we need to do that well first to after be able to generate and sustain our attacks as many times as possible during the games.\u201d What did the squad work on in Dubai, during their winter break? \u201cIt was like a mini pre-season for us in Dubai, we had time to work on a lot of our principles: how we want to set up against different formations, the relevant things we need to work on [both] on and off the ball and apart from that it was great to be together and spend some time together, get to know each other, not just the players but the staff and the backroom staff as well. It was a very productive trip.\u201d Has he started planning for the summer? \u201cAbsolutely. We have to plan and we need to know the direction we want to head and with that we need to bear in mind different scenarios and with that in mind, I have to tell the club what we need, where we think we can improve and where we want to end. And if we all end with the same thing, we put a plan together to try and execute it and make the process as short as possible.\u201d The hits keep on coming, as far as press conferences are concerned. Manchester United will be ticking the media box in a little over 10 minutes ahead of Monday night\u2019s meeting with Chelsea in London. The former England captain Dave Watson has a neurodegenerative disease that was \u201cmost likely\u201d brought on by head injuries and repeated heading of the ball during his playing days, his wife has said in a statement released to the PA news agency: Let\u2019s head briefly to Japan, where the imminent kick-off of the J-League has had players, managers, and player-managers on media duty today. Striker Kazuyoshi Miura of Yokohama FC (right) is still going strong at the age of 52 (!!!). He made his professional debut all the way back in 1986. The man on the left, of course, is Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, who is now 35. So he was a mere two years old when Miura ran on to a pitch as a professional for the first time. More evidence, if it were needed, of the health-giving benefits of the Japanese diet and general way of life. Sad news from Gigg Lane, where it appears the club are heading for liquidation. They were promoted to League One for this season, but then expelled from the Football League owing to their financial difficulties. David Conn reports: A few more lines from Lampard here, speaking about Morocco winger Hakim Ziyech, who will be joining the club from Ajax in time for next season: \u201cI think he has an incredible left foot; he has an elegance about him that can find a pass,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cI see a player that hopefully can have a big imprint on our team and the Premier League. At times this season we\u2019ve missed the player with the finishing touch. Hopefully he can be a piece of that puzzle.\u201d Gunners fitness update klaxon! They take on Newcastle at the Emirates on Sunday afternoon: Kolasinac, Nelson, Saka are all fit. Some of the others, not so much: Sead Kolasinac - Available following left thigh strain. Reiss Nelson - Available following right hamstring strain. Bukayo Saka - Available for following a knock to right leg against Burnley. Cedric Soares, Kieran Tierney, Calum Chambers are all still out - Pablo Mari is in full training following transfer from Brazilian pre-season. Over in Spain, new-ish Barcelona manager Quique Seti\u00e9n has been speaking to media about his shortage of options in the forward line. The club have requested special dispensation to bring someone in outside the transfer window in view of the players on the sidelines. Ahead of their meeting with third-placed Getafe tomorrow afternoon, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has been ruled out for six months after having surgery on a leg injury, while ex-Liverpool man Luis Su\u00e1rez is recovering from a knee problem. \u201cI am always prepared for whatever comes up, work with what I have,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. \u201cEverybody would like to have their team better than they are, but we will adapt to the situation. We must wait for the response to see if we can sign (another striker). The club is working on it. If we are given permission to sign a player, it is preferable, but we will always find a plan - because in the end you have to play with 11. We will adapt, find a solution and the way forward.\u201d In the end, you have to play with 11. He\u2019s not wrong there, is he? By the way, leaders Real Madrid - who are on 52 points, three clear of Bar\u00e7a at the moment - meet Celta Vigo on Sunday evening. Courtesy of the official Canaries website, here are some thoughts from Norwich City manager Daniel Farke, who is preparing his bottom-placed club to take on runaway leaders Liverpool at Carrow Road tomorrow evening: \u201cThe winter break was too short! In Germany we have four-five weeks and I\u2019m lazy! But it was good to be able to calm things down. We had three complete days off but then were back on the training pitch to prepare for the following weeks and months. We never had a full week to prepare in the Championship. Liverpool have had enough time to prepare as well and will be switched on. \u201cAnfield [where they lost 4-1 at the start of the season] was a huge task for us but we showed that when we are good at our topics we are competitive. We created chances and should have been more clinical and switched on. There is always hope. Everything can happen in one game. In 20 games Liverpool will probably win the most, but our game against Man City showed that when we\u2019re good at our topics we can beat them. \u201cIt\u2019s important to bring the mental attitude to the group, whether fighting for promotion or relegation. I\u2019m responsible for man management and leading the group. I admire J\u00fcrgen Klopp because they were so successful last season, but are still so consistent and greedy. \u201cTeams often choose to sit deep against Liverpool, but they\u2019re too strong against that in counter-attacks. If not, they\u2019ll score from a set piece with [Virgil] Van Dijk. We have to have periods on the front foot, dominating possession and be fully aware there will be periods we have to be solid defending.\u201d Lampard (continued) on Monday\u2019s match against Manchester United: \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to open up a gap against a rival and we need to take that chance ... it\u2019s a game we want to win, you can\u2019t control certain factors, but you can control how you go into it. Sometimes at home we haven\u2019t got what we wanted, maybe what we deserved.\u201d It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, do you have a special evening planned? \u201c[Laughs] Do you want the details? The finer details? It will look something like Wolves against Leicester, possibly a nice takeaway, then Love Island on ITV + 1.\u201d Fitness update: \u201cChristian [Pulisic] trained with the Under-23s today, he won\u2019t be fit. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] won\u2019t be fit for this game, he is getting closer ... it\u2019s great to have him nearly back. Tammy [Abraham] is still feeling the effects [of recent injury] and we had to take him out of training a couple of times this week ... we are hopeful, but he is to be assessed over the weekend.\u201d What will new signing Hakim Ziyech bring to the team? \u201cQuality in what he\u2019s got, in terms of the ability to make assists and score goals ... we\u2019ve had games where we\u2019ve had a lot of the ball but we haven\u2019t had that final bit ... he\u2019ll have to fit into the way we want to work here, working hard off the ball with a lot of energy, but the quality he has got will be there for the fans to see.\u201d Has the winter break made a different to the players? \u201cI think ... I haven\u2019t seen a visible difference but I think it\u2019s a good thing for them to mentally rest, get away from each other, and spend time with their families as they see fit.\u201d Did Lampard need the break, it seemed like he was frustrated at the end of January? \u201cThe only thing that frustrates me is that I want to be as successful as I can at this club ... looking back I enjoyed having a bit of time away, it was a small reboot for everybody.\u201d What will Man United bring? \u201cThey\u2019ve added in a couple of positions, but they\u2019re a good team anyway, they are always going to be a threat for the top four. I do expect a tough game on Monday and of course it\u2019s a direct rival, they are not too many points behind us, so we need to take that into account. Manchester United and Tottenham coming up are huge games for us.\u201d (Eighth-placed Manchester United are six points behind Chelsea in fourth.) J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the smilingest manager in Premier League history, has more reason to beam - he has won the Manager of the Month award for a record fifth time, breaking the previous record of four, set by Manchester City rival Pep Guardiola. \u201cDele is a great guy\u201d - some quotes here from Tottenham manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho regarding the recent furore over Dele Alli\u2019s Snapchat posts, in which he appeared to joke about the Coronavirus outbreak and mock and Asian man: Mourinho said: \u201cI spoke with him about that but it was quite an easy conversation because he was very sorry about - let\u2019s say, the mistake - but it was never his intention to hurt or offend. \u201cHe immediately regretted and recognised it was a young generation mistake and he apologised. So my conversation was easy. What can I say, I can say he regrets and that is the best feeling he can show. \u201cI have a son at the same age as Dele and many of the players. I know social media is for his generation but when you are a public person like footballers are, they have to know and they have to be very, very careful. \u201cDele is a great guy. The last thing he is is anything connected with racism.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s big man up front (fitness permitting), Andy Carroll, tried to volley a ball in training and got injured. Magpies manager Steve Bruce doesn\u2019t sound very happy about it, although he refrained from aiming a volley of abuse in Carroll\u2019s general direction. \u201cHe\u2019s strong-minded and tough mentally, and I suppose he\u2019s had to be. However tough you are mentally though, it affects you if you can\u2019t play. It becomes frustrating and disappointing for everybody, and, for Andy, it\u2019s the worst scenario,\u201d said Bruce. I\u2019m currently unable to find a live stream of either the Spurs or Norwich press conferences, but there will definitely be something from Chelsea at 1.30pm, and maybe Arsenal too. Stay tuned. Stats gurus at the official Premier League website tell us that Norwich v Liverpool is the joint highest-scoring match up in the competition: \u201cThe sides have met 17 times in the Premier League and there have been a total of 68 goals, an average of four per fixture.\u201d The equal highest is the head-to-head between Nottingham Forest and Blackburn Rovers, who have banged in a total of 40 goals between them in 10 Premier League encounters. Even I can work out that\u2019s an average of exactly four per match ... Tottenham welcome back Steven Bergwijn, Ben Davies and Giovani Lo Celso for the trip to Aston Villa. Bergwijn was ineligible for Spurs\u2019 FA Cup game with Southampton while Lo Celso (thigh) and Davies (ankle) were unfit. Kane, Sissoko and Foyth all remain out for Tottenham, with Lamela a possibility to feature against Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon: Creative genius Giovani Lo Celso is back in training with the squad, after a thigh injury, and is \u2018in the frame\u2019 for the Villa meeting. Just to mark your card for what is coming up, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will be speaking at 1pm (so very shortly) and at half past Mikel Arteta will also face the cameras. Frank Lampard is also set for his press conference at 1.30pm, while Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is up at 2.45pm. Rangers manager Steven Gerrard has defended his comments in the wake of his side\u2019s defeat against Kilmarnock in midweek. Gerrard said his team \u201cfailed to handle the heat\u201d at Rugby Park, comments which prompted some criticism. But Gerrard on Friday insisted that honesty is the best policy. \u201cMy way of looking back at what I said is that I always try to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in a situation where people don\u2019t believe me or it\u2019s not authentic. At the time, I felt like we\u2019d really let ourselves down and I took responsibility for the group\u2019s performance on the night. So I have no regrets for what I said on the night.\u201d Joe Howlett has emailed in boasting about his Euro 2020 tickets: \u201cI got very lucky. Denmark v Finland in Copenhagen. I\u2019ve heard it being touted as game of the tournament already!\u201d A trip to Copenhagen is never a bad thing, or so I\u2019ve heard. Sounds like fun Joe. Enjoy. Premier-League wise, Tottenham\u2019s press conference is next on the menu at 1pm. They head to Aston Villa tomorrow and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho should be along shortly. Let\u2019s take a quick look at Italy and one of Mourinho\u2019s former clubs, Inter Milan. The Nerazzurri head for Rome and a Sunday evening showdown with Lazio. Antonio Conte\u2019s Inter are top, by virtue of goal difference. But Lazio are only a point behind Inter and Juventus. They could go top with a win if Juve fail to beat Brescia at home earlier on Sunday. The prolific ex-Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku has scored 12 times away from home for Inter so far this season, the most in Europe\u2019s top leagues. \u201cRoad goals,\u201d in US Sports-speak. But hang on - Lazio striker Ciro Immobile has netted the most home goals of any striker in Europe, with 15. Who will come out on top on Sunday? There is a stats piece here on the Inter Milan website, if you fancy it. It\u2019s Hull City v Swansea City tonight, as 15th plays 10th in the Championship. Hull are on a poor run, winless in the Championship since New Year\u2019s Day. That\u2019s partly down to a lengthy injury list, although defenders Matthew Pennington and Ryan Tafazolli may be in line to return tonight. Visitors Swansea City are six points off the play-off places. They will be without midfielder George Byers for the rest of the season after he picked up an ankle injury, and Mike van der Hoorn and Jordon Garrick both remain sidelined. Hull City boss Grant McCann told the club\u2019s website: \u201cWe want to bring the smile and the enjoyment back and to go out there and express ourselves. We all need to stick together. When results don\u2019t go your way it\u2019s very easy to point fingers and look to put the blame somewhere, but we don\u2019t have that culture here. \u201cWe understand that we haven\u2019t been good enough in our last five or six league games but we have the opportunity to turn it around.\u201d Things are heating up in the Championship and no mistake. The weekend\u2019s fixtures look like this, with leaders West Brom hosting Nottingham Forest in the lunchtime kick-off tomorrow before second-placed Leeds hosts Bristol City in a good old-fashioned 3pm Saturday KO: Tonight Hull City v Swansea Saturday West Brom v Nottingham Forest Birmingham v Brentford Cardiff City v Wigan Athletic Charlton v Blackburn Derby County v Huddersfield Fulham v Barnsley Leeds United v Bristol City Middlesbrough v Luton Preston v Millwall QPR v Stoke City Sheffield Wednesday v Reading If you missed it, here\u2019s a story from yesterday evening by David Conn, regarding AFC Wimbledon\u2019s funding of their new stadium at an old location - Plough Lane. The club has raised over \u00a34million via a bond scheme: Uefa have issued a press release this morning outlining the record numbers of fans trying to get their hands on tickets for Euro 2020 this summer, which is being hosted across 12 countries. \u201cIn the ticketing sales phase for fans of qualified teams in December 2019, supporters requested a record number of 8,977,427 tickets, which is more than three times the number of tickets requested during the same sales phase for UEFA EURO 2016,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cFollowing on from last summer\u2019s successful general public sales (12 June \u2013 12 July), when there were 19.3 million ticket applications, there has been an unprecedented total of approximately 28.3 million ticket requests for 2.5 million available tickets. \u201cSignificantly, the overall number of tickets requested for EURO 2020 is double the amount of the total tickets requested for UEFA EURO 2016.\u201d The highest demand has been for the final at Wembley on July 12, which has attracted more than 714,000 ticket requests, eight times the stadium\u2019s capacity. The group stage encounter between Germany and France at the 75,000-capacity Allianz Arena in Munich on June 16 has received 710,000 applications. Fans are loving the multiple-country hosting format, basically, and are proving it with an insatiable - indeed, record-breaking - demand for tickets. Did you get lucky in the sale? Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Norwich press conferences are all scheduled for between now and 3pm. There is nothing due before 1pm though, in case you need to nip to the petrol station for a bunch of flowers and a card. It\u2019s quiz time. Test your knowledge of runaway league leaders, including a curveball on a team from one of Lithuania, Lativa, Estonia or Finland ... Now then. Is Tatith Chong going to go the same way as Ashley Young, Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku, and sign for Inter Milan from Manchester United? Fabrizio Romano writes that he is \u2018seriously considering\u2019 an offer from the Antonio Conte-managed Italian outfit: Klopp finishes the press conference by answering a question on the winter break, and the fact that Manchester City\u2019s match was scheduled during it, and then postponed due to weather: \u201cIt just shows the problem with the schedule, that\u2019s how it is. The winter weather, you can\u2019t change \u2026 we decided the winter break must be a winter break [regarding Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury]. \u201cI just hope somebody will find a solution to these problems. I think the next problem will be if Manchester City go through in the FA Cup, then other games will have to be rescheduled. You cannot please everybody. We need to talk [the clubs with the authorities] about these problems, because if we don\u2019t, it will get worse.\u201d Newcastle target man Andy Carroll has suffered a setback in his fight for full fitness, says manager Steve Bruce. Newcastle host Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday, and Bruce said: \u201cThe big problem we\u2019ve got still is Andy\u2019s not right, so that\u2019s a concern to us going forward. We expected him to be okay and unfortunately, he\u2019s not.\u201d Asked if the injury is more serious than was first feared, Bruce added: \u201cWe don\u2019t think so. Thankfuly, it\u2019s not his ankle, but this hip, hip flexor, whatever it is. When he gets to a certain level in his rehabilitation, he\u2019s still not quite right, so we\u2019ll just have to keep monitoring it and see how he is.\u201d Is Klopp surprised to see how Norwich have struggled given how well they competed in the team\u2019s first match this season? \u201cIs it a surprise? I am not sure, this league is so strong. What I admire is that they stick to their principles, they do what they do ... it\u2019s super coaching, you can see all the patterns and the movements on the pitch ... they caused 95 per cent of the teams they played against real problems ... from the outside it looks like this club really sticks together, they know what they have to do, and strange as it may sound, they are in a really good moment in the club. To stay in the Premier League will be difficult ... but no-one questions Daniel Farke because he is doing an incredible job. I was at a similar club, at Mainz ... you need a plan for tomorrow, for next month, for the next few years, and to me it looks like they have that ... they had a lot of chances in the first game [4-1 to Liverpool at Anfield] so it was a good warning for us ... we will feel the quality of Norwich.\u201d Klopp says James Milner and Sadio Man\u00e9 are in contention to start against Norwich. \u201cThey both trained for Monday on and they are in contention.\u201d Liverpool manager Klopp is asked to compare title races in Germany to the UK: \u201cIt\u2019s intense. People ask silly questions, you have to answer [laughs]. If you want to be successful you have to be consistent ... actually the nicest problem you can have in football is to answer or to not answer these questions ... there are a lot of games to come. It\u2019s question two or three [in this press conference] and Norwich hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet, but they are obviously my first concern. We have no other chance to make this game against Norwich the most important of our lives. People think it will be easy, because they look at the table ... we know they can cause problems, but we know we can cause problems too.\u201d The impact and benefit of the winter break ? \u201cWe sent the players all over the world, we wanted them to rest, and I can see a difference in training. Rest is only one word - it\u2019s rest, it\u2019s recovery, there are a lot of things that start with \u2018re-\u2019 that happen in that week. You don\u2019t lose a lot in a week [in terms of fitness and conditioning], but you can gain a lot.\u201d Klopp speaks! Will Mohamed Salah go to the Tokyo Olympics with Egypt? \u201cDo I want to lose a player in pre-season? Of course not, that\u2019s clear \u2026 we need more information, how will it look, when will the preparation start and so on \u2026 and no-one really contacted us so far, it\u2019s all in the media. So, no decision made yet but we\u2019ll see. We cannot discuss it really because we don\u2019t know a lot about it, really. We need to speak to them [Egypt\u2019s Olympic team management].\u201d Here, Louise Taylor looks ahead to the weekend\u2019s women\u2019s FA CUp action- she speaks to Sunderland Ladies boss Melanie Reay (cousin of Alan Shearer) who is plotting Birmingham\u2019s downfall in their fifth-round meeting on Sunday: Tottenham will take on RB Leipzig in the Champions League in north London next Wednesday. Second in the Bundesliga, just a point behind Bayern Munich, Leipzig are first in action against domestic rivals Werder Bremen tomorrow afternoon. Nick Ames has spoken to midfielder Emil Forsberg, looking ahead to the Spurs match, and looking back on his time in Germany so far: Ruben Vinagre is the only injury absentee for Wolves tonight for their meeting with Leicester. Quoted on the Wolves website, manager Nuno Espirito Santo is expecting a stiff test against the Foxes: \u201cBrendan [Rodgers] is doing a fantastic job, very good players, everybody can see the quality they have. So, we know what we\u2019re going to face. They are a very good team, with a lot of quality players, a clear idea of football.\u201d Fittingly, it\u2019s a Valentine\u2019s Day love-in over on the Leicester City website too, where Rodgers in turn pours praise on the job Nuno is doing with Wolves: \u201cNuno\u2019s done an outstanding job there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a big investment in the Championship. Players came in, but he\u2019s been able to put them into a structure and a format and a way of working. Of course, in the Championship, they were terrific and then they came up, invested again, and then showed that consistency and quality in the Premier League ... \u201cThey play a counter-attacking style, so they\u2019ll be happy to sit a bit deeper and then look to break out with the pace and they have the quality and the understanding to do that.\u201d Leicester\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi is doubtful with a knee injury while January loan signing Ryan Bennett is ineligible against his parent club. Veteran centre-back Wes Morgan returns to the squad. Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp is due to be speaking in less than 25 minutes ... Meanwhile, here\u2019s Reds goalie Alisson Becker with a sumptuous first touch in training. Not so sure about the last touch, though ... Don\u2019t forget, sports fans - you can contact me on Twitter or on email with any thoughts on the weekend\u2019s imminent footballing action. I wouldn\u2019t recommend proposing marriage to your significant other via this blog, but all entries will be considered on merit. Meanwhile, this seems fair regarding social media on Valentine\u2019s Day, from Adam Crafton: Will Spurs or Arsenal sign Norwich City\u2019s Ben Godfrey this summer? Will Jos\u00e9 Mourinho also swoop for Max Aarons? Will Manchester United\u2019s goalie Dean Henderson, on loan at Sheffield United, sign for PSG?? Barry Glendenning has this morning\u2019s transfer tittle-tattle for you right here: Here\u2019s a story we broke last night, regarding the astonishing volume of football match tickets being resold via sites such as StubHub. \u201cEvidence seen by the Guardian indicates that one person may be behind a large proportion of transactions in English football. Internal StubHub data includes multiple listings with the same \u201cseller ID\u201d. Only StubHub knows who they are but they are responsible for nearly \u00a32m of tickets advertised on one day.\u201d Rob Davies has all the details here: Opta\u2019s Duncan Alexander is winning football Twitter, yet again: Here we have an eclectic mix of 10 things to look out for this weekend - from Nottingham Forest\u2019s date with Championship-leading West Brom, to RB Salzburg\u2019s crunch encounter against title rivals Lask in the Austrian top division tonight. Nick Ames, Simon Burnton and Paul Doyle muck in for this one: Who\u2019d have thunk it? Wolves have won 4-3 in both of their home Premier-League era encounters against the Foxes. Will we have another seven-goal thriller tonight? In keeping with \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d, meanwhile, Leicester City have kindly provided kick-off times for fans from Vancouver to Sydney and pretty much everywhere in between. If you\u2019re in the UK, it\u2019s an 8pm start. Italy and Juventus great Gigi Buffon has been adding to his collection of football memorabilia. The goalkeeper snaffled Daniel Maldini\u2019s shirt after the 1-1 draw in Milan last night, adding another father-son combo to his haul, along with Chiesa, Thuram and Weah: Now, here\u2019s a round-up of last night\u2019s action in Europe. In Italy Juventus needed a late Cristiano Ronaldo penalty to salvage a 1-1 draw with Milan in the first leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final, while Napoli beat Inter 1-0 on Wednesday: Paul Pogba is in the news again. He wants to leave Manchester United, says agent Mino Raiola ... but who will stump up the \u20ac100m (\u00a383m) the club apparently want? Here\u2019s Fabrizio Romano: Good morning everybody, and welcome to this Valentine\u2019s Day-themed weekend football countdown. There are six Premier League matches across the weekend, starting with Wolves v Leicester this evening, and ending with a semi-seismic clash between Chelsea and Manchester United on Monday night. Plus of course there\u2019ll be a host of matches in the Football League as the romance of the title race(s) ramps up. On top of that, there are some fascinating fixtures in the leagues across Europe with the business end of the season in Germany, Italy, Spain - indeed, everywhere - fast approaching. Valencia meet Atletico Madrid in La Liga this evening, with Barcelona taking on Getafe tomorrow and Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo on Sunday night. In Germany Borussia Dortmund play tonight, against Eintracht Frankfurt, while leaders Bayern Munich travelling to FC K\u00f6ln on Sunday. But possibly the biggest fixture in Europe this weekend is Lazio\u2019s meeting with Inter Milan in Rome, the city of love, on Sunday. Inter currently top the table on goal difference from Maurizio Sarri\u2019s Juventus, with Lazio lurking a point behind them both. There are several Premier League press conferences coming up throughout the day, starting with league leaders scheduled for Liverpool at 11am, so we\u2019ll bring you quotes and news from those, and much more besides. Let\u2019s hope we all come up smelling of roses.

Last year they passed \u00a31bn for the first time, at 23.5% annual growth, accounting for 71% of all UK music revenues. The demise of the CD has been equally precipitous, falling from \u00a3873m in 2010 to \u00a3318m last year, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. The triumvirate that dominates global streaming \u2013 Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music \u2013 have more than 250 million paying subscribers between them. Including those on ad-funded tiers, that number rises to almost 400 million globally. Universal announced its intention to float as part of the company\u2019s full-year results, which showed total revenues rising a healthy 14% year on year to \u20ac7.1bn (\u00a35.9bn), driven by a 21.5% jump in streaming revenues. Profits rose 22% year on year to \u20ac1.1bn. As the streaming market moves closer to maturity, growth rates are beginning to slow. Universal\u2019s streaming revenues grew 16.8% in the fourth quarter last year, compared with 28% in the first three months of 2019. Vivendi had looked at publicly listing Universal in 2017, but the plan was abandoned the following year as being \u201ctoo complex\u201d. Vivendi has not said what level of shareholding it is seeking to retain in Universal after the flotation. The Tencent-led consortium has the option to buy another stake of up to 10% at the same price in Universal by next January. Vivendi has said it is also in separate talks to sell a minority stake to another unnamed investor, or investors, at a similar price.",

Dehenna Davison, the MP for Bishop Auckland and a prominent member of the party\u2019s new contingent of northern representatives, was pictured holding a County Durham flag with Andrew Foster, a man described by anti-racism campaigners as a \u201cMuslim-hating extremist of the very worst kind\u201d. The images, revealed following an investigation by the campaign group Hope Not Hate show the MP with Foster at a party celebrating Brexit in a pub on 31 January. At the same event she was also pictured with Colin Raine, a former Tory activist banned from the party after allegations that he was behind a far-right protest and made Islamophobic comments online.

However, Matthew McGregor, Hope Not Hate\u2019s campaigns director, called for Davison\u2019s suspension and urged the Conservative party to launch an investigation into the \u201cserious allegations\u201d. His calls were joined by Labour\u2019s shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler, who said the incident was \u201canother example of the serious level of complacency towards the far right by the Tory party\u201d. She added: \u201cThis must be urgently investigated.\u201d McGregor said the campaign group had been following the activities of Foster and Raine, a former Bishop Auckland Conservative council candidate, for some time. Describing the pair as \u201cextreme individuals\u201d who \u201cshould be unwelcome at any mainstream political party gathering\u201d, he said they appeared to \u201cmove closely with the local Bishop Auckland Conservative Association and the new MP\u201d. An online account, thought to be Raine\u2019s, alleges he met with Davison in April at a public event, a month after the party said he was banned from rejoining. On 12 December, the same account also posted a clip of Davison purportedly filmed at a local pub as the exit polls came in, describing her as \u201cour candidate\u201d. Separately, Facebook pictures emerged allegedly showing Foster burning a Qur\u2019an and posing next to a racist message that read \u201cFuck Pakis\u201d. Hope Not Hate claims Foster also attended rallies organised by the English Defence League and Britain First and is alleged to have commented on a picture of Adolf Hitler on Facebook, saying: \u201cWe need some more of this spirit in our town mate \u2026 show these f***ers once and for all.\u201d A Twitter account that allegedly belonged to Foster and has since been suspended also called the dictator a \u201cgreat man\u201d and wished him a happy birthday. Meanwhile, it is claimed that Raine organised a protest outside the former Labour MP Helen Goodman\u2019s office, which included members of the far-right groups the Democratic Football Lads Alliance and the North East Infidels.

But she did make the argument twice. In her speech she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In this leadership election, our party needs to exercise the greatest care in who we choose to lead us. Because the British establishment wants to put us into a box. A box that separates us from the people our party was built to represent. Well I will not be put in that box and won\u2019t allow our party to be either. </p> \n   <p>Yes, we have to be credible to regain trust with voters but I\u2019m not interested in the definition of credibility used by the media and chattering classes. The only credibility I\u2019m interested in winning is that of the people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And in her Q&amp;A, Long-Bailey said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have got a government that wants to put us into a box. They want us to be viewed as the establishment. They are laying a trap for us. They would love nothing more than for us to go down the route of shiny suit wearing, not rocking the boat too much, not setting out a transformative vision, and trying to scale back our ambitions, so that they can turn round to our communities and say: \u2018They\u2019re part of the establishment.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It is obvious why Long-Bailey is making this argument when she appears to be trailing badly behind Starmer in the contest and looking \u201cestablishment\u201d could be seen as one of his weak points. But having an establishment, \u201cshiny suit\u201d image has never stopped Conservative leaders winning general elections, so the premise of her argument is questionable. And Long-Bailey may be wrong to claim that being credible with the chattering classes is not the same as being credible with the public. She seemed to accept that Starmer has credibility with the former, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/06/boris-johnson-labour-scottish-politics-derek-mackay-have-behaved-foolishly-and-am-truly-sorry-scottish-finance-ministers-resignation-statement-live-news?page=with:block-5e3c2e4b8f086a28115a6d2a#block-5e3c2e4b8f086a28115a6d2a\">the polls suggest he has more credibility with the latter too</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She criticised colleagues in the party who had said they would vote remain in any second referendum on Brexit instead of backing a deal negotiated by Labour.</strong> In the Q&amp;A, talking about the problems with Labour\u2019s Brexit policy at the election, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It was also confusing and ambiguous, the final stage of our policy position, because we talked about a people\u2019s vote as a way to resolve the conversations that were happening in our communities; we were going to give people a vote on the final deal. But then when we were asked if we were going to campaign for our own deal, our answer was: [at this point Long-Bailey put on a posher accent] \u201cI don\u2019t know, we will have to see what it looks like, might campaign for remain.\u201d And that was really bad, and it confused a lot of people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The official party policy, agreed at conference last autumn, was to reserve any decision about how to campaign in a second referendum until after a Labour government had renegotiated the withdrawal agreement. Jeremy Corbyn himself would not say how he would campaign, and eventually resolved this conundrum by saying he would be neutral. But Long-Bailey\u2019s comment seemed aimed at colleagues such as Starmer and Emily Thornberry who were explicit about wanting to back remain.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She described herself as someone who was good at both details and big vision. </strong>And she said that, as a working-class woman, she was used to having to prove she was much better than middle-class men.

I\u2019ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won\u2019t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism.</p> \n   <p>But a credible and effective communications strategy extends beyond just being more combative and self-confident. It must also be more creative. So I\u2019ll set up a dedicated creative digital communications unit in the party, producing viral content that can both get around media hostility and speak directly to voters.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This implies that Labour hasn\u2019t tried this before. It has, repeatedly, including employing people to focus on digital media, although admittedly there is always room for improvement.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Labour should support a mass trade union membership drive and back workers in every dispute and strike against exploitative bosses.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We aren\u2019t just a different team of politicians in Westminster, alternating power with the Tories.

And it\u2019s our members and our trade unions, on the frontline in workplaces and communities, who will make that a reality.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why under my leadership, Labour will back workers in every dispute and strike against unfair and exploitative employers. And we\u2019ll launch a mass trade union membership drive, supporting hundreds of thousands of young activists who have been inspired by our party to become active trade unionists in their workplaces.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She implied that she does not see a case for keeping on Diane Abbott, John McDonnell or Corbyn in any frontline roles in Labour. </strong>She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019ve learned so much from Jeremy, John and Diane. They helped our party and our movement rediscover its heart and soul. We owe them so much and I thank them for their huge efforts. History will be much kinder to them than today\u2019s media consensus and we mustn\u2019t retreat from that politics.</p> \n   <p>But they have done their bit and it is time for a new generation to take us forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She quoted Tony Blair approvingly.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In his introduction to the 1997 manifesto, Tony Blair wrote that our party was the \u201cpolitical arm of the British people\u201d.

affecting historic investigations</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Arlene Foster</strong>, the first minister of Northern Ireland and DUP leader, told the Today programme this morning that Brandon Lewis, the new Northern Ireland secretary, should \u201crevisit\u201d the scope of the historical investigation unit that was proposed in the power-sharing deal negotiated by his sacked predecessor.</p> \n  <p>Under <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/856998/2020-01-08_a_new_decade__a_new_approach.pdf\">the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal (pdf)</a> between the parties and the UK government that led to the restoration of the power-sharing executive, the UK promised to \u201cwithin 100 days, publish and introduce legislation in the UK parliament to implement the Stormont House agreement to address Northern Ireland legacy issues\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/390672/Stormont_House_Agreement.pdf\"> Stormont House agreement (pdf),</a> which was agreed in 2014 but never implemented in full, promised:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Legislation will establish a new independent body to take forward investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths; the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU). The body will take forward outstanding cases from the HET process, and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI). A report will be produced in each case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Unionists fear this will lead to former soldiers and police officers facing fresh investigation over matters for which they thought they had been cleared.</p> \n  <p>Foster told Today:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[What was] originally mooted in the Stormont agreement does need to be revisited because a lot of matters have changed since then, not least the fact that the chief constable put all of the so-called state killings into the historical investigation unit, so there are great difficulties in that - not least that 90% of those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland were killed by paramilitaries, terrorists if you will.</p> \n   <p>There is a need for balance in everything we do here in Northern Ireland.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if she would be asking Lewis to review the terms of the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal, Foster said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I had already written to the secretary of state Julian Smith a number of weeks ago saying to him it is very important that the victims take the lead in all of these issues and that there is a co-design of any legislation so they are at the heart of dealing with the matters of the past.</p> \n   <p>It is very important that the victims are at the fore. I hope Brandon Lewis will listen to the voices of the victims.

Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of his new cabinet this morning and, while it is expected to discuss<a href=\"https://politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/109910/new-points-based-immigration-system-could-cut-low\"> the government\u2019s plans for a new post-Brexit immigration system</a>, many of the attendees - like the rest of Westminster - will probably spend just as much time mulling over the implications of the events that led up to yesterday\u2019s shock resignation of Sajid Javid as chancellor. The papers this morning are full of analysis - here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javids-exit-leaves-boris-johnson-in-control-of-treasury\">a take from my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong></a>; I will post links to some others later - but, roughly speaking, the move raises four big questions about the future of British politics.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Does this mean Boris Johnson will now abandon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-rips-up-tory-fiscal-rules-vow-spend-extra-20bn\">the fiscal rules announced during the election</a>, allowing him to borrow even more than planned for spending on infrastructure and public services?</strong> Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, is thought to be angling for this, and yesterday No 10 was vague about whether the government was still committed to those fiscal rules (which were already seen as a loosening from the Philip Hammond era). The rules were drafted when the Tories were expecting to win a small majority, and the scale of Johnson\u2019s victory in December means the pressure to deliver for new Tory voters in the north is much stronger than it was.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Does this mean Johnson is emasculating the Treasury? </strong>That certainly seems to be the intention, and yesterday one commentator said the plan to effectively merge No 10 and the Treasury into a more cohesive unit amounted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/13/politics-live-cabinet-reshuffle-set-to-get-underway-live-news?page=with:block-5e454f778f08e133247429da#block-5e454f778f08e133247429da\">the \u201cmost significant development since the creation of the devolved parliaments in 1999\u201d.</a> But most prime ministers try at one point to curtail the powers of No 11, and most of them fail. The Treasury may prove to be more institutionally resilient than Cummings imagines, and even if the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is more firmly under No 10\u2019s line management, he stills heads a department stuffed with hundreds of clever officials who are professionally trained to tell politicians truths they don\u2019t want to hear.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Does this mean Johnson is getting more like Donald Trump? </strong>In some respects, because the reshuffle had all the hallmarks of a powergrab, and the appointment of Suella Braverman as attorney general has gone down badly with defenders of the judiciary. But even though Johnson\u2019s preferred model for leadership is probably Emperor Augustus, cabinet government still very much applies.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Ultimately will this reshuffle leave Johnson politically stronger or politically weaker? </strong>At this point it is impossible to tell. Some Tory MPs must be unhappy about the way Javid has been treated, but if they are, they have not yet been saying so in public. Johnson is so powerful at the moment that he can more or less do whatever he wants, but that won\u2019t last forever and in the end the reshuffle will be judged by whether or not it delivers for the Conservative party.</p> \n  <p>Here is our overnight story about the reshuffle.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/javid-resigned-after-johnson-pushed-him-to-sack-advisers\">Javid resigned after Johnson pushed him to sack advisers</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here is a graphic from last night about the reshuffle. It features the 10 ministers who were allowed to attend cabinet before the reshuffle. No 10 has now drastically slimmed down those numbers and, in addition to the full cabinet, there will be only four extra attendees: Stephen Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury; Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons; Mark Spencer, the chief whip; and Suella Braverman, the attorney general.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/ups_and_downs-zip/giv-3902w5QlEGEEYcJP/\" data-alt=\"Cabinet changes\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/ups_and_downs-zip/giv-3902w5QlEGEEYcJP/\">Cabinet changes</a> \n   <figcaption>\n    Cabinet changes\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the new cabinet.</p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, give a speech in Salford.</p> \n  <p><em>1pm: </em>Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p>Also, today is the final day for candidates for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership to get the CLP or affiliate nominations that they need to make it onto the final ballot.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s overhauled cabinet has agreed that a new points-based immigration system will be implemented from 1 January next year, believing that it will reduce the number of people coming to the UK, Downing Street has announced. Downing Street is still refusing to say whether or not the budget will go ahead on 11 March as scheduled. (See 2.04pm.) The attempt by Boris Johnson to emasculate the Treasury and seize control of economic policy is doomed to failure, people close to the former prime minister Gordon Brown have said. Rebecca Long-Bailey has set out her four-point plan to rebuild the Labour party and said she was behind at the start of the leadership race as her focus had been on winning the general election. In a major speech in Salford, she also took a veiled swipe at her main rival, Sir Keir Starmer, saying Labour should not let the Tories present them as an establishment, \u201cshiny suit-wearing\u201d party. (See 1.13pm.) Bomb disposal experts have warned it would be too dangerous to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland if it was to involve spanning the vast offshore munitions dump that lies on the most direct route over the Irish Sea. Two Labour MPs, Lilian Greenwood and Alex Sobel, have said they are cancelling their public engagements after attending a bus summit at Westminster also attended by someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. I\u2019m away next week during the half-term recess, but will be back on Monday week. A colleague may be writing the blog next week, but that will depend on how busy the politics news diary gets. Here is Newsnight\u2019s Lewis Goodall on the moment when Boris Johnson treated his new cabinet like children, expecting them to chant back Tory election messages at him. (See 10.33am.) It\u2019s a Johnson party piece. He did the same thing at the first cabinet meeting after the general election. And he has tried the same trick with Tory MPs in the Commons. And here is David Gauke, the former Tory cabinet minister who lost his seat after having the party whip withdrawn over a Brexit rebellion, on the same moment. Downing Street has just announced two more appointments. Lord Callanan, who was a Brexit minister until the department was wound up at the end of January, has been made a business minister. Gillian Keegan has been made an education minister. She was a backbencher. From Sky\u2019s Joe Pike The Institute for Government has been looking at how much cabinet experience Boris Johnson\u2019s new team has. Quite a lot, it says. \u201cOnly three full members \u2013 Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Amanda Milling and George Eustice \u2013 and Suella Braverman, the new attorney general who attends cabinet - have not been around the table before,\u201d Gavin Freeguard writes at the IfG blog. The government reshuffle seems to be running out of steam. No 10 has just issued a press release of 25 appointments, which all involve ministers staying in the same posts. Earlier today Downing Street announced seven junior-level promotions, of which more than half involved women. Amanda Sollaway has been made a business minister. She was a backbencher. Victoria Prentis has been made an environment minister. She was a backbencher. Rachel Maclean has been made a transport minister. She was parliamentary private secretary to Sajid Javid. Nigel Huddleston has been made a culture minister. He was a government whip, and will continue with that role alongside his ministerial job. Theodore Agnew was made joint minister of state at the Cabinet Office and in the Treasury. He had been a junior education minister. Nicholas True has joined the government as a minister of state in the Cabinet Office. Elizabeth Berridge has been made an education minister. She was a government whip in the Lords, and will continue in that role alongside her education post. The full list of appointments is here, on the No 10 website. These are from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has been at the Downing Street lobby briefing. Three Labour leadership candidates, Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, are guaranteed a place on the final ballot, and all five deputy leadership candidates \u2013 Angela Rayner, Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Rosena Alin-Khan \u2013 have also got the CLP or affiliate nominations they need. Emily Thornberry, a candidate for the leadership, is the only person still looking for CLP nominations. As of last night she had 30. She needs three more by the deadline at midnight tonight. Around 18 CLPs are supposed to be nominating today. In an article for PoliticsHome, Thornberry has floated a new policy idea. She says the government is going to have problems in the decades ahead meeting its unfunded public sector pension liabilities, and she proposes a solution: letting people with only limited contributions (two years\u2019 worth initially) take out 75% of their money now, but forgoing their pension when they retire. She says this would free up money for people who need it now, as well as reducing the long-term pension liabilities. And it would be good for the public finances, she claims. This scheme obviously comes at a short-term cost, which would have to be funded through borrowing, but there are two points. First, there is no better time to borrow given the historic lows in interest rates. And second, even if it mean an increase in short-term borrowing, the credit agencies, investment firms and others will all see that it puts Britain on a much sounder footing in terms of our long-term fiscal health. We would therefore have a practical measure that starts to tackle a major long-term threat to the public finances, but at the same time puts money into the pockets of millions of working people on low to medium incomes, at a time when the economy is slowing down. The Jewish Labour Movement has also announced its stance on the Labour leadership. It is nominating Lisa Nandy for leader, and Ian Murray for deputy leader. Here are the results of its ballot. And, while we\u2019re on about Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, my colleague Dan Sabbagh has spoken to bomb disposal experts who say the plan is flawed because the bridge would span a vast offshore munitions dump. The leftwing TSSA transport union has announced that it is nominating Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership, and Angela Rayner for the deputy leadership. Manuel Cortes, the TSSA general secretary, described them as \u201cfantastic candidates, both of whom have made commitments to public ownership of our railways\u201d. Starmer has posted this on Twitter in response. Ministers from the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland executive have criticised the plan floated by No 10 earlier this week for a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Press Association reports. The Scottish transport secretary, Michael Matheson, has said: I strongly believe that if \u00a320bn is available for investment in infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland that, rather than indulging the prime minister with this vanity project, such funding should be made available to our respective governments so it could be better spent on meeting the priorities of the people we represent. And the Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, has said: I am extremely concerned that pursuit of this project, costing \u00a320bn, will be a waste of significant money and resource that could be put to better use by addressing pressures and deliverable projects here in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. By spending just a fraction of the reported cost of this bridge, I am of the view that we could bring significantly more benefits to people across the north by investing in infrastructure here and making a real difference to improving the lives of citizens across Northern Ireland. Here are the main points from Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s \u201cLabour\u2019s path to power\u201d speech in Salford this morning. It was well-written and well-delivered, and John Rentoul has posted a link to the full text. Much of what Long-Bailey said repeated points she has already made in the campaign, but here are the new or newish lines that stuck out. Long-Bailey said Labour should not let the Tories present them as an establishment, \u201cshiny suit wearing\u201d party. This seemed a clear jibe at Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the leadership contest, although Long-Bailey did not make this explicit. But she did make the argument twice. In her speech she said: In this leadership election, our party needs to exercise the greatest care in who we choose to lead us. Because the British establishment wants to put us into a box. A box that separates us from the people our party was built to represent. Well I will not be put in that box and won\u2019t allow our party to be either. Yes, we have to be credible to regain trust with voters but I\u2019m not interested in the definition of credibility used by the media and chattering classes. The only credibility I\u2019m interested in winning is that of the people. And in her Q&amp;A, Long-Bailey said: We have got a government that wants to put us into a box. They want us to be viewed as the establishment. They are laying a trap for us. They would love nothing more than for us to go down the route of shiny suit wearing, not rocking the boat too much, not setting out a transformative vision, and trying to scale back our ambitions, so that they can turn round to our communities and say: \u2018They\u2019re part of the establishment.\u2019 It is obvious why Long-Bailey is making this argument when she appears to be trailing badly behind Starmer in the contest and looking \u201cestablishment\u201d could be seen as one of his weak points. But having an establishment, \u201cshiny suit\u201d image has never stopped Conservative leaders winning general elections, so the premise of her argument is questionable. And Long-Bailey may be wrong to claim that being credible with the chattering classes is not the same as being credible with the public. She seemed to accept that Starmer has credibility with the former, but the polls suggest he has more credibility with the latter too. She criticised colleagues in the party who had said they would vote remain in any second referendum on Brexit instead of backing a deal negotiated by Labour. In the Q&amp;A, talking about the problems with Labour\u2019s Brexit policy at the election, she said: It was also confusing and ambiguous, the final stage of our policy position, because we talked about a people\u2019s vote as a way to resolve the conversations that were happening in our communities; we were going to give people a vote on the final deal. But then when we were asked if we were going to campaign for our own deal, our answer was: [at this point Long-Bailey put on a posher accent] \u201cI don\u2019t know, we will have to see what it looks like, might campaign for remain.\u201d And that was really bad, and it confused a lot of people. The official party policy, agreed at conference last autumn, was to reserve any decision about how to campaign in a second referendum until after a Labour government had renegotiated the withdrawal agreement. Jeremy Corbyn himself would not say how he would campaign, and eventually resolved this conundrum by saying he would be neutral. But Long-Bailey\u2019s comment seemed aimed at colleagues such as Starmer and Emily Thornberry who were explicit about wanting to back remain. She described herself as someone who was good at both details and big vision. And she said that, as a working-class woman, she was used to having to prove she was much better than middle-class men. In her speech she said: To deliver our path to power, we need both details and big vision. I do both. I\u2019m a details person. I work hard. I don\u2019t slack off. I suppose that\u2019s the benefit of being a working-class woman, always having to work twice as hard to show you\u2019re just as good, in fact better, than an upper-middle-class man. So yes, I do think it\u2019s time our party had a woman leader. She said she felt sad that the party had not focused more on its plans for a green industrial revolution during the election campaign. (See 11.04am.) And she gave an example of how she thought it could have helped the party win in Falmouth. (See 11.05am.) She said Labour should be more robust in tackling negative coverage in the media. In her speech she said: My leadership will be far more robust with the media ... I\u2019ll not only call that out, I have a plan to deal with it. I\u2019ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won\u2019t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism. But a credible and effective communications strategy extends beyond just being more combative and self-confident. It must also be more creative. So I\u2019ll set up a dedicated creative digital communications unit in the party, producing viral content that can both get around media hostility and speak directly to voters. This implies that Labour hasn\u2019t tried this before. It has, repeatedly, including employing people to focus on digital media, although admittedly there is always room for improvement. She said Labour should support a mass trade union membership drive and back workers in every dispute and strike against exploitative bosses. She said: We aren\u2019t just a different team of politicians in Westminster, alternating power with the Tories. Our party was born out of a movement in communities like mine and many of those we lost in the election. To win again, we need to look and sound like it. And it\u2019s our members and our trade unions, on the frontline in workplaces and communities, who will make that a reality. That\u2019s why under my leadership, Labour will back workers in every dispute and strike against unfair and exploitative employers. And we\u2019ll launch a mass trade union membership drive, supporting hundreds of thousands of young activists who have been inspired by our party to become active trade unionists in their workplaces. She implied that she does not see a case for keeping on Diane Abbott, John McDonnell or Corbyn in any frontline roles in Labour. She said: I\u2019ve learned so much from Jeremy, John and Diane. They helped our party and our movement rediscover its heart and soul. We owe them so much and I thank them for their huge efforts. History will be much kinder to them than today\u2019s media consensus and we mustn\u2019t retreat from that politics. But they have done their bit and it is time for a new generation to take us forward. She quoted Tony Blair approvingly. She said: In his introduction to the 1997 manifesto, Tony Blair wrote that our party was the \u201cpolitical arm of the British people\u201d. That is what we must become. I believe I can chart the course to get us there. Last night Jake Berry announced that he was leaving the government. He had been the Northern Powerhouse minister, but Boris Johnson wanted him to move to the Foreign Office and Berry refused because he said the foreign travel meant he would not see enough of his three young children. Berry\u2019s portfolio has been handed to Simon Clarke, who has moved from the Treasury to be a minister in the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, although it is not clear whether or not Clarke will call himself the Northern Powerhouse minister. He says he\u2019s in charge of levelling up. Berry was one of the 10 ministers who used to attend cabinet without being a full member. Clarke won\u2019t do that, which could be seen as a downgrade, although the PM has taken a deliberate decision to reduce the number of of cabinet non-member attendees from 10 to four, because it was felt that their numbers were getting out of hand. Rather than going to the pub (see 11.51am), Julian Smith, the former Northern Ireland secretary, has been visiting a school in his Skipton and Ripon constituency. It turned out the pupils hadn\u2019t been keeping up with the news. Julian Smith, who was sacked as Northern Ireland secretary yesterday, was doorstepped by Sky News this morning. Asked about his future plans, he replied: I think my future plans involve things like going to the pub and I\u2019m now going to my constituency. I wish the new cabinet and new secretary of state all the best of luck. Jackson Carlaw has been elected the new leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Carlaw, who had been filling the role on an interim basis since Ruth Davidson stepped down last August, comfortably defeated his rival, Michelle Ballantyne, the party\u2019s social security spokesperson at Holyrood by 4,917 votes to 1,581. Carlaw promised to offer voters a \u201cclear, focused, ambitious alternative to the SNP\u201d, which will include a refreshed approach to the union that would be \u201cpositive and forward-looking, not lazy and historical\u201d. Insisting that he would be \u201can ambassador for Scotland to the UK government\u201d, Carlaw said he would have no problem speaking up against Boris Johnson where necessary. During his leadership campaign, Carlaw, who has served as an MSP since 2007, signalled that he wants to put forward a more populist policy agenda, to dovetail with Johnson\u2019s plans for the UK party, and win over blue-collar voters disillusioned with the SNP and Labour. Q: If the UK goes into recession, how would that affect your plans? Long-Bailey says the economy is vulnerable because the economic model is broken. She refers to the film The Big Short. That shows how people have not learned lessons from the financial crash, she says. She says government should invest more in the UK. It is too unequal, she says. She says the green industrial revolution would spread power. She says people think of collective ownership as an obsession. But it is not, she says. It is about spreading power. Q: What would you replace the House of Lords with? Long-Bailey says she does not support the Lords, because it is the only unelected chamber in Europe. There are some great Labour peers, she says. But a second chamber should be democratically accountable, she says. It should be replaced with an elected senate outside of London. That would be one step towards restoring faith in politics, she says. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary shortly. Q: How much would your policy on freedom of movement affect the wages of workers? Long-Bailey says the UK will be out of the single market. She says she wants an immigration system based on values, not on targets. She says she is worried EU nationals could be facing deportations. And she says Labour has a moral duty to oppose the far right, and to make the positive case for immigration. She says she is a child of immigrants. She is proud of that, she says. She says the impact of immigration on wages is \u201cnegligible\u201d. But she says communities are right to be angry about how services are not working for them. That\u2019s not an immigration problem, she says. She says that is because the Conservative government has starved public services of resources. Q: Do you think it was a mistake backing the election to take place? And what would you do to stop a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year? Long-Bailey says she would rather not have had the election. But the party was not in a good place. Many people in Labour communities saw the party as one trying to overturn the referendum. And remain supporters did not like the party\u2019s stance either, she says. She says it did not help that people in the party were saying different things. And she says it was \u201creally bad\u201d that Labour could not even say it would campaign for its own Brexit deal. She says Labour needs to scrutinise the government, and make sure it does not water down standards. And she says businesses will need support. They have been preparing for the worst, she says. But smaller businesses do not have the resources to prepare, especially firms in the supply chain. Labour should be demanding the government support these firms, she says. Rebecca Long-Bailey is now taking questions. Q: This room isn\u2019t full. Are you worried that your campaign is not going as well as you hoped? Long-Bailey does not accept this. She says she has got some of her finest supporters in the room this morning. It is a long campaign, she says. And she did not have a campaign ready to go. She was concentrating on trying to win the election. She says she thought members would go through a grieving process. But she is standing to tell people that their ambitions are not wrong. Q: Do you only see a path to power outside parliament? She says Labour will only get into power if it has a strong membership. She wants to have a million members. And she thinks the party needs a more robust media strategy. The government wants Labour to be seen as the establishment, she says. It would like Labour to go down the route of \u201cshiny suit wearing\u201d, so they can tell Labour voters the party is unrepresentative. Long-Bailey says Tories want to portray Labour as an establishment, \u201cshiny suit wearing\u201d party. She says parliament has to have a role in giving power away. She wants the nations and regions to be given far more power. She says they also need to define what the role of the government is. She supports a written constitution, so that every decision a government makes should be based on how much it improves people\u2019s lives. UPDATE: This picture helps to explain the question about the room not being full. Long-Bailey is now winding up. When we win the next general election, I want you to be able to say that you stared defeat in the face last time. You felt the pain. But you picked yourself up and were part of a new path to power than runs through social justice, delivering a new, green economy, uniting our people, and empowering them to realise their hopes, dreams and aspirations. Because not only can we do that, it\u2019s the best way to win. So, let\u2019s empower our movement to show that big change is possible through a democratic revolution that delivers aspirational socialism and a green industrial revolution. That\u2019s our path to power. Let\u2019s take it together. Long-Bailey says she can do details and big vision. To deliver our path to power, we need both details and big vision. I do both. I\u2019m a details person. I work hard. I don\u2019t slack off. I suppose that\u2019s the benefit of being a working-class woman, always having to work twice as hard to show you\u2019re just as good, in fact better, than an upper-middle-class man. So yes, I do think it\u2019s time our party had a woman leader. Long-Bailey cites Falmouth as an example of a place where Labour should have promoted its green industrial revolution more effectively. Our green industrial revolution would have transformed Falmouth\u2019s fortunes - but we didn\u2019t get that message out. Alongside local businesses, the community and energy experts, we developed plans to expand Falmouth\u2019s historic docks, which are a big part of the town\u2019s identity. We worked out how we\u2019d use public investment to crowd in private capital to create marine technology jobs and floating offshore wind. We should have given our activists in the town a detailed vision to sell on the doorstep. The new, high-skill, high-tech jobs wouldn\u2019t just benefit those working in the docks. Those extra salaries would be spent supporting local businesses, helping revive the high street. The whole town could be renewed, and through the docks that help define its identity and give it pride and purpose. Long-Bailey turns to the need for a green industrial revolution. She says she is \u201csad\u201d that this did not feature more in the party\u2019s campaign during the general election. The green industrial revolution could have been for us what the NHS was to the 1945 Labour government, our huge, era-defining project. And it still can be. In fact, it must. Because our green industrial revolution can bring people together. It unites young people, who want to fight for our planet\u2019s survival, with workers in every community, from the largest cities, to our nations, towns and villages, who will see new green jobs and lower bills, and the whole country proud to be world leaders in combating the climate crisis. Long-Bailey says Labour has to tell a \u201cconcrete story\u201d about how this plan would help communities. The green industrial revolution will never take off if it\u2019s something done to people rather than done with them. Long-Bailey says Labour has to tell a credible story about how it will help people improve their lives. My socialism isn\u2019t just a moral socialism \u2013 an outrage at the injustice done to others. It\u2019s the socialism of the majority, where everyone can live better lives together. I believe building that majority for change is a socialism that wins. So our path to power requires us to speak an everyday language to people simply going about their normal lives. We have to understand that people want a better life for their children \u2013 that\u2019s aspiration \u2013 but we can only secure that together \u2013 that\u2019s socialism. Long-Bailey says Britain needs a democratic revolution. Westminster feels as distant to many people as Brussels. We need a democratic revolution to break the hold of Westminster and the City over our politics, and show people that they can and will have the power to achieve what they want to achieve. Six of the 10 poorest regions in northern Europe are in the UK, because for too long the fate of our regions has been in the hands of people who only visit them for a photo op in a hi-vis jacket. So power needs to be closer to people geographically, with meaningful new powers and funding devolved to local level to grow local economies, invest in communities and build council homes. We spoke about the economy in the general election, but we didn\u2019t have anything to say to people who\u2019d lost trust with democracy. And after the Iraq war, the expenses scandal and the austerity lie that we\u2019re all in it together, who can blame them? So to follow our path to power, we will champion a democratic revolution. And just the first step would be scrapping the House of Lords and creating an elected senate representing our regions and nations, to scrutinise how every law impacts inequality, the environment and our people\u2019s wellbeing. Long-Bailey says she would be more \u201crobust\u201d with the media. And my leadership will be far more robust with the media. Journalists have a vital role to play in our society. We should respect their work \u2013 and look to ways to free them from government or corporate influence. But let\u2019s be honest: large sections of the media represent vested interests. Much of the press is owned by billionaires, so it\u2019s no surprise they support the Tories and monster Labour. I\u2019ll not only call that out, I have a plan to deal with it. I\u2019ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won\u2019t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism. But a credible and effective communications strategy extends beyond just being more combative and self-confident. It must also be more creative. So I\u2019ll set up a dedicated creative digital communications unit in the party, producing viral content that can both get around media hostility and speak directly to voters. Long-Bailey says she wants to empower members. The least they can do is give them open selections, she says. She says she has heard the criticism about how the party should be focusing on getting rid of Tory MPs, not Labour ones. But having empowered members will allow the party to get rid of Tory MPs, she says. Long-Bailey says she thinks she is the only candidate to have worked out a path to power. It has four elements. To win again, Labour has to look like the party of the workers, she says. She says under her leadership it will back workers in every strike and every dispute against unfair employers. She says it will fight any further Tory attempt to restrict the unions. She says she has been wearing a \u201clove unions\u201d badge this week, because it is the love unions week. She says she was the only candidate on Newsnight wearing the badge. In her speech Long-Bailey has just quoted Tony Blair. In his introduction to the 1997 he said that the Labour party was the political arm of the British people, she says. She says he was right. Long-Bailey has tweeted a link to extracts from her speech. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, is delivering a speech in Salford. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. According to the advance briefing from her team, she is going to set out a path to power for Labour. Her team says it has four elements. 1) Improve Labour\u2019s messaging with \u201can everyday language\u201d of aspirational socialism to sell policies and principles 2) Empower our movement to reconnect with voters in the red wall and beyond 3) Stir up a democratic revolution to \u201cbreak the hold Westminster and the City over our politics, and show people that they can have the power to achieve what they want to achieve\u201d 4) Use the green industrial revolution to unite Labour\u2019s heartlands, from Blyth to Brixton And if you want to know what Sajid Javid is up to this morning, the former chancellor is at a pensioners\u2019 fair in his Bromsgrove constituency. Sky News has just broadcast some footage of Boris Johnson addressing his new cabinet. We\u2019re here to deliver for the people of this country. They have elected us to serve them and this government has to get on with delivering the people\u2019s priorities, and in the next few years we must get on with our basic work. And you know what it is? We are going to cut crime, we are going to tackle homelessness, we are going to tackle waiting lists in our NHS. At that point Johnson launched into his familiar primary school teacher routine. \u201cHow many hospitals are we going to build?\u201d he asked. \u201cForty,\u201d his ministers chanted back at him. No one was brave enough to say a more accurate figure would be six. Johnson then asked the same question about how many more police officers the government was recruiting (20,000, they told him) and how many more nurses (50,000, they told him - although arguably 30,000 is a more accurate figure). He also asked how many extra buses the government was providing, but only some of his ministers seemed to know the answer (announced in his statement to MPs on Tuesday) - 4,000. Johnson went on: All those things we want to achieve, but of course they won\u2019t make any difference in themselves. This is about improving the quality of everybody\u2019s life if possible. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Salma Shah, a former adviser to Sajid Javid, said it would have been \u201cincredibly detrimental\u201d to him if he had allowed No 10 to appoint his advisers. She explained: I think Sajid rightly understood that not having his own political advisers would be incredibly detrimental to his decision-making power. You cannot have a minister that does not appoint their own special advisers because they cannot appoint anyone else. They are the only people in a government department that are the minister\u2019s responsibility and chosen by them. She also played down suggestions that, as a backbencher, Javid would seek to cause problems for Boris Johnson. She said: I think the thing you have to remember about him as a person is he is non-confrontational. He is not someone who is going to rock the boat for the sake of his own ego. In an interview this morning Robert Jenrick, who kept his job as housing secretary, denied that Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, would be a \u201cpuppet\u201d because No 10 is not letting him appoint his own advisers. When this suggestion was put to him, Jenrick said: That\u2019s completely untrue. I know Rishi Sunak well and he is one of the most talented people in politics today. He is going to be a fantastic chancellor. He brings with him a great deal of experience from the private sector, he\u2019s been an excellent minister in my department, and now at the Treasury. He has been heavily involved in the preparations for the budget in March and I think he is going to hit the ground running. Ministers have been arriving at No 10 for the first meeting of the new cabinet. Here are some of them walking up Downing Street. Here is my colleague Graham Russell\u2019s round-up of how the papers have covered Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation. Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland and DUP leader, told the Today programme this morning that Brandon Lewis, the new Northern Ireland secretary, should \u201crevisit\u201d the scope of the historical investigation unit that was proposed in the power-sharing deal negotiated by his sacked predecessor. Under the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal (pdf) between the parties and the UK government that led to the restoration of the power-sharing executive, the UK promised to \u201cwithin 100 days, publish and introduce legislation in the UK parliament to implement the Stormont House agreement to address Northern Ireland legacy issues\u201d. The Stormont House agreement (pdf), which was agreed in 2014 but never implemented in full, promised: Legislation will establish a new independent body to take forward investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths; the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU). The body will take forward outstanding cases from the HET process, and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (PONI). A report will be produced in each case. Unionists fear this will lead to former soldiers and police officers facing fresh investigation over matters for which they thought they had been cleared. Foster told Today: [What was] originally mooted in the Stormont agreement does need to be revisited because a lot of matters have changed since then, not least the fact that the chief constable put all of the so-called state killings into the historical investigation unit, so there are great difficulties in that - not least that 90% of those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland were killed by paramilitaries, terrorists if you will. There is a need for balance in everything we do here in Northern Ireland. Asked if she would be asking Lewis to review the terms of the \u201cNew Decade, New Approach\u201d deal, Foster said: I had already written to the secretary of state Julian Smith a number of weeks ago saying to him it is very important that the victims take the lead in all of these issues and that there is a co-design of any legislation so they are at the heart of dealing with the matters of the past. It is very important that the victims are at the fore. I hope Brandon Lewis will listen to the voices of the victims. That is something I will certainly be saying to him. Walking into Downing Street, Mark Spencer, the chief whip, was asked by reporters if Sajid Javid had been forced out of the cabinet. As the Press Association reports, Spencer replied \u201cNo\u201d, before adding: \u201cIt\u2019s new a government.\u201d Good morning. Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of his new cabinet this morning and, while it is expected to discuss the government\u2019s plans for a new post-Brexit immigration system, many of the attendees - like the rest of Westminster - will probably spend just as much time mulling over the implications of the events that led up to yesterday\u2019s shock resignation of Sajid Javid as chancellor. The papers this morning are full of analysis - here is a take from my colleague Heather Stewart; I will post links to some others later - but, roughly speaking, the move raises four big questions about the future of British politics. 1) Does this mean Boris Johnson will now abandon the fiscal rules announced during the election, allowing him to borrow even more than planned for spending on infrastructure and public services? Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, is thought to be angling for this, and yesterday No 10 was vague about whether the government was still committed to those fiscal rules (which were already seen as a loosening from the Philip Hammond era). The rules were drafted when the Tories were expecting to win a small majority, and the scale of Johnson\u2019s victory in December means the pressure to deliver for new Tory voters in the north is much stronger than it was. 2) Does this mean Johnson is emasculating the Treasury? That certainly seems to be the intention, and yesterday one commentator said the plan to effectively merge No 10 and the Treasury into a more cohesive unit amounted to the \u201cmost significant development since the creation of the devolved parliaments in 1999\u201d. But most prime ministers try at one point to curtail the powers of No 11, and most of them fail. The Treasury may prove to be more institutionally resilient than Cummings imagines, and even if the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is more firmly under No 10\u2019s line management, he stills heads a department stuffed with hundreds of clever officials who are professionally trained to tell politicians truths they don\u2019t want to hear. 3) Does this mean Johnson is getting more like Donald Trump? In some respects, because the reshuffle had all the hallmarks of a powergrab, and the appointment of Suella Braverman as attorney general has gone down badly with defenders of the judiciary. But even though Johnson\u2019s preferred model for leadership is probably Emperor Augustus, cabinet government still very much applies. 4) Ultimately will this reshuffle leave Johnson politically stronger or politically weaker? At this point it is impossible to tell. Some Tory MPs must be unhappy about the way Javid has been treated, but if they are, they have not yet been saying so in public. Johnson is so powerful at the moment that he can more or less do whatever he wants, but that won\u2019t last forever and in the end the reshuffle will be judged by whether or not it delivers for the Conservative party. Here is our overnight story about the reshuffle. And here is a graphic from last night about the reshuffle. It features the 10 ministers who were allowed to attend cabinet before the reshuffle. No 10 has now drastically slimmed down those numbers and, in addition to the full cabinet, there will be only four extra attendees: Stephen Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury; Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons; Mark Spencer, the chief whip; and Suella Braverman, the attorney general. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the new cabinet. 10am: Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, give a speech in Salford. 1pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. Also, today is the final day for candidates for the Labour leadership and deputy leadership to get the CLP or affiliate nominations that they need to make it onto the final ballot. Emily Thornberry is the only candidate who still has not hit this threshold, but three more CLP nominations today would get her over the line. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Britain needs to take a \u201chard look\u201d and reconsider its decision to allow the Chinese firm Huawei into the UK 5G network, US officials have said.. The remarks, made on the margins of the Munich security conference on Friday, represent the most direct public warning from Washington to the UK that it should rethink and needs to recognise the high risk of exposure of the UK network to the Chinese state. the US officials stepped up their campaign against Huawei, claiming it can covertly access mobile phone networks around the world through \u201cback doors\u201d designed for use by law enforcement. The company stands accused of stealing trade secrets and lying to US federal investigators in a new US indictment released on Thursday. US officials said their intelligence showed Huawei had had a secret capability for more than a decade. Washington claims to have passed the highly classified intelligence to the UK and Germany. There have been reports of a highly charged phone call between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump in the wake of the UK decision. Johnson has postponed a planned visit to the US until the summer, citing the pressure of domestic work, but also reflecting the tensions between the two allies. At a briefing in Munich, Robert Blair, the White House special representative for international telecommunications policy, said Britain needed to take a \u201chard look\u201d at its decision to use equipment made by Huawei, which officials in Washington say is a security risk \u2013 charges the company denies. Blair said Washington was looking to develop a partnership with the telecoms industry to provide alternatives to Huawei\u2019s technology. He said a partnership was \u201cvery different from buying shares with taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d. Blair stressed that the UK decision, even if not reversed, would not lead to an end to intelligence cooperation between the close allies, but added that it might require the US to rethink how it shares data. Britain and, to a lesser extent, Germany have said it is possible to keep Huawei away from the core network, and not allow the firm greater than 35% access. But the US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said: \u201cWe have evidence that Huawei has the capability secretly to access sensitive and personal information in systems it maintains and sells around the world.\u201d Another senior US official said: \u201cHuawei does not disclose this covert access to its local customers, or the host nation national security agencies.\u201d The UK has repeatedly argued that any security risks from Huawei can be contained, with its decision to allow the Chinese company a role in 5G technology taken in line with recommendations from its intelligence agency GCHQ. British politicians and officials have also sought to downplay the differences with the US on the issue, arguing that they want to work with the US in developing alternatives. But many Conservative party backbenchers remain concerned by the intensity of the US lobbying and are trying to pressure Johnson into agreeing that Huawei will be eliminated from British networks in the next two to three years in an attempt to reach a compromise that the Trump administration would accept. The US tried to buttress its intelligence disclosures by charging Huawei with racketeering, conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets in the new federal indictment. Huawei also helped Iran\u2019s government by installing surveillance equipment to monitor, identify and detain protesters during the 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Tehran, the indictment alleged. The Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, threw her party\u2019s weight behind the White House warnings, saying that to allow Huawei into European networks would be \u201cto choose autocracy over democracy\u201d. She also accused China of threatening economic retaliation against those who do not accept its technology, saying Europe should not adopt Chinese technology on the basis of short-term economic reasons. Her remarks underlined the bipartisan American opposition to Huawei. The US moves came as the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, arrived in Munich, in part to discuss the German decision to allow Huawei limited access to its 5G network. Huawei dismissed the new indictment as part of the US justice department\u2019s attempt to \u201cirrevocably damage Huawei\u2019s reputation and its business for reasons related to competition rather than law enforcement\u201d. It added: \u201cThe \u2018racketeering enterprise\u2019 that the government charged today is nothing more than a contrived repackaging of a handful of civil allegations that are almost 20 years old.\u201d The future role of China, and the gradual retreat of the US from the world stage, will be a central theme of the Munich conference.

the Swan, After Michelangelo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Leda and the Swan, 1530, After Michelangelo<br></strong>Love comes in strange shapes in Renaissance art \u2013 bulls, clouds, eagles and goats are among its diverse embodiments. Many such transformations depict the disguises in which the god Jupiter has sex in Ovid\u2019s ancient Latin poem, the Metamorphoses. This painting uses the theme to suggest something secret and subversive. It is the best surviving record of a lost painting by Michelangelo that depicts Jupiter taking the body of a swan to snuggle with Leda. But Michelangelo\u2019s female nudes are, famously, not very female. The body of Leda here is based on his own statue, Night, and neither makes much attempt at looking like a woman. For Michelangelo loved men. He escaped accusations of \u201csodomy\u201d by saying his passion for male beauty was purely spiritual. This painting suggests otherwise. Leda\u2019s face is a portrait of <a href=\"https://www.casabuonarroti.it/en/museum/collections/michelangelos-drawings/studies-for-the-head-of-leda/\">his male assistant Antonio Mini</a>, and the way the swan\u2019s beak approaches Leda\u2019s lips is clearly meant to suggest fellatio.</p> <p>Michelangelo painted this transgressive image when he was commander of fortifications for the Florentine Republic during a brutal siege. He expected to die soon alongside the ardent young men defending the battlements. In that moment of crisis, he created this deeply personal confession of desire \u2013 a dangerous Valentine.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/after-michelangelo-leda-and-the-swan\">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2>Don\u2019t forget</h2> <p>To follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gdnartanddesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@GdnArtandDesign</a>.</p> <h2>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</h2> <p>If you don\u2019t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email\">please sign up here</a>.</p>",

Many such transformations depict the disguises in which the god Jupiter has sex in Ovid\u2019s ancient Latin poem, the Metamorphoses. This painting uses the theme to suggest something secret and subversive. It is the best surviving record of a lost painting by Michelangelo that depicts Jupiter taking the body of a swan to snuggle with Leda. But Michelangelo\u2019s female nudes are, famously, not very female. The body of Leda here is based on his own statue, Night, and neither makes much attempt at looking like a woman. For Michelangelo loved men. He escaped accusations of \u201csodomy\u201d by saying his passion for male beauty was purely spiritual. This painting suggests otherwise. Leda\u2019s face is a portrait of his male assistant Antonio Mini, and the way the swan\u2019s beak approaches Leda\u2019s lips is clearly meant to suggest fellatio. Michelangelo painted this transgressive image when he was commander of fortifications for the Florentine Republic during a brutal siege. He expected to die soon alongside the ardent young men defending the battlements. In that moment of crisis, he created this deeply personal confession of desire \u2013 a dangerous Valentine. \u2022 National Gallery, London Don\u2019t forget To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

If I had my way, it would have reinvented its approach to \u2018waste\u2019, mass-produced fashion would no longer exist and we would value clothes for how they are made, not by whom. I believe this is possible: last year, I launched TRASHMag - a magazine focusing on designers and artists producing ethical work. The nine young innovators here are part of that cohort. From the milliner growing plant-based biomaterials to the designer collaging old trainers, their ideas are blueprints for a fashion future that doesn\u2019t cost the earth. * * * Amelie Gaydoul Fashioning menswear from table linen For her final show at the University of Westminster, the recent fashion graduate produced a visual memoir of history based on her grandmother\u2019s restaurant in southern Germany. Gaydoul utilised the restaurant\u2019s 100-year-old tablecloths and napkins as the main fabrics for her collection \u2013 food and beer stains included. Many of the looks were accessorised with silver spoons sourced in London\u2019s antique markets; she aimed to highlight that we \u201cdon\u2019t appreciate what we are surrounded by because we are living in such a fast-paced world\u201d. Ameliemarie.Gaydoul * * * Duran Lantink Repurposing designer cast-offs The half-Dutch, half-South-American, Amsterdam-based designer \u2013 who famously designed the \u201cvagina trousers\u201d Janelle Mon\u00e1e wore for her Pynk video \u2013 makes new garments by merging luxury labels\u2019 unwanted items. Embodied in his pieces, which have also been worn by the likes of Billie Eilish, is the essence of an unusual fashion encounter. Deadstock, or unsold items and unused fabric, from Nike, Dr Martens, Herm\u00e8s and Dries Van Noten has been used to make a single pair of shoes. It\u2019s no surprise he is drawn to high-calibre brands \u2013 his \u201cfashion-forward\u201d mother has a taste for Margiela and Gucci. \u201cI\u2019d cut up garments I found in her closet from as young as nine,\u201d he says. Lantink also has a bespoke service, and works with Liberty and Browns to make collections from the stores\u2019 deadstock. \u201cWhen I started, there was never \u2018sustainability\u2019. But it\u2019s what I\u2019ve done forever and I couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else.\u201d Available at Browns, Farfetch and Modesens * * * Cecily Cracroft-Eley Turning bark and nuts into garments The Central St Martins BA knitwear student graduated last year with a handcrafted collection made mainly from natural materials including walnuts, nzimbu shells, organic jute twine and bark cloth sourced from the forests of Uganda, where she spent her placement year. \u201cI became obsessed with local, traditional crafts and the community aspect \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful to see people working together,\u201d she says. Witnessing shockingly unethical practices in the industry while interning in Paris prompted her to use only natural and recycled fabrics for her final collection. This month she is returning to the same place in Uganda to work with the women in the community there, believing \u201cthe most modern thing we can do now is return to craft. The entire system needs reshuffling.\u201d cecilyophelia.com * * * Priya Ahluwalia Bringing new life to unwanted clothes For AW20, the menswear designer, who studied for her BA at UCA Epsom and her MA at Westminster, focused on the year 1965. \u201cMy mum\u2019s Indian, Dad\u2019s Nigerian and my stepdad is from Jamaica: I wanted to look at the year in the countries I\u2019m affected by,\u201d she says. Witnessing \u201cthe sheer amount of clothing we get rid of\u201d, on a visit to Panipat in India and when working in high street fashion, made Ahluwalia want to utilise deadstock, the unused fabric and clothes made by brands. It\u2019s a method she has practised since founding her label in 2017. She believes that \u201cevery industry needs to have a hard look at itself \u2013 I\u2019m going to be a designer but I\u2019m going to do it in the best way possible.\u201d Available at Browns * * * Leo Carlton Making millinery modern Finally, somebody has transported millinery \u2013 traditionally associated with Ascot and weddings \u2013 into the 21st century. Carlton was brought up in Oxfordshire, where he is now growing plant-based biomaterials to make headpieces that he digitally prints using virtual reality and 3D software. \u201cMy dad is a farmer \u2013 if you get barley at the right time, it can look like certain feathers, if you treat and dye it right,\u201d he says. Carlton studied fashion, bags and accessories at the London College of Fashion and has since been working on his futuristic, yet delicately botanical headpieces. They symbolise that in a time of crisis, nature usually has the answers. studio@leocarlton.com * * * Matthew Needham Upcycling old pieces into new designs Needham describes the way he works as \u201cputting something that has no materialistic value into a fashion context\u201d.

Your super, soaraway, self-coupled Fiver was planning to spend it like every other Valentine\u2019s Day: on our own, watching a fuzzy, unspeakably erotic VHS called Goals Galore 1988-89. Then we realised that the Premier League\u2019s weird, staggered, why-can\u2019t-we-just-do-it-like-the-rest-of-Europe winter break includes a match between Wolves and Leicester that we can watch tonight! It\u2019s the first part of a scattered fixture list that needs its own Craig David tribute song: took her for a drink to watch Southampton v Burnley, we were discussing the pros and cons of a double pivot by Monday, restraining order was in place by Thursday. The Premier League title race is over \u2013 Liverpool could declare, donating their last 13 games to charitable causes like Everton and Manchester United, and they\u2019d still probably win the league \u2013 so the focus will be on the relegation battle as the weekend develops. Tonight, however, is the time for lovin\u2019 Adama Traor\u00e9. Despite suffering another partial dislocation of a shoulder a fortnight ago, he will be fit to put the fear of higher power into Leicester\u2019s defence at Molineux . Traor\u00e9\u2019s rapid recovery registers 8.9 on The Fiver\u2019s hardbastometer, the highest rating since Diego Costa actually, literally, seriously tried to run off a hamstring tear in the 2014 Big Cup final.

However, we also know that the immunity from mumps vaccine can wane over time. This means you can still get mumps even if fully vaccinated; although mumps can be nasty especially in people past puberty, it is usually much milder in previously vaccinated people, so the best way to avoid mumps is to get the vaccine.\u201d</p> <p>Mumps used to be a common viral infection. It causes painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face, which may be preceded by headaches, joint pain and fever. In rare cases, it can cause meningitis, deafness and infertility.</p> <p>PHE urged young people to have the vaccine if they were in any doubt. \u201cThe best protection against mumps and its complications is to have two doses of the MMR vaccine. It\u2019s never too late to catch up,\u201d said Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at PHE.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said anyone in any doubt as to whether they had been vaccinated should contact their GP. \u201cThe rise in mumps cases is alarming and yet another example of the long-term damage caused by anti-vax information,\u201d he said. \u201cScience proves that vaccines are the best form of defence against a host of potentially deadly diseases and are safer and more effective than ever before. Those who claim otherwise are risking people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p>",

Helen Bedford, professor of child public health at UCL, said the large number of cases was of concern. \u201cThese are mainly occurring among older teens and young adults who either had no doses of MMR vaccine when they were young or only had one dose. However, we also know that the immunity from mumps vaccine can wane over time. This means you can still get mumps even if fully vaccinated; although mumps can be nasty especially in people past puberty, it is usually much milder in previously vaccinated people, so the best way to avoid mumps is to get the vaccine.\u201d Mumps used to be a common viral infection. It causes painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face, which may be preceded by headaches, joint pain and fever. In rare cases, it can cause meningitis, deafness and infertility. PHE urged young people to have the vaccine if they were in any doubt. \u201cThe best protection against mumps and its complications is to have two doses of the MMR vaccine. It\u2019s never too late to catch up,\u201d said Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at PHE. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said anyone in any doubt as to whether they had been vaccinated should contact their GP. \u201cThe rise in mumps cases is alarming and yet another example of the long-term damage caused by anti-vax information,\u201d he said. \u201cScience proves that vaccines are the best form of defence against a host of potentially deadly diseases and are safer and more effective than ever before. Those who claim otherwise are risking people\u2019s lives.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>California authorities used the same DNA techniques that led to the capture of the suspected Golden State Killer to free a man who spent about 15 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted in the slaying of his housemate.</p> <p>Ricky Davis was ordered released from custody during an emotional court hearing in Placerville, near Sacramento, on Thursday, after authorities used extended DNA links developed through publicly available genealogical websites to build a family tree that led to the arrest of a new suspect in the killing of his housemate.</p> <p>Hours later a smiling Davis walked out of El Dorado county jail surrounded by family and friends.</p> <p>When asked by reporters to comment on his release he answered \u201cno comment, thank you\u201d, and held up a black sweatshirt embroidered with a yellow Innocence Project logo.</p> <p>Davis, 54, had always maintained his innocence.</p> <p>The El Dorado county district attorney, Vern Pierson, would not go into detail on the newly implicated suspect, who was a juvenile at the time of the slaying and by law must make at least his first appearances in juvenile court even though he is now in his 50s, but said he was one of three young men who had been with the victim\u2019s teenage daughter on the night of the slaying.</p> <p>Pierson said the developments are \u201ctwo of the most dramatic extremes that you can experience\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand, we have the system working in the worst possible way. On the other hand, we have the evolution of technology in terms of genetic genealogy\u201d that led to Davis being freed and a new suspect arrested this week, he said. \u201cIt is a surreal thing in a sense.\u201d</p> <p>The same DNA techniques in 2018 identified former police officer Joseph DeAngelo as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/13/golden-state-killer-13-victims-murder-charge\">suspected Golden State Killer</a>, who is now awaiting trial for numerous homicides and rapes across California in the 1970s and 1980s.</p> <p>It has since been used to find suspects in nearly 80 cases nationwide, said Anne Marie Schubert, the district attorney in neighboring Sacramento county whose office made the DNA link in both cases. But it\u2019s only the second time the new technique has exonerated a suspect, the first being last year in Idaho when Christopher Tapp was cleared of the 1996 murder of Angie Dodge, she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt must be remembered that this is not a tool of conviction, it is a tool of justice,\u201d Schubert said.</p> <p>Jane Hylton, a 54-year-old columnist for the Foothills Times, was found dead \u2013 stabbed 29 times and bitten on the shoulder \u2013 on 7 July 7 1985 inside an El Dorado Hills home. She was staying there temporarily with her teenage daughter, Davis and Davis\u2019s then girlfriend, Connie Dahl.</p> <p>The man arrested this week was one of three youths who were in a park that night with the then-13-year-old daughter of the victim.</p> <p>One of the three boys is now dead and another is cooperating in the investigation, Pierson said. That man is not believed to have participated in the slaying, but may have known about it afterward, he said. The daughter is not a suspect and helped identify the new suspect, he said.</p> <p>Davis and Dahl told detectives they had gone to a party the night before and returned home at 3.30am where they found Hylton\u2019s daughter waiting outside. The teenager told them she had gone out with a group of boys that night and was afraid her mother would be upset with her for being out too late, according to an online synopsis of the case by the Innocence Project, which is part of the Santa Clara University School of Law.</p> <p>\u201cThe three entered the house together. Davis saw blood in the hallway outside the master bedroom and found Hylton\u2019s body on the bed. Davis and Dahl immediately called 911 to report the crime. All three maintained they were not involved in the murder and did not know who committed the crime,\u201d according to the project.</p> <p>The case went unsolved until detectives reopened it in late 1999.</p> <p>Dahl changed her story under what Pierson said were the aggressive interrogation techniques in use at the time, implicating Davis as the killer and telling detectives that she bit the victim during the attack. He said the two investigators have since retired.</p> <p>More sophisticated recent DNA tests found unknown male DNA on the nightgown in the area of the bite mark and the same DNA profile under the victim\u2019s fingernails. Those tests excluded Davis, Dahl and Hylton\u2019s daughter as the sources of the DNA.</p> <p>That led to Davis\u2019s murder conviction being overturned in 2019 after project lawyers argued that \u201chad the original jury heard the DNA results, it would have likely reached a different outcome\u201d. He remained in jail until investigators were satisfied they had the real killer in custody.</p> <p>Dahl, who received a one-year county jail sentence in the case, died in 2014.</p> <p>Innocence Project staff attorney Melissa O\u2019Connell said she thought she had the evidence to free her client in 2014, yet it took six more years before investigators were satisfied that they had found the real killer.</p> <p>She said she was in tears and her client was emotional in court as he was ordered freed. He planned to celebrate with pizza and will be entitled to more than $750,000 in state compensation because he was wrongfully convicted, $140 for each day he spent behind bars.</p> <p>A prosecutor shook Davis\u2019s hand, she said, and \u201che got to hug his mom for the first time in court today in a very, very long time\u201d.</p>",

Hours later a smiling Davis walked out of El Dorado county jail surrounded by family and friends. When asked by reporters to comment on his release he answered \u201cno comment, thank you\u201d, and held up a black sweatshirt embroidered with a yellow Innocence Project logo. Davis, 54, had always maintained his innocence. The El Dorado county district attorney, Vern Pierson, would not go into detail on the newly implicated suspect, who was a juvenile at the time of the slaying and by law must make at least his first appearances in juvenile court even though he is now in his 50s, but said he was one of three young men who had been with the victim\u2019s teenage daughter on the night of the slaying. Pierson said the developments are \u201ctwo of the most dramatic extremes that you can experience\u201d. \u201cOn the one hand, we have the system working in the worst possible way. On the other hand, we have the evolution of technology in terms of genetic genealogy\u201d that led to Davis being freed and a new suspect arrested this week, he said. \u201cIt is a surreal thing in a sense.\u201d The same DNA techniques in 2018 identified former police officer Joseph DeAngelo as the suspected Golden State Killer, who is now awaiting trial for numerous homicides and rapes across California in the 1970s and 1980s. It has since been used to find suspects in nearly 80 cases nationwide, said Anne Marie Schubert, the district attorney in neighboring Sacramento county whose office made the DNA link in both cases. But it\u2019s only the second time the new technique has exonerated a suspect, the first being last year in Idaho when Christopher Tapp was cleared of the 1996 murder of Angie Dodge, she said. \u201cIt must be remembered that this is not a tool of conviction, it is a tool of justice,\u201d Schubert said. Jane Hylton, a 54-year-old columnist for the Foothills Times, was found dead \u2013 stabbed 29 times and bitten on the shoulder \u2013 on 7 July 7 1985 inside an El Dorado Hills home. She was staying there temporarily with her teenage daughter, Davis and Davis\u2019s then girlfriend, Connie Dahl. The man arrested this week was one of three youths who were in a park that night with the then-13-year-old daughter of the victim. One of the three boys is now dead and another is cooperating in the investigation, Pierson said. That man is not believed to have participated in the slaying, but may have known about it afterward, he said. The daughter is not a suspect and helped identify the new suspect, he said. Davis and Dahl told detectives they had gone to a party the night before and returned home at 3.30am where they found Hylton\u2019s daughter waiting outside. The teenager told them she had gone out with a group of boys that night and was afraid her mother would be upset with her for being out too late, according to an online synopsis of the case by the Innocence Project, which is part of the Santa Clara University School of Law. \u201cThe three entered the house together. Davis saw blood in the hallway outside the master bedroom and found Hylton\u2019s body on the bed. Davis and Dahl immediately called 911 to report the crime. All three maintained they were not involved in the murder and did not know who committed the crime,\u201d according to the project. The case went unsolved until detectives reopened it in late 1999. Dahl changed her story under what Pierson said were the aggressive interrogation techniques in use at the time, implicating Davis as the killer and telling detectives that she bit the victim during the attack. He said the two investigators have since retired. More sophisticated recent DNA tests found unknown male DNA on the nightgown in the area of the bite mark and the same DNA profile under the victim\u2019s fingernails. Those tests excluded Davis, Dahl and Hylton\u2019s daughter as the sources of the DNA. That led to Davis\u2019s murder conviction being overturned in 2019 after project lawyers argued that \u201chad the original jury heard the DNA results, it would have likely reached a different outcome\u201d. He remained in jail until investigators were satisfied they had the real killer in custody. Dahl, who received a one-year county jail sentence in the case, died in 2014. Innocence Project staff attorney Melissa O\u2019Connell said she thought she had the evidence to free her client in 2014, yet it took six more years before investigators were satisfied that they had found the real killer. She said she was in tears and her client was emotional in court as he was ordered freed. He planned to celebrate with pizza and will be entitled to more than $750,000 in state compensation because he was wrongfully convicted, $140 for each day he spent behind bars. A prosecutor shook Davis\u2019s hand, she said, and \u201che got to hug his mom for the first time in court today in a very, very long time\u201d.",

Now.\u201d Greta Thunberg, who initiated the movement as a solitary striker in Stockholm in August 2018, said climate strikes were planned in 2,000 cities across the world on Friday, and that bigger actions were planned for the coming months. In many countries, the protests have expanded to include local environmental concerns, new strategies and stronger emphasis on global climate justice. In India on Friday, strikers turned their focus on government plans to deforest swathes of the Aravallis mountain range, which is a conservation area that provides freshwater and oxygen for Delhi and other cities. Some carried banners in English reading: \u201cI love Aravallis\u201d, \u201cOur green lungs\u201d and \u201cProtectors are turning destroyers\u201d. In Sydney, climate strikers demonstrated with banners that depicted the devastating bushfires and blamed the government of Scott Morrison for the \u201cclimate chaos\u201d that has hit Australia. In the Philippines, climate strikers organised an educational storytelling campaign to raise public awareness. In Scotland, Holly Gillibrand, who was one of the first strikers in the UK when she started a vigil outside Lochaber high school in Fort William in the Highlands, said the growth of the movement had been incredible. \u201cWhen I began striking over a year ago, Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future [campaign] were not well known at all and I was one of very few strikers in the UK, but since then, everything has changed.

Among those striking for the first time on Friday was a group in Rwanda, where protesters tweeted Timages of themselves holding signs that said: \u201cRwanda stand for climate.\u201d Friday\u2019s action was not intended as a mega-strike like those in September, when more than 6 million people took part, but it showed how the campaign has evolved. Maryam Grassly, 17, who was among the hundreds of strikers in central London, said: \u201cThe most enthusiastic and passionate people have stayed on, and more people have got involved and been inspired by it, but at the same time we\u2019ve lost the people who didn\u2019t really care.\u201d But in her mind there was no question about the relevance of the protest. \u201cWhen the election happened and Boris [Johnson] got voted in I just kind of gave up on the world, I thought that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the climate emergency and net zero by 2050 but nothing is happening as fast as it should be.\u201d Similarly she was \u201cexcited but worried\u201d about the UK hosting Cop26 later this year, saying the previous conference of the parties in Madrid did not go well. But the protesters were still hopeful about the difference they have made over the past few months. Maude Brown, 17, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned about the issue for almost a decade, I was taught about it in year 4, and no one really cared then so I\u2019m happy that everyone is concerned about it now. I think as more politicians from our generation come in we can make a lot of change in the future.\u201d Most of the strikers were teenagers, but there were some younger children too. Claire Bullivant, from Essex, has been bringing her children Imogen, 12, Max, 9 and Theodore, 5, to the strikes for a few months. \u201cI just think it\u2019s so important to get them involved and to support them because they\u2019re so aware of what\u2019s happening in the world, and they see it in the news, and we don\u2019t want to sit back and do nothing,\u201d Bullivant said. While her daughter\u2019s school has been supportive of her decision to take time off for the strikes, her sons\u2019 school has been less so, but Bullivant said the time off was \u201ctotally justified\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s educational, it\u2019s empowering to be part of a community and show that they\u2019re trying to make a difference to the world, I just don\u2019t think you can underestimate experiences like this,\u201d she said. Asked why she was so keen to get involved, Imogen said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t save the Earth there\u2019s not going to be anywhere else for us to live.\u201d A year ago, the size of the protests in the UK took police by surprise, as thousands defied their teachers to skip school and join the still nascent movement.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Some things you do get a life of their own,\u201d Dorothea Lange once told an interviewer. \u201cThey cut loose from the person who made them.\u201d She was referring to her photograph <a href=\"http://100photos.time.com/photos/dorothea-lange-migrant-mother\">Migrant Mother</a>, in which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2018/jun/19/dorothea-lange-politics-of-seeing-at-barbican-centre\">distilled the collective trauma of the Great Depression</a> into a single, hauntingly intimate portrait of Florence Owens Thompson, a sharecropper\u2019s wife.</p> <p>Taken in 1936, it became one of the most famous images of the 20th century, but the way it came to define her work made Lange ambivalent about the role \u2013 and limits \u2013 of documentary photography.</p> <p>Fifty-five years after her death, as a retrospective of Lange\u2019s work <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5079\">pulls in </a><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5079\">crowds at MoMA in New York</a>, a new book shows just how far she travelled in her efforts to redefine herself. The images in <a href=\"https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/day-sleeper-dorothea-lange-sam-contis-ed\">Day Sleeper</a> tend towards quiet observation, the intimacy Lange captured often heightened by the way she cropped portraits to accentuate the curves of bodies and the textures of clothes. The book is revelatory, a deftly executed reappraisal of an already revered photographer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77ecdcde291ec15e05b0b56db2222dd0e8deb993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77ecdcde291ec15e05b0b56db2222dd0e8deb993/0_0_1772_2216/800.png\" alt=\"from \u2018Day Sleeper\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intimate gestures \u2026 from Day Sleeper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dorothea Lange/Library of Congress; The Crowley Company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Day Sleeper, the American photographer <a href=\"http://www.1000wordsmag.com/sam-contis/\">Sam Contis</a> was granted access to the extensive Dorothea Lange archive at the Oakland Museum of California. It comprises 25,000 negatives and 6,000 vintage prints, as well as extensive field notes, letters and other personal memorabilia. \u201cIt was a bit overwhelming at first,\u201d says Contis, \u201cand, for a long time, I lived in Lange-land, putting rough prints on the wall and spending time with them. After a while, there were pictures I instinctively kept coming back to, many of which I realised had some relationship to my work. The more time I spent with her images, the more I felt a kinship.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone familiar with Contis\u2019s recent book <a href=\"https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/deep-springs-br-sam-contis\">Deep Springs</a>, for which she spent four years photographing in and around an isolated ranch-cum-college in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains, will detect the visual parallels. While Contis\u2019s concerns are contemporary \u2013 an exploration of modern ultra-masculinity as constructed in a strict, old-fashioned, all-male environment \u2013 her quiet observational style has much in common with many of the images in Day Sleeper.</p> <p>\u201cI was looking for difference,\u201d says Contis, \u201cand I was struck by the ways she found to convey intimacy: her interest in gestures, movement, the way she photographed fragments of the human body or cropped her portraits.\u201d</p> <p>Many images Contis selected are closeups of torsos, hands and faces. Lange\u2019s subjects are often women caught in repose, resting or sleeping, and their quiet, relaxed stillness is palpable. The languorousness she evokes is in sharp contrast to the anxiety and isolation that is an undercurrent in her work from the Depression.</p> <p>Day Sleeper includes some of Lange\u2019s early studio portraits and street photography. The book\u2019s title is taken from Lange\u2019s photograph of a sign above a shelter at the El Cerrito docks in California, where workers could nap between shifts. In another image, she captures young and old workers at a union meeting, their expressions ranging from expectant to thoughtful. On closer inspection, the eye is drawn to a single arresting detail: a long thread of spittle hanging from a handsome young man\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Lange seems utterly immersed in her own world of small things: the way strands of hair fall over the faces of her young daughters; the texture of fabric on the curves of a body; how twisted branches can resemble contorted human limbs. Her ways of depicting or evoking the human body, often in fragmented form, are revealing given her own traumatic medical history. Having contracted polio aged seven, she was left with a permanent limp that she disguised, says Contis, \u201cwith long skirts, long pants and a kind of dancing walk\u201d. Lange once remarked: \u201cIt formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me. I\u2019ve never gotten over it, and I am aware of the force and power of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7a8a61db2f9e2788af30a579b6bba2873b273ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7a8a61db2f9e2788af30a579b6bba2873b273ed/0_0_1772_1875/945.png\" alt=\"From \u2018Day Sleeper\u2019 by Dorothea Lange and Sam Contis.\" width=\"945\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women caught in repose \u2026 from Day Sleeper by Dorothea Lange and Sam Contis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Library of Congress; The Crowley Company/Courtesy of MACK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She created a brilliant body of work under sometimes challenging physical conditions, often lugging heavy plate cameras around in the deadening heat. One coded image in Day Sleeper reflects Lange\u2019s inner struggles. It depicts a cinema marquee advertising a 1949 melodrama called The Young Lovers, which starred the actor Ida Lupino. Contis notes that Lange \u201cfilled an entire contact sheet with images of this movie marquee\u201d. Like Lange, Lupino was a polio survivor, and in the film she played a young dancer stricken by the disease. A world of suffering and identification lies behind the image.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/17/dorothea-lange-politics-of-seeing-barbican-review\">Dorothea Lange: Politics of Seeing review \u2013 a visionary whose camera never lied</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Little wonder then that Lange had a keen eye for movement and gesture. She once recalled, as a child, seeing Isadora Duncan dance, describing it as \u201can experience that affected me throughout my life\u201d. Even then, her eye was acute \u2013 she noticed how Duncan moved off-stage as well as on: \u201cMy, how strangely she walked \u2026 with a peculiar grace, not grace as I had preconceived it, but different.\u201d</p> <p>There is a peculiar grace to many of the photographs in Day Sleeper, prompting us to revise any preconceived opinions of Lange, who emerges as a surprisingly contemporary image-maker attuned to small, telling gestures as well as bigger defining moments.</p> <p>\u201cThe sad thing is that she regretted not having lived what she called a completely visual life,\u201d says Contis. \u201cTowards the end, she said she was just starting to understand what photography could do.\u201d For Dorothea Lange, the medium\u2019s possibilities were limitless and she was quietly and attentively open to them all.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/day-sleeper-dorothea-lange-sam-contis-ed\">Day Sleeper is out now from Mack</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Some things you do get a life of their own,\u201d Dorothea Lange once told an interviewer. \u201cThey cut loose from the person who made them.\u201d She was referring to her photograph Migrant Mother, in which she distilled the collective trauma of the Great Depression into a single, hauntingly intimate portrait of Florence Owens Thompson, a sharecropper\u2019s wife. Taken in 1936, it became one of the most famous images of the 20th century, but the way it came to define her work made Lange ambivalent about the role \u2013 and limits \u2013 of documentary photography. Fifty-five years after her death, as a retrospective of Lange\u2019s work pulls in crowds at MoMA in New York, a new book shows just how far she travelled in her efforts to redefine herself. The images in Day Sleeper tend towards quiet observation, the intimacy Lange captured often heightened by the way she cropped portraits to accentuate the curves of bodies and the textures of clothes. The book is revelatory, a deftly executed reappraisal of an already revered photographer. For Day Sleeper, the American photographer Sam Contis was granted access to the extensive Dorothea Lange archive at the Oakland Museum of California. It comprises 25,000 negatives and 6,000 vintage prints, as well as extensive field notes, letters and other personal memorabilia. \u201cIt was a bit overwhelming at first,\u201d says Contis, \u201cand, for a long time, I lived in Lange-land, putting rough prints on the wall and spending time with them. After a while, there were pictures I instinctively kept coming back to, many of which I realised had some relationship to my work. The more time I spent with her images, the more I felt a kinship.\u201d Anyone familiar with Contis\u2019s recent book Deep Springs, for which she spent four years photographing in and around an isolated ranch-cum-college in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains, will detect the visual parallels. While Contis\u2019s concerns are contemporary \u2013 an exploration of modern ultra-masculinity as constructed in a strict, old-fashioned, all-male environment \u2013 her quiet observational style has much in common with many of the images in Day Sleeper. \u201cI was looking for difference,\u201d says Contis, \u201cand I was struck by the ways she found to convey intimacy: her interest in gestures, movement, the way she photographed fragments of the human body or cropped her portraits.\u201d Many images Contis selected are closeups of torsos, hands and faces. Lange\u2019s subjects are often women caught in repose, resting or sleeping, and their quiet, relaxed stillness is palpable. The languorousness she evokes is in sharp contrast to the anxiety and isolation that is an undercurrent in her work from the Depression. Day Sleeper includes some of Lange\u2019s early studio portraits and street photography. The book\u2019s title is taken from Lange\u2019s photograph of a sign above a shelter at the El Cerrito docks in California, where workers could nap between shifts. In another image, she captures young and old workers at a union meeting, their expressions ranging from expectant to thoughtful. On closer inspection, the eye is drawn to a single arresting detail: a long thread of spittle hanging from a handsome young man\u2019s mouth. Elsewhere, Lange seems utterly immersed in her own world of small things: the way strands of hair fall over the faces of her young daughters; the texture of fabric on the curves of a body; how twisted branches can resemble contorted human limbs. Her ways of depicting or evoking the human body, often in fragmented form, are revealing given her own traumatic medical history. Having contracted polio aged seven, she was left with a permanent limp that she disguised, says Contis, \u201cwith long skirts, long pants and a kind of dancing walk\u201d. Lange once remarked: \u201cIt formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me. I\u2019ve never gotten over it, and I am aware of the force and power of it.\u201d She created a brilliant body of work under sometimes challenging physical conditions, often lugging heavy plate cameras around in the deadening heat. One coded image in Day Sleeper reflects Lange\u2019s inner struggles. It depicts a cinema marquee advertising a 1949 melodrama called The Young Lovers, which starred the actor Ida Lupino. Contis notes that Lange \u201cfilled an entire contact sheet with images of this movie marquee\u201d. Like Lange, Lupino was a polio survivor, and in the film she played a young dancer stricken by the disease. A world of suffering and identification lies behind the image. Little wonder then that Lange had a keen eye for movement and gesture. She once recalled, as a child, seeing Isadora Duncan dance, describing it as \u201can experience that affected me throughout my life\u201d. Even then, her eye was acute \u2013 she noticed how Duncan moved off-stage as well as on: \u201cMy, how strangely she walked \u2026 with a peculiar grace, not grace as I had preconceived it, but different.\u201d There is a peculiar grace to many of the photographs in Day Sleeper, prompting us to revise any preconceived opinions of Lange, who emerges as a surprisingly contemporary image-maker attuned to small, telling gestures as well as bigger defining moments. \u201cThe sad thing is that she regretted not having lived what she called a completely visual life,\u201d says Contis. \u201cTowards the end, she said she was just starting to understand what photography could do.\u201d For Dorothea Lange, the medium\u2019s possibilities were limitless and she was quietly and attentively open to them all. Day Sleeper is out now from Mack. Sam Contis is at the London Review Bookshop, London, on 21 February. Dorothea Lange: Words and Pictures is at MoMA, New York, until 9 May.",

      "bodyText": "The attempt by Boris Johnson to emasculate the Treasury and seize control of economic policy is doomed to failure, people close to the former prime minister Gordon Brown have said. Brown, who served as chancellor for a decade between 1997 and 2007 before a three-year stint at 10 Downing Street, is convinced the size and range of the Treasury will stifle the turf-war plans of Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. \u201cThe Treasury will always be sufficiently powerful to make it impossible for No 10 to make decisions,\u201d one source close to Brown said. The source added that the Treasury would counter Johnson\u2019s power grab by holding back information about the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s all about information, not just to growth but also what\u2019s happening to all aspects of public spending.\u201d Torsten Bell, a special adviser to Alistair Darling and now head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said it was wrong to see Sajid Javid\u2019s departure as the end of the Treasury\u2019s independence. \u201cIt means the influence of the Treasury is weakened in the short term. But the Treasury likes Rishi Sunak and he will want to show them he is leading and not a small cog doing what Downing Street tells him.\u201d Bell said it was possible to envisage more joint policymaking but only if the chancellor wanted it and Downing Street did what it had failed to do with Javid and showed Sunak some respect. The most important issue was not how the Treasury and Downing Street organised running of the economy, but the personal relationship between the prime minister and chancellor. \u201cRishi is in a strong position because they can\u2019t fire him. Dominic Cummings can\u2019t afford to fall out with another chancellor because Boris Johnson can\u2019t afford to get rid of him.\u201d Bell was a special adviser the last time there was serious tension between No 10 and the Treasury. Brown appointed Darling to succeed him as chancellor but then took the lead role in managing the financial crisis of 2007-09. Darling strongly resisted attempts to marginalise him and to force the Treasury\u2019s hand. A joint Cabinet Office-Treasury secretariat was set up to coordinate the bailout and part-nationalisation of the banks, and the international response to the crisis that culminated in the London meeting of the G20 in the spring of 2009. One person familiar with that period said Brown brought in a lot of expertise to Downing Street \u2013 such as the former banker Shriti Vadera \u2013 to give him independent advice. \u201cDuring the financial crisis Brown ran things from No 10 and the Treasury wasn\u2019t very happy,\u201d the source said. Brown was the longest-serving chancellor since the early 19th century and dominated domestic policy during his time at the Treasury, on issues such as introducing tax credits, opposing Britain\u2019s membership of the European single currency, and raising national insurance contributions to pay for extra NHS spending. But members of his team were surprised at quickly the Treasury moved on after he moved from 11 Downing Street to No 10. \u201cThe minute he left the Treasury was a vested interest in its own right again.

It may have ended five years ago, but he can\u2019t remember exactly</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>I knew they had stayed in touch, but he always assured me they were just friends. She is also in a second marriage </strong><strong>and we both have grown</strong><strong>up children. My husband and his ex never had children together. Several times she visited us. I did not like it, or want her to, but her feelings were always more important than mine. </strong><strong>He assured me again that they were \u201cjust friends\u201d</strong><strong>. I trusted this man with my life.</strong></p> <p><strong>He knew I thought he was faithful</strong><strong>: I was not suspicious</strong><strong>; </strong><strong>there were no hints. I could kick myself for being so stupid. </strong><strong>He also gave her money, many times</strong><strong>. Now</strong><strong> that he is caught, and </strong><strong>believes a lawyer has the pictures, he is distraught</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and begging me to work things out.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am devastated. We are nearing retirement</strong><strong>, have built a beautiful home, and had many plans. I cannot believe he </strong><strong>really ended his affair years ago. I feel </strong><strong>I still don\u2019t have the truth. </strong></p> <p><strong>Of course, if he convinced me for 20 years that they were just friends, I\u2019m sure he can convince me it was over years ago. Regardless, the betrayal is beyond anything I have ever</strong><strong> experienced. I don\u2019t know how I can stay and </strong><strong>stop obsessing over what he did. Thank you for any insight you can provide.</strong></p> <p>I think you did have hints. I think you felt uncomfortable when she visited \u2013 your instinct was telling you something wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019m telling you this so you can see that you weren\u2019t stupid, but trusted your husband when he \u201cassured you\u201d they were just friends, and so squashed those feelings. It\u2019s no crime to trust and believe what someone has told you. Most people go into a marriage thinking their partner is being faithful.

      "bodyText": "After 30 years of marriage, I accidentally came across pictures of my husband with his ex-wife, and after confronting him found out they had been having an affair that spanned well over a decade. It may have ended five years ago, but he can\u2019t remember exactly. I knew they had stayed in touch, but he always assured me they were just friends. She is also in a second marriage and we both have grownup children. My husband and his ex never had children together. Several times she visited us. I did not like it, or want her to, but her feelings were always more important than mine. He assured me again that they were \u201cjust friends\u201d. I trusted this man with my life. He knew I thought he was faithful: I was not suspicious; there were no hints. I could kick myself for being so stupid. He also gave her money, many times. Now that he is caught, and believes a lawyer has the pictures, he is distraught and begging me to work things out. I am devastated. We are nearing retirement, have built a beautiful home, and had many plans. I cannot believe he really ended his affair years ago. I feel I still don\u2019t have the truth. Of course, if he convinced me for 20 years that they were just friends, I\u2019m sure he can convince me it was over years ago. Regardless, the betrayal is beyond anything I have ever experienced. I don\u2019t know how I can stay and stop obsessing over what he did. Thank you for any insight you can provide. I think you did have hints. I think you felt uncomfortable when she visited \u2013 your instinct was telling you something wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019m telling you this so you can see that you weren\u2019t stupid, but trusted your husband when he \u201cassured you\u201d they were just friends, and so squashed those feelings. It\u2019s no crime to trust and believe what someone has told you. Most people go into a marriage thinking their partner is being faithful. Otherwise, why do it? You ask how you can stay and stop obsessing over what he did. My instinct is usually to be conciliatory and try to mend things, but here I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s the right thing to do.

They warn in a new report that Europe\u2019s largest member risks a \u201cstranded future\u201d, unless it can strengthen its economy and become more competitive.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the key points, kicking off on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/feb/14/german-economy-stagnates-growth-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-5e4643448f0811db2faf780f#block-5e4643448f0811db2faf780f\">today\u2019s growth figures</a>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Recession avoided in 2019, but no rebound on the cards for 2020</strong>. At +0.6%, about half the rate for the Eurozone as a whole, German GDP grew at the slowest pace since the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. We do not expect 2020 to bring much relief with GDP growth likely to slow marginally to a seasonally-adjusted +0.5%. Moreover the risk that Germany\u2019s \u201cgolden\u201d decade of uninterrupted economic growth \u2013 the longest period of expansion since reunification \u2013 will come to an end in 2020 remains on the table for now, given the cautious outlook for global trade and the automotive industry as well as lingering elevated political uncertainty over trade and Brexit.</li> <li><strong>The subdued outlook for the German economy provides a glimpse of a \u201cstranded\u201d future. </strong>Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse is struggling to keep up with structural change, putting it at risk of becoming a \u201cstranded economy\u201d with its long-standing competitive advantage in industry and in particular the car sector becoming obsolete. While the German economy remains highly innovative, it is increasingly struggling to leverage its potential, given the lack of even a basic digital infrastructure, a growing digital skills gap and inadequate start-up funding.</li> <li><strong>But a \u201clost\u201d decade for Germany is not a done deal, yet. </strong>What is needed is a significant long-term investment plan focused on upgrading infrastructure, updating the education system, boosting research &amp; development capabilities and creating a venture fund to co-invest in promising start-ups. But solely throwing money at the problem is not the solution. Instead the German economy\u2019s digital catch-up initiative needs to be accompanied by a \u201csimplification shock\u201c i.e. a notable reduction in red tape to allow for a better delivery of large-scale infrastructure projects, as well as to make life easier for corporates, particularly SMEs.</li> </ul> <p>More <a href=\"https://www.eulerhermes.com/en_global/economic-research/insights/is-germany-a-stranded-economy.html\">here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Economist_Kat/status/1228279359066210305\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/German?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#German</a> economy ended 2019 on a weak note &amp; 2020 is unlikely to provide much relief.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed down 0.6%, or 43 points, at 7,409. Europe did better, despite today\u2019s unimpressive growth report. The Stoxx 690 has finished the day flat (rather like Germany\u2019s GDP...). Have a lovely weekend. GW The eurozone will probably struggle to grow in the current quarter, reckons Greg Daco of Oxford Economics. He predicts that the mere 0.1% growth reported in October-December will be repeated in January-March, with coronavirus restrictions hurting the economy. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s the AFP newswire\u2019s take on today\u2019s German growth figures: Hopes pale for German growth rebound after late 2019 flatline Europe\u2019s largest economy Germany marked time in the fourth quarter of 2019 as its export-oriented industry\u2019s woes continued to weigh on growth, official data showed Friday. Gross domestic product (GDP) was flat quarter-on-quarter in October-December, federal statistics authority Destatis said, disappointing the agency\u2019s own expectations and those of analysts surveyed by Factset. The statisticians also revised their third quarter growth figures, saying that GDP had added 0.2% rather than 0.1%. Over the whole year, the annual growth rate of 0.6% was Germany\u2019s worst since 2013. The economy \u201cremains in a weak phase,\u201d the economy ministry in Berlin said, highlighting \u201cvery weak\u201d industrial production and incoming orders for manufacturing firms towards the end of the year. After a surge in 2017-18, Germany\u2019s export-oriented economy has been sapped since late 2018 by trade conflicts and other sources of uncertainty, including Brexit and slower growth in emerging economies. For some analysts, that meant simply avoiding a second quarter of shrinkage in 2019 after the contraction in April-June was worth celebrating. \u201cOverall economic stagnation in the fourth quarter is already a small success\u201d given that industrial output shrank strongly, said Dr. Fritzi Koehler-Geib, chief economist at KfW banking group. Industry continues to suffer, with production shrinking sharply in December, Destatis data showed. Meanwhile, \u201cprivate and state consumer spending lost significant momentum after a strong third quarter,\u201d the statisticians added. Supported by unemployment close to historic lows and gradually rising public spending, consumption had been an important buttress to economic activity in Germany compensating for ailing industry. Looking ahead into 2020, the rebound many observers were hoping for in the first half of the year will likely be pushed back by the effects of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. \u201cThe German economy\u2019s performance in the first quarter will largely depend on how the coronavirus affects the Chinese economy, and German exports to China,\u201d Commerzbank economist Joerg Kraemer said. Goods sold to China account for around three percent of German GDP, Oddo bank analysts noted. But there are challenges to Europe\u2019s powerhouse beyond the cyclical slowdown. \u201cThe manufacturing sector remains caught between cyclical weakness, on the back of the trade conflict and weaker global growth, and structural weakness, on the back of disruption in the automotive sector and too little investment,\u201d said ING bank economist Carsten Brzeski. In the coming months, the country has little to look forward to but \u201cstagnation, with a risk of a technical recession,\u201d he added. Fancy some afternoon reading? Here\u2019s a fascinating thread from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway about UK statistics, and how a mysterious gold transaction flattered Britain\u2019s trade data: The US stock market has opened gently, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 33 points or 0.1% at 29,456. That\u2019s despite a 0.1% drop in US factory output last month, as Boeing\u2019s 737 Max crisis hits. With stock markets at record highs, Universal Music wants to join the party with an IPO: Here\u2019s our story about Tesco illegally blocking its rivals from opening stores: Wall Street is expected to post fresh gains today, despite the uncertainty created by Covid-19. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: \u201cWith the coronavirus death total now reaching 1,000 and looking likely to go much higher, Asian shares have nevertheless followed yesterday\u2019s Wall Street rally as factories begin to re-open across China. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9%, with Shanghai blue chips gathering momentum by reaching 0.8%. The Japanese Nikkei market was closed due to a public holiday. In Europe, stocks are also higher the FTSE up 0.7%. Although markets are higher , investors will likely remain concerned about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. After 18-months of the trade dispute wreaking havoc on the markets and China, the coronavirus outbreak has been an additional source of concern, though markets are remarkably resilient for now.\u201d For days, investors have been fluctuating between panicking about the coronavirus, and persuading themselves that the crisis is abating. Today they\u2019re in a calm mood, pushing stocks in Europe up to new record highs. The Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.15% to a fresh peak, after China reported that some deaths have been \u2018double-counted\u2019. This has reassured traders, who hit the sell button yesterday after a big spike in cases. But new cases keep cropping up around the world, including a Channel 4 employee in London: Back in the UK, supermarket chain Tesco has been blasted by regulators for unlawfully blocking its rivals from opening stores. The Competition and Markets Authority has announced that Tesco has pledged to stop using covenants and exclusivity arrangements to prevent landlords letting sites to other supermarkets. A review has found 23 separate agreement of this type, which has been illegal since 2010. Andrea Gomes da Silva, Executive Director, Markets and Mergers at the CMA, says: It\u2019s unacceptable that Tesco had these unlawful restrictions in place for up to a decade. By making it harder for other supermarkets to open stores next to its branches, shoppers could have lost out. In the future, we want the ability to fine businesses if we find that they are in breach of our orders. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve called on the Government for more powers. The CMA is also asking other supermarkets to check whether they have used similar anti-competitive restrictions. Back in the debt crisis, some of Europe\u2019s smaller countries were the black sheep of the euro-flock. Today, these peripheral nations are driving growth, as France and Italy shrink and Germany stagnates. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, says the periphery are the euro area\u2019s bright spot: \u201cToday\u2019s country breakdown of Eurozone\u2019s GDP growth showed us that the bloc grew by 1.2% in 2019. This rate of expansion is comparable to that of the UK. The US economy, however, grew by 2.3% in 2019, which is around double the rate of the Eurozone and the UK\u201d The Eurozone performance can be mainly explained by the poor performance of Germany and Italy, which are its biggest and third largest economies respectively. Size matters when it comes to GDP growth rates - a one percentage point increase in the growth rate of Germany and Italy increases Eurozone GDP by 0.5 percentage points.\u201d \u201cHowever, the bright spot in the Eurozone continues to lie in the peripheral economies. With the exception of Greece, all of the bailout economies have surpassed pre-crisis output levels and continue to grow at strong rates. In fact, we estimate that the three bailout economies (Spain, Portugal and Cyprus) which reported Q4 2019 output estimates today, grew by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter compared to virtually no growth in the German, French, Italian and Dutch economies in GDP weighted terms (see Figure below).\u201d Germany\u2019s economy is unlikely to improve much this year, due to trade tensions, the shift away from petrol and diesel cars, and Brexit. So argues Ludovic Subran and Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, top economists at German insurance giant Allianz. They warn in a new report that Europe\u2019s largest member risks a \u201cstranded future\u201d, unless it can strengthen its economy and become more competitive. Here\u2019s the key points, kicking off on today\u2019s growth figures. Recession avoided in 2019, but no rebound on the cards for 2020. At +0.6%, about half the rate for the Eurozone as a whole, German GDP grew at the slowest pace since the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. We do not expect 2020 to bring much relief with GDP growth likely to slow marginally to a seasonally-adjusted +0.5%. Moreover the risk that Germany\u2019s \u201cgolden\u201d decade of uninterrupted economic growth \u2013 the longest period of expansion since reunification \u2013 will come to an end in 2020 remains on the table for now, given the cautious outlook for global trade and the automotive industry as well as lingering elevated political uncertainty over trade and Brexit. The subdued outlook for the German economy provides a glimpse of a \u201cstranded\u201d future. Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse is struggling to keep up with structural change, putting it at risk of becoming a \u201cstranded economy\u201d with its long-standing competitive advantage in industry and in particular the car sector becoming obsolete. While the German economy remains highly innovative, it is increasingly struggling to leverage its potential, given the lack of even a basic digital infrastructure, a growing digital skills gap and inadequate start-up funding. But a \u201clost\u201d decade for Germany is not a done deal, yet. What is needed is a significant long-term investment plan focused on upgrading infrastructure, updating the education system, boosting research &amp; development capabilities and creating a venture fund to co-invest in promising start-ups. But solely throwing money at the problem is not the solution. Instead the German economy\u2019s digital catch-up initiative needs to be accompanied by a \u201csimplification shock\u201c i.e. a notable reduction in red tape to allow for a better delivery of large-scale infrastructure projects, as well as to make life easier for corporates, particularly SMEs. More here. Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics has told clients: \u201cWe think the economy will continue to flirt with recession in the first half of this year.\u201d It\u2019s hard to put too much gloss on a stagnating economy, but the German government has tried to strike an optimistic-ish tone this morning. Berlin\u2019s economy ministry says Germany\u2019s economy is going through a weak phase, but it\u2019s encouraged that business sentiment has improved. But... the ministry also warns that the coronavirus outbreak means that the risks from overseas have increased, but it\u2019s hard to say what the impact will be. More encouragingly, employment growth across the eurozone has risen. The number of employed people rose by 0.3% in the euro area in the final quarter of 2019, and by 0.2% in the European Union. That\u2019s up from 0.1% in Q3. This jobs creation has pulled the unemployment rate down to its lowest level since the financial crisis, which is clearly welcome -- but it\u2019s disappointing that it\u2019s not leading to faster growth. At just 0.1%, the eurozone and the EU has both posted their weakest growth since early 2013 (when the debt crisis drove Europe into recession). Although countries in the periphery grew quite strongly in the last quarter of 2019, weakness at Europe\u2019s largest economies was to blame. Here\u2019s what we know (not all countries have reported GDP yet): Romania: +1.5% quarter-on-quarter in October-December Lithuania: +1.3% Hungary: +1.0% Cyprus: +0.8% Bulgaria: +0.7% Portugal: +0.6% Slovakia: +0.6% Spain: +0.5% Belgium: + 0.4% Netherlands: +0.4% Austria: +0.3% Denmark: +0.3% Czechia: +0.2% Latvia: +0.2% Poland: +0.2% Germany: no growth France: -0.1% Italy: -0.3% Finland: -0.4% And here\u2019s how some non-EU members performed China: +1.5% growth quarter-on-quarter US: + 0.5% UK: no growth Just in: The eurozone nearly stalled in the final quarter of 2019, dragged down by weakness in its three largest economies. Statistics body Eurostat reports that the euro area and the wider European Union only grew by 0.1% in October-December. That\u2019s down from 0.3% growth across Europe in July-September Germany stagnated (as we learned at 7am), while France and Italy contracted during the quarter. On an annual basis, the eurozone only grew by 1.2% in 2019 while the EU expanded by 1.4%. This matches Eurostat\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 GDP estimates from a couple of weeks ago, and confirms that Europe ended 2019 on a weak note. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets points out that Germany\u2019s economy has been basically flat for nine months: European stock markets are subdued today, following Germany\u2019s underwhelming growth figures. The Stoxx 600 index is flat, having dropped yesterday as traders fretted about a sharp leap in coronavirus cases. In London, the FTSE 100 is being pulled down by RBS (-6%); its weak outlook has also pushed Lloyds and Barclays down almost 1%. Over in the City, shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have slumped 6% as new chief executive Alison Rose outlines her strategy alongside its latest financial results RBS is being rebranded as NatWest, with Rose perhaps hoping to put the legacy of the bank\u2019s bailout firmly into history. She is also slashing the size of its investment bank and cutting its long-term profitability targets. But arguably the most important news is that RBS has laid out its climate emergency strategy. It plans to\u201dat least halve\u201d the climate impact of our financing activity by 2030, and will phase out all support for the coal industry by the end of the decade. It will also stop lending to energy firms from next year if they don\u2019t have a plan to help achieve the Paris Agreement goals. Rose concedes this will be tough: This will be a significant challenge as we, like others, do not yet fully understand what this will require and how it will be achieved, not least as there is currently no standard industry methodology or approach. Solving this will require UK and international industry, regulators and experts to come together and find solutions. We are determined to not just play our part, but to lead on the collaboration and co-operation that is so critical to influencing the transition to a low carbon economy. RBS also posted a 93% jump in profits for 2019. Investors, though, are disappointed that RBS didn\u2019t announce a larger special dividend today. They may also be concerned that the bank says it faces a \u201crange of significant risks and uncertainties\u201d from political, economic and regulatory angles. The euro has dropped to its lowest level in over two and a half years, after this morning\u2019s German GDP figures. The single currency has dipped to \u20ac1.0828, its weakest levels since May 2017, extending its recent losses. The risk of a full-blown recession is hanging over Germany, says economist Carsten Brzeski of ING. He fears that the Covid-19 outbreak will hurt Germany, although a pick-up in construction could cushion the blow. Having analysed today\u2019s GDP report, Brzeski writes: Looking ahead, the latest soft indicators and industrial data for December do not bode well for the short-term outlook. Also, the impact from the coronavirus on the Chinese economy is likely to delay any rebound in the manufacturing sector as it at least temporarily disrupts supply chains. However, despite these rather discouraging factors, there are several \u2013 partly technical \u2013 drivers which should soften any pessimism. The poor performance of the construction sector in the fourth quarter was mainly driven by the Christmas break. With mild winter weather, a rebound in the first quarter looks likely. Also, changes in the inventory cycle could support growth in the short run. Brzeski reckons that hopes of a strong rebound this year have been wiped out: Some weeks ago, we had started to investigate which form the recovery could take from the alphabet soup of options. Will it be a \u2018V\u2019 for a strong rebound, a \u2018U\u2019 for a longer bottom followed by a strong rebound, a \u2018J\u2019 for a longer period of stagnation followed by a weak rebound, an \u2018L\u2019 for a long period of stagnation or even a \u2018W\u2019 for a double dip recession? Today\u2019s data shows that the alphabet soup has been taken off the menu for the time being. Stagnation, with a risk of a technical recession, currently looks like the only dish served. Stagnation is bad, but there\u2019s some relief that Germany didn\u2019t do even worse. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics feared German GDP could actually have contracted in the last quarter, given recent weak data: Bloomberg\u2019s Fergal O\u2019Brien agrees: But currency analyst Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern is concerned about Germany\u2019s prospects this year, given the coronavirus outbreak will hurt its manufacturing base. 2019 was not a great year for Germany. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that the economy grew by 0.5% in January-March, only to shrink by 0.2% in April-June. Growth picked up by 0.2% in July-September, before fizzling out in the last quarter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s economy is flatlining, as a slowdown in spending and exports wipes out growth. Figures just released show that German GDP was unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2019. Economists had expected a rise of 0.1%, so this is disappointing (and matches the UK\u2019s own performance in Q4). On an annual basis, the German economy only grew by 0.6% during 2019, Destatis adds. That\u2019s a very weak result, as Europe\u2019s largest economy struggles to handle trade tensions, changes in the auto industry, and a slowing European economy. It\u2019s not all gloom -- growth in the third quarter has been revised up to 0.2%. But the general picture is weak: Destatis, Germany\u2019s statistics body, reports that household and government spending both slowed in the last quarter, while investment from companies was mixed. After a very strong third quarter, the final consumption expenditure of both households and government slowed down markedly. Trends diverged for fixed capital formation. While gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment was down considerably compared to the third quarter, fixed capital formation in construction and other fixed assets continued to increase. Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars also hurt Germany. Destatis reports that German exports were \u201cslightly down\u201d in the last quarter, while imports of goods and services increased. Later today we\u2019ll get an updated reading on eurozone GDP for the last quarter. Preliminary figures release last month showed that the region only grew by 0.1%, with France and Italy shrinking.

The Egyptian pro-government website Cairo24 quoted a police source as saying the \u201ctourist didn\u2019t follow the law, and made sexual gestures to one of the police officers who was keeping the public order\u201d. It added that this resulted in an argument inside the airport where others intervened to end the dispute. The officer in question then \u201cinsisted on getting his rights and implementing the law\u201d. Egyptian authorities say they are taking steps to eliminate harassment, including imposing a fine on those who pester tourists at attractions throughout the country. A United Nations study published in 2013 revealed that \u201c99.3% of Egyptian girls and women surveyed reported some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime\u201d. Egyptian prosecutors ordered that Camoccio be detained for four days pending an investigation. His family said his detention was then extended for a further 15 days, but he has not been charged. On the Facebook page supporting Camoccio, his family say \u201cthe police are very uncooperative and are withholding evidence that would clear Tony of any wrongdoing\u201d. Tourism has slowly returned to Egyptian resorts such as Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh after a four-year drop in numbers following the 2015 downing of a Russian passenger plane in South Sinai. An estimated 9 million tourists visited Egypt in 2018. A British tourist, Laura Plummer, was detained at Hurghada airport in 2017 and served 13 months in prison after a scan of her bag revealed she was carrying 290 tablets of the painkiller Tramadol, a controlled substance in Egypt. An Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are in contact with a British man who has been arrested in Egypt. Our staff are in touch with his family and the Egyptian authorities.\u201d Adham Youssef contributed to this report",

But as this year\u2019s Games in Tokyo approaches it is not the usual concerns \u2013 the potential for high temperatures or the logistics of putting on the world\u2019s biggest sporting event \u2013 that is the biggest problem for organisers. It is the coronavirus. On Friday, China reported 5,090 new cases and 121 new deaths in the previous 24 hours, Japan has also had its first death as the virus continues to spread. For now, however, the International Olympic Committee position is clear: there is absolutely no chance the Games, which are due to start in late July, will be postponed despite the growing global health emergency. But athletics was similarly upbeat before the World Indoor Championships, due to take place in Nanjing in March, was cancelled. And so was Formula One before the Shanghai Grand Prix was also shelved. The virus has also wiped out golf tournaments, matches, and almost all sports in China \u2013 including Olympic qualifying events. What is worrying medical experts is that with so many people packed into a small area there is a possibility for infectious diseases to spread. This month Toshiro Muto, the chief executive of the Tokyo organising committee, voiced some of those concerns by saying he was \u201cseriously worried\u201d the spread of coronavirus \u201ccould throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games\u201d. Muto later backed down and this week the organising committee\u2019s president Yoshiro Mori said he was clear that \u201cWe are not considering a cancellation or postponement of the Games\u201d.

They will also issue masks and hand sanitisers during race week. Meanwhile it remains unclear whether Chinese athletes due to compete in sporting events in Britain in the next month will take part. Public Health England confirmed there are currently no restrictions on Chinese players coming to the prestigious All-England Badminton Championships or the Gymnastics World Cup, both of which will be staged in Birmingham. However it is rumoured from within the sport that the Chinese badminton players will withdraw from all European tournaments this month, as well as from one in Germany the week before the All England event. The chief executive of Badminton England, Adrian Christy, said the advice the organiser has been given is to carry on preparations for the All England as planned. \u201cWe are monitoring the coronavirus very closely and are in touch with Public Health England several times a week \u2013 and they have been very helpful indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advice we have been given is to carry on our preparations for the All England as planned, and we are doing that. \u201cWe are also in regular touch with our international governing body who are monitoring this from a global perspective.\u201d Birmingham will also stage a World Cup gymnastics meeting next month and a spokesperson for GB Gymnastics insisted that \u201cas it stands it\u2019s business as usual. \u201cWe continue to plan for the Chinese delegations competing in Birmingham at the end of next month,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Recently I was interviewing someone for an article \u2013 a serious article about serious stuff \u2013 and I noticed they were distracted by something on the floor: my feet. Specifically, my socks: Lion King socks with Simba ear embellishments that were poking out above the shoe\u2019s tongue. This professional embarrassment is my mother\u2019s fault. She bought me the socks last year; I am merely an idiot who ran out of other pairs to wear. For the longest time, I was the youngest in my family and even though I no longer am, I remain frozen in that era. For example, as a teen I said in passing that I liked prawns, even though I\u2019ve often said since that I prefer other proteins. If we eat out, someone will invariably tap me on the wrist: \u201cOh you\u2019ll love this dish. It\u2019s got prawns.\u201d Back then, I also read a lot of harrowing books, though I shirk the morbid now. Whenever there is something sombre on TV, someone will say, \u201cI bet Coco will like this emo stuff\u201d to which I also scream, \u201cI am not emo!\u201d and lose my argument. For years I\u2019ve daydreamed about moving to mainland Europe. \u201cYou\u2019re too young,\u201d Mum will say, or if she\u2019s in the mood for some Asian drama: \u201cYou want to leave your own mother? Here is a knife, just kill me yourself.\u201d And although I point out that she was just 18 when she left home for Britain, and I am 31, she will say that I am her baby and must stay at her side for ever. It will never change. I will be trying to celebrate my 50th with a sophisticated soiree, and my family will roll through with a cake shaped like a prawn and someone dressed like Pumbaa. Maybe I should stop fighting it. These are, at least, very comfortable socks.",

      "body": "<p>It was our 10-year wedding anniversary last week, and my wife and I decided to head to a hotel with the kids. This alone was a source of controversy among friends (and by friends, I mean my wife\u2019s, as I obviously don\u2019t discuss weekends away with my mates for fear of being called a boring bastard). Apparently, if you want to enjoy a romantic weekend away, there is absolutely no way you should take your children.</p> <p>My wife and I always choose to go away with our children. When we got married, we couldn\u2019t afford a long honeymoon, so we had a night away at a hotel. Our eldest son was just under one, and we didn\u2019t want to be away from him, so we had him in a cot with us. I suspected that the appeal of this might wane as he got older and we had more kids. Obviously, when you have your first kid, it\u2019s all one-to-one time and taking endless photos. By the time you have the third, you are happy to leave them in a cupboard for a week with a family-size box of cereal.</p> <p>For me, though, it\u2019s all about how often I am away for work: I already see the kids far less than I would like, so the idea of leaving them behind is unthinkable. Just this morning, as I was supposed to be finishing this column, my son said he had thought I was walking them to school, and looked a bit upset. So I stopped working and took them to school, only for him to not talk to me or say goodbye. Which means I\u2019m now finishing this column on the train.</p> <p>As for my wife, it might be that she doesn\u2019t trust anyone else to look after the kids. A few years ago, we left them with my mum to go on a date. We arrived back at hers slightly later than planned, at about 1am, to find them eating sandwiches, because apparently they were hungry. I was left to explain to my mum that either they were hungry at 1am for the first time since breastfeeding, or she may have been reading the signals wrong.</p> <p>For our anniversary weekend, we decided to splash out on something extra nice, and the hotel took care to make things enticing for the children. Unfortunately, this had the effect of the boys being extremely excited about where we were staying, and waking us up at 5am every day. We spent our days feeling knackered and, in the case of one of us, pretty grumpy. One of the kids also asked the waiter at the posh hotel restaurant if he could have a cheese sandwich instead of the dinner options. The waiter kindly sorted it out, over our incessant chants of, \u201cWe\u2019re so sorry for putting you to this trouble.\u201d Despite all this, I would still much rather have had the children there, than not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/24/romesh-ranganathan-i-need-a-guilt-free-get-out-of-socialising-card\">Romesh Ranganathan: I need a guilt-free get-out-of socialising card</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This may read as very smug. But the weekend did make me suspect that it might be a damning indictment of our relationship rather than something to brag about. We had one dinner alone and challenged ourselves not to talk about the kids or logistical stuff for the entire evening. After five minutes of discussing films, and remembering that we have zero common ground there, we became elective mutes. Maybe we need to bring the kids with us, just so we\u2019re not faced with the realisation that they\u2019re the only thing keeping us together.</p> <p>I\u2019m being melodramatic, of course. Even so, I have just booked another weekend away, this time for the two of us. When my wife asks me what inspired it, I will have to think of another reason apart from: \u201cI just want to see if this marriage works.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was our 10-year wedding anniversary last week, and my wife and I decided to head to a hotel with the kids. This alone was a source of controversy among friends (and by friends, I mean my wife\u2019s, as I obviously don\u2019t discuss weekends away with my mates for fear of being called a boring bastard). Apparently, if you want to enjoy a romantic weekend away, there is absolutely no way you should take your children. My wife and I always choose to go away with our children. When we got married, we couldn\u2019t afford a long honeymoon, so we had a night away at a hotel. Our eldest son was just under one, and we didn\u2019t want to be away from him, so we had him in a cot with us. I suspected that the appeal of this might wane as he got older and we had more kids. Obviously, when you have your first kid, it\u2019s all one-to-one time and taking endless photos. By the time you have the third, you are happy to leave them in a cupboard for a week with a family-size box of cereal. For me, though, it\u2019s all about how often I am away for work: I already see the kids far less than I would like, so the idea of leaving them behind is unthinkable. Just this morning, as I was supposed to be finishing this column, my son said he had thought I was walking them to school, and looked a bit upset. So I stopped working and took them to school, only for him to not talk to me or say goodbye. Which means I\u2019m now finishing this column on the train. As for my wife, it might be that she doesn\u2019t trust anyone else to look after the kids. A few years ago, we left them with my mum to go on a date. We arrived back at hers slightly later than planned, at about 1am, to find them eating sandwiches, because apparently they were hungry. I was left to explain to my mum that either they were hungry at 1am for the first time since breastfeeding, or she may have been reading the signals wrong. For our anniversary weekend, we decided to splash out on something extra nice, and the hotel took care to make things enticing for the children. Unfortunately, this had the effect of the boys being extremely excited about where we were staying, and waking us up at 5am every day. We spent our days feeling knackered and, in the case of one of us, pretty grumpy. One of the kids also asked the waiter at the posh hotel restaurant if he could have a cheese sandwich instead of the dinner options. The waiter kindly sorted it out, over our incessant chants of, \u201cWe\u2019re so sorry for putting you to this trouble.\u201d Despite all this, I would still much rather have had the children there, than not. This may read as very smug. But the weekend did make me suspect that it might be a damning indictment of our relationship rather than something to brag about. We had one dinner alone and challenged ourselves not to talk about the kids or logistical stuff for the entire evening. After five minutes of discussing films, and remembering that we have zero common ground there, we became elective mutes. Maybe we need to bring the kids with us, just so we\u2019re not faced with the realisation that they\u2019re the only thing keeping us together. I\u2019m being melodramatic, of course. Even so, I have just booked another weekend away, this time for the two of us. When my wife asks me what inspired it, I will have to think of another reason apart from: \u201cI just want to see if this marriage works.\u201d",

She said the three-month leadership election was a \u201clong campaign\u201d but she believed she still had the support of the wider membership.

She said her plan to rebuild Labour should be based on aspirational socialism, empowering members, a democratic revolution that boosted trade union membership and scrapped the House of Lords, and her own flagship policy, the green industrial revolution. She thanked Corbyn, McDonnell and Diane Abbott for doing \u201ctheir bit\u201d but said it was now right for a new generation to take the movement forward and she was ready to take up the mantle of socialist leadership. She said she wanted to see party and trade union membership grow to 1 million members and explained how she saw this translating to eventual power in Westminster. She said: \u201cImagine we could have a member right now, who\u2019s part of an anti-fracking campaign, in a town like Blackpool, which now has two Tory MPs. We could provide her with political education and encourage her to join a union. \u201cAt work, she\u2019ll help get her co-workers involved in the union and build up trust with them by standing up to a bullying manager. She\u2019ll also talk about fracking and our green industrial revolution in her union branch and about the Labour movement to her fellow climate activists. \u201cCome the next election, she\u2019ll have helped win her co-workers and anti-fracking communities over to Labour.\u201d She warned the party against \u201cfalling into a trap\u201d of looking like the establishment, saying it should be bold about the democratic shake-up. \u201cWe have a government that wants to put us into a box. They want us to be viewed as the establishment and they are laying a trap for us. \u201cThey would love nothing more for us than to go down the route of shiny-suit-wearing, not-rocking-the-boat-too-much, not setting out a transformative vision and trying to scale back our ambition. Now is not the time to retreat from our ambition.\u201d She also took aim at the media in a bid to shake up what she described as a \u201cTory power base\u201d and said she would set up a new creative digital programme to create viral social media content. Just days ago, the deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon, who also has the backing of McDonnell, suggested the party should print a free Labour newspaper to bypass traditional media. \u201cI\u2019ll set up a dedicated creative digital communications unit in the party, producing viral content that can both get around media hostility and speak directly to voters,\u201d she said. Her leadership rivals came in for criticism. She described the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, as having experience but no plan to win an election. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy was described as having a solid analysis of what went wrong but not the answers. Starmer, she said, was rigorous and detailed at the dispatch box, but she said the party had not won the election because of Brexit and because \u201cwe looked like just another bunch of politicians in Westminster\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Pretty much every actor in Parasite puts in a note-perfect performance, but as the film unfolds there\u2019s no doubting the star of the show. The house where the bulk of the action takes place \u2013 a gloriously opulent modernist building, shot to ensure no gleaming surface or painstaking furniture arrangement goes unnoticed \u2013 is truly a thing of wonder. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s big-screen creations to date include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/10/worldcinema.horror\">amphibious man-eating mutants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/19/okja-review-netflix-tilda-swinton-giant-korean-pig-cannes-2017\">genetically modified superpigs</a>, but this pad might just top the lot.</p> <p>Within the film, this is the home of the well-to-do Park family and brainchild of a hotshot celebrity architect; in real life, it\u2019s the result of four carefully crafted sets and lots of clever editing. The upshot is the appearance of a luxurious labyrinth of burnished wood and crystal-clear glass, all towering tastefully over the best-kept lawn this side of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jul/08/desperate-housewives-series-six\">Wisteria Lane</a>. Bong\u2019s film imparts many vital lessons, and chief among them is that there are few things in life more pleasing than a perfectly positioned coffee table.</p> <p>But like his flesh-and-blood monsters, this invention contains its fair share of menace too. As our downtrodden heroes find themselves drawn to the house, first fawning over it and then getting to work covertly moving in, Parasite sets itself within a small but distinct band of movies in which the setting is paramount and a place of ostensible domestic bliss becomes twisted into something else altogether.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12ee2b733732939135737ef35ca5dac0eda5abe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12ee2b733732939135737ef35ca5dac0eda5abe5/0_39_1435_861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twisted domestic bliss \u2026 Hereditary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twisted domestic bliss \u2026 Hereditary</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These films can belong to various genres, though the most common is horror. The Bates Motel, Cuesta Verde and Hill House have all entered movie lore for the scares hidden within, part of a grand tradition that has passed from<strong> </strong>Repulsion to Hereditary via Amityville. While Parasite isn\u2019t exactly a horror film, what it does share with these movies \u2013 and their spiritual sibling, the home-invasion thriller \u2013 is a slow-burn first act that doubles as a private tour of the grounds, showing us all the quirks and intricacies that will inevitably come into play later. Not so much Chekhov\u2019s gun as Chekhov\u2019s laundry chute, Chekhov\u2019s rickety treehouse or Chekhov\u2019s remotely operated patio door.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-korea-seems-glamorous-but-the-young-are-in-despair\">Parasite director Bong Joon-ho: 'Korea seems glamorous, but the young are in despair'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A scream is never far from a laugh, and while the likes of Panic Room, Don\u2019t Breathe and Hush mine their locations for the former, Home Alone outstrips them all by employing the same premise for slapstick. Despite its marketing as an adults-only nailbiter, Parasite probably has as much in common with the hide-and-seek mischief of Kevin McCallister, not least because the film only really catches fire when the household\u2019s underlings manage to rid the place of its ruling class.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06030915e4b4688d89d46760625bcc9bc7b2e056\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06030915e4b4688d89d46760625bcc9bc7b2e056/109_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kims\u2019 basement apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An oppressive mess \u2026 the Kims\u2019 basement apartment</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Film company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That C-word, though, was never something Home Alone paid much thought to, whereas class is Parasite\u2019s entire reason for being, peering out from the film\u2019s every nook and cranny. The angular perfection of the Parks\u2019 house is more than just a pretty space \u2013 it\u2019s a reminder that this family occupy a different world to that of the Kims, whose grubby basement flat is an oppressive mess of chipped tiling and loose-hanging wires.

      "bodyText": "Pretty much every actor in Parasite puts in a note-perfect performance, but as the film unfolds there\u2019s no doubting the star of the show. The house where the bulk of the action takes place \u2013 a gloriously opulent modernist building, shot to ensure no gleaming surface or painstaking furniture arrangement goes unnoticed \u2013 is truly a thing of wonder. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s big-screen creations to date include amphibious man-eating mutants and genetically modified superpigs, but this pad might just top the lot. Within the film, this is the home of the well-to-do Park family and brainchild of a hotshot celebrity architect; in real life, it\u2019s the result of four carefully crafted sets and lots of clever editing. The upshot is the appearance of a luxurious labyrinth of burnished wood and crystal-clear glass, all towering tastefully over the best-kept lawn this side of Wisteria Lane. Bong\u2019s film imparts many vital lessons, and chief among them is that there are few things in life more pleasing than a perfectly positioned coffee table. But like his flesh-and-blood monsters, this invention contains its fair share of menace too. As our downtrodden heroes find themselves drawn to the house, first fawning over it and then getting to work covertly moving in, Parasite sets itself within a small but distinct band of movies in which the setting is paramount and a place of ostensible domestic bliss becomes twisted into something else altogether. These films can belong to various genres, though the most common is horror. The Bates Motel, Cuesta Verde and Hill House have all entered movie lore for the scares hidden within, part of a grand tradition that has passed from Repulsion to Hereditary via Amityville. While Parasite isn\u2019t exactly a horror film, what it does share with these movies \u2013 and their spiritual sibling, the home-invasion thriller \u2013 is a slow-burn first act that doubles as a private tour of the grounds, showing us all the quirks and intricacies that will inevitably come into play later. Not so much Chekhov\u2019s gun as Chekhov\u2019s laundry chute, Chekhov\u2019s rickety treehouse or Chekhov\u2019s remotely operated patio door. A scream is never far from a laugh, and while the likes of Panic Room, Don\u2019t Breathe and Hush mine their locations for the former, Home Alone outstrips them all by employing the same premise for slapstick. Despite its marketing as an adults-only nailbiter, Parasite probably has as much in common with the hide-and-seek mischief of Kevin McCallister, not least because the film only really catches fire when the household\u2019s underlings manage to rid the place of its ruling class. That C-word, though, was never something Home Alone paid much thought to, whereas class is Parasite\u2019s entire reason for being, peering out from the film\u2019s every nook and cranny. The angular perfection of the Parks\u2019 house is more than just a pretty space \u2013 it\u2019s a reminder that this family occupy a different world to that of the Kims, whose grubby basement flat is an oppressive mess of chipped tiling and loose-hanging wires. In this regard, Parasite plants its foot firmly on the neatly manicured turf of a third type of house-movie: the one in which a plush bourgeois home conceals bottomless depths of misery. The idea that picket-fenced paradise is actually playing host to the slow death of the American dream has long given rise to earnest Hollywood fare, from Ordinary People to American Beauty to Revolutionary Road (the clue\u2019s often in the artfully ironic title). Parasite, which prefers acid satire to heartfelt drama, has its truer kindred spirits in The Stepford Wives or Blue Velvet. These films\u2019 hedgerowed havens might have been intended as quintessential Americana, but Bong shows that the depravity of suburban affluence is hardly exclusive to the land of the free. Oddly for a film set in present-day South Korea, Parasite also has plenty in common with a very specific strain of British period drama, where a bitter and unspoken class divide plays out within a grand stately home. Gosford Park, Downton Abbey and The Remains of the Day are all touchstones here, using a lavish domestic backdrop to drive home the poisonous master-minion relationships therein. And if you\u2019re especially clever, your house can itself serve as a handy visual metaphor for the very themes it\u2019s picking at: Bong has cited his admiration for Joseph Losey\u2019s The Servant, a po-faced study of repressed envy in which characters are kept apart by a staircase. The genius of Parasite is that it takes that idea to a whole new level, but also that it manages to drop in on so many genres along the way: broad comedy, queasy slasher, class-war psychodrama.

The UK\u2019s largest water supplier gave \u201ccareful consideration\u201d to joining the industry\u2019s first rebellion against Ofwat, in which three major water utilities plan to challenge the regulator. Anglian Water and Northumbrian Water have followed the lead of Yorkshire Water, which earlier this week became the first major water utility to call for the competition watchdog to intervene in the spat over profits. The Thames Water board met to discuss whether to refer their own price regulation to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) before deciding that the process could lead to \u201csignificant management distraction\u201d while it works to improve its service. Thames has weathered multiple run-ins with the regulator in recent years over its poor record on tackling leaks and pollution. In the past the utility was accused of profiteering from its customers by paying out rich dividends to investors and virtually no tax. \u201cIt was deemed to be in the best interests of both customers and employees to accept the final determination, to ensure certainty in the months and years ahead, and to move forward positively and constructively,\u201d the company said. Ofwat sets the price controls every five years to decide how much money people should pay for their water and the level of service they should receive. This also determines how much profit utilities can make for their investors and shareholders. The dissenting firms claim Ofwat\u2019s price review could damage long-term investment in the sector by forcing companies to observe tougher industry targets while cutting spending and water bills. The plans could also lead to underinvestment in the UK\u2019s water system, which would pose a risk to customers and the environment, the companies have said. The CMA said it expects to take six months to rule on whether the price controls were fair but the inquiry could take longer. Kip Meek, the chair of the inquiry, said: \u201cEveryone needs water, so it\u2019s really important that customers\u2019 bills are not set too high, but at the same time the water companies have enough money to deliver an efficient and high-quality service.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The broadcaster\u2019s member of staff is understood to have been on holiday in China in the last month and felt unwell.

However, the existing RBS bank branches \u2013 most of which are in Scotland \u2013 will keep their name, as will Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The chief executive, Alison Rose, who took over in November, described her strategy as the \u201cstart of a new era\u201d. The bank\u2019s reputation was shattered after its near collapse in 2008, when the government was forced to shell out \u00a345bn to save the bank, which is still 62% taxpayer-owned.</p> <p>Since then the RBS brand has been sullied by claims that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/rbs-settles-us-department-of-justice-investigation-with-49bn-fine\">mis-sold toxic mortgage-backed securities</a> in the lead-up to the global credit crunch and that it<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/20/mps-publish-full-unredacted-report-into-rbs-small-business-scandal\"> pushed small businesses towards failure</a> in order to sell their assets for profit.</p> <p>Despite ditching the Scottish name, the chairman, Howard Davies, said the bank\u2019s headquarters would remain in Edinburgh. \u201cWe\u2019re not unscrewing any brass plaques at this point,\u201d he said. However, Rose, the first woman to run one of the \u201cbig four\u201d lenders, will be based in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6243dac74016c970b6af965099699c257e233436\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6243dac74016c970b6af965099699c257e233436/21_146_3467_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The existing RBS branches \u2013 most of which are in Scotland \u2013 will keep their name, as will Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The existing RBS bank branches \u2013 most of which are in Scotland \u2013 will keep their name, as will Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The strategy was revealed as the bank released its full-year earnings, which showed that 2019 pre-tax profits surged by 93% to \u00a33.1bn from \u00a31.6bn a year earlier. Its results were boosted by its disposal of a stake in the Middle Eastern bank Alawwal last year.</p> <p>This is the third consecutive year of profit for RBS since its bailout in 2008. Shareholders will pocket another \u00a3968m in dividends as a result of the bank\u2019s strong performance, \u00a3600m of which will go to the government coffers.</p> <p>Rose was widely expected to reveal job losses on Friday but refused to disclose how many colleagues or bank branches would be axed as part of plans to cut costs by \u00a3250m this year.</p> <p>Its NatWest Markets investment bank has been singled out for a \u201csignificant transformation\u201d, with plans to exit parts of the business and cut its basket of risky assets in half. Rose said it was part of efforts to build a \u201csmaller and simpler bank\u201d.</p> <p>As part of the strategy, Rose announced that RBS will also stop lending and offering underwriting services to major oil and gas producers that do not have credible transition plans in line with Paris climate agreement targets, which aim to limit global heating to below 2C.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The group is threatening similar moves against companies with more than 15% of their activities related to coal unless they have similar plans prepared. RBS also pledged to fully phase out coal financing by 2030 and is aiming to \u201cat least halve\u201d the climate impact of its lending activity by the end of the decade.</p> <p>The value of loans to oil, gas and coal companies is relatively small compared to its peers, worth about \u00a36bn. At its rival Barclays, lending and underwriting to carbon-intensive companies and projects totalled $85bn (\u00a364bn) between 2015 and 2018, according to a study commissioned by campaign groups including Rainforest Action Network. </p> <p>However, Rose said it was a step in the right direction: \u201cOn our balance sheet, only 1% of our lending is to the oil and gas sector, and in coal it\u2019s marginal, down at 0.3%. But, for me, the key message here is we\u2019re all going to need to work together; no one organisation is going to solve the climate challenge on their own and we\u2019re very keen to work with business, with regulators, with industry to help make the plans to transition over the next 10 years.\u201d</p>",

The chief executive, Alison Rose, who took over in November, described her strategy as the \u201cstart of a new era\u201d. The bank\u2019s reputation was shattered after its near collapse in 2008, when the government was forced to shell out \u00a345bn to save the bank, which is still 62% taxpayer-owned. Since then the RBS brand has been sullied by claims that it mis-sold toxic mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the global credit crunch and that it pushed small businesses towards failure in order to sell their assets for profit. Despite ditching the Scottish name, the chairman, Howard Davies, said the bank\u2019s headquarters would remain in Edinburgh. \u201cWe\u2019re not unscrewing any brass plaques at this point,\u201d he said. However, Rose, the first woman to run one of the \u201cbig four\u201d lenders, will be based in London. The strategy was revealed as the bank released its full-year earnings, which showed that 2019 pre-tax profits surged by 93% to \u00a33.1bn from \u00a31.6bn a year earlier. Its results were boosted by its disposal of a stake in the Middle Eastern bank Alawwal last year. This is the third consecutive year of profit for RBS since its bailout in 2008. Shareholders will pocket another \u00a3968m in dividends as a result of the bank\u2019s strong performance, \u00a3600m of which will go to the government coffers. Rose was widely expected to reveal job losses on Friday but refused to disclose how many colleagues or bank branches would be axed as part of plans to cut costs by \u00a3250m this year. Its NatWest Markets investment bank has been singled out for a \u201csignificant transformation\u201d, with plans to exit parts of the business and cut its basket of risky assets in half. Rose said it was part of efforts to build a \u201csmaller and simpler bank\u201d. As part of the strategy, Rose announced that RBS will also stop lending and offering underwriting services to major oil and gas producers that do not have credible transition plans in line with Paris climate agreement targets, which aim to limit global heating to below 2C. The group is threatening similar moves against companies with more than 15% of their activities related to coal unless they have similar plans prepared. RBS also pledged to fully phase out coal financing by 2030 and is aiming to \u201cat least halve\u201d the climate impact of its lending activity by the end of the decade. The value of loans to oil, gas and coal companies is relatively small compared to its peers, worth about \u00a36bn. At its rival Barclays, lending and underwriting to carbon-intensive companies and projects totalled $85bn (\u00a364bn) between 2015 and 2018, according to a study commissioned by campaign groups including Rainforest Action Network. However, Rose said it was a step in the right direction: \u201cOn our balance sheet, only 1% of our lending is to the oil and gas sector, and in coal it\u2019s marginal, down at 0.3%. But, for me, the key message here is we\u2019re all going to need to work together; no one organisation is going to solve the climate challenge on their own and we\u2019re very keen to work with business, with regulators, with industry to help make the plans to transition over the next 10 years.\u201d",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

No rights to assets in the husband\u2019s sole name, and no rights to maintenance.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal court had \u201cupheld the existing concepts of what constitutes a lawful marriage \u2026 The law in these cases is not keeping up with society.

      "bodyText": "Islamic faith marriages are not valid under English law, the court of appeal has ruled, in a blow to thousands of Muslim women who have no rights when it comes to divorce. The judgment, delivered on Friday, overturned an earlier high court ruling that an Islamic marriage, known as a nikah, fell within the scope of English matrimonial law. The appeal court has confirmed that nikah marriages are legally \u201cnon-marriages\u201d, meaning spouses have no redress to the courts for a division of matrimonial assets such as the family home and spouse\u2019s pension if a marriage breaks down. Many couples who undergo nikah ceremonies believe they are lawfully married. But their marriages are only legal if they additionally go through a civil ceremony. A survey in 2017 found nearly all married Muslim women in the UK had had a nikah and almost two-thirds had not had a separate civil ceremony. Responding to the appeal court judgment, Charles Hale QC, of the family law firm 4PB, said: \u201cThis means that many have absolutely no rights at the end of what they believe to be their \u2018marriage\u2019. No rights to assets in the husband\u2019s sole name, and no rights to maintenance.\u201d The appeal court had \u201cupheld the existing concepts of what constitutes a lawful marriage \u2026 The law in these cases is not keeping up with society. These vulnerable women need better protection than the law currently provides.\u201d The 2018 high court case concerned a couple, Nasreen Akhter and Mohammed Shabaz Khan, who had undergone a nikah marriage conducted by an imam in front of 150 guests at a restaurant in Southall, west London, in 1998. The relationship had broken down, and Akhter petitioned for divorce. But Khan blocked the move, arguing the couple were not married under English law, only under sharia or Islamic law. Akhter said she had seen Khan as her husband, and he had \u201calways introduced me as his wife\u201d. The high court heard the couple had intended to follow their nikah ceremony with a civil ceremony, but that Khan refused to go through with a legal process despite frequent efforts by Akhter to persuade him. Mr Justice Williams, who heard the case in the family division of the high court in London, concluded the marriage fell within the scope of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Under the law, there are three categories of marriage: valid, void and non-marriage. Valid marriages may be ended by a decree of divorce; void marriages may be ended by a decree of nullity; non-marriages cannot be legally ended because legally the marriage never existed. The high court ruled the Akhter-Khan marriage had been \u201centered into in disregard of certain requirements as to the formation of marriage. It is therefore a void marriage and the wife is entitled to a decree of nullity\u201d. An appeal against the high court ruling was brought by the attorney general. Three family judges sitting in the court of appeal concluded that to uphold the high court\u2019s ruling \u201cwould gravely diminish the value of the system of registration of marriages upon which so much depends in a modern community\u201d. It added: \u201cIt is not difficult for parties who want to be legally married to achieve that status.\u201d The state did not have a human rights obligation to recognise religious marriage, the judgment said. Daniel Jones, of the law firm BLM, said the appeal court judgment was \u201ca real blow for all concerned\u201d. He added: \u201cThe decision \u2026 will leave Muslim women in the UK in legal limbo, compelled to turn to sharia councils to pursue Islamic divorce. This often involves lengthy delays and does not afford women the same financial protections as would be granted if their ceremonies were recognised as a marriage under English law. \u201cThis matter is of fundamental importance to Muslim women across the UK \u2026 leaving many women at great financial risk in unhappy relationships.\u201d Anna-Laura Lock, a senior associate at the law firm Winckworth Sherwood, said: \u201cGiven the current law on marriage leaves parties to a religious ceremony so exposed financially following relationship breakdown, this will not be the end of the road for this issue. A change in the law is long overdue and must surely be on the horizon.\u201d The law on marriage was \u201cno longer fit for purpose in a modern, multicultural and less religious society\u201d, she added. Pragna Patel of Southall Black Sisters, an organisation that has campaigned on the issue of nikah marriages, said: \u201cToday\u2019s judgment will force Muslim and other women to turn to sharia \u2018courts\u2019, which already cause significant harm to women and children, for remedies because they are now locked out of the civil justice system. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the outsourcing of justice on family matters to unaccountable and fundamentalist-inspired community-based systems of religious arbitration. This is not about recognising religious marriages; it is about the state guaranteeing equality to all before the law.\u201d In 2018, an independent review of sharia councils recommended that Muslim couples should undergo a civil marriage as well as a religious ceremony to give women protection under the law. The review, instigated by Theresa May in 2016 when she was home secretary, found that a significant number of Muslim couples did not register their marriages under civil law, and \u201csome Muslim women have no option of obtaining a civil divorce\u201d. Raghad Altikriti, president of the Muslim Association of Britain, said many Islamic centres in the UK had made civil registration a condition of nikah marriage. The appeal court ruling provided an \u201copportunity to continue the discussion to ensure that everyone\u2019s rights are protected by facilitating a comprehensive system that incorporates the needs of all\u201d, she added.",

      "body": "<p>Joseph Shabalala, who has died aged 78, was the founder, leader and musical director of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the most popular vocal group Africa has ever produced. They may be an a cappella choir who started out singing traditional songs in Zulu, but under Shabalala\u2019s direction they created a distinctive and often thrilling harmony style that became massively popular in South Africa in the 1970s, and then a global phenomenon in the 80s after they collaborated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paul-simon\" title=\"\">Paul Simon</a> on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/paul-simon-graceland-acclaim-outrage\" title=\"\">Graceland project</a>.</p> <p>They went on to win five Grammy awards (and were nominated for 17 others), release more than 50 albums, and perform before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/nelson-mandela-obituary\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela</a> and the Queen. Celebrated for their live performances, which involve dance as well as unaccompanied vocals, Ladysmith often spend over six months a year touring outside South Africa \u2013 a workload that did not alter even when Shabalala stepped down from performing in 2014. The current lineup includes four of his sons.</p> <p>He was born and brought up on a farm near the town of Ladysmith, out in the hills of KwaZulu-Natal. His parents, Jonathan and Nomandla, worked there and so did Joseph \u2013 the eldest of their eight children \u2013 after he was forced to leave school at the age of 12, because his father had died. He was joined on the farm by his second cousin Albert Mazibuko, who is still a member of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Albert described their early life to me in 2010, \u201clooking after cattle, then goats and sheep and singing farm songs for calling the animals\u201d. He looked up to Joseph \u201cbecause he was a great singer and an expert in stick fighting [a ferocious traditional South African sport] and because he was very popular with the ladies \u2026 every boy wanted to be like him\u201d.</p> <p>While still a teenager, Shabalala moved to Durban, where he worked in a factory and sang in vocal groups, the Durban Choir and the Highlanders. In 1959 he formed Ezimnyama, which would be renamed Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Ladysmith was of course their home town, while Black referred to black oxen, \u201cthe strongest animals on the farm\u201d, and Mambazo, said Albert, was \u201cthe Zulu word for axe \u2026 a warning they could chop down any competition\u201d.</p> <p>The group were competitive from the start, taking part in singing contests (an important part of South Africa\u2019s musical tradition) but at first concentrating only on folk songs, rather than Shabalala\u2019s own compositions, because he feared their rivals might steal them. Under his guidance they developed their unique style, switching suddenly and dramatically from stirring, intense and bass-heavy vocal work to quiet, delicate and almost whispered passages \u2013 matched with equally unexpected dance moves. In 1970 they began singing on radio programmes, and after being signed to Gallo Records in Johannesburg released their first album, Amabutho, in 1973. It was a big hit in South Africa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/11/joseph-shabalala-ladysmith-black-mambazo-founder-dies-aged-78\">Joseph Shabalala, Ladysmith Black Mambazo founder, dies aged 78</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By now they were performing Shabalala\u2019s songs, as well as traditional material, at contests, but they won so frequently that they were banned in order to give others a chance.

A four-year-old boy suffered burns in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute, after picking up a device containing phosphorus. The episode led to the last major survey of the maritime site, with dredging for the gas pipeline thought to have been the cause.</p> <p>Beaufort\u2019s Dyke is about 31 miles (50km) long and up to 300 metres (1,000ft) deep, and lies directly on the most direct route for a link between Portpatrick in Scotland and Larne in Northern Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/bridge-zip/giv-3902YOlQIqEjM2R8/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/bridge-zip/giv-3902YOlQIqEjM2R8/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/02/14/Beaufort_28_March_1995.jpg\">British ships sailed out from Cairnryan</a> in western Scotland to dump weapons in Beaufort\u2019s Dyke from the 1920s to the 1970s, including Allied and German munitions after the second world war. Sometimes the vessels did not reach the dyke, the bombs dumped overboard into shallower waters instead. Detailed records were often destroyed at the time. In 1997 it was acknowledged that <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1997-07-08/debates/c35048d3-0299-4d6a-aa4e-8a53ec46ed0f/BeaufortSDyke\">radioactive waste had also been dumped in steel drums</a> there in the 1950s after what the then Scotland secretary, Donald Dewar, said was \u201ca discovery of old papers in the Public Records Office\u201d.</p> <p>Deidre Brock, a Scottish National party MP, said she wanted the Ministry of Defence to conduct an \u201ceco-audit\u201d of what was in Beaufort\u2019s Dyke. \u201cI asked how the MoD monitors this ticking timebomb but it turns out no one monitors it and nobody knows what condition it\u2019s in. No one knows what\u2019s down there and no one looks at it. How could anyone think it was sensible to build a bridge over all that?\u201d she said.</p> <p>The MoD acknowledged that it had a broad \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d for the site, because it dumped the munitions there in the first place, but believes that the site is safe because there is no impact on the seabed, a point generally reinforced by experts and the last survey conducted in the mid-1990s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/11/uk-brexit-britain-hs2-scottish-bridge\">A road to the north, a bridge across the sea \u2013 nice symbols, but they won\u2019t unite the UK | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rickard agreed, saying that \u201cfor the most part abandoned modern munitions are extremely stable as they would not have been primed or fused\u201d although pre-second world war compounds such as Shellite \u201care more likely to explode if they are subjected to shock from falling shipwreck debris\u201d.</p> <p>When it comes to underwater munitions, non-intervention has long been considered to be the safest course of action, a policy that was introduced after an failed attempt to lift a wrecked munitions ship off the Kent coast in 1967. An attempt to clear the SS Kielce, about four miles offshore, triggered an explosion that measured 4.5 on the Richter scale. Properties in Folkestone were damaged, although no injuries were reported.</p> <p>There is also evidence that 14,500 tonnes of <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020423/text/20423w18.htm\">artillery rockets tipped with phosgene</a>, a chemical weapon, were dumped in Beaufort\u2019s Dyke after the war. The gas gradually suffocates victims and is six times more deadly than chlorine. Phosgene, however, is destroyed on contact with sea water, and a 1996 survey found no evidence of it or mustard gas in seabed samples. Experts believe that more dangerous nerve agents or other chemical weapons were dumped further afield at 22 locations in the Atlantic.</p> <p>Brock said Downing Street\u2019s bridge proposals highlighted a wider marine environmental problem, which is being acknowledged in countries such as Norway and Belgium. \u201cAction is being taken elsewhere to start cleaning up the messes left behind by the dumping of chemical, biological and conventional weapons and the radioactive waste is getting special attention.

      "bodyText": "Bomb-disposal experts have warned it would be too dangerous to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland if it was to involve spanning the vast offshore munitions dump that lies on the most direct route over the Irish Sea. The most direct route for Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of a 28-mile bridge would involve crossing Beaufort\u2019s Dyke, a trench that contains more than 1m tonnes of unexploded munitions, plus chemical weapons and radioactive waste. Robin Rickard, a consultant with the explosive ordnance advisers Exord, said \u201cany intrusive works such as piling associated with the construction of bridges would pose an unacceptable level of risk\u201d because it could disturb the munitions on the seabed. He added: \u201cIn my opinion, this would be without doubt an enormous undertaking. Without knowing the planned design and engineering methodology, but assuming it would involve deep intrusive seabed works in proximity to unexploded ordnance, it would thereby represent a significant risk to the project and its personnel.\u201d The dump site is not regularly monitored by the British government, although the construction of a British Gas pipeline two decades ago resulted in thousands of second world war incendiary bombs being washed ashore, some of which exploded when they dried out. A four-year-old boy suffered burns in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute, after picking up a device containing phosphorus. The episode led to the last major survey of the maritime site, with dredging for the gas pipeline thought to have been the cause. Beaufort\u2019s Dyke is about 31 miles (50km) long and up to 300 metres (1,000ft) deep, and lies directly on the most direct route for a link between Portpatrick in Scotland and Larne in Northern Ireland. British ships sailed out from Cairnryan in western Scotland to dump weapons in Beaufort\u2019s Dyke from the 1920s to the 1970s, including Allied and German munitions after the second world war. Sometimes the vessels did not reach the dyke, the bombs dumped overboard into shallower waters instead. Detailed records were often destroyed at the time. In 1997 it was acknowledged that radioactive waste had also been dumped in steel drums there in the 1950s after what the then Scotland secretary, Donald Dewar, said was \u201ca discovery of old papers in the Public Records Office\u201d. Deidre Brock, a Scottish National party MP, said she wanted the Ministry of Defence to conduct an \u201ceco-audit\u201d of what was in Beaufort\u2019s Dyke. \u201cI asked how the MoD monitors this ticking timebomb but it turns out no one monitors it and nobody knows what condition it\u2019s in. No one knows what\u2019s down there and no one looks at it. How could anyone think it was sensible to build a bridge over all that?\u201d she said. The MoD acknowledged that it had a broad \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d for the site, because it dumped the munitions there in the first place, but believes that the site is safe because there is no impact on the seabed, a point generally reinforced by experts and the last survey conducted in the mid-1990s. Rickard agreed, saying that \u201cfor the most part abandoned modern munitions are extremely stable as they would not have been primed or fused\u201d although pre-second world war compounds such as Shellite \u201care more likely to explode if they are subjected to shock from falling shipwreck debris\u201d. When it comes to underwater munitions, non-intervention has long been considered to be the safest course of action, a policy that was introduced after an failed attempt to lift a wrecked munitions ship off the Kent coast in 1967. An attempt to clear the SS Kielce, about four miles offshore, triggered an explosion that measured 4.5 on the Richter scale. Properties in Folkestone were damaged, although no injuries were reported. There is also evidence that 14,500 tonnes of artillery rockets tipped with phosgene, a chemical weapon, were dumped in Beaufort\u2019s Dyke after the war. The gas gradually suffocates victims and is six times more deadly than chlorine. Phosgene, however, is destroyed on contact with sea water, and a 1996 survey found no evidence of it or mustard gas in seabed samples. Experts believe that more dangerous nerve agents or other chemical weapons were dumped further afield at 22 locations in the Atlantic. Brock said Downing Street\u2019s bridge proposals highlighted a wider marine environmental problem, which is being acknowledged in countries such as Norway and Belgium. \u201cAction is being taken elsewhere to start cleaning up the messes left behind by the dumping of chemical, biological and conventional weapons and the radioactive waste is getting special attention. We should not be left behind,\u201d she added.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>There can\u2019t be anyone in the country who seriously believes that a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, across one of the deepest, busiest stretches of the Irish Sea that has been used as a dumping ground for millions of tonnes of explosives, will ever be built. And yet Boris Johnson managed to keep an entirely straight face as he announced his intention to proceed with feasibility studies for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/10/boris-johnson-northern-ireland-scotland-bridge-plan-being-actively-looked-into-no-10\">imaginary bridge</a>. Some reckoned this was just a diversionary tactic \u2013 on the same day Michael Gove shamelessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/10/checks-on-eu-bound-goods-inevitable-gove-tells-business-leaders\">admitted there would be post-Brexit border checks</a> after months in which the government has brazenly said there wouldn\u2019t \u2013 but there is no denying Boris\u2019s attraction to shiny, new infrastructure projects. All of which have a habit of going wrong. When he was mayor of London, there was the Boris Island airport which disappeared under the sea, and the Garden Bridge that cost \u00a340m not to even begin construction. It would have been a lot cheaper just to pay me \u00a320m right at the very start just to say the idea was completely ludicrous. Come to think of it, make me a consultant on the Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge right now. The country will thank me in the end. Then there are the projects that did get built. The <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/emirates-air-line/\">cable car that goes from nowhere in particular to nowhere in particular</a> and is used by almost no one. Crossrail that is massively over budget and three years \u2013 and counting \u2013 late. So the prospects for HS2, which is already \u00a380bn over budget and spectacularly late before a mile of track has even been laid, don\u2019t seem exactly promising. But thrilled to be writing the biggest cheque in the UK\u2019s history, Boris has given the project the go-ahead. At least, the section up to Crewe. The rest may be later downgraded to regular track; if it gets built at all. Still, by then Boris will be long gone and someone else will be left to pick up the pieces.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>A survey has come up with a list of people\u2019s biggest regrets. The top five are wishing you had saved more when you were younger, not keeping in touch with old friends, not taking the plunge in a romance, not travelling when you had fewer responsibilities and not pursuing a better-paid job. Maybe I am unusual here, but only one of these really applies to me. I do profoundly regret not making more time for old friends and family, especially those who have died and for whom it is too late to let them know how much I loved them. The other regrets, not so much. I never had much money to save in the first place, though what I did have I could have spent a great deal more wisely and creatively. But that\u2019s another story. I\u2019ve never felt as if I\u2019ve missed out by not having travelled more \u2013 I much prefer going to the same places with the same people over and over again. I\u2019ve also never wished I\u2019d chased the big bucks: I consider myself lucky to do the job I have. Enjoying my work has been one of the unexpected bonuses of my life, not least because for a long time the idea of even having a career \u2013 let alone one I enjoyed \u2013 seemed inconceivable. But most of all I have no feelings of regret for the love affairs that never happened. Quite the reverse, in fact. Just a sense of massive relief. Not just because I love my wife and our children. But also because I can\u2019t help feeling that I may have dodged a bullet. Back in the day, I wasn\u2019t always the best judge of a partner nor the best prospect, and my relationships invariably ended badly. And if I didn\u2019t dodge a bullet, then the women certainly did. Put it like this. I wouldn\u2019t have gone out with me, so I see no reason why anyone else should have wanted to. Thankfully, my wife made an exception. She, of course, may have her own regrets ...</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Even before I reached an age at which actuarial tables became a matter of personal rather than academic interest, Jeanne Calment\u2019s story had long been an object of fascination. Calment was born in the Proven\u00e7al town of Arles in February 1875 and died there 122 years, five months and 14 days later in 1997, by which time she was officially the oldest woman to have ever lived. And she still holds that record. Some scientists may now reckon that the person who will live to 150 has already been born and that reaching 100 will soon become normal, but the 7 billion-plus people on the planet have still got a way to go before someone inches past Calment. Only it now turns out that Jeanne may not have been Jeanne after all. A <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/17/was-jeanne-calment-the-oldest-person-who-ever-lived-or-a-fraud\">gripping story in the New Yorker</a> reports that some gerontologists have now become sceptical about her longevity. They have examined photos of her at the age of 110 and concluded that she has the physical attributes of someone under 90, and found serious time-shifts and lacunae in her life story. Rather than having met Van Gogh in 1888, they think that that Jeanne may actually have been her daughter Yvonne, who was reported to have died of tuberculosis in 1934. Their suggestion is that it was Jeanne who died of TB and that, to avoid inheritance tax, her husband, Freddy, passed off her body as that of their daughter Yvonne, and that Yvonne happily went along with it. As presumably did half of Arles who must have noticed that Jeanne had become a lot younger since her daughter had died. It all sounds highly improbable, though perhaps no more so than the chances of outliving by at least five years everyone who has ever been born in human history. In any case the French, who are extremely proud of Jeanne\u2019s legacy, are vigorously defending her posthumous honour. I\u2019d like to believe Jeanne, if only for the hope she offers. Though I\u2019m not sure I quite fancy making it through to the age of 122 myself. Rather depends on how many of my family and friends are still alive and how well Spurs are playing.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>If one of the first rules of politics is to anticipate your opponent\u2019s next step, then Boris Johnson\u2019s ministerial reshuffle has to go down as a partial cock-up. Having been pleasantly surprised at how accommodating Sajid Javid had been over the previous six months, Boris and Dominic Cummings had clearly expected the chancellor to just roll over when he was informed that from now on all his special advisers would be sacked and that the Treasury would be run from No 10. But, right at the last and rather unexpectedly, Sajid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\">turned out to have some self-respect</a>, so Boris was blindsided into appointing the 12-year-old Rishi Sunak, who clearly doesn\u2019t. That aside, though, Boris and Dom are probably looking back at a decent day\u2019s work. Old scores were settled, competent ministers were replaced with yes men and women, as well as unelected peers and, moments after the culture secretary had been unable to take departmental questions for a second time as she was otherwise engaged in the Lords, there was no attorney general to answer attorney general questions. Taking back control has rarely looked so anti-democratic. It\u2019s begun to look as if Boris and Dom are actively trolling the country to see what they can get away with.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>Organisation has never been my strongest point \u2013 it\u2019s always a major achievement to get the car its MOT on time \u2013 but I can safely say that I can always remember who paid for my holidays. Especially if it\u2019s one that I went on little more than a month previously. It\u2019s me and my wife. Just as it has been for the last 30 something years. But curiously, Boris Johnson finds this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/labour-demands-inquiry-into-boris-johnsons-holiday\">rather more problematic</a>. In the register of members\u2019 interests, he has listed his \u00a315K new year break as a gift from Carphone Warehouse millionaire and Tory party donor David Ross. Only it turns out that Ross says he didn\u2019t pay for it at all, he merely discovered the availability of a vacant villa with five servants. Boris\u2019s subsequent clarification \u2013 \u201cMr Ross facilitated accommodation for Mr Johnson on Mustique valued at \u00a315K. Therefore this is a benefit in kind from Mr Ross to Mr Johnson and Mr Johnson\u2019s declaration to the House of Commons is correct\u201d \u2013 has only muddied the waters. This rather suggests that I should have listed Airbnb as a benefit in kind when we went to Minneapolis last summer. Boris then said he had no idea who owned the villa and who had paid.

      "bodyText": "Monday There can\u2019t be anyone in the country who seriously believes that a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, across one of the deepest, busiest stretches of the Irish Sea that has been used as a dumping ground for millions of tonnes of explosives, will ever be built. And yet Boris Johnson managed to keep an entirely straight face as he announced his intention to proceed with feasibility studies for his imaginary bridge. Some reckoned this was just a diversionary tactic \u2013 on the same day Michael Gove shamelessly admitted there would be post-Brexit border checks after months in which the government has brazenly said there wouldn\u2019t \u2013 but there is no denying Boris\u2019s attraction to shiny, new infrastructure projects. All of which have a habit of going wrong. When he was mayor of London, there was the Boris Island airport which disappeared under the sea, and the Garden Bridge that cost \u00a340m not to even begin construction. It would have been a lot cheaper just to pay me \u00a320m right at the very start just to say the idea was completely ludicrous. Come to think of it, make me a consultant on the Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge right now. The country will thank me in the end. Then there are the projects that did get built. The cable car that goes from nowhere in particular to nowhere in particular and is used by almost no one. Crossrail that is massively over budget and three years \u2013 and counting \u2013 late. So the prospects for HS2, which is already \u00a380bn over budget and spectacularly late before a mile of track has even been laid, don\u2019t seem exactly promising. But thrilled to be writing the biggest cheque in the UK\u2019s history, Boris has given the project the go-ahead. At least, the section up to Crewe. The rest may be later downgraded to regular track; if it gets built at all. Still, by then Boris will be long gone and someone else will be left to pick up the pieces. Tuesday A survey has come up with a list of people\u2019s biggest regrets. The top five are wishing you had saved more when you were younger, not keeping in touch with old friends, not taking the plunge in a romance, not travelling when you had fewer responsibilities and not pursuing a better-paid job. Maybe I am unusual here, but only one of these really applies to me. I do profoundly regret not making more time for old friends and family, especially those who have died and for whom it is too late to let them know how much I loved them. The other regrets, not so much. I never had much money to save in the first place, though what I did have I could have spent a great deal more wisely and creatively. But that\u2019s another story. I\u2019ve never felt as if I\u2019ve missed out by not having travelled more \u2013 I much prefer going to the same places with the same people over and over again. I\u2019ve also never wished I\u2019d chased the big bucks: I consider myself lucky to do the job I have. Enjoying my work has been one of the unexpected bonuses of my life, not least because for a long time the idea of even having a career \u2013 let alone one I enjoyed \u2013 seemed inconceivable. But most of all I have no feelings of regret for the love affairs that never happened. Quite the reverse, in fact. Just a sense of massive relief. Not just because I love my wife and our children. But also because I can\u2019t help feeling that I may have dodged a bullet. Back in the day, I wasn\u2019t always the best judge of a partner nor the best prospect, and my relationships invariably ended badly. And if I didn\u2019t dodge a bullet, then the women certainly did. Put it like this. I wouldn\u2019t have gone out with me, so I see no reason why anyone else should have wanted to. Thankfully, my wife made an exception. She, of course, may have her own regrets ... Wednesday Even before I reached an age at which actuarial tables became a matter of personal rather than academic interest, Jeanne Calment\u2019s story had long been an object of fascination. Calment was born in the Proven\u00e7al town of Arles in February 1875 and died there 122 years, five months and 14 days later in 1997, by which time she was officially the oldest woman to have ever lived. And she still holds that record. Some scientists may now reckon that the person who will live to 150 has already been born and that reaching 100 will soon become normal, but the 7 billion-plus people on the planet have still got a way to go before someone inches past Calment. Only it now turns out that Jeanne may not have been Jeanne after all. A gripping story in the New Yorker reports that some gerontologists have now become sceptical about her longevity. They have examined photos of her at the age of 110 and concluded that she has the physical attributes of someone under 90, and found serious time-shifts and lacunae in her life story. Rather than having met Van Gogh in 1888, they think that that Jeanne may actually have been her daughter Yvonne, who was reported to have died of tuberculosis in 1934. Their suggestion is that it was Jeanne who died of TB and that, to avoid inheritance tax, her husband, Freddy, passed off her body as that of their daughter Yvonne, and that Yvonne happily went along with it. As presumably did half of Arles who must have noticed that Jeanne had become a lot younger since her daughter had died. It all sounds highly improbable, though perhaps no more so than the chances of outliving by at least five years everyone who has ever been born in human history. In any case the French, who are extremely proud of Jeanne\u2019s legacy, are vigorously defending her posthumous honour. I\u2019d like to believe Jeanne, if only for the hope she offers. Though I\u2019m not sure I quite fancy making it through to the age of 122 myself. Rather depends on how many of my family and friends are still alive and how well Spurs are playing. Thursday If one of the first rules of politics is to anticipate your opponent\u2019s next step, then Boris Johnson\u2019s ministerial reshuffle has to go down as a partial cock-up. Having been pleasantly surprised at how accommodating Sajid Javid had been over the previous six months, Boris and Dominic Cummings had clearly expected the chancellor to just roll over when he was informed that from now on all his special advisers would be sacked and that the Treasury would be run from No 10. But, right at the last and rather unexpectedly, Sajid turned out to have some self-respect, so Boris was blindsided into appointing the 12-year-old Rishi Sunak, who clearly doesn\u2019t. That aside, though, Boris and Dom are probably looking back at a decent day\u2019s work. Old scores were settled, competent ministers were replaced with yes men and women, as well as unelected peers and, moments after the culture secretary had been unable to take departmental questions for a second time as she was otherwise engaged in the Lords, there was no attorney general to answer attorney general questions. Taking back control has rarely looked so anti-democratic. It\u2019s begun to look as if Boris and Dom are actively trolling the country to see what they can get away with. Friday Organisation has never been my strongest point \u2013 it\u2019s always a major achievement to get the car its MOT on time \u2013 but I can safely say that I can always remember who paid for my holidays. Especially if it\u2019s one that I went on little more than a month previously. It\u2019s me and my wife. Just as it has been for the last 30 something years. But curiously, Boris Johnson finds this rather more problematic. In the register of members\u2019 interests, he has listed his \u00a315K new year break as a gift from Carphone Warehouse millionaire and Tory party donor David Ross. Only it turns out that Ross says he didn\u2019t pay for it at all, he merely discovered the availability of a vacant villa with five servants. Boris\u2019s subsequent clarification \u2013 \u201cMr Ross facilitated accommodation for Mr Johnson on Mustique valued at \u00a315K. Therefore this is a benefit in kind from Mr Ross to Mr Johnson and Mr Johnson\u2019s declaration to the House of Commons is correct\u201d \u2013 has only muddied the waters. This rather suggests that I should have listed Airbnb as a benefit in kind when we went to Minneapolis last summer. Boris then said he had no idea who owned the villa and who had paid. It was just one of those unaccountable windfalls that have a habit of landing in his lap. Further reports have suggested the villa could have been one of two possible properties he stayed in, owned by different wealthy Americans, who have no record of who paid the \u00a315K. Somehow it seems to have just landed in someone\u2019s bank account and it would be rude to check who made the transfer. Digested week, digested: Another bridge too far. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2020. An earlier version wrongly said Jeanne Calment died in 1977. It was also amended to reflect the fact that the ownership of the Mustique villa in which Johnson and Symonds stayed over the new year has not yet been fully established.",

She was attending the inaugural strategy meeting for the UK members of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/generation-identity-uk-far-right-extremists\" title=\"\">Generation Identity, a pan-European far-right network</a> known for spreading anti-immigration ideas and stoking fears about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/great-replacement-theory-alt-right-killers-el-paso\" title=\"\">\u201cgreat replacement\u201d</a> in which white populations become minorities. Ebner had spent months infiltrating the group\u2019s encrypted, invite-only messaging channels under an alias and striking up a rapport with members; now she was meeting them in person.</p> <p>I meet Ebner at the same pub, only this time it is mid-morning and, save for the barman polishing furniture, there is no one else here. \u201cThis feels weird,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really scared walking in that night so I remember it as having a dark and oppressive atmosphere. I\u2019m surprised at how unremarkable it feels today.\u201d</p> <p>Her first meeting with Generation Identity was brief: they talked disparagingly about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/23/challenging-prejudice-constructively-hope-not-hate\" title=\"\">anti</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/23/challenging-prejudice-constructively-hope-not-hate\" title=\"\">-racism organisation</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/23/challenging-prejudice-constructively-hope-not-hate\" title=\"\"> Hope Not Hate</a>; the best way of vetting new recruits; white supremacist literature; and where they were going on their holidays (Hungary was a popular choice). More nerve-racking, says the 28-year-old, was the second meeting the next day in a flat in Brixton, south London, which was led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/26/austrian-far-right-leader-searched-on-suspicion-of-forming-terrorist-group-with-christchurch-shooter\" title=\"\">Martin Sellner, the head of Identit\u00e4re Bewegung \u00d6sterreich</a>, Austria\u2019s Identitarian Movement. Ebner feared her cover would be blown as she and Sellner had both featured in a report on extremism on <em>Newsnight</em> the previous year, but, as they shook hands, he didn\u2019t appear to recognise her. Attendees were asked to fill in a questionnaire about their background and ideology, after which talks were given by Sellner and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/far-right-activists-barred-britain-state-speech\" title=\"\">Brittany Pettibone</a>, Sellner\u2019s girlfriend (and now wife). Among the topics was the danger posed by infiltrators from anti-racist organisations, security services and the media. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh God. Are they going to pull everyone\u2019s hair to see who\u2019s wearing a wig?\u2019\u201d Ebner recalls.</p> <p>Her experiences are detailed in her new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/going-dark-9781526616784/\" title=\"\">Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists</a></em>. Along with recording her meetings with Generation Identity, it tells how, over the course of two years, she inveigled her way into the chatrooms of the Trad Wives movement, including the anti-feminist Red Pill Women, and the Terror Agency Sister group, a women-only group for supporters of Islamic State. In US \u201calt-right\u201d channels, she eavesdropped on arrangements for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/12/charlottesville-far-right-crowd-with-torches-encircles-counter-protest-group\" title=\"\">2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville</a>. Ebner had planned to attend but changed her mind after people began posting pictures of firearms. (The event ended in tragedy after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/virginia-unite-the-right-rally-protest-violence\" title=\"\">man deliberately drove a car into a group of protesters</a>, killing a young woman and injuring scores more.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Creating a false identity is like inventing a character for a book \u2013 you have to know the person\u2019s background and desires</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ebner, who speaks five languages, is a research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London, a counter-extremism organisation founded in 2006 with a focus on combating the spread of propaganda, hate speech and disinformation online. Her first book, <em>The Rage</em> (2018), was about the reciprocal relationship between far-right and Muslim extremists and how, she says, \u201ceach exploits the fears that the other side provokes\u201d. She was inspired to write it after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-slow-burning-hatred-led-to-jo-cox-murder\" title=\"\">murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016</a> by a rightwing extremist. Before Cox\u2019s death, her research was broadly centred on jihadism. \u201cBut then I shifted focus. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what had happened to her, and I realised how little attention was being paid to the threat from the far right.\u201d</p> <p><em>Going Dark</em> builds on that research by revealing how extremist groups from across the ideological spectrum harness technology to spread the word, and exposes their methods of radicalisation, from online recruitment and networking to mobilisation and intimidation tactics. \u201cThe radicalisation engines that today\u2019s extremists are building are cutting edge: artificially intelligent, emotionally manipulative and socially powerful,\u201d Ebner writes in the introduction.</p> <p>In the course of her research, Ebner has been known to juggle five online identities simultaneously. To do this successfully, she says, \u201cyou have to create a story for your character. It\u2019s a bit like inventing a character for a book. You have to know the person\u2019s background but also her desires. What does she want? What makes her angry? And then it\u2019s about maintaining that presence online for a period of time so people get to know you.\u201d</p> <p>Newcomers to far-right extremist networks can initially be asked to prove their whiteness by taking a photo of their wrist along with a timestamp and the group logo. Ebner was once asked to submit a genetic test to prove her white ancestry (she used a fake one). Some networks even instruct new recruits to launch an online hate or disinformation campaign against, say, a political campaigner \u2013 \u201cjust to show that they are willing to go there\u201d, Ebner says.</p> <p>Is there a thrill in pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes and potentially putting herself in danger? \u201cI would be lying if I said there wasn\u2019t an element of that; there is an adrenaline rush in doing any kind of undercover work,\u201d Ebner says. \u201cTo be able to get inside a movement while being completely opposed to the ideologies, that can feel good. Though there may be better ways to get that kind of kick \u2026 such as jumping out of a plane.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38dbedc8dbfb2c974467cb48e4e9c14daac8924a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38dbedc8dbfb2c974467cb48e4e9c14daac8924a/0_127_3088_1853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neo-Nazis clash with anti-fascist counterprotesters at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neo-Nazis clash with anti-fascist counterprotesters at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, there have been times when fears about her personal safety have almost overwhelmed her. In 2017, she wrote a comment piece for this newspaper on the mainstreaming of far-right groups in which she observed that the English Defence League co-founder Tommy Robinson\u2019s supporters included prominent US alt-right leaders. At the time, she was working for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/19/prevent-quilliam-foundation-extremism\" title=\"\">counter-extremist thinktank</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/19/prevent-quilliam-foundation-extremism\" title=\"\"> Quilliam</a>.</p> <p>The next day, Robinson and a camera crew entered her office to demand that she justify linking him to white supremacists. The incident was uploaded on to the internet as part of Robinson\u2019s Troll Watch series. It was followed by a campaign of online harassment led by others against Ebner, which included threats of sexual violence and death. \u201cThat was quite traumatising,\u201d she recalls. When leaving work, she would worry that she was being followed, \u201cor that when I got home there might be someone waiting for me. But in the end I came to the conclusion that that\u2019s exactly what they want. It is their goal in their intimidation campaigns to make people quit their jobs, to make them too afraid to criticise them or expose their manipulative tactics. What kept me going was not wanting to give in.\u201d</p> <p><em>Going Dark</em> doesn\u2019t underestimate the continuing threat of jihadism \u2013 a fortnight after we meet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/03/sudesh-amman-how-did-science-student-become-streatham-jihadist\" title=\"\">Sudesh Amman</a>, who had already been convicted for terror offences, stabbed two members of the public in Streatham, south London, before being shot dead by police. Ebner\u2019s focus, however, is on the methods used by everyone from jihadists to conspiracy theorists to white supremacists and anti-feminists to disseminate, radicalise and recruit. It explains broader concepts used by extremists, including \u201credpilling\u201d which, inspired by the 1999 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-matrix\" title=\"\">The Matrix</a></em>, sees recruiters persuading potential sympathisers of an alternative reality in which they are oppressed and threatened by particular groups, and the \u201cgamification\u201d of discourse, in which terrorists adopt or are given heroic names from computer games, or are given scores for injuring or killing. By adopting the language of gamers, the lines between fantasy and reality become dangerously blurred among perpetrators and sympathisers.</p> <p>Ebner anticipates a near future in which AI tools bolster online extremist campaigns with \u201cdeepfakes\u201d \u2013 fake newspaper articles and audio and film footage that has been seamlessly doctored. Matters aren\u2019t helped by the slowness of policymakers and tech firms to rid platforms of harmful content, or the fact that extremists manage to stay one step ahead by developing new methods to escape detection. </p> <p>Does Ebner\u2019s work makes her feel bleak about the future and our ability to combat extremism? \u201cYes,\u201d she replies. \u201cThere are times when I feel pessimistic about how these extremist movements have the potential, in the medium and long term, to completely destabilise our democracies, not just through intimidating opponents but manipulating normal, average users and radicalising sympathisers.\u201d But, she adds, researching the book also made her see a human side to people with extreme viewpoints. However disgusting she found their ideologies, she says she felt \u201cempathy, even sympathy, for people\u2019s fears. Because in the end there was always some kind of fear, or lack of love or recognition, that was driving individuals into those networks.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Extremist movements could\u00a0completely destabilise our democracies, intimidating opponents and radicalising sympathisers</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On coming across young people in neo-Nazi channels (the youngest she encountered claimed to be 14), Ebner had to resist the urge to engage with them individually and attempt to change their minds: \u201cI had to keep telling myself that I will have a bigger impact by gathering information.\u201d A young person\u2019s professional future can be wrecked by associations with extremist groups, something their leaders often count on to ensure lifelong commitment. \u201cIsis were known for putting their newest faces on their propaganda material,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to reverse that.\u201d</p> <p>Given the threats she has endured online, Ebner is understandably cautious about sharing details of her personal life. What she will say is that she was born and raised in Vienna \u2013 her mother is an actor turned acting coach and her father a healthcare consultant. After secondary school, she studied for a degree in international business administration and philosophy in Vienna, though, she notes, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really interested in the business part. I just did it as I thought I could earn money.\u201d She subsequently got a scholarship to Peking University for an MA in international relations and history. She completed her final year at the London School of Economics, where she shifted her focus to political Islam and the history of jihadism, and got her first job at Quilliam soon afterwards.</p> <p>Ebner recalls that, while she was growing up, there was what she describes as a \u201cvery utopian view of the future of the internet \u2026 There was this sense that it would enable the democratisation of knowledge, make the world more tolerant and build bridges rather than build tensions and split communities.\u201d But by the early 2010s, the shine had begun to come off. \u201cThe rate of technological change scares people,\u201d she notes.

      "bodyText": "One October evening in 2017, the counter-extremism expert Julia Ebner put on a wig and a pair of glasses, walked into a pub in Mayfair, London, and sat down with 20 strangers. She was attending the inaugural strategy meeting for the UK members of Generation Identity, a pan-European far-right network known for spreading anti-immigration ideas and stoking fears about a \u201cgreat replacement\u201d in which white populations become minorities. Ebner had spent months infiltrating the group\u2019s encrypted, invite-only messaging channels under an alias and striking up a rapport with members; now she was meeting them in person. I meet Ebner at the same pub, only this time it is mid-morning and, save for the barman polishing furniture, there is no one else here. \u201cThis feels weird,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really scared walking in that night so I remember it as having a dark and oppressive atmosphere. I\u2019m surprised at how unremarkable it feels today.\u201d Her first meeting with Generation Identity was brief: they talked disparagingly about the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate; the best way of vetting new recruits; white supremacist literature; and where they were going on their holidays (Hungary was a popular choice). More nerve-racking, says the 28-year-old, was the second meeting the next day in a flat in Brixton, south London, which was led by Martin Sellner, the head of Identit\u00e4re Bewegung \u00d6sterreich, Austria\u2019s Identitarian Movement. Ebner feared her cover would be blown as she and Sellner had both featured in a report on extremism on Newsnight the previous year, but, as they shook hands, he didn\u2019t appear to recognise her. Attendees were asked to fill in a questionnaire about their background and ideology, after which talks were given by Sellner and Brittany Pettibone, Sellner\u2019s girlfriend (and now wife). Among the topics was the danger posed by infiltrators from anti-racist organisations, security services and the media. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh God. Are they going to pull everyone\u2019s hair to see who\u2019s wearing a wig?\u2019\u201d Ebner recalls. Her experiences are detailed in her new book, Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists. Along with recording her meetings with Generation Identity, it tells how, over the course of two years, she inveigled her way into the chatrooms of the Trad Wives movement, including the anti-feminist Red Pill Women, and the Terror Agency Sister group, a women-only group for supporters of Islamic State. In US \u201calt-right\u201d channels, she eavesdropped on arrangements for the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Ebner had planned to attend but changed her mind after people began posting pictures of firearms. (The event ended in tragedy after a man deliberately drove a car into a group of protesters, killing a young woman and injuring scores more.) Ebner, who speaks five languages, is a research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London, a counter-extremism organisation founded in 2006 with a focus on combating the spread of propaganda, hate speech and disinformation online. Her first book, The Rage (2018), was about the reciprocal relationship between far-right and Muslim extremists and how, she says, \u201ceach exploits the fears that the other side provokes\u201d. She was inspired to write it after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016 by a rightwing extremist. Before Cox\u2019s death, her research was broadly centred on jihadism. \u201cBut then I shifted focus. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what had happened to her, and I realised how little attention was being paid to the threat from the far right.\u201d Going Dark builds on that research by revealing how extremist groups from across the ideological spectrum harness technology to spread the word, and exposes their methods of radicalisation, from online recruitment and networking to mobilisation and intimidation tactics. \u201cThe radicalisation engines that today\u2019s extremists are building are cutting edge: artificially intelligent, emotionally manipulative and socially powerful,\u201d Ebner writes in the introduction. In the course of her research, Ebner has been known to juggle five online identities simultaneously. To do this successfully, she says, \u201cyou have to create a story for your character. It\u2019s a bit like inventing a character for a book. You have to know the person\u2019s background but also her desires. What does she want? What makes her angry? And then it\u2019s about maintaining that presence online for a period of time so people get to know you.\u201d Newcomers to far-right extremist networks can initially be asked to prove their whiteness by taking a photo of their wrist along with a timestamp and the group logo. Ebner was once asked to submit a genetic test to prove her white ancestry (she used a fake one). Some networks even instruct new recruits to launch an online hate or disinformation campaign against, say, a political campaigner \u2013 \u201cjust to show that they are willing to go there\u201d, Ebner says. Is there a thrill in pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes and potentially putting herself in danger? \u201cI would be lying if I said there wasn\u2019t an element of that; there is an adrenaline rush in doing any kind of undercover work,\u201d Ebner says. \u201cTo be able to get inside a movement while being completely opposed to the ideologies, that can feel good. Though there may be better ways to get that kind of kick \u2026 such as jumping out of a plane.\u201d Nonetheless, there have been times when fears about her personal safety have almost overwhelmed her. In 2017, she wrote a comment piece for this newspaper on the mainstreaming of far-right groups in which she observed that the English Defence League co-founder Tommy Robinson\u2019s supporters included prominent US alt-right leaders. At the time, she was working for the counter-extremist thinktank Quilliam. The next day, Robinson and a camera crew entered her office to demand that she justify linking him to white supremacists. The incident was uploaded on to the internet as part of Robinson\u2019s Troll Watch series. It was followed by a campaign of online harassment led by others against Ebner, which included threats of sexual violence and death. \u201cThat was quite traumatising,\u201d she recalls. When leaving work, she would worry that she was being followed, \u201cor that when I got home there might be someone waiting for me. But in the end I came to the conclusion that that\u2019s exactly what they want. It is their goal in their intimidation campaigns to make people quit their jobs, to make them too afraid to criticise them or expose their manipulative tactics. What kept me going was not wanting to give in.\u201d Going Dark doesn\u2019t underestimate the continuing threat of jihadism \u2013 a fortnight after we meet, Sudesh Amman, who had already been convicted for terror offences, stabbed two members of the public in Streatham, south London, before being shot dead by police. Ebner\u2019s focus, however, is on the methods used by everyone from jihadists to conspiracy theorists to white supremacists and anti-feminists to disseminate, radicalise and recruit. It explains broader concepts used by extremists, including \u201credpilling\u201d which, inspired by the 1999 film The Matrix, sees recruiters persuading potential sympathisers of an alternative reality in which they are oppressed and threatened by particular groups, and the \u201cgamification\u201d of discourse, in which terrorists adopt or are given heroic names from computer games, or are given scores for injuring or killing. By adopting the language of gamers, the lines between fantasy and reality become dangerously blurred among perpetrators and sympathisers. Ebner anticipates a near future in which AI tools bolster online extremist campaigns with \u201cdeepfakes\u201d \u2013 fake newspaper articles and audio and film footage that has been seamlessly doctored. Matters aren\u2019t helped by the slowness of policymakers and tech firms to rid platforms of harmful content, or the fact that extremists manage to stay one step ahead by developing new methods to escape detection. Does Ebner\u2019s work makes her feel bleak about the future and our ability to combat extremism? \u201cYes,\u201d she replies. \u201cThere are times when I feel pessimistic about how these extremist movements have the potential, in the medium and long term, to completely destabilise our democracies, not just through intimidating opponents but manipulating normal, average users and radicalising sympathisers.\u201d But, she adds, researching the book also made her see a human side to people with extreme viewpoints. However disgusting she found their ideologies, she says she felt \u201cempathy, even sympathy, for people\u2019s fears. Because in the end there was always some kind of fear, or lack of love or recognition, that was driving individuals into those networks.\u201d On coming across young people in neo-Nazi channels (the youngest she encountered claimed to be 14), Ebner had to resist the urge to engage with them individually and attempt to change their minds: \u201cI had to keep telling myself that I will have a bigger impact by gathering information.\u201d A young person\u2019s professional future can be wrecked by associations with extremist groups, something their leaders often count on to ensure lifelong commitment. \u201cIsis were known for putting their newest faces on their propaganda material,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to reverse that.\u201d Given the threats she has endured online, Ebner is understandably cautious about sharing details of her personal life. What she will say is that she was born and raised in Vienna \u2013 her mother is an actor turned acting coach and her father a healthcare consultant. After secondary school, she studied for a degree in international business administration and philosophy in Vienna, though, she notes, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really interested in the business part. I just did it as I thought I could earn money.\u201d She subsequently got a scholarship to Peking University for an MA in international relations and history. She completed her final year at the London School of Economics, where she shifted her focus to political Islam and the history of jihadism, and got her first job at Quilliam soon afterwards. Ebner recalls that, while she was growing up, there was what she describes as a \u201cvery utopian view of the future of the internet \u2026 There was this sense that it would enable the democratisation of knowledge, make the world more tolerant and build bridges rather than build tensions and split communities.\u201d But by the early 2010s, the shine had begun to come off. \u201cThe rate of technological change scares people,\u201d she notes. Its effect on society \u201cis something that\u2019s on the mind of most people of my generation\u201d. I ask if the months spent trawling message boards with often horrifyingly violent and racist content takes its toll. \u201cIt does,\u201d she says, \u201cthough it\u2019s a creeping kind of trauma. Research by psychologists suggests that it can have long-term effects that can take a while to appear. I try my best to avoid social media and have online detoxes regularly, though that can be difficult. When working undercover, you need to maintain a presence online. You can\u2019t just disappear.\u201d Ebner is also keenly aware of \u201chow distorted the whole online space is, and how that doesn\u2019t reflect general opinions.

You can add as much garlic and chilli as you dare \u2013 the joy of cooking for one. Prep 10 min Cooking 15 min Serves 1 100g dried spaghetti Extra-virgin olive oil 1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced \u00bd-1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped \u00bd head spring greens, rinsed and shredded \u00bd unwaxed lemon Parmesan cheese (I use a vegetarian parmesan-style cheese) Cook the spaghetti in a saucepan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions \u2013 around eight minutes. Meanwhile, heat a generous drizzle of oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic and chilli, and fry for a minute or so, until the garlic is starting to turn golden at the edges. Add the spring greens and cook, stirring occasionally, for three to four minutes, or until the greens have wilted a little. Finely grate over the lemon zest. Drain the spaghetti, keeping some of the cooking water, then put the pasta back in the pan with a splash of the water. Squeeze over the juice of about a quarter of the lemon, and serve topped with a drizzle of oil and a wispy pile of finely grated parmesan. A few things you could add, if you have them to hand: crumbled feta, crispy breadcrumbs, toasted pine nuts or torn basil. Chocolate and blood orange sundae If you can\u2019t get blood oranges, a normal orange or clementine will be fine. Make sure you let the sticky blood oranges cool enough so as not to melt the ice-cream. Prep 15 min Cooking 5 min Serves 1 1 blood orange 2 tbsp maple syrup 2-3 scoops good-quality, shop-bought chocolate ice-cream 1 handful toasted pecans 1 square dark chocolate, for grating Peel the orange with a serrated knife to avoid getting any pith. Roughly chop half the orange, put in the bottom of your sundae dish or glass, and pop it in the freezer. Cut the remaining orange into slices. Put a small frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the maple syrup and wedges of orange, and cook for four to five minutes, or until the oranges are all sticky. Leave to cool slightly. Now, layer up your sundae: take the glass out of the freezer, then top the chopped orange with the ice-cream and sticky maple oranges. Finish with the toasted pecans and a grating of dark chocolate.",

Extreme mercury poisoning can cause paralysis, coma, or insanity. In a 2018 study measuring blood mercury levels in miners in eastern Cameroon, almost one in 10 (9.1%) of the miners had blood that was chronically intoxicated with mercury.<br><br>Yet Marie Louise, a mother of five in her 40s living in Longa Mali, is handling mercury freely as she stands ankle-deep in a pool of opaque mustard coloured water just metres from her front door. Her children stand in the water with her, watching her form a tiny, ladybird-sized blob to sell for $2 (\u00a31.53) for a local dealer. Silvery globules spread into the water as the children splash and rub their eyes, while Marie Louise massages the remaining mercury with her hands.<br><br>The Cameroonian mining code forbids the use of mercury for this purpose due to its toxic health effects. Gold mining companies operating here are quick to cite this. Yet, on the ground, the use of mercury is freely observed at many gold mining sites, often just a few hundred metres away from local policemen who are seen slumbering in the shade of mango trees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521b36ed7668abe1d8ffc018334f7734110844cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521b36ed7668abe1d8ffc018334f7734110844cd/0_463_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman digs for gold where locals once dug for crops.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman digs for gold where locals once dug for crops</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inna Lazareva</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mining companies also say they use pictures to illustrate the dangers of mercury use as a deterrent.<br><br>\u201cI know the dangers,\u201d Marie Louise admitted. \u201dBut it\u2019s money.

The puddle turned out to be an abandoned gold mine, with a steep drop, 18 metres deep. Samba tried to get out, his arms and legs scrambling frantically in search of something to grip on to as muddy water choked him. His father, Sah, still carries a photo of his son\u2019s lifeless body after it was recovered from the mining pit in September 2017. Between 2017 and 2019, at least 115 children and adults drowned or were buried alive by landfalls in the mostly abandoned pits in the East and Adamawa regions of Cameroon, according to Forests and Rural Development (Foder), a local watchdog that is alone in tracking the accidents and deaths. \u201cThe whole area was not at all secure,\u201d says Sah, whose fury is clear as he describes how gold mining pits in the region \u2013 which locals call \u201ctombs\u201d \u2013 have been left open and abandoned by Chinese companies, among others. Samba\u2019s tragic death was not exceptional. The recorded body count, say campaigners, is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of forgotten victims of the ruthless modern-day hunt for one of the world\u2019s most sought-after metals \u2013 gold. Cameroon has one of the richest subsoils in Africa. Since 2008, gold prices have risen and informal mining has spread widely across the continent. In recent years, more than 400 mining sites have been dug open by dozens of mining companies in Cameroon, predominantly from China, but also from South Korea, Greece, South Africa and elsewhere, according to Foder. Some British companies advertise online that they conduct gold exploration programmes in the country. Cameroonian law obliges anyone exploiting a mining site to close and restore it before departing. In practice, however, once miners finish digging up gold from pits of up to 100 metres deep, they simply move on to the next project. Few \u2013 if any \u2013 mining holes are properly restored. The scale of this is vast, says Eric Etoga, a Cameroonian activist who has been researching the extractive industries for years for Global Youth Dynamic, a local NGO. According to a study he produced in June 2019 for the Publish What You Pay campaign group, mining companies had left 248 open mining holes in in one area of east Cameroon alone. \u201cWe need sanctions \u2013 without them, people continue to do whatever they want,\u201d said Etoga. Cameroon\u2019s ministry of mines did not reply to repeated requests for comment. The Cameroonian branch of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a global body that promotes itself as setting the \u201cglobal standard to promote the open and accountable management of oil, gas and mineral resources\u201d, also failed to address the deaths in the mines, simply forwarding government reassurances that the numbers of mortalities in abandoned pits have significantly decreased over the past two years. The ministry of mines added that there are fewer deaths following its implementation of information campaigns. \u201cThe risky zones have been marked and picture-diagrams have been erected to inform locals of the dangers,\u201d wrote Aristide Mimbang of Cameroon\u2019s mining ministry, in an email forwarded by EITI Cameroon. Walking among abandoned mining holes in parts of eastern Cameroon, nothing appears further from the truth. Not a single signpost or diagram was seen in the seven sites visited by the Guardian, as unaccompanied young children walked barefoot or wearing flip-flops in the dangerous areas. Women with babies tied on their backs were seen descending into the mines with no protection or safety precautions. On paper, some British companies extracting gold in Cameroon praise the benefits of the business for local populations, claiming that it helps villagers to survive financially. On the ground, some of the youths working in gold mines confirm that the industry enables them to earn money, which they would otherwise have been unable to do in an underdeveloped region that lacks basic services, including a steady electricity supply. Yet, when it comes to the open mining pits, corporate reassurances that the holes will be filled up and restored ring hollow. The landscape of eastern Cameroon, which in the past used to provide fertile farming ground for the local population, nowadays resembles the surface of the moon, with giant holes puncturing the once green landscape. As the midday sun heated the pits, the brown, polluted waters inside reek of chemical waste, attracting clouds of buzzing mosquitoes that spread malaria, dengue fever and other killer diseases. China is Cameroon\u2019s biggest foreign investor and trading partner, operating a wide range of infrastructure projects, from constructing roads to building football stadiums. In January 2019, one of China\u2019s top diplomats, Yang Jiechi, visited the Central African nation. Yet, in eastern Cameroon, the visit prompted protests, as miners picketed outside a Chinese-run gold mining project in the village of Ngoura, blocking access. In December 2017, in the nearby village of Ngoe Ngoe, nine people were killed during a land fall in a deep mine left open by the Chinese company Lu and Lang. The pit had been abandoned by workers less than a month earlier. Chinese and other foreign companies are not the only ones responsible.

Ndoyama alleges that the mine in which his son died belonged to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise d\u2019Exploitation Mini\u00e8re (SCEM), a company owned by Ali Bachir, a prominent member of Cameroon\u2019s national assembly from the ruling party, the Cameroon People\u2019s Democratic Movement. The party is led by Cameroon\u2019s president, Paul Biya, who, aged 87, is currently Africa\u2019s second longest-ruling autocrat (after Equatorial Guinea\u2019s president Teodoro Obiang). Ndoyama said that he had tried to press SCEM officials to launch an inquiry into his son\u2019s death in the hope of getting some desperately needed compensation for the family, but received no response. \u201cThe gendarmerie came to do an investigation, but there was no follow up,\u201d he says. \u201cThe state lets people just die in the holes.\u201d In a telephone interview, Ali Bachir confirmed that he owns SCEM and that the company is still operating, but denied that his company is involved in digging mining pits. \u201cThere\u2019s not even a single hole that we\u2019ve left open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do research,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the Chinese who left the holes open \u2026 It\u2019s they who are exploiting gold in Betare Oya.\u201d Yet official ministry of mines documents obtained by the Guardian show that SCEM has conducted gold exploitation in several sites in eastern Cameroon \u2013 all without proper authorisation. According to the documents, two branches of SCEM were operating in the Betare Oya region in 2016, using five excavators, and declaring a total of 230 grams of gold a month. In April 2018, Cameroon\u2019s ministry of mines issued a notice to force companies including SCEM and Lu and Lang to shut down their operations, in some cases because of the safety hazards posed by deserted open holes. SCEM was found to have been operating without any formal authorisation or licensing, the mining minister said at the time. A total of 1,776 Cameroonians signed a petition, initiated by Foder, that called on the government to force mining companies to abide by the law and close the open pits. \u201cHonourable ministers, how many more deaths do you want in order to put an end to this?,\u201d the petitioners asked. \u201cThese irresponsible mining companies\u2026 are pillaging us and they are killing us. \u201cThese poisonous lakes, these gold pits have become tombs.\u201d As the presence of mining companies destroys farm land, pollutes water sources and poisons the local fish, instead of digging the ground for crops the locals are now digging for gold in order to survive. Processing such gold poses serious health hazards. Mercury is an essential tool in some types of gold extraction because of its ability to bind gold particles together. Yet it is also a poison \u2013 whether its fumes are inhaled, its particles are eaten through contaminated fish or water, or simply if someone touches it with their bare hands. Besides lung damage it can lead to memory loss, irritability, depression, kidney failure, tremors, numbness and discoloured, peeling or scaly skin. Extreme mercury poisoning can cause paralysis, coma, or insanity. In a 2018 study measuring blood mercury levels in miners in eastern Cameroon, almost one in 10 (9.1%) of the miners had blood that was chronically intoxicated with mercury. Yet Marie Louise, a mother of five in her 40s living in Longa Mali, is handling mercury freely as she stands ankle-deep in a pool of opaque mustard coloured water just metres from her front door. Her children stand in the water with her, watching her form a tiny, ladybird-sized blob to sell for $2 (\u00a31.53) for a local dealer. Silvery globules spread into the water as the children splash and rub their eyes, while Marie Louise massages the remaining mercury with her hands. The Cameroonian mining code forbids the use of mercury for this purpose due to its toxic health effects. Gold mining companies operating here are quick to cite this. Yet, on the ground, the use of mercury is freely observed at many gold mining sites, often just a few hundred metres away from local policemen who are seen slumbering in the shade of mango trees. Mining companies also say they use pictures to illustrate the dangers of mercury use as a deterrent. \u201cI know the dangers,\u201d Marie Louise admitted. \u201dBut it\u2019s money. Without this, how will we live?,\u201d she ssays, adding that the children also sometimes use mercury to help with gold processing. \u201cWhen we see that the belly is empty, we have to do it in order to eat,\u201d she adds, gesturing to her children. For Cameroon\u2019s young generation, the gold mining industry is not only claiming lives in accidents in unsecured pits, but also results in many students dropping out of school. One headmaster of a school in Betare Oya told the Guardian that each year, almost half of the students drop out to work in gold mines as soon as the dry season begins in December. The pattern is the same throughout the gold mining areas of eastern Cameroon. On the ground, the locals say they see few changes. In Batouri, the abandoned mining pit in which Saustem Brandon Samba drowned remains open, in the same state as when the 12-year-old fell into it, his father said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even secure,\u201d his father Sah says. \u201cNothing has been done. \u201cAnd there are more than 100 others like it nearby.\u201d \u201cThe more I research it, the more I realise that people are taking advantage from people\u2019s ignorance,\u201d says Etoga. \u201cIf it had been a population that had been sufficiently educated, who had a good level of knowledge, it wouldn\u2019t be happening. But there, many people don\u2019t know anything \u2013 especially if they spend their time in the mines instead of going to school. \u201cSome say that gold has brought us so much money, so many millions. \u201cBut if you weigh it against all that we have lost, you will see that we\u2019ve gained nothing. Nothing at all.\u201d",

The list is set in advance, runs in alphabetical order, and usually alternates between names associated with male and female gender. In 2020, Ellen, Francis, Gerda and Hugh are set to follow Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis in turn.</p>\n    <p>According to the Met Office, the decision for a storm to be named is \u201cbased on a combination of both the impact the weather may have, and the likelihood of those impacts occurring. A storm will be named when it has the potential to cause an amber or red weather warning.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The list of names is partially generated from suggestions sent in by the public - and the Met Office says it is happy for people to either <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/index\">email suggestions or submit them via social media</a>.<br></p>\n    <p>Bad luck if your name begins with a Q, U, X, Y or Z though - you\u2019ll never get a storm named after you.

      "bodyText": "The Met Office has raised the threat level of Storm Dennis, issuing a \u201cdanger to life\u201d weather warning as Britain braced itself for a second weekend of gusty weather. The 1,200 mile-wide storm is expected to cause torrential downpours, raising the risk of fast-flowing floods and transport disruption over the weekend. The country is still recovering from the flooding caused by Storm Ciara, during which a man in Micheldever, Hampshire, was killed when his car was hit by a branch and a dog walker in Liverpool died when a bough fell on him. This weekend, Storm Dennis will develop in the north Atlantic before tracking eastwards, and passing into northern Scotland on Saturday, with the country set to be blasted by winds of up to 70mph, and some areas receiving more than 100mm of rain. The Met Office issued severe amber weather warnings that flooding could cause danger to life, while power cuts are expected and transport links could be affected. The Environment Agency issued 16 flood warnings for England, where flooding is \u201cexpected\u201d, and 109 of its less serious flood alerts. The impact of Storm Dennis is likely to be \u201cat least as bad\u201d as last weekend, but it is so far impossible to say which parts of the country will be worst affected, a spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. Current forecasts are accurate to within about 20 miles, but in the UK that could mean the difference between the storm having its worst impacts in one side of the Pennines or the other, which would affect whether the east or west side of the country will see the most rainfall, the spokesperson added. Rivers are already high and the ground saturated from last weekend\u2019s storms, meaning there is less capacity to absorb more heavy rainfall. Climate breakdown is increasing the severity of storms and extreme rainfall, leading to far higher levels of flooding. The spokesperson said the UK needed to change its approach to flooding as a result, because current efforts to protect homes will be inadequate in the future. Network Rail advised passengers to expect disruption on many routes because of flooding and allow more time for their journeys. It said tracks could be flooded as the ground near some railway lines is already saturated, particularly in the north-west. Jake Kelly, Network Rail\u2019s passenger director, said: \u201cStorm Ciara dumped a month and a half of rain on us last weekend, leaving ground waterlogged and rivers swollen. \u201cWe had a lot of flooding in the north-west and a lot of it disrupted the railway, for example at Todmorden and Caldew near Carlisle.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Barr says Trump\u2019s tweets make his job \u2018impossible\u2019 With his Department of Justice under fire from the White House, the US attorney general, William Barr, told ABC on Thursday that Donald Trump\u2019s tweets about criminal cases \u2013 including that of Trump\u2019s associate Roger Stone \u2013 \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d, but insisted he would not be \u201cbullied\u201d. Matthew Miller, an Obama-era DoJ official, expressed skepticism, tweeting: \u201cBarr is telling the president that his impulsiveness is making it politically harder for him to deliver the results he wants.\u201d John Kelly. Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff has criticised the president for his firing of Alexander Vindman, the US army officer who testified in the impeachment case. Kelly took issue with several other Trump policies in a speech at Drew University. Hope Hicks. Trump\u2019s long-serving aide, who left the White House in 2018 to work at Fox News, is returning to the president\u2019s side as a White House counselor. Democrats urge chief justice to step in over \u2018abuse of power\u2019 Democrats have called on the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, to step in to protect a federal judge, who was targeted by Donald Trump after presiding over the Stone case. Meanwhile, another senior law enforcement official in Washington has quit after her oversight of Stone\u2019s prosecution prompted Trump to pull her nomination for a top job at the treasury. Critics of the president have described his continued attacks on the judiciary as an \u201cabuse of power\u201d. Head juror. Having first criticised Stone\u2019s sentencing, Trump has now claimed the jury foreperson in the case, Tomeka Hart, had \u201csignificant bias\u201d, after it emerged that she was once a Democratic candidate for Congress. Kudlow attacks China\u2019s \u2018lack of transparency\u2019 on coronavirus Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council, has said the White House is disappointed by Beijing\u2019s \u201clack of transparency\u201d over the coronavirus outbreak, as China\u2019s official statistics on cases continued to shift. On Friday, China added 121 new deaths to its overall toll \u2013 but also removed 108, which it claimed had been double-counted. Several affected Chinese cities are now under quarantine measures similar to those in Wuhan, in an effort to limit the continuing spread of the outbreak. Global spread. Three people are known to have died from the coronavirus outside mainland China: one in Hong Kong, one in the Philippines, and now one in Japan, which reported its first death on Thursday. Banker who fled Russia blames \u2018oppressive state machine\u2019 Dmitry Ananiev, the one-time billionaire owner of a Moscow bank and senator in Russia\u2019s upper chamber, was forced to flee the country in 2017 after being threatened with fraud and money-laundering charges by Russian prosecutors. Now living in exile in Cyprus, he told the Guardian that he fell foul of the \u201coppressive machine of the state\u201d, but remains reluctant to blame Vladimir Putin directly. In exile. Ananiev is one of a steady stream of exiles from Russia to Cyprus, Monaco and London. Some are long-term critics of Putin; others are former allies of the Russian president who \u201csuddenly develop an opposition voice\u201d after leaving Russia, write Luke Harding and Hugh Miles. Cheat sheet A federal court has ordered Microsoft to stop work on its cloud computing project for the Pentagon, after Amazon sued over its loss of the $10bn contract, which it was expected to win, claiming Trump\u2019s bias against the company stymied its bid. Three female high school runners in Connecticut have filed a federal lawsuit to block transgender athletes from competing in girls\u2019 sports in the state, claiming trans participation has cost them track titles and scholarship opportunities. Seattle Against Slavery, a non-profit campaign group, says it significantly disrupted the city\u2019s sex trafficking trade by drawing tens of thousands of men into online conversations with chatbots, which posed as sex workers before delivering a deterrence message. A music fan who lost a mix tape while on holiday in Spain 25 years ago was unexpectedly reunited with her cassette when she spotted it in an exhibition of pieces made from plastic marine debris by the British artist Mandy Barker. Must-reads The best exhibitions of Black History Month This year\u2019s Black History Month marks the 150th anniversary of the 15th amendment, which gave black men the right to vote. Nadja Sayej selects seven art exhibitions to see across the US in February, from a visual history of hip-hop in New York, to a consideration of stereotypes from the Jim Crow era in Los Angeles. Why the champions of civility keep losing With rightwing demagogues and extreme partisanship on the rise across the globe, calls for a return to the civil, sensible politics of the past appear to be ignored. Benjamin Moffitt examines why moderates everywhere are failing in the fight against populism. I made bombs for al-Qaida \u2013 here\u2019s why I stopped Saudi-born Aimen Dean was inspired to become an Islamic militant by the war in the former Yugoslavia and swore an oath of allegiance to Osama bin Laden. But after the 1998 bombings of two US embassies, he says: \u201cI felt we were twisting our principles past breaking point. I no longer wanted to be part of it.\u201d Why musicians dread careless airlines The Malian artist Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko says US border officials broke his \u201cimpossible to replace\u201d kora, a harp-like west African instrument, during a security check last week. As Amanda Holpuch learns, he is far from the first musician whose instrument has fallen victim to baggage handlers. Opinion Massachusetts is suing Juul for targeting its advertising at children and teenagers. The e-cigarette company\u2019s predatory tactics are even more appalling than you may have thought, says Nancy Jo Sales. The lawsuit against Juul underscores the degree to which the internet and social media have increased companies\u2019 access to underage consumers. Sport Pel\u00e9, the former Brazil striker who remains the only footballer ever to have won the World Cup three times, has dismissed his own son\u2019s claims that his ill health has made him depressed and reclusive. \u201cI am good,\u201d the 79-year-old said. \u201cI continue to accept my physical limitations in the best way possible but I intend to keep the ball rolling.\u201d A shocking video emerged earlier this month, showing the world lightweight boxing champion Gervonta Davis choking the mother of his child in public.

      "bodyText": "The oldest love affair in history is between the bee and the flower. It began more than 100m years ago, when nature devised a more efficient way than winds for plants to procreate. About 80% of plant species now use animals or insects to carry pollen grains from the male part of the plant to the female part. The plants developed flowers. Their perfumed scent, colourful displays and sweet nectar are all designed to woo pollinators. Over time, 25,000 or so species (we still don\u2019t know exactly how many) of bee have evolved globally to play Cupid to specific flowering plants and trees: their short life cycle perfectly synchronised with the blooming of the flowers. On each visit they refuel with nectar, collect pollen to feed their young and in the process become a messenger of love. But nature\u2019s great lovers are going through a rocky patch, from which they may not recover. It\u2019s in all our interests that this age-old romance endures because about one in three mouthfuls we eat depends on bee pollination, including most fruits and vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices, oil crops, as well as coffee.

Despite acknowledging that the level of sewage discharges into the River Wharfe at Ilkley \u2013 which have been admitted by Yorkshire Water \u2013 should trigger an investigation, the EA told campaigners nothing will happen for 10 years. In correspondence with campaigners from the Yorkshire town, who are trying to clean up their river, officials from the agency said any solutions to the problem of sewage discharge would not be considered and delivered until the ninth asset management period (AMP9), which would run from 2030 to 2035. Becky Malby, on behalf of the Ilkley Clean River campaign, said: \u201cThis is not the service we expect from our regulatory body. The public expectation is that now the problem has been identified and acknowledged, something will be done to address it as a matter of urgency.\u201d Campaigners in Ilkley have applied for a stretch of the river to be given bathing water status in an attempt to force action on the river being used as what activists describe as an open sewer. They are one of several groups across the country attempting to have rivers designated \u201cbathing water quality\u201d \u2013 a higher level of water cleanliness \u2013 to force the agency to take tougher action against water companies discharging untreated sewage. The chair of the EA, Emma Howard Boyd, told the Guardian this month the move to seek bathing water quality for rivers, in line with coastal waters, was a \u201cgame changer\u201d for inland water quality. Yorkshire Water released data to the Ilkley campaigner that revealed there had been 136 discharges from combined sewage overflows (CSOs) into the river, between April to December 2019, representing 77 days of sewage leaks The Environment Agency regulations state that spills of more than 60 per year should trigger an investigation into discharges from CSOs. But Ilkley campaigners who have carried out their own testing of a stretch of the River Wharfe, which is used by thousands of people each year to swim and play in, are furious that the agency is telling them to wait until at least 2030 for any investigation and remedial action to be taken. There are an estimated 15,700 combined sewage overflows where the EA permits water companies to discharge untreated sewage into rivers in extreme weather conditions but analysis shows the overflows are discharging sewage far more often than they should be, according to a report by WWF. Just 14% of rivers are rated as good under the EU water framework directive, which provides a baseline quality for the health of wildlife and habitats in inland waters. Despite the water company\u2019s admissions on sewage spills into the river, the Environment Agency told Ilkley Clean River Campaign it would not mount an investigation until data on the sewage spills had been gathered by new monitors which it is requiring water companies to fit to their combined sewage overflows. The government gave water companies a deadline of 2020 to fit monitors to the majority of CSOs. According the agency, by this March 13,000 out of 15,000 will have monitoring installed. An EA spokesperson said: \u201cThe Environment Agency will always investigate allegations of illegal sewage discharges. \u201cFor this particular case the storm sewage in question is from the Ashlands Road wastewater treatment works which receives and treats wastewater from the Ilkley area, we have carried out a number of ecological and chemical tests to assess whether the discharges had any impact on local fish and invertebrate populations, but no clear impact was found. \u201cThese investigations also confirmed they are operating within the conditions set out in their permit, and we do not consider that the works are causing a significant adverse environmental impact. \u201cLooking ahead, we will continue to work with the Ilkley Clean River Group and Yorkshire Water to monitor discharges and are currently looking at ways to reduce their frequency.\u201d",

They represent a significant share of Democratic voters, especially in states like South Carolina (nearly 60%). Despite representing this large voting bloc, polls such as <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us02102020_uyid781.pdf/\">Quinnipiac</a> continue to frame black Americans as a monolithic group, while disaggregating white people by age, political identification and education.</p> <p>I argue it is important to see the heterogeneity of black Americans. Others agree. Professor Eddie Glaude Jr said: \u201cWe have to be more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/esglaude/status/1227215546158108675\">nuanced</a> in how we talk about black voters. I would love to see the breakdown of the Q poll. Age. Class. Etc.\u201d Rolling Stone writer Jamil Smith said, \u201cI\u2019ve examined the newest Quinnipiac poll very thoroughly \u2026 and unfortunately, it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamilSmith/status/1227225740522844160\">does not break down black voters</a> by age, class, education, or even gender. Just \u2018Black.\u2019 White respondents receive more nuanced treatment in the poll.\u201d This is puzzling considering black people (84%) report being just as likely as white people to pay a lot or some attention to the 2020 election.</p> <p>Though black Americans represent only <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218#RHI225218\">13.4%</a> of the population, the more than <a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">40 million</a> of us represent a diverse array of backgrounds and political attitudes.

Second, <a href=\"http://www.censusscope.org/us/map_nhblack.html\">geography</a> matters.

There are nearly 5% more black women relative to black men, while women outnumber men by about 1.6% generally. Fourth, education matters and intersects with gender. About 25% of black women who are 25 years of age or older have a <a href=\"https://blackdemographics.com/education-2/education/\">graduate or bachelor\u2019s degree</a> (compared with only 18% of black men). There are important educational differences among cities as well. While over 30% of black Americans in some cities have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (Washington DC, Austin, Raleigh, Durham and San Francisco), other cities have black populations where less than 20% are college-educated (Milwaukee, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Charleston, St Louis and Detroit).</p> <p>These differences among black Americans manifest within and across cities. The most affluent black metropolitan areas, Washington DC and Atlanta, feature some of the highest forms of <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/city-and-metropolitan-income-inequality-data-reveal-ups-and-downs-through-2016/\">income inequality</a>. Furthermore, black people are least concentrated in the highest-growth geographies. Cities like Baltimore, Detroit and St Louis are expected to continue losing jobs. It should be no surprise that these cities were part of the Great Migration north as black people searched for better work opportunities outside of the south and fled the potential of lynching. Hampered by race riots and redlining, these cities have struggled to attract commerce. As some of the largest state employers, universities in these areas need to continue to provide opportunities for the communities they have historically neglected and used as research guinea pigs. But, all of these areas have historically black colleges that should receive the same investments as the predominantly white universities down the street.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump understands the role that social media played in the 2016 election so he isn\u2019t just signaling to whites in suburbia, he is also signaling to blacks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/black-voters-donald-trump-philadelphia-pennsylvania-2020-20200212.html\">racial composition of neighborhoods within cities</a> plays a role in the voting attitudes of black Americans.

Our votes will be on full display in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday in states with high black populations such as Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and California (particularly in Oakland and the southern part of the state). So, what are the key demographic factors that should be focused on when addressing black American voters? First, black Americans comprise many ethnicities and ancestral nationalities. Immigrants represent roughly 10% of black people in the US and a substantial percentage of Latinos identify as black. Second, geography matters. Similar to the end of slavery and Jim Crow, black people are concentrated most in the south, mid-Atlantic and select cities such as Chicago, Detroit and New York City.

      "body": "<p>Mental health nurse Nicole Richards had been renting privately for years and had always found it impossible to save anything towards buying her first home, let alone the UK <a href=\"https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/Media/Press-Releases/2020-press-releases/halifax/first-time-buyers-costs-soar-over-last-year/\" title=\"\">average first-time buyer deposit</a> of \u00a346,000. But she has now moved into a brand-new property, slashed her rent bill by more than \u00a3250 a month \u2013 with most of that money being channelled into an Isa \u2013 and will hopefully be in a position to buy her home in five years\u2019 time.</p> <p>Richards, 27, is among hundreds of key workers who have taken advantage of an innovative government-supported scheme that is expanding across the country and aims to remove the \u201cdeposit barrier\u201d that is probably the biggest obstacle to home ownership for many on low and average incomes.</p> <p>This scheme, known as rent to buy, means you pay a reduced rent on a new-build home to help you save for a deposit to buy the property. It is not new and we will probably be hearing more about it \u2013 possibly in the March budget.</p> <p>Last September, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/resi-convention-2019\" title=\"\">the then housing minister, Esther McVey, said</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look to expand rent to buy, so people can rent knowing they are going to buy, knowing they\u2019ve got a bit of breathing space. Maybe it\u2019s in five years, maybe it\u2019s in 10 years but they will get to own that property, so they can plan, knowing they have the certainty of getting a deposit and getting that house.\u201d</p> <p>Richards signed up for her home through Rentplus, which describes itself as the country\u2019s leading provider of rent-to-buy housing. It partners with housing associations and the majority of its applicants are key workers \u2013 NHS staff, teachers, firefighters, members of the armed forces \u2013 who often cannot afford to save up a deposit because their rent and essential outgoings are too high.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bef86d9a24fecf4f4591fd2703ce47b2b7bf2a85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bef86d9a24fecf4f4591fd2703ce47b2b7bf2a85/223_354_1142_685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Richards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicole Richards had been renting for years but was not able to save enough for a deposit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Richards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richards, who lives in Northampton, was scanning Rightmove for a new place to live when she saw something about new one-bedroom houses that Rentplus was offering via the local housing association Greatwell Homes. She expressed an interest and then had to go through an interview process to check she could afford the property. \u201cThen it was within a couple of weeks that I moved in,\u201d she says. That was in May 2019.</p> <p>Her rent is much cheaper: she was paying \u00a3725 a month but now it is \u00a3460. She set up an Isa and is paying in \u00a3200 a month by standing order to build up a pot of cash to go towards the deposit on the house.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d been renting for about six years and have never been able to save as much as I am now,\u201d says Richards, who works full time as a nurse in a child and adolescent mental health unit.</p> <p>Rentplus principally takes people from council waiting lists but it is not a social housing scheme \u2013 it is a commercial operation funded by long-term private investors that seeks to make a profit. However, it says this means it is able to deliver additional affordable homes on top of those that local authorities and housing associations can fund.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>London has priced itself out of what we\u2019re trying to do \u2026</p> <footer> <cite>Rentplus</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rentplus has just over 850 homes, although it has set itself a target of delivering 5,000 homes across England by the end of this year. Its properties are spread across Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and Wiltshire \u2013 and it recently announced an expansion into the north of England.</p> <p>But at present, you will not find any Rentplus homes in London \u2013 the place where the affordability problem is at its worst.</p> <p>\u201cLondon has priced itself out of what we\u2019re trying to do \u2026 we haven\u2019t ruled it out but we haven\u2019t found anything that works for us across the boroughs of London,\u201d it says.</p> <p>So how does Rentplus work? It buys newly built homes from housing developers and leases them to housing associations, which then allocate them, including to people on council waiting lists. The properties range from one-bed apartments to five-bedroom houses.</p> <p>Tenants move in and pay an affordable rent \u2013 typically 80% of the local market rent, and averaging about \u00a3575 a month \u2013 for five to 20 years on five-year renewable tenancies. Crucially, they also get security \u2013 as long as they keep paying the rent, they will not be evicted on the whim of the landlord.

      "bodyText": "Mental health nurse Nicole Richards had been renting privately for years and had always found it impossible to save anything towards buying her first home, let alone the UK average first-time buyer deposit of \u00a346,000. But she has now moved into a brand-new property, slashed her rent bill by more than \u00a3250 a month \u2013 with most of that money being channelled into an Isa \u2013 and will hopefully be in a position to buy her home in five years\u2019 time. Richards, 27, is among hundreds of key workers who have taken advantage of an innovative government-supported scheme that is expanding across the country and aims to remove the \u201cdeposit barrier\u201d that is probably the biggest obstacle to home ownership for many on low and average incomes. This scheme, known as rent to buy, means you pay a reduced rent on a new-build home to help you save for a deposit to buy the property. It is not new and we will probably be hearing more about it \u2013 possibly in the March budget. Last September, the then housing minister, Esther McVey, said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look to expand rent to buy, so people can rent knowing they are going to buy, knowing they\u2019ve got a bit of breathing space. Maybe it\u2019s in five years, maybe it\u2019s in 10 years but they will get to own that property, so they can plan, knowing they have the certainty of getting a deposit and getting that house.\u201d Richards signed up for her home through Rentplus, which describes itself as the country\u2019s leading provider of rent-to-buy housing. It partners with housing associations and the majority of its applicants are key workers \u2013 NHS staff, teachers, firefighters, members of the armed forces \u2013 who often cannot afford to save up a deposit because their rent and essential outgoings are too high. Richards, who lives in Northampton, was scanning Rightmove for a new place to live when she saw something about new one-bedroom houses that Rentplus was offering via the local housing association Greatwell Homes. She expressed an interest and then had to go through an interview process to check she could afford the property. \u201cThen it was within a couple of weeks that I moved in,\u201d she says. That was in May 2019. Her rent is much cheaper: she was paying \u00a3725 a month but now it is \u00a3460. She set up an Isa and is paying in \u00a3200 a month by standing order to build up a pot of cash to go towards the deposit on the house. \u201cI\u2019d been renting for about six years and have never been able to save as much as I am now,\u201d says Richards, who works full time as a nurse in a child and adolescent mental health unit. Rentplus principally takes people from council waiting lists but it is not a social housing scheme \u2013 it is a commercial operation funded by long-term private investors that seeks to make a profit. However, it says this means it is able to deliver additional affordable homes on top of those that local authorities and housing associations can fund. Rentplus has just over 850 homes, although it has set itself a target of delivering 5,000 homes across England by the end of this year. Its properties are spread across Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and Wiltshire \u2013 and it recently announced an expansion into the north of England. But at present, you will not find any Rentplus homes in London \u2013 the place where the affordability problem is at its worst. \u201cLondon has priced itself out of what we\u2019re trying to do \u2026 we haven\u2019t ruled it out but we haven\u2019t found anything that works for us across the boroughs of London,\u201d it says. So how does Rentplus work? It buys newly built homes from housing developers and leases them to housing associations, which then allocate them, including to people on council waiting lists. The properties range from one-bed apartments to five-bedroom houses. Tenants move in and pay an affordable rent \u2013 typically 80% of the local market rent, and averaging about \u00a3575 a month \u2013 for five to 20 years on five-year renewable tenancies. Crucially, they also get security \u2013 as long as they keep paying the rent, they will not be evicted on the whim of the landlord. This gives them time to save, clear debts, build up a strong credit history and put down roots in the community. They do not have to pay an initial fee when they move in and they also do not have to cough up for service charges or towards repairs or upkeep, as that is all covered by their rent. After fixed periods they are offered the chance to buy the home they are living in, which of course means no additional moving costs. At the point of purchase, tenants are gifted 10% of the market value of the property to put towards a deposit. Rentplus was set up about five years ago and the first tranche of tenants are on track to buy their property next year. In the past there have been issues with some banks and building societies not accepting gifted deposits from unrelated third parties, and there may be some lenders for whom this is still a problem. However, asked about this, Steve Collins, the Rentplus chief executive, says: \u201cWe provide a cash deposit direct into the solicitor\u2019s account.

He has also launched a number of tours across historically black colleges and universities, and he has over a dozen field offices in California. Buttigieg, meanwhile, does not have a single field office in California, according to his campaign website, which grossly hinders his ground game with Latino voters. His campaign has touted black support where it doesn\u2019t exist, including by falsely claiming that certain black leaders had endorsed his Douglass Plan for Black America. Further, the campaign underplayed how much the plan was buttressed by white endorsers. Buttigieg\u2019s success reveals both the abject uselessness of focusing on early states that don\u2019t reflect the Democratic party\u2019s diversity and the essential hollowness of his campaign. Like his political career, it allows him to collect accomplishments without much sense that he is particularly qualified. Malaika Jabali is a public policy attorney, writer and activist",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not easy starting a new business at the best of times. Certainly not if you left school at 13, and just four years later you\u2019re trying to learn a whole new trade to support your family. It\u2019s even tougher if your home is a shack that\u2019s sometimes knee-deep in floodwater, in a slum community in the outskirts of Barishal, in southern Bangladesh. But none of this held back 17-year-old Munia, who has started up her own sewing and tailoring business. She\u2019s one of 830 women in the Barishal area who are being supported by the British Red Cross and its counterpart, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society. With a carefully targeted mix of small cash grants and training, the It Starts With Her campaign will enable 2,500 people like Munia set up microbusinesses, bringing much needed income \u2013 and self-reliance \u2013 to families on the frontline of the climate crisis. Munia\u2019s swing machine In Munia\u2019s case, that meant 10 days of training and a donated sewing machine \u2013 and she was up and running. \u201cThe tailor taught me everything \u2013 how to measure up and cut material, and how to sew.\u201d She took to the new skills with enthusiasm, delighted to have a chance to help her mother, Shahanaj, support the family. Shahanaj has until now been the main breadwinner, preparing spices for festivals. Now Munia can chip in. \u201cI contribute about 500 taka [just under \u00a35] to the family. I\u2019m supporting my younger brother\u2019s education,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother benefits, my father benefits. They are happy, very happy.\u201d For Munia, the difference in her self-esteem is striking. From being a shy girl wrestling with the question of whether she should marry young in order to ease pressure on her family, she now\u2019s facing a future she feels she has a say in \u2013 thanks to running her own business on her terms. And the effect on her parents is particularly gratifying. \u201c[They will say:] \u2018My daughter is making a living now\u2019 \u2013 this is a proud thing to say.\u201d Shahanaj is also a Women\u2019s Squad volunteer with the local community disaster management committee \u2013 a Red Cross initiative, which helps local people improve their resilience in the face of disasters and poor sanitation, and helps women take a leading role in dealing with issues in their communities. Munia\u2019s proud of her mother\u2019s contribution: \u201cThe volunteers help a lot of people,\u201d she explains, \u201cinstalling water pumps and toilets and helping with drainage.\u201d Akriti Farmahan who works for Red Cross, including in Barishal, says: \u201cThe Women\u2019s Squads have really earned people\u2019s respect \u2013 even among the men. Considering it\u2019s a male-dominated society, that\u2019s quite something. They can see the difference [the women] have made to the whole community.\u201d Munia works at home with her mother, Shahanaj, who makes cigarettes by hand Initiated by the Red Cross, the next phase of the programme will be co-funded by the Department for International Development (DfID), under its UK Aid Match initiative.

Period. | Elizabeth Payne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI would think since it\u2019s a sales tax holiday, there\u2019s really no limit on the number of items anybody can purchase,\u201d said Joey Hensley, the Republican senator, during a debate on the bill. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you would limit the number of items someone could purchase.\u201d</p> <p>Hensely\u2019s legislative assistant <a href=\"https://americanindependent.com/tennessee-gop-tampon-ban-feminine-hygiene-products-sales-tax-holiday-republicans/\">later explained</a> that his questions were prompted by concerns \u201cthat the possibility of people purchasing large quantities had not been factored in when determining the cost of the legislation\u201d. One would not want Tennessee to be bankrupted by residents bulk-buying tampons, after all.</p> <p>Menstrual products are a necessity, not a luxury; and yet, across America and around the world, they\u2019re still largely taxed as the latter. Products such as Viagra and Rogaine, however, are not subject to sales tax in America because they\u2019re considered medically necessary. Why is this the case? As President Obama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c2Ro54Alkk\">joked back in 2016</a>, \u201cI suspect it\u2019s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.\u201d</p> <p>The annual tax revenue from menstrual products is not insignificant, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/25/564580736/more-states-move-to-end-tampon-tax-that-s-seen-as-discriminating-against-women\">around $1m in Utah to $20m in California</a>. This is money a lot of states don\u2019t want to lose; after all they might then have to make the funds up via drastic measures like taxing billionaires a little more. In 2016, Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor of California at the time, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-tampon/california-governor-vetoes-bill-to-repeal-tampon-tax-idUSKCN11J2QK\">vetoed a bipartisan bill</a> that would have exempted menstrual products from sales tax, saying it would cost the state too much in lost revenue. Brown also shot down similar bills which would have ended certain state taxes for diapers.</p> <p>Over the last few years there\u2019s been increased global activism and awareness around the so-called tampon tax, and some progress has been made. Between 2016 and 2018, five US states (Nevada, New York, Florida, Connecticut and Illinois) got rid of the tax, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/tampon-tax.html\">at least 22 states</a> introduced bills to repeal the tax last year. California also <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/sales-tax-for-tampons-diapers-eliminated-in-california-for-2-years/30463779\">suspended the tax</a> in a law that went into effect on January 1, though the exemption, which also includes diapers, expires in 2022. As it stands, a tampon tax is still in place <a href=\"https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a29490059/tampon-tax-state-guide/\">across 33 states</a>.</p> <p>In 2004, Kenya became the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/10/476741805/what-kenya-can-teach-the-u-s-about-menstrual-pads\">first country in the world</a> to end a value-added sales tax on menstrual products. Thanks to pressure from female parliamentarians, the nation has since implemented a number of progressive period policies. In 2010 it allocated almost $4m to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jul/29/kenya-schoolgirls-sanitary-pads-funding\">provide free sanitary pads</a> to schoolgirls.</p> <p>Canada, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44912742\">India</a>, Australia, Malaysia, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/21/no-luxury-book-containing-tampons-is-runaway-hit\">Germany</a> have all jettisoned the tampon tax in the past few years, following pressure from activists. The UK still has a 5% tax (down from an original 20%), but in 2015 set up a tampon tax fund and pledged that the money raised would be spent on women\u2019s charities.</p> <p>Scrapping sales tax on menstrual products and treating them like the necessities they are is an important step towards period equity. But even without sales tax, the items are still expensive and many women struggle to afford them. Last year a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-menstruation-usa/even-in-the-u-s-poor-women-often-cant-afford-tampons-pads-idUSKCN1P42TX\">survey of low-income women</a> in St Louis, Missouri, found nearly two-thirds couldn\u2019t afford menstrual hygiene products during the previous year, and one in five struggled to buy the products every month. Meanwhile, just across the border in Tennessee, we\u2019ve got Republicans worrying women might abuse the system by splurging on tax-free tampons.</p>",

The three-day event, held at the end of July, allows shoppers to buy items like computers and clothing without paying the usual 7% state sales tax. \u201cI would think since it\u2019s a sales tax holiday, there\u2019s really no limit on the number of items anybody can purchase,\u201d said Joey Hensley, the Republican senator, during a debate on the bill. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you would limit the number of items someone could purchase.\u201d Hensely\u2019s legislative assistant later explained that his questions were prompted by concerns \u201cthat the possibility of people purchasing large quantities had not been factored in when determining the cost of the legislation\u201d. One would not want Tennessee to be bankrupted by residents bulk-buying tampons, after all. Menstrual products are a necessity, not a luxury; and yet, across America and around the world, they\u2019re still largely taxed as the latter. Products such as Viagra and Rogaine, however, are not subject to sales tax in America because they\u2019re considered medically necessary. Why is this the case? As President Obama joked back in 2016, \u201cI suspect it\u2019s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.\u201d The annual tax revenue from menstrual products is not insignificant, ranging from around $1m in Utah to $20m in California. This is money a lot of states don\u2019t want to lose; after all they might then have to make the funds up via drastic measures like taxing billionaires a little more. In 2016, Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor of California at the time, vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have exempted menstrual products from sales tax, saying it would cost the state too much in lost revenue. Brown also shot down similar bills which would have ended certain state taxes for diapers. Over the last few years there\u2019s been increased global activism and awareness around the so-called tampon tax, and some progress has been made. Between 2016 and 2018, five US states (Nevada, New York, Florida, Connecticut and Illinois) got rid of the tax, and at least 22 states introduced bills to repeal the tax last year. California also suspended the tax in a law that went into effect on January 1, though the exemption, which also includes diapers, expires in 2022. As it stands, a tampon tax is still in place across 33 states. In 2004, Kenya became the first country in the world to end a value-added sales tax on menstrual products. Thanks to pressure from female parliamentarians, the nation has since implemented a number of progressive period policies. In 2010 it allocated almost $4m to provide free sanitary pads to schoolgirls. Canada, India, Australia, Malaysia, and Germany have all jettisoned the tampon tax in the past few years, following pressure from activists. The UK still has a 5% tax (down from an original 20%), but in 2015 set up a tampon tax fund and pledged that the money raised would be spent on women\u2019s charities. Scrapping sales tax on menstrual products and treating them like the necessities they are is an important step towards period equity. But even without sales tax, the items are still expensive and many women struggle to afford them. Last year a survey of low-income women in St Louis, Missouri, found nearly two-thirds couldn\u2019t afford menstrual hygiene products during the previous year, and one in five struggled to buy the products every month. Meanwhile, just across the border in Tennessee, we\u2019ve got Republicans worrying women might abuse the system by splurging on tax-free tampons.",

That crash-course led to a six-decade career in which metal became the American artist\u2019s primary material.</p> <p>As well as iron and bronze, Pepper, who has died aged 97, was the first to use Corten steel (which weathers attractively outdoors) in art, before more famous male peers such as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-donald-judd-1395839.html\" title=\"\">Donald Judd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/serra\" title=\"\">Richard Serra</a>.

      "bodyText": "In 1962, when Beverly Pepper was invited to take part in an artist residency at a metalworking factory in the Italian town of Piombino, they asked if she could weld. \u201cOf course,\u201d she lied, quickly seeking out a local handyman to teach her the basics. That crash-course led to a six-decade career in which metal became the American artist\u2019s primary material. As well as iron and bronze, Pepper, who has died aged 97, was the first to use Corten steel (which weathers attractively outdoors) in art, before more famous male peers such as Donald Judd and Richard Serra. She employed these industrial materials on a range of scales, from vast land art projects to delicate, plinth-based sculpture. Curvae, a 2012 series of steel works, each over a metre in height, is typical in how the red-brown weathered surface of the material blends with the landscape. The connection to nature is reinforced as each piece of metal curls off the ground like a dropped leaf. In the 1970s she created a series of razor-sharp geometric \u201ctabletop\u201d sculptures in polished steel, which, with titles including Pergamon and Paraclete, introduced a spiritual dimension to the work and reflected an enduring interest in ancient civilisations. \u201cMy influences are historical: Trajan\u2019s column, Cleopatra\u2019s obelisk, the Roman forum, amphitheatres in Sicily, Greece and Turkey,\u201d Pepper said in 2013. \u201cI focus on the present as projected from the past.\u201d In 1988 she undertook the design of the Parc de l\u2019Estaci\u00f3 del Nord in Barcelona, producing an undulating terrain using earth and walls of broken blue tiles that glint in the sun. This landscape, reminiscent of ancient burial grounds, was dotted with a series of human-sized steel columns. Pepper\u2019s Manhattan Sentinels, three cast-iron pillars installed in Federal Plaza, New York city, in 1993, are taller. With their bulky, more rectangular form, they bring an industrial feel to the square. She was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Irwin Stoll and Beatrice Hornstein.

They will make their last-ditch effort to persuade the seven men and five women of the jury that Weinstein is a sexual monster who preyed on innocent victims and must be found guilty on all five counts of rape and sexual assault. He denies all the charges. Friday\u2019s closing prosecution statement will be presented by Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, a lifelong New York prosecutor who cuts a strikingly low-key figure beside Rotunno. But the contrast in their styles is deceptive: the two lawyers are evenly matched in terms of their aggression, determination and formidableness. Which of them will prevail when the jury returns with its verdict, probably next week, could have far-reaching consequences in Hollywood and beyond.

The defence has amassed a wealth of emails between Weinstein and his alleged victims showing that in several cases he maintained close contact with them, even of a sexual nature. Rotunno read out an email to him from one of the main accusers months after she was allegedly raped that read: \u201cMiss you big guy.\u201d \u201cNot words you say to your rapist,\u201d the defence lawyer told the jury. Of the six women, only two are directly attached to the charges. The first, whom the Guardian is not naming because of a lack of clarity over her desire to be identified, is the source of two rape counts against Weinstein, alleging he attacked her in a New York hotel in 2013 and then at a Beverly Hills hotel the following year. Miriam Haley is connected to a single count of a criminal sex act, alleging that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in his SoHo apartment in 2006. The final two counts can only apply if either or both of the accusers\u2019 accounts lead to convictions, in which event Weinstein also faces charges of predatory sexual assault, which implies attacks on multiple women. Four other women \u2013 the Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young \u2013 were brought into the trial by prosecutors as supporting evidence. The challenge for Illuzzi-Orbon as she stands to deliver her closing statement is whether she can persuade the jury that the welter of emails and other discrepancies in the women\u2019s testimony is only to be expected when dealing with as towering and calculating a sexual predator as she alleges Weinstein is. She will stress the vast gulf in power between the alleged assailant and his victims, pointing to his connections to world leaders such as Bill Clinton, while the woman who accuses him of rape was raised by contrast on a dairy farm.

We\u2019ve seen Statoil dropping the word \u201coil\u201d with the refreshed identity of Equinor, and Dong (Danish Oil and Natural Gas) relaunched as the renewable energy company \u00d8rsted. It\u2019s hard to see Equinor as anything more than greenwash while it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aker-bp-results-equinor/aker-bp-nears-deal-with-equinor-on-north-sea-oil-gas-development-idUSKBN2050XL\" title=\"\">still drilling the Arctic</a>, but \u00d8rsted may yet become the world\u2019s first green energy supermajor, betting on the power of offshore wind to eventually see off natural gas. Shell is also keen to show off its green credentials, as anyone who has seen its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ab7edb2-3366-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5\" title=\"\">multimillion pound advertising campaign</a> can tell. It\u2019s scared, or it wouldn\u2019t bother.</p> \n<p>BP has been here before, with a \u00a3100m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jul/29/bp\" title=\"\">\u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d rebrand</a> in the early noughties. Alongside a new sunflower logo, this emphasised the company\u2019s commitment to wind, solar and biofuels alongside oil and gas, but renewables remained a small part of its portfolio. Clean energy is good for press photos, but not really central to BP\u2019s core business model. Environmentalist Jonathon Porritt originally tried to engage in its initiatives, but turned away in disgust, declaring it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/it-is-impossible-todays-big-oil-companies-adapt-climate-change-jonathon-porritt\" title=\"\">impossible</a> for today\u2019s oil majors to change at the radical speed required.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2aacca9e-f149-4b45-99ba-192c0c95a6a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sthwBnyGBbY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If BP is serious about rising to the challenge of the climate crisis, it will have to go the extra mile to convince us. It\u2019s one thing for a computer company to make bold claims on climate action (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/16/microsoft-carbon-emissions-negative-2030\" title=\"\">as Microsoft did last month</a>, announcing it would be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030), but it\u2019s another for an oil major. And yet, so far, Looney\u2019s new vision is light on specifics. Apparently we have to wait until September for the details, but it does seem clear that BP will still be selling oil and gas.</p> \n<p>BP seems to be banking on the \u201cnet\u201d in net zero doing a lot of heavy lifting. Which leaves the rather basic question: how does it plan to balance out carbon emissions produced by burning fossil fuels? Trees are great for helping us mop up some of the damage we\u2019ve already caused, and various <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-10-ways-negative-emissions-could-slow-climate-change\" title=\"\">other technological options</a> might turn out to be useful on a small scale. Capturing carbon from the air and using it to make plastic; adding iron to the ocean to speed up its ability to absorb carbon; or genetically modifying trees so they have larger, carbon-sucking roots, for example. But a lot of this is still a bit sci-fi, and none of it is ever likely to soak up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/oil-firms-barrels-markets\" title=\"\">quantities of oil and gas</a> BP plans to keep selling.</p> \n<p>Looney says he wants to help the world to get to net zero, not just BP. It is, apparently, shutting down the \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnjliRaval/status/1227635190824042498\" title=\"\">Possibilities Everywhere</a>\u201d ad campaign that showcased its (relatively small-scale) work on clean energy, instead funnelling resources into campaigns that foster \u201cthe right kind of change\u201d.</p> \n<p>This is the part of the project we should perhaps be most wary of. It\u2019s worth remembering that with the Beyond Petroleum push in the noughties, BP popularised the idea of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17wwln-safire-t.html\" title=\"\">carbon footprint</a>\u201d. The approach seemed to mean well but was effective at individualising the causes of climate crisis, pulling attention away from the sorts of large-scale change that would really challenge the fossil fuel companies.</p> \n<p>Beware oil execs in environmentalists\u2019 clothing. They may simply wish to seize the growing energy for change and steer it towards their own ends: the continued burning of fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>The most offensively disingenuous idea at the heart of this flashy new strategy is that BP finally \u201cgets\u201d the climate crisis. Oil runs off many things, and one of them is strong science. Fossil fuel companies have long known their business was dangerous and yet they chose to keep profiting off it. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/revealed-big-oil-profits-since-1990-total-nearly-2tn-bp-shell-chevron-exxon\" title=\"\">new data</a> shows quite how much they profited ($332bn in the last three decades in the case of BP). BP hasn\u2019t suddenly got a dose of the climate heebie-jeebies, it\u2019s just worried that, finally, you have.</p> \n<p>The Instagramming, tie-free Looney might reflect a new phase in the oil business, but is it still business as usual underneath? It\u2019s hard not to see the rhetorical use of the \u201cnet\u201d in net zero as a bit of smoke and mirrors, a way of making it sound as if it is taking the crisis seriously while avoiding the simple truth: we need to stop burning fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>If BP really wants us to believe that a company that made its name in oil can be part of the solution, it needs to stop drilling. It\u2019s as simple as that. Hold retirement parties for refineries and retrain workers for a zero-carbon future, and do it fast. That might actually be something worth Instagramming about.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Alice Bell is co-director at the climate change charity Possible</p>",

It\u2019s hard to see Equinor as anything more than greenwash while it\u2019s still drilling the Arctic, but \u00d8rsted may yet become the world\u2019s first green energy supermajor, betting on the power of offshore wind to eventually see off natural gas. Shell is also keen to show off its green credentials, as anyone who has seen its multimillion pound advertising campaign can tell. It\u2019s scared, or it wouldn\u2019t bother. BP has been here before, with a \u00a3100m \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d rebrand in the early noughties. Alongside a new sunflower logo, this emphasised the company\u2019s commitment to wind, solar and biofuels alongside oil and gas, but renewables remained a small part of its portfolio. Clean energy is good for press photos, but not really central to BP\u2019s core business model. Environmentalist Jonathon Porritt originally tried to engage in its initiatives, but turned away in disgust, declaring it was impossible for today\u2019s oil majors to change at the radical speed required. If BP is serious about rising to the challenge of the climate crisis, it will have to go the extra mile to convince us. It\u2019s one thing for a computer company to make bold claims on climate action (as Microsoft did last month, announcing it would be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030), but it\u2019s another for an oil major. And yet, so far, Looney\u2019s new vision is light on specifics. Apparently we have to wait until September for the details, but it does seem clear that BP will still be selling oil and gas. BP seems to be banking on the \u201cnet\u201d in net zero doing a lot of heavy lifting. Which leaves the rather basic question: how does it plan to balance out carbon emissions produced by burning fossil fuels? Trees are great for helping us mop up some of the damage we\u2019ve already caused, and various other technological options might turn out to be useful on a small scale. Capturing carbon from the air and using it to make plastic; adding iron to the ocean to speed up its ability to absorb carbon; or genetically modifying trees so they have larger, carbon-sucking roots, for example. But a lot of this is still a bit sci-fi, and none of it is ever likely to soak up the quantities of oil and gas BP plans to keep selling. Looney says he wants to help the world to get to net zero, not just BP. It is, apparently, shutting down the \u201cPossibilities Everywhere\u201d ad campaign that showcased its (relatively small-scale) work on clean energy, instead funnelling resources into campaigns that foster \u201cthe right kind of change\u201d. This is the part of the project we should perhaps be most wary of. It\u2019s worth remembering that with the Beyond Petroleum push in the noughties, BP popularised the idea of a \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d. The approach seemed to mean well but was effective at individualising the causes of climate crisis, pulling attention away from the sorts of large-scale change that would really challenge the fossil fuel companies. Beware oil execs in environmentalists\u2019 clothing. They may simply wish to seize the growing energy for change and steer it towards their own ends: the continued burning of fossil fuels. The most offensively disingenuous idea at the heart of this flashy new strategy is that BP finally \u201cgets\u201d the climate crisis. Oil runs off many things, and one of them is strong science. Fossil fuel companies have long known their business was dangerous and yet they chose to keep profiting off it. Indeed, new data shows quite how much they profited ($332bn in the last three decades in the case of BP). BP hasn\u2019t suddenly got a dose of the climate heebie-jeebies, it\u2019s just worried that, finally, you have. The Instagramming, tie-free Looney might reflect a new phase in the oil business, but is it still business as usual underneath? It\u2019s hard not to see the rhetorical use of the \u201cnet\u201d in net zero as a bit of smoke and mirrors, a way of making it sound as if it is taking the crisis seriously while avoiding the simple truth: we need to stop burning fossil fuels. If BP really wants us to believe that a company that made its name in oil can be part of the solution, it needs to stop drilling. It\u2019s as simple as that. Hold retirement parties for refineries and retrain workers for a zero-carbon future, and do it fast. That might actually be something worth Instagramming about. \u2022 Alice Bell is co-director at the climate change charity Possible",

Nagelsmann has, by common consent, added a more technical element to the pressing game developed under Rangnick and Hasenh\u00fcttl.

It turns out that is not true; he converses readily and does not dodge a topic, even if a palpable guardedness tends to underpin his responses. There is only one question that prompts a pause of several seconds. The snowballs in Aue were far from the only occurrences of hostility from opposing crowds in his half-decade with Leipzig: a severed bull\u2019s head was thrown near the pitch in a match at Dinamo Dresden in 2016 and, to give just one more recent example, Union Berlin\u2019s fans began their meeting on this season\u2019s opening day with a 15-minute silence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"edc9196eafd75d708d0f4f7ba3fea7b69ade541d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edc9196eafd75d708d0f4f7ba3fea7b69ade541d/0_74_7952_5230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emil Forsberg says: \u2018If people want to try and stand in our way, we\u2019re going to try and beat them.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emil Forsberg says: \u2018If people want to try and stand in our way, we\u2019re going to try and beat them.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Jehnichen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if attitudes have softened in some quarters, there will always be those who never accept a Red Bull-owned club in a country where the stake held by supporters remains sacrosanct.

Liverpool were previously linked with a move and perhaps they, or other Premier League clubs, might be tempted this summer given that Forsberg has found it hard to get back into Nagelsmann\u2019s starting XI since a cold laid him low during the winter break. There is every chance he will be trusted at White Hart Lane though: Forsberg scored Leipzig\u2019s first-ever Champions League goal and has been on target three times in this season\u2019s edition, including two against Benfica in an injury-time comeback. Perhaps, particularly given Spurs\u2019 mediocre form, he and his gang of upstarts should be favourites to reach the last eight. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d he protests. \u201cNot if you look at the team Tottenham have: fantastic players, a fantastic coach and a fantastic stadium. We have a chance, of course, but we will have to be at 100% and to get every decision right.\u201d The concern for Spurs, and for whose who would wish RB Leipzig away, is that they tend to do exactly that.",

To impoverish us. To assimilate us. To eliminate us,\u201d said Tait. \u201cWe know that our self-determination, our sovereignty, our very identity, is based on us having control over our lands.\u201d</p> \n<p>In November, British Columbia became the first province in Canada to pass legislation promising to uphold the United Nations declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples. But such promises seem empty in the wake of recent police actions, said Wickham.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere were tactical teams walking around with semi-automatic weapons in my territory. Industry was allowed to come and go freely. White settlers were allowed to come and go freely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you were a Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en person, you are not permitted on your own territory.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6afdb1d6-5a0a-421f-9867-ab78b1262728\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation have lived on their territories in what is now British Columbia for thousands of years.

But Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en chiefs say the authority of these groups only applies to reservations \u2013 not traditional territory where the pipeline is proposed.</p> \n<p>Unlike in much of Canada \u2013 where relationships between First Nations and the state are governed by treaties \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/03/canada-first-nation-land-rights\">few aboriginal nations in British Columbia </a>ever signed deals with colonial authorities, meaning the federal government still operates in a vacuum of authority on their lands.</p> \n<p>In 1997, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en and Gitxsan nations won a landmark case in which the supreme court ruled that their aboriginal title had not been extinguished when Canada became a country.

      "bodyText": "As armed Canadian police officers advanced through snow towards their camp, the group of Indigenous women was absorbed in a drumming ceremony to honour the spirits of missing and murdered Indigenous women across the country. Rows of red dresses hung from a fishing line slung across the road, and from pine and spruce trees in the surrounding forest \u2013 each one a memorial to the thousands of Indigenous women killed or disappeared in recent years. A pair of helicopters buzzed overhead, but on the ground, the women\u2019s voices and drums drowned out the officers as they warned them to leave or face arrest. \u201cWe remained in ceremony \u2013 even as the tactical officers surrounded us and began pick off individuals,\u201d said one of the women, Dr Karla Tait. Set amid dense evergreen forests near the bank of the Wedzin Kwah, or Morice River, the remote cabins at Unist\u2019ot\u2019en camp have become a place of healing for Indigenous youth, who take lessons on trapping and traditional medicines. But the camp in north-western British Columbia is also the last line of defence in the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation\u2019s fight against a controversial natural gas pipeline. The long-simmering conflict came to a head this week, as Canada\u2019s national police force deployed helicopters, armed officers and dogs to enforce a court injunction and clear Indigenous activists who had been blocking work crews from the route of the C$6.6bn (US$5bn) Coastal GasLink project. Twenty-eight people were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, including three Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en matriarchs \u2013 Tait, Freda Huson and Brenda Michell. \u201cI felt overwhelmed with sadness, and pain over the fact that we were being removed from our territory,\u201d said Tait, remembering the moment she was escorted past the fluttering red dresses towards a police vehicle. She made sure to touch each dress as she left. But she and the other \u201cland defenders\u201d remain defiant. Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs, who oversee 22,000 sq km of territory, have stubbornly opposed the project and remain locked in a battle with the courts, the pipeline company \u2013 and the government of Justin Trudeau. And in recent days, their fight has been taken up by other groups across the country. For more than a week, members of the Tyendinaga Mohawk have blocked freight and commuter rail traffic in Ontario, in support of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en. Elsewhere, protestors have blocked roads, barricaded access to shipping ports and occupied the offices of elected officials in a wave of dissent. Late on Thursday, Canadian National Railway, the country\u2019s largest freight operator, said it was shutting down its operations in the east of the country due to the continuing blockade, and warned of temporary layoffs. Soon after, Via Rail, which operates much of Canada\u2019s passenger rail service, said its entire service would be suspended until further notice. Climate action groups have also taken up the cause of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en, seeing their fight as part of a broader one against resource extraction projects in the country. The demonstrations have piled pressure on Canada\u2019s prime minister, who has vaunted his commitment to diversity and tackling the deep-rooted inequities facing Indigenous peoples. \u201cTrudeau has gone to the United Nations to shed tears about the history of Canada\u2019s relationship with indigenous people,\u201d said Tait. \u201cAnd on the other hand, he\u2019s essentially authorizing the use of force against our unarmed people for upholding our rights.\u201d This week, Trudeau has expressed his support for peaceful protest \u2013 but also criticised the rail blockades. Amid pleas from business leaders for a swift end to the crisis, other politicians have been even more outspoken in their condemnation. In Alberta \u2013 a province whose economy relies on oil and gas \u2013 the conservative premier, Jason Kenney, has warned that the current unrest is a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for future opposition to fossil-fuel based projects. \u201cThis is not about Indigenous people. It\u2019s not about carbon emissions. It\u2019s about a hard-left ideology that is, frankly, opposed to the entire modern industrial economy,\u201d said Kenney. \u201cIt\u2019s about time that our police services demonstrated that this is a country that respects the rule of law.\u201d And after protesters barricaded the entrance to British Columbia\u2019s legislative assembly, the province\u2019s premier, John Horgan, called the demonstrations a \u201cshift from traditional protest \u2013 to something quite different\u201d. Molly Wickham, a spokesperson for the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en who also has the hereditary name Sleydo\u2019, agreed. \u201cIndigenous people see what\u2019s happening to us and see what\u2019s happening to our territory and our pristine waters \u2013 and to our people on the ground, having semiautomatic weapons aimed at us,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are responding to that in appropriate ways.\u201d More than just a row over a pipeline, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en protests also reflect Canada\u2019s often fraught relationship with First Nations. \u201cEver since colonization, the aim has been to dispossess our people from our lands. To impoverish us. To assimilate us. To eliminate us,\u201d said Tait. \u201cWe know that our self-determination, our sovereignty, our very identity, is based on us having control over our lands.\u201d In November, British Columbia became the first province in Canada to pass legislation promising to uphold the United Nations declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples. But such promises seem empty in the wake of recent police actions, said Wickham. \u201cThere were tactical teams walking around with semi-automatic weapons in my territory. Industry was allowed to come and go freely. White settlers were allowed to come and go freely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you were a Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en person, you are not permitted on your own territory.\u201d Controversy around the Coastal GasLink project has been compounded by questions over who has the right to speak for the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en. Coastal GasLink has signed benefit agreements with the 20 elected First Nations councils along the route, including five of the six elected band councils in the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation. But Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en chiefs say the authority of these groups only applies to reservations \u2013 not traditional territory where the pipeline is proposed. Unlike in much of Canada \u2013 where relationships between First Nations and the state are governed by treaties \u2013 few aboriginal nations in British Columbia ever signed deals with colonial authorities, meaning the federal government still operates in a vacuum of authority on their lands. In 1997, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en and Gitxsan nations won a landmark case in which the supreme court ruled that their aboriginal title had not been extinguished when Canada became a country. But the case did not establish the boundaries of that title and the court suggested subsequent cases would be needed to settle the issue. \u201cAboriginal title claims of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en people have yet to be resolved either by negotiation or litigation,\u201d wrote the justice Marguerite Church in her decision to grant Coastal GasLink the injunction. \u201cWhile Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en customary laws clearly exist on their own independent footing, they are not recognized as being an effectual part of Canadian law.\u201d Legal experts believe the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en would probably have a strong case to establish title to the land in the courts, enabling them to better fight the project. But such cases can take decades to adjudicate and cost millions of dollars, a prospect Tait called \u201cinsufficient\u201d given the pipeline\u2019s imminent construction. For those on the front lines of the fight, the nationwide support is a vindication that the long-simmering frustrations over land claims and a fraught Indigenous relationship with the state are facing a long-overdue reckoning. \u201cThis is far from over,\u201d said Wickham. \u201cWe\u2019ve had day after day of invasion and we\u2019re still here. We\u2019re still not giving up.\u201d",

She is related to a famous former striker; can you identify him? The respective answers \u2013 Melanie Reay and her cousin Alan Shearer \u2013 may challenge quiz participants outside the north-east, but few who know their women\u2019s football. In the latter circles Reay is instantly recognisable as the gifted and ultra-loyal coach of a Sunderland Ladies side who were summarily demoted two divisions in 2018 when the Football Association turned a revamped Women\u2019s Super League all professional.</p> <p>Sunderland had just finished a respectable seventh but, with their parent men\u2019s club hitting financial problems prompted by two swift relegations, they failed to meet the funding criteria required for a licence to play in the WSL or even the semi-professional Championship.</p> <p>Down they dropped into the third tier, National League North, where, despite receiving no expenses, let alone match fees, Reay\u2019s players top the table and are on a 20-game unbeaten run. Birmingham of the WSL would certainly be unwise to underestimate them when they meet in the FA Cup fifth round at Eppleton in County Durham on Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/25/sunderland-ladies-football\">Sunderland Ladies given new hope in bid to return from football\u2019s margins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPromotion\u2019s our overriding objective,\u201d says Reay. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great opportunity to test ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Sunderland have submitted an application for a Championship licence to the FA and there is cautious optimism that should they finish in a promotion place, the ruling body may look favourably on it. Significantly Stewart Donald, the club\u2019s owner, has supported the Ladies, allowing them to share top-class facilities at the Academy of Light with Phil Parkinson\u2019s League One men.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Premier League-standard training ground and being able to use the indoor barn means I never need cancel sessions,\u201d says Reay, whose squad of teachers, teaching assistants, personal trainers, students and a commuter from Africa train twice weekly. \u201cThis club has a great history and we\u2019re really driven to get back where we believe we belong.

      "bodyText": "Name the coach seconded to assist Phil Neville during his first two World Cup qualifiers as England women\u2019s manager? She is related to a famous former striker; can you identify him? The respective answers \u2013 Melanie Reay and her cousin Alan Shearer \u2013 may challenge quiz participants outside the north-east, but few who know their women\u2019s football. In the latter circles Reay is instantly recognisable as the gifted and ultra-loyal coach of a Sunderland Ladies side who were summarily demoted two divisions in 2018 when the Football Association turned a revamped Women\u2019s Super League all professional. Sunderland had just finished a respectable seventh but, with their parent men\u2019s club hitting financial problems prompted by two swift relegations, they failed to meet the funding criteria required for a licence to play in the WSL or even the semi-professional Championship. Down they dropped into the third tier, National League North, where, despite receiving no expenses, let alone match fees, Reay\u2019s players top the table and are on a 20-game unbeaten run. Birmingham of the WSL would certainly be unwise to underestimate them when they meet in the FA Cup fifth round at Eppleton in County Durham on Sunday. \u201cPromotion\u2019s our overriding objective,\u201d says Reay. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great opportunity to test ourselves.\u201d Sunderland have submitted an application for a Championship licence to the FA and there is cautious optimism that should they finish in a promotion place, the ruling body may look favourably on it. Significantly Stewart Donald, the club\u2019s owner, has supported the Ladies, allowing them to share top-class facilities at the Academy of Light with Phil Parkinson\u2019s League One men. \u201cIt\u2019s a Premier League-standard training ground and being able to use the indoor barn means I never need cancel sessions,\u201d says Reay, whose squad of teachers, teaching assistants, personal trainers, students and a commuter from Africa train twice weekly. \u201cThis club has a great history and we\u2019re really driven to get back where we believe we belong. Our double relegation wasn\u2019t down to results so it hurt but we\u2019ve moved on from the bitter disappointment of what happened. We\u2019ve got over it; we\u2019re on a new journey now.\u201d For a while the Ladies were cut adrift, excluded from the Academy of Light and exiled to Newcastle, but, amid an inevitable personnel churn, two constants remained: the manager and her captain-cum-key-midfielder, Keira Ramshaw. \u201cIt was tough but we always kept our fighting spirit,\u201d says Reay. \u201cKeira loves Sunderland so much she gave up WSL contracts to stay, so, no, I never felt like quitting. Over the past 20 years this club\u2019s produced so many top players from the north-east; it\u2019s important to keep on doing that.\u201d Tellingly, seven of the 23-woman England squad at last summer\u2019s World Cup in France were former Sunderland players and six \u2013 including Steph Houghton, Lucy Bronze and Jill Scott \u2013 started the semi-final defeat by the USA. Now, though, there is no WSL team north of Manchester and the most northerly venues when England host Euro 2021 are Sheffield/Rotherham and Manchester. \u201cIt would have been nice to have had games up here,\u201d says Reay. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the facilities.\u201d Indeed, neglecting to utilise the Stadium of Light, the Riverside and St James\u2019 Park with easy access to Europe from nearby Newcastle airport seems akin to something Reay has always been happily unfamiliar with: missing a sitter. Once an utterly ruthless, positively Shearer-esque striker for Sunderland \u2013 58 goals in 82 games \u2013 and Newcastle \u2013 65 in 64 matches \u2013 she evidently has much in common with her cousin; not that they have too much chance to compare notes. \u201cI only really see Alan at family gatherings,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s so busy.\u201d Given that the 39-year-old Reay is married with a small son, combining her day job as head of Gateshead college\u2019s women\u2019s football academy with managing Sunderland does not leave much spare time. Two years ago, though, Reay could not resist an invitation to take a couple of weeks off and fill the gap between Neville\u2019s original No 2, Casey Stoney, departing for Manchester United and his current assistant, Bev Priestman, arriving from Canada. \u201cIt was an honour,\u201d says a Uefa A licence holder so highly regarded by Neville during a draw with Wales and win against Bosnia that she subsequently coached an England Under-23s side at a Nordic tournament and spent part of last summer\u2019s showpiece in France at the FA\u2019s invitation. \u201cI\u2019m open to any further offers,\u201d she says. The Lionesses\u2019 world of luxury hotels and privately chartered planes is light years from the conflicting priorities at Sunderland, where Grace McCatty, the team\u2019s defensive lynchpin, has flown in from Nairobi for Sunday\u2019s tie but misses some games because of the daunting logistics of her career as an Africa programme manager for the Prince\u2019s Trust. Reay remains as unfazed as she once was in the penalty area. \u201cYou can only ask so much of players who aren\u2019t paid,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the unbeaten run\u2019s a source of pride; we want to extend it against Birmingham.\u201d",

I\u2019ve got another 20 years, maybe.\u201d He explains his Conservative vote as self-interested, but only through lack of choice. \u201cMaybe I am being selfish and just looking out for myself,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do it, the government won\u2019t do it for us.\u201d For many boomers, protecting homes and pensions in the face of a declining welfare state is paramount. The socialist historian RH Tawney captured a wider sense of responsibility for future generations when he said of education: \u201cWhat a wise parent would wish for their children, so the state must wish for all its children.\u201d It was assumed that the fortunes of each generation would improve on the last, but also that such wealth increases would be ploughed back in taxes to support the elderly. Rolling back the welfare state during her tenure as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher proclaimed: \u201cThere is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families.\u201d Thatcher\u2019s policies drove a wrecking ball through the bonds of social collectivism across generations, replacing it with individual and familial responsibility. Decades later, exacerbated by austerity, the memory of this social contract is not easily recalled. We won\u2019t reignite intergenerational solidarity if we entrench resentment across age groups. The economic divide is real, but its systemic causes are often ignored by stories of millennials as workshy snowflakes who malign the elderly. To compound the problem, it\u2019s likely that the Conservatives will solidify their older base, which has now reached uncharted areas in the north. What might shift the dynamics is creating shared intergenerational spaces. That could be care home nurseries, such as those already running in London and Essex, or homeshare schemes for the elderly to rent out affordable rooms in exchange for a helping hand. We should harness the different struggles across generations into a force for unity, before age divisions break our politics for good. \u2022 Rachel Shabi is a journalist and author",

      "bodyText": "A nail-bomb of grief explodes in this second album by US musician Katie Gately, trauma seeming to rip open its edges. It was written while her mother was dying from a rare form of cancer; the title suggests this horror looming into her life, but also somewhere she can thread it together and tie it down. It is a stupendously big and loud record. On Allay, multitracked Holly Herndon-ish vocals wrap around a commanding lead line from Gately. \u201cI am living in a womb made of dirt and dust,\u201d she sings as boulders seem to splinter around her, the kind of percussion used in trailers for Marvel movies. The 10-minute centerpiece, Bracer, is more massive still. Majestic drum rolls, as if heralding the arrival of a satanic princess, slowly turn into an insistent beat that is thrillingly syncopated into something dancehall-adjacent; its final 80 seconds is a coronal mass-ejection of white-hot sound. The album features samples of earthquakes, shovels, shredders and screaming peacocks \u2013 an industrial-era Bosch painting turned into music. This nightmare is expertly arranged throughout, though in the second half the maximalism starts to feel like a means of papering over weak songwriting: the melodies on Tower are both undercooked and fussily overwrought, while the ones on Flow feel like an afterthought. The ambient bookends, Ritual and Rest, distinguish themselves with a subtle buzz of metallic sound haunting the bedrock of the mix but aren\u2019t enormously arresting. Gately is at her best and most distinctive when fleshing her ideas out into those big, ambitious song forms, another of which is Waltz. Ironically deploying the cutesy politesse of 3/4 time to demonstrate corrupted innocence is nothing new \u2013 think of any Tim Burton movie \u2013 but Gately\u2019s version of this technique is skin-crawling in its malevolent heft. If you\u2019re an evil confectioner whose sweet shop is hollowed out of a cursed oak tree, this is what you want to pipe out of your PA system.",

      "bodyText": "Everyone knows that couple: the one that endures no matter what life throws at them. So how do they do it? Over the last few months, we\u2019ve asked 15 couples that question \u2013 and, as Tolstoy suggested when he wrote \u201call happy families are alike\u201d, there were some common themes. Friendship is key Almost every couple said they were each other\u2019s closest friend. Chef David Swain said he\u2019d always felt that way about his partner, Sarah: \u201cI would be lost without Sarah in so many ways because I speak about everything I have on my mind to Sarah and always have. That\u2019s one of the lovely things I know we can do together, talk about anything we want to without any prejudice from the other.\u201d Some couples start as friends and then become partners; others start with lust and get to an enduring friendship. And they work hard to maintain that friendship. Toby Boon said his time with his husband, Max, is precious. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend, I would rather spend [my free time] with Max than anyone else.\u201d Yep, intimacy is important For Ron McCallum and Mary Crock, physicality is a big part of their connection. \u201cIt can help when things can get a bit rocky \u2026 and I\u2019m not meaning anything erotic, but it just can help. It\u2019s almost like the oil can smooth [things] over.\u201d Sarah Munn said the same thing: \u201cIntimacy is a real glue. I\u2019ve always thought that is an important part of real longevity. It\u2019s something that we both have kept a focus on, making sure that we keep our sexual relationship alive, and I feel lucky like that because I know plenty of people [where] that can be the thing that pulls them apart.\u201d Differences are good Hilary Bell loved the fact her husband, Philip Johnston, sees the world in a very different way. \u201cThey can open your eyes to things that you would never come across on your own ... Not just books or art or whatever, but ways of looking at things, or people that you wouldn\u2019t normally think about talking to.\u201d He agreed: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make the other person be just like you.\u201d And actually, if there are differences, there\u2019s no point in trying to change the other. James Carpenter\u2019s advice to his daughter on choosing a partner for an enduring relationship was: \u201cYou should be looking roughly at about 85% [that works]. There\u2019s going to be 15% there that you mightn\u2019t like but can you manage it? Can you live with it? Don\u2019t try and change it, it\u2019s the way that the person is.\u201d Deal with the inevitable conflict \u201cPeople say you shouldn\u2019t fight in a marriage,\u201d said Reid Froggatt of his relationship with wife Clare. \u201cI think you should fight. I think you should fight every day. Not fighting as in silly [arguments] but negotiating. Have a lot of regular little negotiations ... Then you resolve, move on. Resolve, move on. Otherwise, someone feels like they\u2019re walking on someone else.

Can Sonic become the first half-decent video game adaptation (a list that sadly does not include the fleetingly promising Detective Pikachu)? The ultra-fast blue hedgehog has plenty of scope for kid-friendly action and funnies, so the chances are pretty good.</p> <h2>Parasite (15)</h2> <p><em>(Bong Joon-ho, 2019, South Korea) 132 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEUXfv87Wpk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SEUXfv87Wpk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>They did it: Parasite brought the house down at the Oscars last weekend, winning four awards and securing a place in history as the first non-English-language film to win the top prize. So it\u2019s a virtually compulsory cinema visit now to see a masterly satire-turned-horror film that has pertinent points to make about late-stage capitalism.</p> <h2>Emma. (U)</h2> <p><em>(Autumn de Wilde, 2020, UK) 125 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsOwj0PR5Sk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qsOwj0PR5Sk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Jane Austen novel, which in the 1990s powered the careers of both Gwyneth Paltrow and Alicia Silverstone, is reinvented for another generation. Visually arch, and with more than a touch of Wes Anderson, this has Anya Taylor-Joy as the wannabe matchmaker of the title, and Beast\u2019s Johnny Flynn as the hunky Mr Knightley. Miranda Hart is also on hand as the ever-yacking Miss Bates, as is Bill Nighy as Emma\u2019s father Mr Woodhouse.</p> <h2>The Lighthouse (15)</h2> <p><em>(Robert Eggers, 2019, Can/US) 109 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyag7lR8CPA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hyag7lR8CPA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Still hanging on in there, ignoring its Oscar shutout, is this reliably berserk study of two lighthouse keepers \u2013 Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson \u2013 confined together on a New England lighthouse in the 19th century. Suffice to say, things do not go smoothly. Director Robert Eggers, best known for The Witch, throws in one rogue element after another to keep us on our toes. Filmed in black-and-white, it looks great, too.</p> <h2>Ghost (12)</h2> <p><em>(Jerry Zucker, 1990, US) 126 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uubih798tg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8uubih798tg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This blockbusting afterlife romcom, directed, unexpectedly, by Jerry Zucker, is wheeled out for Valentine\u2019s Day. The reason for its success is not hard to isolate: it zeroes in on the heartstrings with lethal accuracy in a tale of murder, grief and protection from beyond the grave.</p> <p><em>AP</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc65066ce995c4c4bc9c6ea2246438647da549ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc65066ce995c4c4bc9c6ea2246438647da549ee/0_33_3130_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1975\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conditional offer\u2026 the 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mara Palena</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The 1975</h2> <p>Matty Healy and co\u2019s delayed fourth album, Notes on a Conditional Form \u2013 originally due this month, now out in April \u2013 continues the band\u2019s refusal to be pigeonholed, veering from People\u2019s noisy emo to new single Me &amp; You Together Song\u2019s Busted-esque strumalong. Expect a few more genres to be unironically showcased at these arena shows. <br><em><a href=\"https://the1975.com/tour/\">Nottingham, Saturday 15; Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunday 16; Leeds, Monday 17; Bournemouth, Wednesday 19; London, Friday 21 February; touring to 3 March</a></em></p> <h2>Rosie Lowe</h2> <p>Fresh from touring with fellow alt-pop practitioner Shura, Devon\u2019s Rosie Lowe heads out on another jaunt in support of last May\u2019s second album, YU. While her debut album, 2016\u2019s introspective Control, was mainly recorded at 3am, its follow-up lets more light in, with highlight The Way a sun-drenched ode to falling in love. <em><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/rosielowemusic/events/?ref=page_internal\">Manchester, Saturday 15; Brighton, Tuesday 18; London, Wednesday 19; Bristol, Thursday 20 February</a></em></p> <h2>Kindness</h2> <p>Burned out by label politics, financial woes and a lack of self-confidence following 2014\u2019s Otherness album, Kindness, AKA Adam Bainbridge, focused instead on other people\u2019s projects. Collaborations with Blood Orange, Solange and Robyn eventually led them back to the studio, with last year\u2019s typically languid third album, Something Like a War, the result. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.cca-glasgow.com/programme/432-presents-kindness\">Centre for Contemporary Arts, Glasgow, Tuesday 18</a>; <a href=\"https://www.yes-manchester.com/whats-on\">Yes, Manchester, Thursday 20</a>; <a href=\"https://earthackney.co.uk/performers/kindness/\">EartH, N16, 22 February</a></em></p> <h2>Mura Masa</h2> <p>Guernsey brainbox Alex Crossan, who trades as producer and multi-instumentalist Mura Masa, takes his grunge-inspired second album Raw Youth Collage (RYC) on the road. Expect guest vocalists, controlled mayhem and the songs from his hip-hop and dance-inspired 2017 self-titled breakthrough to be heavily reworked. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.muramasa.me/\">Alexandra Palace, N22, Thursday 20; O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, 22 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Imelda May, Lisa O\u2019Neill, Radie Peat et al: Imagining Ireland</h2> <p>Imelda May\u2019s recent return to the soulful directness of her origins in blues and jazz makes her a fitting headliner for this gig\u2019s theme of Irish women \u201cspeaking up, speaking louder\u201d. Edgy yet traditional folk singers Lisa O\u2019Neill and Radie Peat and young singer-songwriter Soak also join the powerful bill. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/search?search=Imelda+May&amp;past_events=1\">Barbican Hall, EC2, Friday 21 February</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1a37826880fdacd4adde69491e0c09eda4ab032\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1a37826880fdacd4adde69491e0c09eda4ab032/0_140_6911_4147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nixon in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s Tricky\u2026 Nixon in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Camilla Winther</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Nixon in China</h2> <p>The 1987 premiere of Nixon in China, with its almost Verdian depiction of Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972, was one of the landmark moments of 20th-century music theatre. A new generation of stagings of John Adams\u2019s first opera has shed fresh light on the score. One of those, directed by John Fulljames, was first seen in Copenhagen last year and now comes to Scottish Opera, with Eric Greene as Nixon, Mark Le Brocq as Mao Tse-Tung and Julia Spors\u00e9n as Pat Nixon. Joana Carneiro conducts. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.scottishopera.org.uk/shows/nixon-in-china/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlYqirsrO5wIVEcDeCh3w5QniEAAYASAAEgJul_D_BwE\">Theatre Royal, Glasgow, Tuesday 18 to 22; Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, 27 &amp; 29 February</a></em></p> <h2>G\u00fcrzenich-Orchester K\u00f6ln</h2> <p>Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth is a familiar figure here as a guest conductor but this appearance is with the Cologne orchestra he\u2019s led as music director since 2015. Their contribution to the Beethoven anniversary celebrations is an interpretation of the famous academy concerts that Beethoven put on in Vienna in the 1800s. It includes his Emperor Concerto and extracts from orchestral pieces and piano sonatas, alongside modern works by BA Zimmermann, Helmut Lachenmann and Francesco Filidei; a specially commissioned score by Isabel Mundry binds it all together. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/129299-francois-xavier-roth-gurzenich-orchester-koln-2020\">Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Friday 21 February</a></em></p> <h2>Bath Bachfest</h2> <p>The Sixteen, recorder player Michala Petri, Florilegium and the Academy of Ancient Music headline at Bath\u2019s annual weekend of all things baroque. Harry Christophers\u2019s group sing Purcell and Domenico Scarlatti; Petri plays Bach\u2019s flute sonatas; and Florilegium mix his trio sonatas with Couperin; while there\u2019s Handel, Corelli, Torelli and a Bach cantata in the AAM\u2019s programme. <br><em><a href=\"https://bathbachfest.co.uk/\">Various venues, Thursday 20 to 22 February</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da278fc9a2c5c07fbba7b6c2a56513e2027da5b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da278fc9a2c5c07fbba7b6c2a56513e2027da5b2/283_2629_3083_1850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harland Miller\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover star\u2026 Harland Miller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ollie Hammick/White Cube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Harland Miller</h2> <p>Bookish conceptual artist Miller grew up in Yorkshire, and this home ground retrospective is full of nostalgia for his 1970s childhood here as well as the old paperback covers that inspire his art. Paintings of orange Penguin books and blue Pelican books abound. He uses their titles to explore memories of the Yorkshire landscape. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.yorkartgallery.org.uk/news-media/latest-news/\">York Art Gallery, to 31 May</a></em></p> <h2>Haley Morris-Cafiero</h2> <p>After one of her projects went viral, American artist Haley Morris-Cafiero got trolled by online thugs who commented on her appearance. So she tracked down their profile photos and dressed up as them. In her new work The Bully Pulpit she masquerades as her own trolls in crude costumes and prosthetic disguises. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.tjboulting.com/newsslideshow/2016/06/haley-morris-cafiero-featured-on-mic-com/0\">TJ Boulting, W1, to 14 March</a></em></p> <h2>Alan Davie and David Hockney</h2> <p>In the early 1960s, Hockney was a pop supernova, bringing humour and brilliance to British art. His unprecedented paintings of modern life featuring Typhoo tea, Cliff Richard and men in love had an untroubled, honest eye for a new era. This show mixes his optimistic young art with the much angrier, more troubled and introverted early paintings of Alan Davie. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.townereastbourne.org.uk/exhibition/alan-davie-and-david-hockney-early-works/\">Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne, Saturday 15 February to 31 May</a></em></p> <h2>Lines of Beauty</h2> <p>Drawing reached mind-boggling peaks of excellence in Renaissance and baroque Europe, winning recognition as an art in its own right. Rulers and aristocrats were proud to show off their albums of sketches. One of the greatest collections still in private hands belongs to the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House. This exhibition gives a taste of its wonders. Get up close to the likes of Rembrandt, Rubens and Poussin. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/museums/millennium-gallery/exhibitions/coming-soon/lines-of-beauty-master-drawings-from-chatsworth\">Millennium Gallery, Sheffield, to 25 May</a></em></p> <h2>We Will Walk</h2> <p>Anything that came to hand was useful in the fight for civil rights in the 1960s. African-American artists in the south evolved such strategies as the \u201cyard show\u201d \u2013 a temporary exhibition outside your own house created with found stuff. This exhibition juxtaposes political quilts and haunted guitars with moving photos and includes Bessie Harvey and Freeman Vines. <br><em><a href=\"https://turnercontemporary.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIudHO0uDO5wIVjMjeCh3K1gdgEAAYASAAEgJfhvD_BwE\">Turner Contemporary, Margate, to 3 May</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a4b396a360afe8da4e31fe731d3cd9f024770b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a4b396a360afe8da4e31fe731d3cd9f024770b0/0_261_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Crouch in I, Cinna (the Poet).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bard times\u2026 Tim Crouch in I, Cinna (the Poet).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A Number</h2> <p>Caryl Churchill\u2019s intense, intellectual plays can sound a bit intimidating for some, but put them on stage and they are such a thrill. Here is writing that makes the theatre buzz with mysterious energy and tension. A Number, from 2002, is about a father and son \u2013 and genetic cloning. Polly Findlay\u2019s production stars Roger Allam and Colin Morgan, who plays three versions of the same character. <br><em><a href=\"https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/a-number/\">Bridge Theatre, SE1, to 14 March</a></em></p> <h2>Back to the Future</h2> <p>Great Scott! Marty McFly and Dr Emmett Brown are going back to the future \u2013 only this time they are doing it on stage. This musical has been adapted by the film\u2019s creative team and will include new music from Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri. The show opens in Manchester ahead of a West End run. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com/\">Opera House, Manchester, Thursday 20 February to 17 May</a></em></p> <h2>The Realistic Joneses</h2> <p>Will Eno\u2019s work has always been seriously smart and decidedly quirky. The Realistic Joneses is his first mainstream hit but it is still pleasingly bizarre. Eerie, funny, truthful writing, it is about two couples and neighbours who are both called Jones. In true Beckettian style, the gang don\u2019t get up to an awful lot. But as night falls and they sit and chat, meaning builds and the atmosphere darkens. Simon Evans directs Sharon Small, Clare Foster, Corey Johnson and Jack Laskey. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/the-realistic-joneses/\">Theatre Royal: Ustinov Studio, Bath, to 7 March</a></em></p> <h2>The Upstart Crow</h2> <p>The hit BBC TV series showed that a comedy about Shakespeare could, actually, be quite fun. Now Ben Elton\u2019s show is theatre-bound and will feature David Mitchell in his West End debut, alongside Gemma Whelan, Helen Monks and Mark Heap. The play picks up after Will has just produced Measure for Measure, which didn\u2019t go down a storm. Can he pen a hit and secure his reputation? (Spoiler: yes.) <br><em><a href=\"https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/tickets/upstart-crow/\">Gielgud Theatre, W1, to 25 April</a></em></p> <h2>I, Cinna (the Poet)</h2> <p>Tim Crouch\u2019s writing is a draw in whichever medium he chooses: he co-wrote Toby Jones\u2019s TV series Don\u2019t Forget the Driver but he is also an exceptionally inventive playwright. This is his fifth play in a series about Shakespeare\u2019s minor characters. I, Cinna focuses on the poet in Julius Caesar, who is mistaken for someone else and torn to pieces by an angry mob. Will the young audience in the theatre help Cinna rewrite his story? <br><em><a href=\"https://www.unicorntheatre.com/ICinna\">Unicorn Theatre, SE1, to 29 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad2aa3977caaca88a0e35d331be204e15cdfbbf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad2aa3977caaca88a0e35d331be204e15cdfbbf0/0_303_5234_3141/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Message in a Bottle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sting in the tale\u2026 Message in a Bottle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Royal Ballet: Dances at a Gathering / The Cellist</h2> <p>One of the best storytellers in ballet, Cathy Marston gets her first main stage commission for the Royal Ballet, The Cellist \u2013 and about time, too.

Visually arch, and with more than a touch of Wes Anderson, this has Anya Taylor-Joy as the wannabe matchmaker of the title, and Beast\u2019s Johnny Flynn as the hunky Mr Knightley. Miranda Hart is also on hand as the ever-yacking Miss Bates, as is Bill Nighy as Emma\u2019s father Mr Woodhouse. The Lighthouse (15) (Robert Eggers, 2019, Can/US) 109 mins Still hanging on in there, ignoring its Oscar shutout, is this reliably berserk study of two lighthouse keepers \u2013 Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson \u2013 confined together on a New England lighthouse in the 19th century. Suffice to say, things do not go smoothly. Director Robert Eggers, best known for The Witch, throws in one rogue element after another to keep us on our toes. Filmed in black-and-white, it looks great, too. Ghost (12) (Jerry Zucker, 1990, US) 126 mins This blockbusting afterlife romcom, directed, unexpectedly, by Jerry Zucker, is wheeled out for Valentine\u2019s Day. The reason for its success is not hard to isolate: it zeroes in on the heartstrings with lethal accuracy in a tale of murder, grief and protection from beyond the grave. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz The 1975 Matty Healy and co\u2019s delayed fourth album, Notes on a Conditional Form \u2013 originally due this month, now out in April \u2013 continues the band\u2019s refusal to be pigeonholed, veering from People\u2019s noisy emo to new single Me &amp; You Together Song\u2019s Busted-esque strumalong. Expect a few more genres to be unironically showcased at these arena shows. Nottingham, Saturday 15; Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunday 16; Leeds, Monday 17; Bournemouth, Wednesday 19; London, Friday 21 February; touring to 3 March Rosie Lowe Fresh from touring with fellow alt-pop practitioner Shura, Devon\u2019s Rosie Lowe heads out on another jaunt in support of last May\u2019s second album, YU. While her debut album, 2016\u2019s introspective Control, was mainly recorded at 3am, its follow-up lets more light in, with highlight The Way a sun-drenched ode to falling in love. Manchester, Saturday 15; Brighton, Tuesday 18; London, Wednesday 19; Bristol, Thursday 20 February Kindness Burned out by label politics, financial woes and a lack of self-confidence following 2014\u2019s Otherness album, Kindness, AKA Adam Bainbridge, focused instead on other people\u2019s projects. Collaborations with Blood Orange, Solange and Robyn eventually led them back to the studio, with last year\u2019s typically languid third album, Something Like a War, the result. Centre for Contemporary Arts, Glasgow, Tuesday 18; Yes, Manchester, Thursday 20; EartH, N16, 22 February Mura Masa Guernsey brainbox Alex Crossan, who trades as producer and multi-instumentalist Mura Masa, takes his grunge-inspired second album Raw Youth Collage (RYC) on the road. Expect guest vocalists, controlled mayhem and the songs from his hip-hop and dance-inspired 2017 self-titled breakthrough to be heavily reworked. Alexandra Palace, N22, Thursday 20; O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, 22 February MC Imelda May, Lisa O\u2019Neill, Radie Peat et al: Imagining Ireland Imelda May\u2019s recent return to the soulful directness of her origins in blues and jazz makes her a fitting headliner for this gig\u2019s theme of Irish women \u201cspeaking up, speaking louder\u201d. Edgy yet traditional folk singers Lisa O\u2019Neill and Radie Peat and young singer-songwriter Soak also join the powerful bill. Barbican Hall, EC2, Friday 21 February JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Nixon in China The 1987 premiere of Nixon in China, with its almost Verdian depiction of Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972, was one of the landmark moments of 20th-century music theatre. A new generation of stagings of John Adams\u2019s first opera has shed fresh light on the score. One of those, directed by John Fulljames, was first seen in Copenhagen last year and now comes to Scottish Opera, with Eric Greene as Nixon, Mark Le Brocq as Mao Tse-Tung and Julia Spors\u00e9n as Pat Nixon. Joana Carneiro conducts. Theatre Royal, Glasgow, Tuesday 18 to 22; Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, 27 &amp; 29 February G\u00fcrzenich-Orchester K\u00f6ln Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth is a familiar figure here as a guest conductor but this appearance is with the Cologne orchestra he\u2019s led as music director since 2015. Their contribution to the Beethoven anniversary celebrations is an interpretation of the famous academy concerts that Beethoven put on in Vienna in the 1800s. It includes his Emperor Concerto and extracts from orchestral pieces and piano sonatas, alongside modern works by BA Zimmermann, Helmut Lachenmann and Francesco Filidei; a specially commissioned score by Isabel Mundry binds it all together. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Friday 21 February Bath Bachfest The Sixteen, recorder player Michala Petri, Florilegium and the Academy of Ancient Music headline at Bath\u2019s annual weekend of all things baroque. Harry Christophers\u2019s group sing Purcell and Domenico Scarlatti; Petri plays Bach\u2019s flute sonatas; and Florilegium mix his trio sonatas with Couperin; while there\u2019s Handel, Corelli, Torelli and a Bach cantata in the AAM\u2019s programme. Various venues, Thursday 20 to 22 February AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Harland Miller Bookish conceptual artist Miller grew up in Yorkshire, and this home ground retrospective is full of nostalgia for his 1970s childhood here as well as the old paperback covers that inspire his art. Paintings of orange Penguin books and blue Pelican books abound. He uses their titles to explore memories of the Yorkshire landscape. York Art Gallery, to 31 May Haley Morris-Cafiero After one of her projects went viral, American artist Haley Morris-Cafiero got trolled by online thugs who commented on her appearance. So she tracked down their profile photos and dressed up as them. In her new work The Bully Pulpit she masquerades as her own trolls in crude costumes and prosthetic disguises. TJ Boulting, W1, to 14 March Alan Davie and David Hockney In the early 1960s, Hockney was a pop supernova, bringing humour and brilliance to British art. His unprecedented paintings of modern life featuring Typhoo tea, Cliff Richard and men in love had an untroubled, honest eye for a new era. This show mixes his optimistic young art with the much angrier, more troubled and introverted early paintings of Alan Davie. Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne, Saturday 15 February to 31 May Lines of Beauty Drawing reached mind-boggling peaks of excellence in Renaissance and baroque Europe, winning recognition as an art in its own right. Rulers and aristocrats were proud to show off their albums of sketches. One of the greatest collections still in private hands belongs to the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House. This exhibition gives a taste of its wonders. Get up close to the likes of Rembrandt, Rubens and Poussin. Millennium Gallery, Sheffield, to 25 May We Will Walk Anything that came to hand was useful in the fight for civil rights in the 1960s. African-American artists in the south evolved such strategies as the \u201cyard show\u201d \u2013 a temporary exhibition outside your own house created with found stuff. This exhibition juxtaposes political quilts and haunted guitars with moving photos and includes Bessie Harvey and Freeman Vines. Turner Contemporary, Margate, to 3 May JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows A Number Caryl Churchill\u2019s intense, intellectual plays can sound a bit intimidating for some, but put them on stage and they are such a thrill. Here is writing that makes the theatre buzz with mysterious energy and tension. A Number, from 2002, is about a father and son \u2013 and genetic cloning. Polly Findlay\u2019s production stars Roger Allam and Colin Morgan, who plays three versions of the same character. Bridge Theatre, SE1, to 14 March Back to the Future Great Scott! Marty McFly and Dr Emmett Brown are going back to the future \u2013 only this time they are doing it on stage. This musical has been adapted by the film\u2019s creative team and will include new music from Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri. The show opens in Manchester ahead of a West End run. Opera House, Manchester, Thursday 20 February to 17 May The Realistic Joneses Will Eno\u2019s work has always been seriously smart and decidedly quirky. The Realistic Joneses is his first mainstream hit but it is still pleasingly bizarre. Eerie, funny, truthful writing, it is about two couples and neighbours who are both called Jones. In true Beckettian style, the gang don\u2019t get up to an awful lot. But as night falls and they sit and chat, meaning builds and the atmosphere darkens. Simon Evans directs Sharon Small, Clare Foster, Corey Johnson and Jack Laskey. Theatre Royal: Ustinov Studio, Bath, to 7 March The Upstart Crow The hit BBC TV series showed that a comedy about Shakespeare could, actually, be quite fun. Now Ben Elton\u2019s show is theatre-bound and will feature David Mitchell in his West End debut, alongside Gemma Whelan, Helen Monks and Mark Heap. The play picks up after Will has just produced Measure for Measure, which didn\u2019t go down a storm. Can he pen a hit and secure his reputation? (Spoiler: yes.) Gielgud Theatre, W1, to 25 April I, Cinna (the Poet) Tim Crouch\u2019s writing is a draw in whichever medium he chooses: he co-wrote Toby Jones\u2019s TV series Don\u2019t Forget the Driver but he is also an exceptionally inventive playwright. This is his fifth play in a series about Shakespeare\u2019s minor characters. I, Cinna focuses on the poet in Julius Caesar, who is mistaken for someone else and torn to pieces by an angry mob. Will the young audience in the theatre help Cinna rewrite his story? Unicorn Theatre, SE1, to 29 February MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Royal Ballet: Dances at a Gathering / The Cellist One of the best storytellers in ballet, Cathy Marston gets her first main stage commission for the Royal Ballet, The Cellist \u2013 and about time, too. It is a one-act work inspired by the life of cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9, and comes in a double bill with Jerome Robbins\u2019s 1969 Dances at a Gathering. Royal Opera House, WC2, Monday 17 February to 4 March Scottish Dance Theatre: Antigone, Interrupted A new solo for Sol\u00e8ne Weinachter, who was hugely impressive in Lost Dog\u2019s Juliet &amp; Romeo. SDT\u2019s artistic director Joan Clevill\u00e9 transforms Sophocles\u2019s Antigone into a tale for today, exploring the body as a tool for resistance. Perth, Sat; Edinburgh, Thursday 20 to 22 February; touring to 30 May Message in a Bottle A dance version of a jukebox musical, set to the songs of Sting. Choreographer Kate Prince (best known for feelgood hip-hop with ZooNation), turns Fields of Gold, Roxanne and the rest into the backdrop for a story about the adventures of three exiled siblings. Peacock Theatre, WC2, to 21 March LW Main composite image: (clockwise from top left), A Number; Parasite; Rosie Lowe; Sonic the Hedgehog",

      "body": "<p>Veteran producer-screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin created a comfort-food weepie classic with his gem Ghost, the story of a murdered young man who sticks around as a ghost to watch over his grieving artist girlfriend. It is now rereleased in UK cinemas for the 30-year anniversary. This is a film that for its global army of fans attained a new level of sadness when its star, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/15/patrick-swayze-obituary1\">Patrick Swayze</a>, died of pancreatic cancer in 2009 at the age of 57.</p> <p>Rubin\u2019s script is a lethally effective tragicomic fantasy.

But that choice was inspired. Zucker is a genius at spoofing certain genres in the service of deadpan gags; with Ghost he proved himself a master craftsman, knowing how to tell the story well and play it absolutely straight while also delivering the comedy where necessary.</p> <p>Swayze plays hardworking young Manhattan banker Sam and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/demi-moore\">Demi Moore</a> plays his girlfriend Molly, who specialises in ceramic pots (which gives us one of the most loved and satirised set-pieces in modern movie history: Molly sensuously shaping clay as Sam embraces her from behind and the Righteous Brothers\u2019 Unchained Melody plays on the jukebox, in the improbably vast bohemian apartment they are somehow able to afford). It all feels so weirdly innocent and romantic that there isn\u2019t even really any smuttiness in the image of the pot rising under her caress.

      "bodyText": "To executives of McClatchy, Thursday\u2019s bankruptcy of the second largest newspaper chain in the US is the fault of its pensioners, who outnumber current employees by a margin of 10 to one. To industry analysts of the troubled newspaper sector it was simple economics, the inevitable consequence of a company expanding its empire through accumulated debt at the same time its customer base was shrinking. Yet whatever the reasons for the failure of a company that publishes many of the biggest titles in American journalism, including the Miami Herald, Fort Worth Star Telegram, Charlotte Observer and its hometown Sacramento Bee, there is no doubting the cost: truth and knowledge in an era of rampant fake news and misinformation. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big loss for American democracy,\u201d said Nicholas Lemann, the dean emeritus of the Columbia school of journalism. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the super incredible home run Jeffrey Epstein story by the Miami Herald that\u2019s gone, it\u2019s the day-to-day coverage of the mayor, the governor, the major companies, you know just being there to make the people who run the place know they\u2019re being watched.\u201d Initially, at least, McClatchy insists there will be no changes or cutbacks in its 30 newsrooms across 14 states, despite net losses of $364m in the first nine months of 2019. In announcing the \u201csad milestone\u201d of its filing for Chapter 11 protection, the company founded during the California gold rush promised to emerge stronger and \u201ccommitted to essential local news and information\u201d through a beefed up digital presence, according to the chairman Kevin McClatchy. Yet some analysts predict the break-up of the company will follow, while others are certain the reorganization and elimination of McClatchy\u2019s $700m debt and astronomical pension obligations will signal new rounds of belt-tightening, barely a decade after it splashed out $4.5bn to buy the rival Knight Ridder chain. Pew Research reported last summer that newsroom employees in the US dropped 47% from 2008 to 2018, and at the Miami Herald declining print revenues and dwindling circulation saw 70 more jobs cut last month as the newspaper shuttered its printing presses to merge with a local rival. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a fan of McClatchy and that\u2019s from someone who\u2019s no fan of big-chain newspapers,\u201d said Christopher Ali, a professor in the University of Virginia\u2019s department of media studies. \u201cThey seem to have understood for years the importance of local news. \u201c[But] when a large chain says we\u2019re going to emerge from bankruptcy stronger and more digital, these are red flags. In this case digital is just a placeholder for wire or national content and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see investment going to McClatchy\u2019s centralized news production system.\u201d Newsroom employees at the Miami Herald promised an \u201cunwavering commitment to strong local journalism\u201d on Thursday in the wake of their parent company\u2019s bankruptcy and likely sale to a hedge fund, Chatham Asset Management. \u201cWhen our journalism and our livelihoods are threatened by the decisions from our corporate owners our communities suffer,\u201d One Herald Guild, the newly recognized union chapter of Herald newsroom employees, said in a tweeted statement. \u201cWe are committed to defending our newsroom\u2019s priorities regardless of ownership.\u201d Lemann, however, who examines the future of the US regional press in an article entitled Can Journalism be Saved? in the current New York Review of Books, expects the \u201csystematic decline\u201d to continue. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of how they cover or don\u2019t cover national news, it\u2019s not because of what the president says about them, it\u2019s because Google and Facebook and Craigslist have taken all their advertising away,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the future is digital.

      "body": "<p>There are moments of dark humour in Visible: Out on Television (Apple TV+), but they are buried deep. This history of mostly late 20th-century LGBTQ life, as seen through the lens of American TV, moves from the televised McCarthy hearings to the dominance of the celebratory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ryan-murphy\">Ryan Murphy</a> empire (Glee, Pose, etc). When it settles for a period on Dynasty in the 1980s, it becomes clear that it has been a long, hard journey to get to a show such as the drag ball drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/pose-ryan-murphy-transgender-actors-groundbreaking-new-show\">Pose</a>. Dynasty\u2019s Steven Carrington was gay, until he wasn\u2019t, but when he was again, his male love interests tended to meet a sticky end. \u201cMultiple male partners were killed,\u201d intones the voiceover in hilariously sombre tones.</p> <p>In 1995, a feature-length documentary called The Celluloid Closet looked at homosexuality in Hollywood and in the movies.

As a lesbian, she joined a deaf man and a man with multiple sclerosis. Grave psychiatrists spoke soberly about homosexuality as an incurable mental illness.

A later episode discusses the erasure of bisexuality by way of Carrie in Sex and the City dismissively referring to it as \u201cjust a layover on the way to Gaytown\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/25/lee-daniels-taraji-p-henson-empire\">Empire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\">The Wire</a> and Noah\u2019s Ark are analysed in terms of their portrayal of the experiences of black gay men. In one particularly moving segment of the series, Cruz reveals just how similar his own story was to that of his character in My So-Called Life. Cruz was kicked out of the house when he came out to his father, and lived between his car and friends\u2019 sofas. The show\u2019s creator, Winnie Holzman, wrote it into the show. Cruz says that, even now, he gets daily reminders of what it meant for gay teenagers to see a character like Rickie on the screen, even though My So-Called Life ended after just one season, 25 years ago.</p> <p>Visible does a convincing job of using TV to take the pulse of the American people. It is an American series, and as such it assumes a knowledge that may not exist for those who did not grow up in US households. Occasionally, it defaults to broad brushstrokes, and when it does it has the curious effect of feeling both overly long and not detailed enough. Perhaps there were too many ideas or too many people to cram into five episodes, even though some push past the hour mark. Still, it is an elegant education, and its vast library of footage makes for a smorgasbord of queer entertainment through the ages.\ufeff</p>",

In one particularly moving segment of the series, Cruz reveals just how similar his own story was to that of his character in My So-Called Life. Cruz was kicked out of the house when he came out to his father, and lived between his car and friends\u2019 sofas. The show\u2019s creator, Winnie Holzman, wrote it into the show. Cruz says that, even now, he gets daily reminders of what it meant for gay teenagers to see a character like Rickie on the screen, even though My So-Called Life ended after just one season, 25 years ago. Visible does a convincing job of using TV to take the pulse of the American people. It is an American series, and as such it assumes a knowledge that may not exist for those who did not grow up in US households. Occasionally, it defaults to broad brushstrokes, and when it does it has the curious effect of feeling both overly long and not detailed enough. Perhaps there were too many ideas or too many people to cram into five episodes, even though some push past the hour mark. Still, it is an elegant education, and its vast library of footage makes for a smorgasbord of queer entertainment through the ages.\ufeff",

      "bodyText": "A senior White House official has called on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Chinese authorities expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to limit its spread. \u201cWe are a little disappointed that we haven\u2019t been invited in and we\u2019re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council. His comments came after Chinese authorities said they had altered how they count cases, resulting in confusion amid dramatic changes to the reported figures for two days in a row, and dampening hopes that the outbreak may peak later this month. On Thursday, Hubei officials reported a large spike in cases after including those confirmed by CT scans, not just lab tests. The revision added 254 deaths to the overall Chinese toll. Then on Friday, China added 121 new deaths \u2013 but also removed 108 fatalities from the total, due to what China\u2019s National Health Commission said were \u201cduplicate statistics\u201d. In its latest update, the commission reported 121 new deaths and 5,090 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of people infected to more than 64,000 worldwide, with 63,851 of the cases in China. The death toll stands at 1,383 \u2013 with three of those deaths outside of mainland China, one in Hong Kong, one in Japan and one in the Philippines. The commission did not give further explanation of the double-counted cases on Friday. \u201cBased on the current trend in confirmed cases, this appears to be a clear indication that while the Chinese authorities are doing their best to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the fairly drastic measures they have implemented to date would appear to have been too little, too late,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney. Chinese authorities also announced that 1,716 health workers had been infected as of 11 February. Six had died. Officials on Friday, responding to questions about how those cases are counted, said that when asymptomatic patients show symptoms during quarantine they would be included as confirmed. While public health experts have greeted the change in reporting \u2013 in order to capture more cases and get more patients needed treatment \u2013 positively, others say it raises more questions about the data.

Researchers at China National Biotech, a state-owned company, said that human antibodies from survivors had helped patients who were critically ill, prompting calls for recovered patients to donate blood plasma. The next few weeks are critical for judging whether quarantine measures have worked, and as residents return to work in major cities. Officials said this year would not see a \u201cpeak\u201d in return journeys after the lunar new year holiday and that all parts of the country should \u201ccontinue protection and control measures\u201d. Containing the coronavirus in Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, is still of \u201cutmost importance\u201d in order to achieve \u201ceconomic and societal development\u201d this year, officials said.

You go to bed thinking: \u2018What can we do?\u2019 \u201cAnd then you wake up, or keep checking your phone to get an update ... the hard thing is the delay and then nothing comes.\u201d Police thanked those involved in the search, many of whom were local volunteers from the Wanaka and Makarora region. \u201cThe search was extremely challenging at times, especially in consideration of the terrain, and the work of all involved is to be commended,\u201d Kirkwood said. According to the New Zealand Mountain Safety Council, in the 10 years to June 2017 there were 57 hiker deaths, almost half of them international tourists. Last year, 600,000 international visitors went hiking in New Zealand, a 34% rise on 2014. There has been an 83% increase in related injuries over the past 10 years, with an average of 4,000 injuries a year. More than 500 search and rescue operations for lost hikers are carried out every year. Simpson\u2019s death will be referred to the coroner.",

      "body": "<p>In October last year, Meena Viswanath, a 31-year-old civil engineer from Berkeley, California, joined a small team of volunteers who were developing a Yiddish course on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/08/learning-the-duolingo-how-one-app-speaks-volumes-for-language-learning\">Duolingo, the free language learning app</a> with over 300 million users. Having grown up in the only Yiddish-speaking family in a majority English-speaking New Jersey neighborhood, the prospect of broadcasting her mother tongue to a global network of students was exciting.</p> <p>Throughout October, Viswanath and three other contributors regularly met to discuss the curriculum over a shared Slack channel. They had a target to get the course up and running towards the end of 2020, and to begin, progress was solid. But then they hit a roadblock.</p> <p>Yiddish, which combines elements of German, Hebrew, Aramaic and Slavic, is a language of many dialects corresponding to the different regions of Europe where they emerged. The differences in pronunciation and grammar between these dialects are subtle, but for a native speaker they carry meaningful information about identity, culture and religious affiliation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance\">Behemoth, bully, thief: how the English language is taking over the planet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you hear someone speaking Central European Yiddish, Viswanath explained to me, it would be a relatively safe bet that they are from a Hassidic community in Brooklyn. Whereas a speaker of Northern European Yiddish is more likely to have been taught at a secular university or school.</p> <p>So whose dialect was going to be digitally archived as <em>the</em> Yiddish dialect?</p> <p>Uncertain how to navigate this impasse, the team drafted a poll and posted it online, inviting others to vote. It triggered a community-wide debate: some felt that the Northern dialect, which closely matches the written form, was most appropriate. Others argued that Central Yiddish, which is most widely spoken, made more sense. This was further heightened by a fraught history. There were 13 million Yiddish speakers before the Holocaust; today the number hovers at around half a million. Teaching a dialect, therefore, is seen by many as a defiant homage to what was lost.</p> <p>\u201cPeople felt like this was not just a question about a dialect, but a political, socio-cultural question,\u201d Viswanath said. \u201cAnd we realized that we were going to make a lot of people angry, no matter what we picked.\u201d</p> <p>Along with Hawaiian, Scottish Gaelic and Navajo, Yiddish is one of several minority languages in development phase on the Duolingo platform. The company, which was recently valued at $700m, views the inclusion of languages with fewer speakers as part of a broader mission to become the most complete language education platform online.</p> <p>For dominant languages like English and Spanish, which are highly standardized and deeply entrenched in global culture, Duolingo\u2019s simple, game-ified approach to pedagogy \u2013 Learn Spanish in Five Minutes a Day! \u2013 makes sense. For minority languages, however, language education is often not just a matter of mastering a vocabulary and a grammar, but of immersing oneself in a culture, a history, a way of life.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Lessons on Duolingo are a collage of colorful progress bars, ticks and crosses, cartoon characters cheering you on, doling out small hits of dopamine as you click your way to linguistic mastery. This game-like approach has been at the center of the app since it launched in 2012, and proved popular from the start.</p> <p>To begin, users only had access to lessons in a handful of major European languages, but as the polyglot user base ballooned, so too did demand for greater linguistic diversity. Hiring translators was expensive, so the company invited dedicated users to participate in course creation as volunteers \u2013 crowdsourcing for language education.</p> <p>As well as adding to existing courses, contributors could recommend languages of their choosing, meaning that smaller, lesser-known languages were added early on. Irish, for example, was added in 2014 and was a huge success. The Irish language is spoken by approximately 1.8 million people worldwide; there are now 920,000 active learners on Duolingo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2e9f94b040a22954b86b56b979a83e7852dea7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2e9f94b040a22954b86b56b979a83e7852dea7e/0_140_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duolingo, a free language learning app, has over 300 million users.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duolingo, a free language learning app, has over 300 million users.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Herman/Demotix/Corbis (commissioned)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After seeing the popularity of Irish Duolingo, Ciaran I\u00f2saph MacAonghais submitted an application to create a Scottish Gaelic Duolingo course. MacAonghais, a 28-year-old Gaelic teacher in the West Highlands town of Oban, was brought up among a family of proud native speakers. As a teenager, he stopped engaging with the language and then went to Edinburgh University to study English literature. But before becoming a father at the age of 20, he found himself drawn back to the language of his childhood.</p> <p>He transferred to Celtic studies, and shortly after moved back home to teach the heritage tongue. \u201cI realized that knowing the language gives you a richer picture of the place that you\u2019re from \u2013 you suddenly see Scotland in full color,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo, when I saw the Irish Duolingo had almost a million subscribers, I thought that the same could happen for our language.\u201d</p> <p>Last June, MacAonghais got an email from Duolingo administrators inviting him to lead the course design for Scottish Gaelic. Over an intense eight-month period he and a small team wrote a curriculum and recorded more than 7,000 audio clips of people speaking the language, including the voices of MacAonghais\u2019s uncle and grandmother.</p> <p>The course launched on 30 November last year, coinciding with St Andrew\u2019s Day, and already has 186,000 active learners. \u201cTo see this many people learning Gaelic, potentially listening to my gran, that\u2019s really affirming,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Scottish Gaelic is just one endangered language among thousands. Every two weeks or so, the sole speaker of a language dies, often taking with them millennia of culture condensed in their unique lexicon and grammar.</p> <p>Of the estimated 7,000 languages spoken around the world today, linguists predict that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/feb/21/endangered-languages-research-project\">nearly half are in danger of extinction</a> by the end of this century.</p> <p>According to Conor Walsh, a product manager at Duolingo, the company sees itself as having a role to play in the preservation of endangered languages, offering a ready-made digital platform for motivated members of a linguistic community, like MacAonghais, to take the lead. \u201cWe know that to speak an endangered language is a badge of honor,\u201d Walsh told me. \u201cWe want the Duolingo courses to reflect that.\u201d</p> <p>But languages do not become endangered peacefully, and the diminution of native speakers is often embedded in histories of colonialism and suppression. For many communities who speak their tongue within a dominant culture, linguistic education is thus tied up with political resistance. And when Duolingo adds endangered languages to its platform, the company inevitably becomes entangled in this historical context.</p> <p>When the Hawaiian Duolingo course launched in 2018, for example, some native speakers felt that it was too short and basic. K\u016b Kahakalau, a renowned native Hawaiian educator, told CNN that the course was \u201ctoo baby, it\u2019s too simple\u201d.</p> <p>Given Hawaiian history, this is a serious charge. After illegally overthrowing the Hawaiian government in 1893, the US administration banned the native language from school instruction as part of the broader cultural oppression of the native populations. Generations of young people were denied access to their cultural heritage, until a community-led renaissance in the 1970s, which focused on linguistic immersion and education to re-engage with what was lost. To this day, linguistic education is seen as a vital part of a broader cultural revitalization.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We feel the weight of the responsibility \u2026 After all, this is our language. This is our people</p> <footer> <cite>Meena Viswanath</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More content has since been added to the course, which now has half a million active learners. But according to Ekela Kaniaupio-Crozier, a contributor to the Hawaiian Duolingo course and a longtime educator at Kamehameha Schools, which emphasizes Hawaiian language and culture, the original release was somewhat limited partly because the volunteers were encouraged by Duolingo administrators to have it completed for World Indigenous Day on 8 October 2018. \u201cWhen I look back we should have said no and taken more time,\u201d she told me. \u201cOur target group has always been our own community, and our intention was to teach our own.\u201d</p> <p>Another language launched on Indigenous People\u2019s Day in 2018 was Din\u00e9, which is spoken by the Navajo people. As well as being significantly shorter than other courses on the platform, there was a noticeable absence of quality sound recordings. According to one Navajo educator I spoke to, the diminished learning material made the Navajo course feel tokenistic for some.</p> <p>\u201cI know that some Navajo who heard of the Duolingo course for Navajo were unhappy stating that it is our language that the holy people, Di\u0328yi\u0328n Di\u0328ne\u0328\u2019e\u0328\u0301 [God], gave to us,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers felt it was an invitation to non-Navajo people to learn Navajo for \u2018bragging rights\u2019 and for reasons of ego.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The team at Duolingo are acutely aware of the sensitivities involved with developing a course for an endangered language, which is why they invite community members and native speakers to develop the courses. Walsh, who has studied endangered language policy at Harvard and the National University of Ireland, told me that when a complex issue arises \u2013 like which Yiddish dialect is appropriate \u2013 administrators allow community members to make a decision together, without imposing their own opinion.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not taking any political sides,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ultimately need to decide what is right.\u201d</p> <p>The volunteers that I spoke to, who are all deeply engaged in their own linguistic communities, do not see Duolingo as a catch-all solution to language education, but one tool among many that can be harnessed to revitalize broader cultural expression. \u201cDuolingo will not replace person-to-person teaching, but it can offer a way for beginners to learn and feel comfortable,\u201d Ekela Kaniaupio-Crozier said. \u201cIt might get a someone to a place where they want to reach out and engage more.\u201d</p> <p>Viswanath agrees, and is particularly optimistic about how Duolingo attracts younger students. \u201cThey seem to have figured out an addictive type of learning that appeals to a younger generation.\u201d</p> <p>She and the other volunteer Yiddish-speakers have now collected the votes, more than 4,000 in total, and are slowly coming to a decision about what dialect to proceed with. \u201cAs you can imagine, there has been a lot of back and forth between us, and we feel the weight of the responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, this is our language. This is our people.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In October last year, Meena Viswanath, a 31-year-old civil engineer from Berkeley, California, joined a small team of volunteers who were developing a Yiddish course on Duolingo, the free language learning app with over 300 million users. Having grown up in the only Yiddish-speaking family in a majority English-speaking New Jersey neighborhood, the prospect of broadcasting her mother tongue to a global network of students was exciting. Throughout October, Viswanath and three other contributors regularly met to discuss the curriculum over a shared Slack channel. They had a target to get the course up and running towards the end of 2020, and to begin, progress was solid. But then they hit a roadblock. Yiddish, which combines elements of German, Hebrew, Aramaic and Slavic, is a language of many dialects corresponding to the different regions of Europe where they emerged. The differences in pronunciation and grammar between these dialects are subtle, but for a native speaker they carry meaningful information about identity, culture and religious affiliation. If you hear someone speaking Central European Yiddish, Viswanath explained to me, it would be a relatively safe bet that they are from a Hassidic community in Brooklyn. Whereas a speaker of Northern European Yiddish is more likely to have been taught at a secular university or school. So whose dialect was going to be digitally archived as the Yiddish dialect? Uncertain how to navigate this impasse, the team drafted a poll and posted it online, inviting others to vote. It triggered a community-wide debate: some felt that the Northern dialect, which closely matches the written form, was most appropriate. Others argued that Central Yiddish, which is most widely spoken, made more sense. This was further heightened by a fraught history. There were 13 million Yiddish speakers before the Holocaust; today the number hovers at around half a million. Teaching a dialect, therefore, is seen by many as a defiant homage to what was lost. \u201cPeople felt like this was not just a question about a dialect, but a political, socio-cultural question,\u201d Viswanath said. \u201cAnd we realized that we were going to make a lot of people angry, no matter what we picked.\u201d Along with Hawaiian, Scottish Gaelic and Navajo, Yiddish is one of several minority languages in development phase on the Duolingo platform. The company, which was recently valued at $700m, views the inclusion of languages with fewer speakers as part of a broader mission to become the most complete language education platform online. For dominant languages like English and Spanish, which are highly standardized and deeply entrenched in global culture, Duolingo\u2019s simple, game-ified approach to pedagogy \u2013 Learn Spanish in Five Minutes a Day! \u2013 makes sense. For minority languages, however, language education is often not just a matter of mastering a vocabulary and a grammar, but of immersing oneself in a culture, a history, a way of life. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Lessons on Duolingo are a collage of colorful progress bars, ticks and crosses, cartoon characters cheering you on, doling out small hits of dopamine as you click your way to linguistic mastery. This game-like approach has been at the center of the app since it launched in 2012, and proved popular from the start. To begin, users only had access to lessons in a handful of major European languages, but as the polyglot user base ballooned, so too did demand for greater linguistic diversity. Hiring translators was expensive, so the company invited dedicated users to participate in course creation as volunteers \u2013 crowdsourcing for language education. As well as adding to existing courses, contributors could recommend languages of their choosing, meaning that smaller, lesser-known languages were added early on. Irish, for example, was added in 2014 and was a huge success. The Irish language is spoken by approximately 1.8 million people worldwide; there are now 920,000 active learners on Duolingo. After seeing the popularity of Irish Duolingo, Ciaran I\u00f2saph MacAonghais submitted an application to create a Scottish Gaelic Duolingo course. MacAonghais, a 28-year-old Gaelic teacher in the West Highlands town of Oban, was brought up among a family of proud native speakers. As a teenager, he stopped engaging with the language and then went to Edinburgh University to study English literature. But before becoming a father at the age of 20, he found himself drawn back to the language of his childhood. He transferred to Celtic studies, and shortly after moved back home to teach the heritage tongue. \u201cI realized that knowing the language gives you a richer picture of the place that you\u2019re from \u2013 you suddenly see Scotland in full color,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo, when I saw the Irish Duolingo had almost a million subscribers, I thought that the same could happen for our language.\u201d Last June, MacAonghais got an email from Duolingo administrators inviting him to lead the course design for Scottish Gaelic. Over an intense eight-month period he and a small team wrote a curriculum and recorded more than 7,000 audio clips of people speaking the language, including the voices of MacAonghais\u2019s uncle and grandmother. The course launched on 30 November last year, coinciding with St Andrew\u2019s Day, and already has 186,000 active learners. \u201cTo see this many people learning Gaelic, potentially listening to my gran, that\u2019s really affirming,\u201d he said. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Scottish Gaelic is just one endangered language among thousands. Every two weeks or so, the sole speaker of a language dies, often taking with them millennia of culture condensed in their unique lexicon and grammar. Of the estimated 7,000 languages spoken around the world today, linguists predict that nearly half are in danger of extinction by the end of this century. According to Conor Walsh, a product manager at Duolingo, the company sees itself as having a role to play in the preservation of endangered languages, offering a ready-made digital platform for motivated members of a linguistic community, like MacAonghais, to take the lead. \u201cWe know that to speak an endangered language is a badge of honor,\u201d Walsh told me. \u201cWe want the Duolingo courses to reflect that.\u201d But languages do not become endangered peacefully, and the diminution of native speakers is often embedded in histories of colonialism and suppression. For many communities who speak their tongue within a dominant culture, linguistic education is thus tied up with political resistance. And when Duolingo adds endangered languages to its platform, the company inevitably becomes entangled in this historical context. When the Hawaiian Duolingo course launched in 2018, for example, some native speakers felt that it was too short and basic. K\u016b Kahakalau, a renowned native Hawaiian educator, told CNN that the course was \u201ctoo baby, it\u2019s too simple\u201d. Given Hawaiian history, this is a serious charge. After illegally overthrowing the Hawaiian government in 1893, the US administration banned the native language from school instruction as part of the broader cultural oppression of the native populations. Generations of young people were denied access to their cultural heritage, until a community-led renaissance in the 1970s, which focused on linguistic immersion and education to re-engage with what was lost. To this day, linguistic education is seen as a vital part of a broader cultural revitalization. More content has since been added to the course, which now has half a million active learners. But according to Ekela Kaniaupio-Crozier, a contributor to the Hawaiian Duolingo course and a longtime educator at Kamehameha Schools, which emphasizes Hawaiian language and culture, the original release was somewhat limited partly because the volunteers were encouraged by Duolingo administrators to have it completed for World Indigenous Day on 8 October 2018. \u201cWhen I look back we should have said no and taken more time,\u201d she told me. \u201cOur target group has always been our own community, and our intention was to teach our own.\u201d Another language launched on Indigenous People\u2019s Day in 2018 was Din\u00e9, which is spoken by the Navajo people. As well as being significantly shorter than other courses on the platform, there was a noticeable absence of quality sound recordings. According to one Navajo educator I spoke to, the diminished learning material made the Navajo course feel tokenistic for some. \u201cI know that some Navajo who heard of the Duolingo course for Navajo were unhappy stating that it is our language that the holy people, Di\u0328yi\u0328n Di\u0328ne\u0328\u2019e\u0328\u0301 [God], gave to us,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers felt it was an invitation to non-Navajo people to learn Navajo for \u2018bragging rights\u2019 and for reasons of ego.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The team at Duolingo are acutely aware of the sensitivities involved with developing a course for an endangered language, which is why they invite community members and native speakers to develop the courses. Walsh, who has studied endangered language policy at Harvard and the National University of Ireland, told me that when a complex issue arises \u2013 like which Yiddish dialect is appropriate \u2013 administrators allow community members to make a decision together, without imposing their own opinion. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any political sides,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ultimately need to decide what is right.\u201d The volunteers that I spoke to, who are all deeply engaged in their own linguistic communities, do not see Duolingo as a catch-all solution to language education, but one tool among many that can be harnessed to revitalize broader cultural expression. \u201cDuolingo will not replace person-to-person teaching, but it can offer a way for beginners to learn and feel comfortable,\u201d Ekela Kaniaupio-Crozier said. \u201cIt might get a someone to a place where they want to reach out and engage more.\u201d Viswanath agrees, and is particularly optimistic about how Duolingo attracts younger students. \u201cThey seem to have figured out an addictive type of learning that appeals to a younger generation.\u201d She and the other volunteer Yiddish-speakers have now collected the votes, more than 4,000 in total, and are slowly coming to a decision about what dialect to proceed with. \u201cAs you can imagine, there has been a lot of back and forth between us, and we feel the weight of the responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, this is our language. This is our people.\u201d",

He came up the hard way from abject poverty in west Baltimore, learned to box under the trainer who inspired the Cutty character in The Wire and excelled to become the sport\u2019s second-youngest world champion at just 22 years old. He is the type of homegrown property with a compelling backstory and crowd-pleasing style that makes US television executives salivate. Under Armour saw enough in Davis to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tt5_76QfD8\">sign him to a sponsorship deal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/93399257-132.html\">plaster billboards with his image</a>, a rare mainstream breakthrough in a sport that\u2019s increasingly been ignored by major brands.

This is not about boxers being violent. Or athletes who participate in violent sports being violent. Or even that sportspeople from distressed backgrounds are violent.</p> <p><em>Men </em>are violent. White and black, rich and poor. Impunity for violence against women is as universal an issue as issues get. And everyone must call it out when they see it because the longer we keep looking the other way, the more it\u2019s bound to keep happening.

On some level, putting aside the normalization of the abuse of women in our society, it fits into the framework of how the broader public understands a sport like boxing. Violence begets violence, it\u2019s thought. But that, too, is a fallacy.</p> <p>The problem is inherent in the sport\u2019s decentralized power structure. Boxers are independent contractors and the absence of a central governing body means any form of discipline would have to come from the networks and the promoters, who have a direct financial stake in a fighter\u2019s public profile and ability to generate revenue. Any of the individual athletic commissions which sanction the sport on a state-by-state basis could put their foot down and deny a fighter the license required to fight in their boundaries, but <a href=\"https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/2002/03-20/0029_boxing__memphis_emerges_as_favori.html\">there will always be another state</a> waiting with open arms to deliver a big-ticket event, and the economic impact it brings, to their backyard. Same goes for the networks, in this case Showtime, which has made no small investment in broadcasting Davis\u2019s past seven fights either on premium cable or on pay-per-view. They have declined to comment on the matter but their position doesn\u2019t require any extraordinary insight to divine. They are a publicly traded company answerable to their shareholders, fully aware their rivals in a space where market share is a zero-sum game would be falling over themselves to sign Davis if they dropped him. They want to be responsible, but they also want to remain in business.</p> <p>Truth is, the same power brokers who dress boxing up as the biggest sport in the world for a couple of nights a year are more than content to have it spend the rest of the calendar in the shadows, where incidents like these barely make the news and can be marginalized during the next money-spinning promotion. So once the commission has passed off the responsibility to the network, and the network has passed it off to the consumer, the entire operation is dependent on the public\u2019s indifference when it comes to violence against women.</p> <p>There is simply no existing incentive to take a strong disciplinary stand when time and again it\u2019s been proven that any stigma resultant from instances of gender-based violence does nothing to compromise a fighter\u2019s market value. In fact, many boxers have been rewarded in the <em>immediate</em> aftermath, essentially profiting off their notoriety. Mike Tyson\u2019s first fight back after serving a three-year prison sentence on a rape conviction, despite being a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zWXWKm9kOQ\">glorified exhibition</a>, remains <a href=\"http://boxing.nv.gov/results/Top_Boxing_Gates/\">one of the highest-grossing events</a> in the sport\u2019s history. And Floyd Mayweather Jr, who mentored Davis for years, was handed a quarter-<em>billion</em> dollar contract from Showtime and CBS only months after serving a 60-day sentence in a Nevada county jail for a domestic abuse conviction in 2013. Maddeningly, to promote his first fight under the record-smashing deal, Showtime infamously televised an <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/67594626\">hour-long infomercial</a>, produced by Mayweather, which reframed his incarceration as an obstacle to be overcome on the comeback trail.</p> <p>Boxers, contrary to the public perception, are not more prone to violence outside the ring than anyone else. Putting aside the many studies that show athletes in violent sports <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/\">commit gender-based violence at a lower rate than the general population</a> (since rates are unreliable and essentially meaningless due to underreporting); anecdotally, any boxing lifer will tell you the sport does far more to drill violence <em>out</em> of adolescents who come from at-risk circumstances than it\u2019s done to exacerbate aggressive tendencies, teaching its practitioners to control and channel extreme impulses toward productive ends.</p> <p>Which is to say I am pretty sure what happened that night in Coral Gables has nothing to do with Gervonta Davis being a boxer. But until the machine which profits from him can find a way to place <em>something</em> between Davis and the next big payday besides an Instagram mea culpa, there\u2019s no incentive for him to assume responsibility for his behavior and the cycle is bound to repeat itself. The only question is whether anyone with a seat at the table will care. No one but Davis himself can be directly blamed for what happened in that gym, just as no single party is entirely responsible for an industry\u2019s inability to hold abusers to account. But as is clear in those 14 seconds, the failure of the whole collective is impossible to deny.</p>",

Putting aside the many studies that show athletes in violent sports commit gender-based violence at a lower rate than the general population (since rates are unreliable and essentially meaningless due to underreporting); anecdotally, any boxing lifer will tell you the sport does far more to drill violence out of adolescents who come from at-risk circumstances than it\u2019s done to exacerbate aggressive tendencies, teaching its practitioners to control and channel extreme impulses toward productive ends. Which is to say I am pretty sure what happened that night in Coral Gables has nothing to do with Gervonta Davis being a boxer. But until the machine which profits from him can find a way to place something between Davis and the next big payday besides an Instagram mea culpa, there\u2019s no incentive for him to assume responsibility for his behavior and the cycle is bound to repeat itself. The only question is whether anyone with a seat at the table will care. No one but Davis himself can be directly blamed for what happened in that gym, just as no single party is entirely responsible for an industry\u2019s inability to hold abusers to account. But as is clear in those 14 seconds, the failure of the whole collective is impossible to deny.",

I am in a small town outside Toulouse in south-western France to meet Pone, a beatmaker who helped shape the sound of French hip-hop in the 1990s. As part of Marseille\u2019s seminal group <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonky_Family\" title=\"\">Fonky Family</a>, he produced hits such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjqs8L6PGiE\" title=\"\">Art De Rue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhnmbCW93yw\" title=\"\">Sans R\u00e9mission</a> and the hair-raising <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JycjRQHXTuo\" title=\"\">Myst\u00e8re et Suspense</a>, as well as 113\u2019s hypnotic single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5WPa4uoY-U\" title=\"\">Hold Up</a>.

But his mind, trapped inside his unresponsive body, functions as it always used to: bursting with ideas. His situation evokes that of Jean Dominique-Bauby, the fashion editor who lived with locked-in syndrome following a major stroke and wrote the memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/30/diving-bell-butterfly-florence-bensadoun\" title=\"\">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a> using technology controlled by the movements of his eyes.</p> <p>Pone\u2019s survivor spirit doesn\u2019t do self-pity.

The news dropped like a bomb in his family life: nothing could prepare them for the rapidity with which he would become tetraplegic. The worst part was becoming mute.

In her late 50s, with her own children grown up and gone from home, she assembles and studies memories of her lost mother.</p> <p>After the superbly expansive major chord of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/19/green-road-anne-enright-nick-lezard-paperback\" title=\"\"><em>The Green Road</em></a>, with its large Irish family pulled back by centripetal force to the Lear-like matriarch\u2019s kitchen kingdom, <em>Actress</em> feels a more meditative, elusive, exploratory book.

Katherine O\u2019Dell\u2019s defining film role was as a nursing sister in a field hospital, with a soldier dying in her lap. She did versions of penitence modelled on Grace Kelly and \u2013 consummate professional \u2013 she could cry out of one eye or two.

Rather than the strong arcs of loss and resolution in a Hollywood plot, <em>Actress</em> makes room for siftings and digressions. Norah is a reluctant if expansive narrator, pushing herself to consider intractable things. She is already the author of five novels, in which, she says, there is not much sex or violence: people \u201cjust realise things and feel a little sad\u201d.

O\u2019Dell needs the crowd in the stalls to be with her when she acts, and reaches out for the reassurance of her watching daughter. Norah, too, needs someone to be there.

Speaking on the first anniversary of the movement in the UK, Craig Bennett said it was grassroots activism, not centralised politics, that was leading to change. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a new kind of informed and exciting activism,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cWhat excites me most is seeing the awakening of communities. To see the school strikes \u2013 to see the next generation of activists coming through \u2013 could not be more exciting for the movement long term. \u201cTo have a whole generation coming through going on these demonstrations, where is that going to take us? What is going to happen in 10 years\u2019 time when they start being in employment? Are they suddenly going to turn off the activism? I don\u2019t think so, and that is what is really hopeful for the environmental movement.\u201d Bennett is leaving the environmental charity after 18 years, the last five as head of the organisation. In that time, the group has shifted its focus from the past tactics of lobbying Westminster politicians to the creation and development of a grassroots base of activists. In the last 18 months 150 new community action groups have been created by the movement, while supporters of the environmental charity have more than doubled from about 160,000 to more than 400,000. The move to tap into and amplify community frustrations at the failure to do enough to tackle climate breakdown has coincided with the growth of the school strikes movement and the appearance of Extinction Rebellion. \u201cWe have got to use the politics on the ground rather than rely on centralised institutions and politicians to do it for us,\u201d he said. Bennett \u2013 who will take over as head of the Wildlife Trust in April \u2013 believes the explosion of activism has been caused partly by the deep frustration of ordinary people that we are not making fast enough progress to tackle climate change, combined with growing evidence from scientists that the world has an ever decreasing amount of time to make change. \u201cThere is something that is unique about these issues,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cThe longer we take to achieve the change, the worse the prize of the outcome.

      "body": "<p>Not badly done, Emma. Novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/eleanor-catton\">Eleanor Catton</a> has scripted this amiable, genial and interestingly unassuming new adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten\">Jane Austen</a>\u2019s Regency classic, the great prototype romantic comedy, though it may be truer to call it a marriage comedy or marrcom. Music video specialist <a href=\"http://www.autumndewilde.com/\">Autumn de Wilde</a> makes her feature directing debut, with cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt often confecting a buttery sunlight in which to shoot. De Wilde and Catton are pretty content to let the story itself do the work, getting the big moments, letting the subtleties go, but showcasing a very watchable lead turn from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/09/anya-taylor-joy-thoroughbreds-interview\">Anya Taylor-Joy</a> whose eerily unblinking gaze has something calculating and predatory.</p> <p>This movie does take a bit of time to settle down, with a frantically intrusive musical soundtrack at the very beginning, chirruping away under the action to make sure we understand how sprightly and amusing things are supposed to be. There is also what I can only describe as some startling buttock action. Dishy Mr Knightley is briefly glimpsed stark naked from the, ahem, rear. And Emma herself, standing alone with her back to the chimneypiece on a winter\u2019s day, bizarrely hoists her skirts to get the full benefit of a roaring open fire, without obviously troubling herself to ascertain that the servants are not nearby. But these indiscretions happen at the very beginning, after which the movie keeps its full period costume sedately in place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b5cfc7999831930803d325f5c98830f34e38cd3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5cfc7999831930803d325f5c98830f34e38cd3f/0_806_4448_2109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pernickety \u2026 Bill Nighy, left, as Mr Woodhouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"474\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pernickety \u2026 Bill Nighy, left, as Mr Woodhouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Box Hill Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taylor-Joy is the famous Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich but, most importantly of course, unmarried, subverting sexual politics by bearing the previous three attributes as coolly as any eligible bachelor. She passes her time by matchmaking, a passion into which she diverts her own romantic frustrations. Emma has found a suitor for her former governess Miss Taylor (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/25/gemma-whelan-game-of-thrones-interview\">Gemma Whelan</a>), who leaves their home to marry Mr Weston (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/24/rupert-graves-interview-roman-horrible-histories\">Rupert Graves</a>) \u2013 thus grieving Emma\u2019s pernickety old dad, in which role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bill-nighy\">Bill Nighy</a> is inevitably, amusingly cast.

      "bodyText": "Not badly done, Emma. Novelist Eleanor Catton has scripted this amiable, genial and interestingly unassuming new adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Regency classic, the great prototype romantic comedy, though it may be truer to call it a marriage comedy or marrcom. Music video specialist Autumn de Wilde makes her feature directing debut, with cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt often confecting a buttery sunlight in which to shoot. De Wilde and Catton are pretty content to let the story itself do the work, getting the big moments, letting the subtleties go, but showcasing a very watchable lead turn from Anya Taylor-Joy whose eerily unblinking gaze has something calculating and predatory. This movie does take a bit of time to settle down, with a frantically intrusive musical soundtrack at the very beginning, chirruping away under the action to make sure we understand how sprightly and amusing things are supposed to be. There is also what I can only describe as some startling buttock action. Dishy Mr Knightley is briefly glimpsed stark naked from the, ahem, rear. And Emma herself, standing alone with her back to the chimneypiece on a winter\u2019s day, bizarrely hoists her skirts to get the full benefit of a roaring open fire, without obviously troubling herself to ascertain that the servants are not nearby. But these indiscretions happen at the very beginning, after which the movie keeps its full period costume sedately in place. Taylor-Joy is the famous Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich but, most importantly of course, unmarried, subverting sexual politics by bearing the previous three attributes as coolly as any eligible bachelor. She passes her time by matchmaking, a passion into which she diverts her own romantic frustrations. Emma has found a suitor for her former governess Miss Taylor (Gemma Whelan), who leaves their home to marry Mr Weston (Rupert Graves) \u2013 thus grieving Emma\u2019s pernickety old dad, in which role Bill Nighy is inevitably, amusingly cast. Emma can\u2019t wait to set up her low-born friend Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) with the oleaginous clergyman Mr Elton (Josh O\u2019Connor), despite Mr Elton\u2019s socio-sexual intentions being elsewhere engaged, and despite sweet-natured Harriet\u2019s tendresse for local farmer Mr Martin (Connor Swindells). Arrogant heir-to-a-fortune Frank Churchill (Callum Turner) intrigues Emma, though he is perhaps more enamoured of Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson) and Emma is continuingly piqued by the intimate, needlingly flirtatious criticisms of Mr Knightley (Johnny Flynn), whose brother is married to Emma\u2019s sister. Their meet-cute has been going on since childhood. Taylor-Joy is interestingly cast, especially for Emma\u2019s legendary nasty moment, a flash of spite and sadism in which Taylor-Joy suddenly resembles the sinister rich kid she played in Cory Finley\u2019s recent thriller Thoroughbreds. Emma waspishly humiliates tiresome old Miss Bates (Miranda Hart) in front of everyone during an outing to Box Hill, an act of despicable cruelty for which she is famously criticised by Mr Knightley \u2013 it was \u201cbadly done\u201d \u2013 and for which she gets karmic justice. Yet Emma is so conceited that afterwards, when she is very contrite, her sense of status is such that she cannot quite bring herself to apologise to Miss Bates explicitly, leaving us to wonder how intentional a character revelation this is. Sometimes the casting and staging work well, sometimes not so well. That excellent actor Josh O\u2019Connor is forced into a pantomime role as Mr Elton, an unsympathetic Uriah Heepy-creepy performance that does not really suit him. Maybe he would have brought something more interesting to the role of Frank Churchill.

It is quite an unusual take on our records.\u201d</p> <p>Often how a letter ended up in the archives is of equal interest to its content.</p> <p>The \u201cmy Darling Morris\u201d letter was written by 22-year-old Cyril in 1934, when homosexual acts between men were criminalised. It is a powerful expression of love as well as raw panic that the feeling is not mutual.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fb58190972d328fc5773185f98fa28712eabcda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb58190972d328fc5773185f98fa28712eabcda/62_83_2394_1436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Cyril\u2019s letters to Morris, which went on to become a police exhibit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Cyril\u2019s letters to Morris, which went on to become a police exhibit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Director of Public Prosecutions/The National Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cyril has just found out that Morris is not meeting him at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/feb/27/revived-1930s-london-gay-members-club-caravan-club-raided-by-police\">Caravan Club</a>, a dingy, unconventional and gay-friendly basement club near Covent Garden that billed itself as \u201cLondon\u2019s greatest bohemian rendezvous\u201d.</p> <p>He writes: \u201cAs a matter of fact I stayed in bed all day yesterday, didn\u2019t even get up to eat and just thought of you, and counting the hours until I should see you, and then the terrible shock, of not being with you after all.\u201d</p> <p>The letter suggests something else is going on in Morris\u2019s life. \u201cI always feel so embarrassed when we meet as the terrible thought of your trouble keeps ringing in my ears, and I hate myself and cried for hours when I lay and thought it all, especially when I love you, Morris darling, honestly I do.\u201d</p> <p>Cyril had the letter on him when police raided the club. According to accounts, he ripped it up and hid it under a divan but it was found and taken as evidence.

      "bodyText": "The \u201cmy Darling Morris\u201d love letter is like many across history. \u201cI just lived for tonight when I was to have seen you,\u201d it reads. \u201cI only wish that I was going away with you, just you and I to eat and sleep and make love together.\u201d The letter though is different to others because it was filed away in government records: seized by police and used in a criminal trial because the writer to Morris was a man. It has gone on display at the National Archives as part of an exhibition of love letters, opening on Valentine\u2019s Day, which includes the first earl of Leicestershire, Robert Dudley, writing to Elizabeth I and the first Labour prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, to his secret aristocratic lover, Lady Margaret Sackville. The show is a first for the archives and might surprise some people, said the curator, Vicky Iglikowski-Broad. \u201cIt goes through 500 years of records we have relating to intimate expressions of love and as a state archive that\u2019s not something that we are normally associated with. It is quite an unusual take on our records.\u201d Often how a letter ended up in the archives is of equal interest to its content. The \u201cmy Darling Morris\u201d letter was written by 22-year-old Cyril in 1934, when homosexual acts between men were criminalised. It is a powerful expression of love as well as raw panic that the feeling is not mutual. Cyril has just found out that Morris is not meeting him at the Caravan Club, a dingy, unconventional and gay-friendly basement club near Covent Garden that billed itself as \u201cLondon\u2019s greatest bohemian rendezvous\u201d. He writes: \u201cAs a matter of fact I stayed in bed all day yesterday, didn\u2019t even get up to eat and just thought of you, and counting the hours until I should see you, and then the terrible shock, of not being with you after all.\u201d The letter suggests something else is going on in Morris\u2019s life. \u201cI always feel so embarrassed when we meet as the terrible thought of your trouble keeps ringing in my ears, and I hate myself and cried for hours when I lay and thought it all, especially when I love you, Morris darling, honestly I do.\u201d Cyril had the letter on him when police raided the club. According to accounts, he ripped it up and hid it under a divan but it was found and taken as evidence. It was retyped as \u201cExhibit 4\u201d. Little is known about Cyril or Morris and what happened after the raid but the letter has an obvious poignancy. \u201cIt could be a love letter from any context or any era,\u201d said Iglikowski-Broad. \u201cIt just so happens that it is between two men and it is because of that it\u2019s preserved in our collection.\u201d The exhibition includes documents that shine light on well-known love affairs, including the Instrument of Abdication of Edward VIII, the legal document allowing him to give up the throne and marry Wallis Simpson. The two-paragraph legal document was signed on 10 December 1936 by Edward at his Windsor home, Fort Belvedere, in the presence of his brothers Albert (George VI), Henry and George. There is also the will of Anne Lister, the Halifax landowner known as Gentleman Jack and often referred to asBritain\u2019s first modern lesbian. Lister leaves her estate to her lover Ann Walker but stipulates, as a way of protecting her, that she would be disinherited if she were ever to marry. Other letters are not effusive, but still revealing. \u201cI humbly kiss your foot,\u201d writes Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the man who probably won the heart, but not the hand, of Elizabeth I. Over the o\u2019s in the word poor Dudley has put little brows \u2013 a reference to her nickname for him: \u201cEyes.\u201d In contrast, the passions of MacDonald, Britain\u2019s first Labour prime minister, for Sackville, a well-connected society beauty, are unrestrained. The archives have about 150 letters from MacDonald expressing his love and frustration. \u201cI want you &amp; you are hundreds of miles away &amp; I cannot even kiss you,\u201d reads one. MacDonald, the son of a farm labourer and housemaid, proposed at least three times and was turned down on each occasion. It has been speculated that the problem was not class but religion, as Sackville was Roman Catholic and MacDonald was raised in the Presbyterian church. The letters are in the archives because Sackville died in 1963 without giving any instructions for them. Her local bank manager sent them to the Historical Manuscripts Commission, which became part of the new National Archives when it was established in 2003. MacDonald sometimes wrote that Sackville would of course burn all his letters. \u201cIt says a lot that she kept them,\u201d said Iglikowski-Broad. \u201cIt signals what the relationship meant to her.\u201d \u2022 With Love is at the National Archives, Kew, 14 February to 5 July.",

      "body": "<p>The trebling of tuition fees would unleash a new golden age for English universities, or so we were told. They would become financially sustainable, competitive, liberated from stifling bureaucracy and responsive to the needs of students. And yet, nearly a decade later, higher education is in crisis.</p> <p>Tuition fees have formed part of a full-frontal assault on the living standards of a generation battered by a housing crisis, stagnating wages and slashed services. And with <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/education/about-17-students-are-forecast-fully-pay-back-their-loans/\" title=\"\">83% of student loans</a> forecast to never be paid back in full, the promises of financial sustainability are a nonsense. Both frontrunners for the Labour leadership have committed to maintaining the party\u2019s totemic commitment to abolishing this punitive attack on aspiration, recognising that university education is a social good. But the issue goes much, much wider \u2013 and has profound implications for the future of our society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>According to the University and College Union, university staff\u2019s pay has declined by 20% over the last decade</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This month, staff will begin rolling strike action at 74 universities: their list of grievances is long indeed, ranging from pensions to pay and workload. A job in academia used to be perhaps the definitive prestigious middle-class occupation, rewarded with status, security and top salaries. Yet academics have become a case study in the decline of the middle class in favour of a casualised, precarious, overworked labour force. According to the University and College Union, university staff\u2019s real-terms pay has <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10342/Value-of-university-staff-pay-has-plummeted-in-last-decade-employers-own-research-reveals\" title=\"\">declined</a> by 20% over the last decade. In London \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities \u2013 that collapse has been even more profound. Seven out of 10 higher education researchers are stuck with the insecurity of fixed-term contracts, and 30% of teaching at many institutions is <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/10336/Counting-the-costs-of-casualisation-in-higher-education-Jun-19/pdf/ucu_casualisation_in_HE_survey_report_Jun19.pdf\" title=\"\">done</a> by so-called atypical academics, treated as casual workers and paid by the hour.</p> <p>This precariousness has huge consequences: like making financial plans, long-term family decisions, buying a house, paying rent and bills, and the impact on mental health all that can have. There\u2019s another dimension, too: casualisation fuels the already stark pay gap suffered by women and black and minority-ethnic staff. Even as pay deteriorates, the workload only mounts: in 2016, 83% of academics reported an increase in the pace or intensity of work, with the average staff member <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/8195/Workload-is-an-education-issue-UCU-workload-survey-report-2016/pdf/ucu_workloadsurvey_fullreport_jun16.pdf\" title=\"\">working</a> nearly 51 hours a week.</p> <p>The whole model is based on making universities compete, and, following the logic of market economics, this has created winners and losers.

      "bodyText": "The trebling of tuition fees would unleash a new golden age for English universities, or so we were told. They would become financially sustainable, competitive, liberated from stifling bureaucracy and responsive to the needs of students. And yet, nearly a decade later, higher education is in crisis. Tuition fees have formed part of a full-frontal assault on the living standards of a generation battered by a housing crisis, stagnating wages and slashed services. And with 83% of student loans forecast to never be paid back in full, the promises of financial sustainability are a nonsense. Both frontrunners for the Labour leadership have committed to maintaining the party\u2019s totemic commitment to abolishing this punitive attack on aspiration, recognising that university education is a social good. But the issue goes much, much wider \u2013 and has profound implications for the future of our society. This month, staff will begin rolling strike action at 74 universities: their list of grievances is long indeed, ranging from pensions to pay and workload. A job in academia used to be perhaps the definitive prestigious middle-class occupation, rewarded with status, security and top salaries. Yet academics have become a case study in the decline of the middle class in favour of a casualised, precarious, overworked labour force. According to the University and College Union, university staff\u2019s real-terms pay has declined by 20% over the last decade. In London \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities \u2013 that collapse has been even more profound. Seven out of 10 higher education researchers are stuck with the insecurity of fixed-term contracts, and 30% of teaching at many institutions is done by so-called atypical academics, treated as casual workers and paid by the hour. This precariousness has huge consequences: like making financial plans, long-term family decisions, buying a house, paying rent and bills, and the impact on mental health all that can have. There\u2019s another dimension, too: casualisation fuels the already stark pay gap suffered by women and black and minority-ethnic staff. Even as pay deteriorates, the workload only mounts: in 2016, 83% of academics reported an increase in the pace or intensity of work, with the average staff member working nearly 51 hours a week. The whole model is based on making universities compete, and, following the logic of market economics, this has created winners and losers. The Tory-Lib Dem government removed the cap on student numbers, encouraging institutions to compete with each other for applicants: but admissions rose quicker than staff numbers, inevitably reducing the quality of education. Universities spend vast amounts on advertising, from billboards to adverts on buses \u2013 both the universities of Central Lancashire and the West of England splashed \u00a33.4m each on marketing in 2017-18, for instance. They invest vast sums in flashy buildings that they hope students will gawp at on open days: superficial additions that are hardly the best use of limited resources. Acting rather like corporate titans, Russell group universities used resources to aggressively expand and hoover up students from middle-tier universities, often with offers that are unconditional on A-levels. \u201cLet\u2019s just get these students, it\u2019s bums on seats,\u201d as Natalie Fenton, a professor at Goldsmiths, University of London, sums it up. \u201cThat completely squeezed that middle group of institutions which then found themselves in crisis, so they seek to recruit from institutions below them in the pecking order, and the whole system starts to crumble.\u201d Nearly a quarter of English universities are now in deficit: so much for financial sustainability. The system moulds students into consumers seeking value for money: if they are to be saddled with debt, they understandably expect an education that will open doors for high-salaried occupations. But the expansion in higher education has not been accompanied by a commensurate increase in well-paid, skilled jobs, creating a ticking timebomb of disillusionment and resentment.

There\u2019s another perverse consequence of marketisation: as debt-laden students head for degrees they think will maximise their earning potential, many vital courses suffer. The University of Sunderland is axing its history, politics and foreign language courses, for example, expressing a desire for a more \u201ccareer-focused and professions-facing\u201d approach. \u201cWe do know that subjects go in cycles,\u201d says Prof Fenton, \u201cso there some courses that aren\u2019t trendy now, it\u2019s decided they\u2019re not economically viable, and you end up with universities without politics or history departments.\u201d It\u2019s a process encouraged by a wider push to promote Stem subjects \u2013 science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 at schools, often to the detriment of creative arts.

      "bodyText": "Bridget McKenzie\u2019s selection of projects for $100m in sports grants lacked transparency and diverged significantly from Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations, Australia\u2019s top public servant has found. But despite criticising the former sport minister\u2019s handling of the community sport infrastructure grant program, Phil Gaetjens has rejected the Australian National Audit Office\u2019s conclusion it was targeted at marginal and target seats. Gaetjens\u2019 comments are contained in a submission to the Senate inquiry into sports grants, the first intervention by the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in his own words since Scott Morrison asked him to report on McKenzie\u2019s adherence to ministerial standards. Gaetjens\u2019 report triggered McKenzie\u2019s resignation on 2 February over a conflict of interest in one grant, but the government has blocked its release on the basis it is a confidential cabinet document. In the submission, Gaetjens said McKenzie had \u201cwide discretion\u201d about the \u201cother factors\u201d she could consider and that she had \u201cacted within the remit of the guidelines\u201d when approving grants. Gaetjens agreed with the ANAO that there were \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d with her decision-making role, agreeing that McKenzie\u2019s office had undertaken \u201ca separate and non-transparent process in addition to the assessment by Sport Australia\u201d. \u201cKey among these were the lack of transparency for applicants around the other factors being considered, and the disconnect between the assessment process run by Sport Australia and the assessment and decision-making process in the minister\u2019s office. \u201cThis lack of transparency, coupled with the significant divergences between projects recommended by Sport Australia and those approved by the minister have given rise to concerns about the funding decision-making.\u201d Gaetjens cast doubt on the conclusion that a spreadsheet generated in November 2018 that was colour-coded by electorate and party was the basis of McKenzie\u2019s decisions, noting that decisions were made months later in three rounds in December 2018, February 2019 and April 2019, and that 30% of projects labelled \u201csuccessful\u201d on that sheet were not funded. He said this evidence \u201cdoes not accord\u201d with the ANAO\u2019s conclusion that McKenzie\u2019s office had focused on marginal and target electorates. \u201cI did not find evidence that the separate funding approval process conducted in the minister\u2019s office was unduly influenced by reference to marginal or targeted electorates.\u201d Gaetjens also noted McKenzie\u2019s evidence to him \u201cthat she had never seen the adviser\u2019s spreadsheet and that neither she nor her staff based their assessments on it\u201d. On Thursday, ANAO officials told the first sports grants inquiry hearing that McKenzie was not interviewed and did not formally respond to its draft report when asked for comment. Gaetjens said 32% of proposed projects in marginal or target seats were ultimately approved, compared with 36% in other electorates. He noted that 180 marginal or targeted projects were recommended by Sport Australia, and 229 were ultimately approved by the minister, representing a 27% increase, but the number of projects funded in non-marginal non-target seats also increased from 325 to 451, or 39%. Gaetjens argued McKenzie\u2019s intervention had improved the geographical spread of projects, with only five electorates missing out on any funding, compared with 30 that were set to miss out if Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations had been adopted. \u201cFurther, the evidence I have reviewed does not support the suggestion that political considerations were the primary determining factor in the minister\u2019s decisions to approve the grants. \u201cOn this basis, and while there were shortcomings in the administration of the program, I concluded senator McKenzie did not act in breach of the standards with respect to fairness. \u201cI did find that senator McKenzie breached the standards by failing to declare her memberships of two organisations and that she had an actual conflict of interest when awarding funding to one of those organisations, the Wangaratta Clay Target Club, which was neither declared to the prime minister nor managed.\u201d Gaetjens did not interview anyone from the prime minister\u2019s office, and acknowledged he did not have all the information available to the ANAO. The Gaetjens submission did not address the ANAO\u2019s finding that it was \u201cnot evident\u201d what McKenzie\u2019s legal authority was to approve grants. On Friday Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese accused Scott Morrison of personal involvement in the $100m program and misleading parliament by claiming that all projects funded were eligible. He cited evidence from the ANAO on Thursday evening that in fact 43% of projects were ineligible when agreements were signed and that Morrison\u2019s office had made \u201cdirect\u201d representations about which projects should be funded, including exchanging versions of the spreadsheet with McKenzie\u2019s office. The government has continued to defend the eligibility of projects, citing the fact that \u201cno project which was funded was assessed as ineligible at the time the assessment was made\u201d, as the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said on Friday.",

There are loads of consoles there to play on, old and contemporary. Even games like Pong and Space Invaders can be sampled. They have a couple of re-creations of teenagers\u2019 rooms from days gone by to add to the atmosphere. There was also a rather random interactive representation of the flames from the Back to the Future DeLorean projected on to the floor. It amused my gamer daughter to think her mum played some of these games, and we had a chance to exchange our experiences and challenge each other. The gift shop was cool too, with T-shirts and bags with retro designs. <br><strong>Heather Johnson</strong></p> \n<h2>Mauritshuis museum: the Hague</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7c7901bcd2650aa8da1b181a5e3d6f24e36acb9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c7901bcd2650aa8da1b181a5e3d6f24e36acb9/334_1481_3170_1902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girlwith a Pearl Earring by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer in the museum Mauritshuis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>An afternoon to kill in the Hague?

A friendly man at the station information desk suggested it and I\u2019m so glad he did. The painting seems to glow: the Girl\u2019s face and the earring appear luminous. It was a real moment of joy, standing there looking at her. I enjoyed the walk to the Mauritshuis too: it\u2019s surrounded by many grand buildings and squares, including the Plein, with its statue of William of Orange, where you can sit and have a gin and tonic (just a suggestion).<br><strong>Anna</strong></p> \n<h2>Gucci Garden Galleria, Florence</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"552f50f37ce700e2b0f44a7b23fd63dc74612ce4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/552f50f37ce700e2b0f44a7b23fd63dc74612ce4/0_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gucci Museum in Florence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Fifteen minutes\u2019 walk from Florence station is the free-to-enter <a href=\"https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ca/gucci-garden-c-gucci-garden-landing?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1aOmmfzL5wIVyLTtCh3ekg6wEAAYASAAEgL1jPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">Gucci Garden Galleria</a> in the Palazzo della Mercanzia.

Take in classic prints, including the Grace Kelly-inspired Flora scarves, and the wonderfully retro collection of 1970s knitwear.

One of the largest collections of furniture in the world, it is a fascinating and well-curated collection of clutter, including imperial travelling thrones, commodes and washstands. No Marie Kondo here \u2013 only Maria Theresa. The station itself is a gem with its glass-fronted mid-century design, its unassuming monument to children of the Kindertransport and being the first port of call for many during the 2015 migrant crisis. <br><strong>Anita</strong></p> \n<h2>Kiasma, Helsinki</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74c6e2c1ec2c588904a86244146812e5b0cad95d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c6e2c1ec2c588904a86244146812e5b0cad95d/0_78_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twins and clock tower in the Helsinki Railway station.

When I was a nanny in Helsinki I used to take the girls I looked after for a day out there all the time. Not only can you enjoy the changing exhibitions, but the architecture of the building and the area blow you away: you can even see a glimpse of the parliament house from the front yard. <br><strong>Ida</strong></p> \n<h2>Museum for Arts and Crafts, Hamburg</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a91a72557966a49b30ef8f8c47a39fec1ef976f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a91a72557966a49b30ef8f8c47a39fec1ef976f/0_55_3898_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A display of cutlery from Jewish ownership in a Looted Art exhibition at Museum for Arts and Crafts, Hamburg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/home.html\" title=\"\">Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe</a> (Museum for Arts and Crafts, entry \u20ac12/\u20ac8) is an ideal spot to stretch your legs between long train rides to Scandinavia, set in parkland behind Hamburg Hauptbahnhof.

The main exhibition is one of the largest in the world - but even a dash between train connections is worthwhile despite the size. The first shots of the second world war were fired here and the focus is on the tragic experience of Poland.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Computerspielemuseum, Berlin About a 15-minute walk from Berlin Ostbahnhof is the Computerspielemuseum (\u20ac9/\u20ac6), which is a haven for old and young who grew up playing computer games. There are loads of consoles there to play on, old and contemporary. Even games like Pong and Space Invaders can be sampled. They have a couple of re-creations of teenagers\u2019 rooms from days gone by to add to the atmosphere. There was also a rather random interactive representation of the flames from the Back to the Future DeLorean projected on to the floor. It amused my gamer daughter to think her mum played some of these games, and we had a chance to exchange our experiences and challenge each other. The gift shop was cool too, with T-shirts and bags with retro designs. Heather Johnson Mauritshuis museum: the Hague An afternoon to kill in the Hague? Just a 10-minute walk from Den Haag Centraal station is the Mauritshuis museum (adult \u20ac15.50, under-19s free), home to Johannes Vermeer\u2019s Girl with a Pearl Earring. A friendly man at the station information desk suggested it and I\u2019m so glad he did. The painting seems to glow: the Girl\u2019s face and the earring appear luminous. It was a real moment of joy, standing there looking at her. I enjoyed the walk to the Mauritshuis too: it\u2019s surrounded by many grand buildings and squares, including the Plein, with its statue of William of Orange, where you can sit and have a gin and tonic (just a suggestion). Anna Gucci Garden Galleria, Florence Fifteen minutes\u2019 walk from Florence station is the free-to-enter Gucci Garden Galleria in the Palazzo della Mercanzia. The fashion label\u2019s three-storey museum, laid out by Gucci designer Alessandro Michele, contains room after room filled with a visual history of the brand through the decades. Marvel at beautifully crafted trunks, vanity cases and accessories from the 1930s. Then gasp at the beautifully bejewelled gowns and leather handbags. Take in classic prints, including the Grace Kelly-inspired Flora scarves, and the wonderfully retro collection of 1970s knitwear. On the ground floor is the gift store, selling fashion-related books and stylish magazines. The Gucci Osteria on the ground floor terrace mixes sartorial style with beautiful food. Claire Hofmobiliendepot, Vienna From Vienna\u2019s Westbahnhof it\u2019s a 10-minute walk to the Imperial Furniture Collection (\u20ac10.50/\u20ac6.50). One of the largest collections of furniture in the world, it is a fascinating and well-curated collection of clutter, including imperial travelling thrones, commodes and washstands. No Marie Kondo here \u2013 only Maria Theresa. The station itself is a gem with its glass-fronted mid-century design, its unassuming monument to children of the Kindertransport and being the first port of call for many during the 2015 migrant crisis. Anita Kiasma, Helsinki The Kiasma museum of modern art (\u20ac15/under-18s free), right behind the main railway station in Helsinki, is amazing \u2013 not only because you get to see the most beautiful railway station in Finland, designed by Eliel Saarinen. When I was a nanny in Helsinki I used to take the girls I looked after for a day out there all the time. Not only can you enjoy the changing exhibitions, but the architecture of the building and the area blow you away: you can even see a glimpse of the parliament house from the front yard. Ida Museum for Arts and Crafts, Hamburg Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe (Museum for Arts and Crafts, entry \u20ac12/\u20ac8) is an ideal spot to stretch your legs between long train rides to Scandinavia, set in parkland behind Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. It\u2019s in a wonderful building, with a huge collection of antiquities, including ancient artefacts from all the major religions. There are collections of pianos, graphic art, art nouveau and Bauhaus, all of world significance. There are seven current exhibitions, which often focus on modern design; at the moment these include designers Stefan Sagmeister and Jessica Walsh\u2019s exploration of beauty. There\u2019s a lovely cafe too. Alexandra The Museum of the Second World War, Gdansk A 15-minute stroll from Gdansk Glowny, this daunting sounding museum (\u00a33 entry) proved a fascinating visit. The main exhibition is one of the largest in the world - but even a dash between train connections is worthwhile despite the size. The first shots of the second world war were fired here and the focus is on the tragic experience of Poland. The exhibition looks at how the war started, victims, perpetrators, and ordinary people in Poland. The way the story is told is of a very high quality and immerses the visitor in an emotional and thought-provoking experience. We went because the hostel we stayed in recommended it, and it was one of the highlights of our journey round Poland. Cheryl Jewish Museum, Copenhagen Copenhagen\u2019s many museums are full of art, design, and colonial loot, but the object that stays with me most is a Yiddish typewriter from the small Danish Jewish Museum (\u00a36.75/\u00a35.60).

An Obama-era justice department official, Matthew Miller, wrote that Barr was telling Trump that if he \u201cwould just shut up, Barr could take care of him much more effectively\u201d. The White House said Barr had a right to his opinion. The Republican majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, told Fox News: \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Cummings and goings \u2013 </strong>The modest reshuffle that quickly escalated into high drama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javids-exit-leaves-boris-johnson-in-control-of-treasury\">left Boris Johnson with control of the Treasury</a>, Heather Stewart writes this morning.

In Huanggang \u2013 one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan \u2013 and Dawu county in central Hubei, authorities gave orders \u201cfully sealing\u201d all residential areas and banning private use of vehicles.

UK experts have warned that fake news and advice about the Covid-19 virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-false-rumours-cost-lives-researchers\">could cost lives</a>. Prof Paul Hunter from East Anglia University said: \u201cWorryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-latest-updates-wuhan-hubei-china-deaths-cruise-ship-sydney-cases-covid19-live-news\">Find out more at our live blog</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Racism in medical schools \u2013 </strong>Black, Asian and minority ethnic trainee doctors are experiencing a \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at medical schools amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/14/bame-trainee-doctors-in-climate-of-fear-over-racism\">failure to address widespread racism</a>, according to the British Medical Association. Its investigation with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found medical schools were ill-prepared to deal with racism against students. Of the 32 medical schools that responded to freedom of information requests, only half said they kept specific record of racism complaints. Gurdas Singh, co-chair of the BMA\u2019s medical students committee, said the most common racist incidents included patients refusing to be treated by BAME people, and female black medical students being mistaken for nurses. The BMA has launched a charter for medical schools that offers guidance for students on how to get support and calls for dedicated procedures to handle racism complaints.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Chatbot sex sting \u2013 </strong>Anti-slavery campaigners have used chatbots to disrupt sex trafficking by drawing thousands of men into online conversations and then confronting them with messages to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/13/sex-worker-chatbots-fool-thousands-to-hit-trafficking-industry\">deter them from buying sex online</a>. Seattle Against Slavery said it led to a 50% decline in the city for online searches with keywords such as \u201cteen escort\u201d. The bots had about 19,000 conversations with 15,000 people.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018I\u2019m not going to be bullied\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray with you as we find ourselves crashing into the end of another week. The US attorney general, William Barr, has publicly rebuked Donald Trump, saying the president\u2019s tweets about the case of Roger Stone \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it\u2019s Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president,\u201d said Barr, in the wake of the justice department intervening in Stone\u2019s case after the president vented his anger about the severity of the sentence being sought. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do what I think is right,\u201d Barr added. \u201cAnd you know \u2026 I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\u201d Observers were sceptical about Barr\u2019s bullish stance, given that he presented a watered-down assessment of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation findings to shield the president. An Obama-era justice department official, Matthew Miller, wrote that Barr was telling Trump that if he \u201cwould just shut up, Barr could take care of him much more effectively\u201d. The White House said Barr had a right to his opinion. The Republican majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, told Fox News: \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d * * * Cummings and goings \u2013 The modest reshuffle that quickly escalated into high drama has left Boris Johnson with control of the Treasury, Heather Stewart writes this morning. Sajid Javid threw the job back in the PM\u2019s face after being told that in order to remain as chancellor he must sack his advisers. Javid said he didn\u2019t believe \u201cany self-respecting minister would accept such conditions\u201d. Swiftly replaced by Rishi Sunak, Javid has become the shortest-serving chancellor in 50 years. The prime minister\u2019s new cabinet includes some intriguing choices: a leader for the Cop26 talks who has only said \u201cclimate\u201d six times in parliament; an attorney general who supported the illegal prorogation of parliament, and thinks human rights have gone too far; and an international development secretary who questions the value of foreign aid. Our editorial concludes: \u201cThis is the sixth different Tory-led government since 2010 \u2026 a government beholden to one man, Mr Johnson, and to his grey eminence, Mr Cummings.\u201d * * * China ramps up war with Covid-19 \u2013 Chinese authorities have expanded \u201cwartime\u201d measures to combat coronavirus as deaths reached nearly 1,400 and more than 5,000 new cases were reported. In Huanggang \u2013 one of the worst-hit areas outside of Wuhan \u2013 and Dawu county in central Hubei, authorities gave orders \u201cfully sealing\u201d all residential areas and banning private use of vehicles. American officials, though, have questioned whether China is being honest in its sharing of information on the outbreak. In Japan, the first Covid-19 fatality \u2013 a woman in her 80s \u2013 has been recorded and there are indications the virus might be spreading there after several other people with no recent connection to China tested positive. UK experts have warned that fake news and advice about the Covid-19 virus could cost lives. Prof Paul Hunter from East Anglia University said: \u201cWorryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources.\u201d Find out more at our live blog. * * * Racism in medical schools \u2013 Black, Asian and minority ethnic trainee doctors are experiencing a \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at medical schools amid a failure to address widespread racism, according to the British Medical Association. Its investigation with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found medical schools were ill-prepared to deal with racism against students. Of the 32 medical schools that responded to freedom of information requests, only half said they kept specific record of racism complaints. Gurdas Singh, co-chair of the BMA\u2019s medical students committee, said the most common racist incidents included patients refusing to be treated by BAME people, and female black medical students being mistaken for nurses. The BMA has launched a charter for medical schools that offers guidance for students on how to get support and calls for dedicated procedures to handle racism complaints. * * * Chatbot sex sting \u2013 Anti-slavery campaigners have used chatbots to disrupt sex trafficking by drawing thousands of men into online conversations and then confronting them with messages to deter them from buying sex online. Seattle Against Slavery said it led to a 50% decline in the city for online searches with keywords such as \u201cteen escort\u201d. The bots had about 19,000 conversations with 15,000 people. The campaign also involved placing more than 2m Google adverts warning people of the risks of buying sex online. * * * Play it again \u2013 A music fan has been reunited with a cassette tape she lost while on holiday 25 years ago after it was found by an artist and made into an exhibition piece. Stella Wedell was 12 when, during a Spanish holiday, she lost the tape containing songs by the likes of Pet Shop Boys, Shaggy and Bob Marley. She was astounded to spot it a quarter of a century later in a touring exhibition called Sea of Artifacts by the British artist and photographer Mandy Barker, who found it washed up on Lanzarote and had it restored and made playable. \u201cIt was an astounding chance for Stella to walk into my exhibition and recognise her tape,\u201d the artist said. Prof Richard Thompson, head of the marine litter research unit at Plymouth University, said: \u201cThe fact it has survived intact shows the durability of plastic and the threat it can pose to the marine environment.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Who killed Olof Palme? After a night at the cinema in 1986, the Swedish prime minister was assassinated on Stockholm\u2019s busiest street. The identity of his killer has never been proven. Jan Stocklassa discusses whether novelist Stieg Larsson\u2019s theory can provide any answers. And: the first same-sex couple to get married in Northern Ireland. Lunchtime read: The trouble with anti-populism With rightwing demagogues gaining power and public debate getting nastier, many are calling for a return to a more sensible politics. But does this approach have its own fatal flaws? Sport UK Athletics is in more turmoil after its chair, Chris Clark, resigned after barely seven months in charge on the day the troubled organisation announced its new chief executive. Premier League clubs, the sports minister and football fans have condemned StubHub, as data emerged that uncovers for the first time the scale of the website\u2019s grip on thousands of tickets to football matches. Pel\u00e9 has dismissed his son\u2019s claims that he is depressed and reclusive, assuring fans he is doing well and maintaining a busy schedule. McLaren\u2019s Zak Brown says Formula One would be right to once more put its participants first if it had to postpone or cancel the Vietnam Grand Prix as it did in China because of the coronavirus outbreak. In darts, Fallon Sherrock narrowly failed to create more history as she drew 6-6 with Glen Durrant at the Premier League in Nottingham. Business Asian shares have mostly fallen with investors turning cautious following a surge in cases of coronavirus in China. The US justice department has added new criminal charges against Huawei and several subsidiaries, accusing the Chinese company of a brazen scheme to steal trade secrets from competitors in America.

Maybe you\u2019ve even said or thought it yourself. \u201cPoliticians are always fighting!\u201d \u201cPolitics has become totally irrational!\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t politicians just compromise, find some consensus and solve our problems?\u201d</p> <p>For many people, these views have come to seem like basic common sense. In this era of extreme partisanship, the argument goes, what we need is more unity and moderation to bring us together. And if there is one group of politicians who have been blamed for the sorry state we find ourselves in, it is populists.</p> <p>Since the twin shocks of 2016 \u2013 the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump \u2013 a cottage industry of authors, pundits and organisations has emerged with the shared goal of fighting populism. Books with names such as <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-people-vs-democracy-9780674237681.html\" title=\"\">The People vs Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How Save It</a>, and Anti-Pluralism: The Populist Threat to Liberal Democracy have been published on both sides of the Atlantic. Tony Blair has set up his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/01/tony-blair-to-launch-new-institute-for-centre-ground-politics\" title=\"\">Institute for Global Change</a> to find \u201can answer to the new populism of left and right which exploits the anger and drives the world apart\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, two of the most prominent politicians defeated by populist competitors, Hillary Clinton and Matteo Renzi, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/clinton-blair-renzi-why-we-lost-populists-how-fight-back-rightwing-populism-centrist\" title=\"\">offered their tips</a> about how to stop populists (too little, too late). And in a truly remarkable bit of chutzpah, populist extraordinaire Silvio Berlusconi has tried to reinvent himself as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/03/italian-elections-european-union-populism\" title=\"\">a pro-EU unifier</a>, here to save Italy from populism. Even the pontiff has warned against populism, with <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Pope Francis</a> stating that \u201cpopulism is evil and ends badly\u201d.</p> <p>What unites these self-styled defenders of democracy, ready to roll up their sleeves and take the apparent populist scourge head-on? It\u2019s certainly not a clear ideology. Nor is it opposition to a particular variety of populism. It is something far more disparate than that. So how about we just call this phenomenon, simply, anti-populism?</p> <p>While populism itself has received an enormous amount of media attention over the past several years, anti-populism has not. Yet this is somewhat curious, given that anti-populism \u2013 with its call for a more sensible, moderate politics \u2013 has become one of the most widely held views across the western political mainstream.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see why anti-populist ideas are popular: they have intuitive appeal in a time when two-party politics seems to be breaking down in the US, UK and Australia; when genuinely dangerous rightwing populists are winning power across the world; and when politics and public debate seem increasingly divisive and volatile. In this context, the key values of anti-populism \u2013 civility, maturity, deliberation \u2013 sound rather nice.</p> <p>Yet it is worth asking how we got to this point, and considering how opposing populism \u2013 a term that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/birth-of-populism-donald-trump\" title=\"\">in some contexts</a>, particularly in the US, until recently had positive connotations \u2013 became the supposedly sensible position to take. Crucially, it is also worth asking whether anti-populism is effective. If the aim is to defeat populists, do the solutions proposed by the anti-populists \u2013 running the gamut from borrowing some populist policies to refusing to negotiate with them at all \u2013 actually work? Or do they ultimately succumb to what the philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lacan.com/zizpopulism.htm\" title=\"\">the populist temptation</a>\u201d: where the self-declared opponents of populism end up becoming a watered-down version of the thing they were fighting against in the first place?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Unlike other \u201cisms\u201d, anti-populism is not a clear ideological disposition or mode of governance, but rather an odd mix of ideological and strategic allies pulled together in a temporary coalition. Anti-populism can draw together politicians from all over the left-right spectrum. They don\u2019t have a shared view of the role of the state, military intervention, fiscal regulation and so on \u2013 but what they do share is a broader vision of how politics should be \u201cdone\u201d.</p> <p>Although populists on the left and right clearly have very different stances, there are a number of things that tend to unite them \u2013 and mobilise anti-populists\u2019 concerns.</p> <p>First, while populists appeal to \u201cthe people\u201d against \u201cthe elite\u201d, anti-populists see this as a crude and patently false way to divide society. The political theorist Jan-Werner M\u00fcller argues that populists\u2019 \u201cidea of the single, homogenous, authentic people is a fantasy\u201d. Instead, anti-populists argue that we should acknowledge that there are many overlapping, competing characterisations of \u201cthe people\u201d in society, and that such collective identities are only ever made up by individuals anyway. This liberal individualism chafes against populism\u2019s insistence on groups \u2013 the people and the elite \u2013 as the primary actors in political struggles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d866757f4ff22ce47c67c4985f55a875f48fbc21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d866757f4ff22ce47c67c4985f55a875f48fbc21/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-Brexit march in London, during which protesters called for a second referendum to remain in the EU.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-Brexit march in London, during which protesters called for a second referendum to remain in the EU.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anti-populists also tend to object to the nationalist and even isolationist visions that that idea of \u201cthe people\u201d implies. While populists of both the right and left tend to be critics of globalisation \u2013 variously blaming it for increasing migration, weakening national sovereignty or lowering wages \u2013 anti-populists tend to defend a world of free markets and free movement of peoples, as well as acknowledging the important role of transnational economic and political bodies in our globally interdependent era.</p> <p>Second, populists tend to champion political mechanisms that allegedly give voice to the people (such as referendums, plebiscites and forms of direct democracy), whereas anti-populists see such mechanisms as rather crude and divisive, potentially leading to mob rule. For anti-populists, politics is a relatively rational activity in which politicians debate one another, hopefully finding consensus by convincing the other side with the strength of their arguments. For them, politics is not a battle of passions, but rather something of a puzzle to be solved. This is a supposedly rational view of politics \u2013 sober, mature and graceful \u2013 against the allegedly immature, kneejerk and sensational politics of populists.</p> <p>This notion of rationality is central to anti-populism. Populists are cast as peddlers of lies, manipulating people\u2019s emotions, playing on their basest fears and whipping up hysteria, while anti-populists see themselves as taking a clear-eyed view of the world. This is evident in the way \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/hysteria-fake-news-epidemic-distraction\" title=\"\">fake news</a>\u201d and \u201cpost-truth\u201d have somehow become synonymous with populism: while populists are relativists who bend reality to their will, anti-populists see themselves as concerned with the capital-T Truth.</p> <p>Anti-populists also share an opposition to the way that populists behave in the political sphere. While populists are often defined by their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/why-are-we-surprised-by-every-populist-politician-voting-for-them-can-be-a-rational-choice\" title=\"\">bad manners</a> \u2013 think here of Donald Trump\u2019s lack of respect for any modicum of decorum, or of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines calling Barack Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d \u2013 anti-populists find such breaches of the supposed rules of political conduct inexcusable. Furthermore, they are dismayed by populists\u2019 lack of respect for proceduralism \u2013 that is, populists\u2019 tendency to crash through the usual processes of checks and balances. Anti-populists have a more <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/04/how-liberals-fell-in-love-with-the-west-wing\" title=\"\">West Wing</a>-esque vision of politics as full of people with (generally) good intentions, who might have different ideological views, but who above all respect the rules of the game.</p> <p>Connected to all this, perhaps the most important tendency of anti-populism, is a valourisation of consensus in politics. For anti-populists, we are no longer living in \u201cordinary times\u201d in which consensus rules. Characterising these good old days, the political scientist and journalist Yascha Mounk <a href=\"http://pratclif.com/2018/mounk.htm\" title=\"\">notes that</a> for decades, \u201cdeveloped democracies in North America, western Europe and beyond appeared to be remarkably stable. Moderate parties and politicians were dominant. Independent institutions were strong. A broad political consensus created a sense that the future was highly predictable.\u201d For anti-populists, a return to this consensus would represent a healthy return to \u201cnormal\u201d politics.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Yet it is worth asking the question: when it comes to politics, what is normality anyway? Behind such calls for consensus and order, there are some significant problems with anti-populism. For one thing, there is little questioning of who this particular consensus actually worked for. Some would argue that the alleged consensus of post-cold war politics was actually the result of the capitulation of the centre-left to the right, rather than any real moderation.</p> <p>The anti-populist call for consensus politics in many ways resembles the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/the-death-of-consensus-how-conflict-came-back-to-politics\" title=\"\">third way</a> \u201cbeyond left or right\u201d position offered by Blair and the British sociologist Anthony Giddens in the 90s, and adapted by parties and leaders across the world. One cannot help but feel a sense of deja vu \u2013 in 2002, in the face of populist Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s progression to the second round of the French presidential elections, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/may/03/eu.thefarright\" title=\"\">Giddens wrote</a> that \u201cthe renewed polarisation of politics on the left and right is plainly threatening to political stability\u201d, and that \u201cthe third way can beat the far right by modernising, liberalising and being tough on immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Fast-forward 16 years, and we find Blair singing from the same hymnbook, claiming that \u201cthe political space for argument and debate has become very, very hard to curate and understand because everything is just sucked into this vortex of highly inflamed political rhetoric and exchanges of position without people trying to really reach much common ground\u201d, and arguing that the way to fight the far right is by forcing migrants to integrate more. And it\u2019s not only Blair and his coterie: the international enthusiasm for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/23/macrons-centrism-is-coming-apart-at-the-seams/\" title=\"\">not left, nor right</a>\u201d politics in France is also evidence of an attempted rehabilitation of the third way, with Macron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/28/emmanuel-macron-populism-french-president\" title=\"\">decrying</a> the \u201cpopulist and nationalist leprosy\u201d of Europe.</p> <p>Here, one starts to get the feeling that addressing the so-called populist threat is less about fighting actual populism, and more about rehabilitating and rebranding the third way for a new era. But it\u2019s not clear that the third way\u2019s vision of consensus politics is actually desirable in a democracy. As the late political scientist Peter Mair argued, a world in which major parties ideologically converge is one where party democracy becomes hollowed out and politicians become unresponsive to the demands of voters.</p> <p>The second weakness of anti-populism is that it creates an atmosphere where any politician that deviates from the \u201cnorm\u201d \u2013 that is, the centre-left or centre-right \u2013 risks being tarnished with the populism label. This can have sometimes end up delegitimising worthy challengers to the existing political consensus, which in turn means that we get stuck with more of the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The populism label is also often used to bundle together very different figures or parties. It is true that anti-populists usually acknowledge, correctly, that the threat posed by radical right populists, with their often explicit threats against minorities, tends to be far greater than that posed by populists on the left, who focus their anger on the economic elite. To see just how dangerous rightwing populism can be, look to India, where the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has passed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/22/narendra-modi-defends-contentious-citizenship-law-as-clashes-continue-india\" title=\"\">new laws</a> that effectively make the country\u2019s Muslim minority into second-class citizens, or the US, where Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric has inspired a spate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/aug/28/in-the-name-of-trump-supporters-attacks-database\" title=\"\">violent attacks</a> on minorities, journalists and opponents.</p> <p>Yet that doesn\u2019t stop some of the more fervent anti-populists drawing an equivalence between the populist left and right. Take, for example, the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pete-buttigieg-compares-bernie-sanders-supporters-to-trump-fans\" title=\"\">comments</a>, from 2019, about populist sentiment in the US: \u201cIt just kind of turns you against the system in general, and then you\u2019re more likely to want to vote to blow up the system. Which could lead you to somebody like Bernie, and it could lead you to somebody like Trump. That\u2019s how we got where we are.\u201d The message here is that Trump and Sanders are the same in being expressions of democratic discontent: the subtext is that such anti-system sentiment is immature, destructive and dangerous.</p> <p>Similarly, Mounk, who bills himself as \u201cone of the world\u2019s leading experts on the crisis of liberal democracy and the rise of populism\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/yascha-mounk-democracy/554786/\" title=\"\">argues</a> that there are good reasons to worry about the \u201cauthoritarian tendencies\u201d of left-populists \u201cwhether it\u2019s the Chavistas in Venezuela or even Podemos in Spain\u201d. This is because \u201cthe populist logic ultimately works the same way on the left as it does on the right: once you\u2019ve said that you alone speak for the whole of the people, any form of opposition to you immediately becomes illegitimate.\u201d</p> <p>While this may be the case in Venezuela, it is absurd to claim that the likes of Podemos, or more importantly, left populists who have actually held government \u2013 such as Syriza in Greece or Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in Mexico \u2013 pose as great a threat to democracy to someone like Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil or Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, who have well and truly set about dismantling liberal democracy in their respective countries.</p> <p>A third weakness of anti-populism is that when it becomes a dominant frame in our thinking about liberal-democratic politics, it tends to reinforce the false opposition between liberalism (with its rule of law, freedom of speech and checks and balances) and democracy (with its popular sovereignty and majoritarianism) \u2013 a binary, ironically, that populists also tend to promote. On one side, populists tend to argue that within liberal democracies, we\u2019ve gone too far towards the liberal side of things, with unelected bodies and elites undermining the voice of the people. On the other side, we have anti-populists seeking to fight populism tooth and nail, even if this means playing into arguably not-so-democratic solutions (such as attempting to rerun or ignore referendums that give the \u201cwrong\u201d result) or rigidly defending distant and not particularly representative or responsive institutions or bodies (such as the European troika in the battles over the Greek government debt crisis).</p> <p>But this opposition is too simplistic. As the political theorist Chantal Mouffe <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/2739-chantal-mouffe-and-the-crisis-of-liberal-democracy\" title=\"\">has argued</a>, the very strength of liberal democracy is that it is characterised by the productive tension between these two forces. If we go too far towards majoritarian-style democracy, we end up with mob rule; if we go too far towards liberalism, we end up with detached technocracy. Instead, we need liberalism and democracy to keep one another in line \u2013 pushing the other back when it oversteps its mark or is out of balance.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Setting aside these criticisms of anti-populism, there is a much simpler question that needs to be answered: does anti-populism actually work? Is it an effective way to stem the rise of populists? When it comes to opposing individual populist leaders, the answer often seems to be no. With Trump, for instance, the anti-populist approach favoured by Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2013 symbolised by her disastrous \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d comments \u2013 enhanced the feeling of ostracism and victimhood among his supporters, and burnished Trump\u2019s claims that he is hated by the elite, which only added to his populist appeal.</p> <p>Even when anti-populist leaders who claim to be beyond left or right have prevailed, such as Macron in France, the recipe has quickly soured. Macron\u2019s politics have taken a rightward turn; his popularity has taken an enormous hit; he faced sustained protest from the <em>gilets jaunes</em>; and some have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/28/emmanuel-macron-populism-french-president\" title=\"\">accused him</a> of \u201cenabling the populism he was supposed to defeat\u201d, as the standing of Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally, continues to rise.</p> <p>On the level of party politics, the evidence of anti-populism\u2019s efficacy is more mixed. On one hand, the most explicit form of anti-populism has come in the form of the <em>cordon sanitaire</em>, a French phrase that was originally used to describe the use of barriers to stop the spread of an infectious disease, but now means refusing to co-operate, negotiate or govern with the populist right. This worked in Belgium throughout the 1990s and 2000s, leading to the demise of the far-right Vlaams Blok and the poor showing of its successor party, Vlaams Belang. However, the same tactic has failed in Sweden, where a <em>cordon sanitaire</em> against the Sweden Democrats has played into their voters\u2019 sense of aggrievement. The party\u2019s share of the vote increased from 12.9% in 2014 (when the <em>cordon sanitaire</em> began) to 17.5% in 2018.</p> <p>A very different anti-populist tactic has been to try to beat populists, particularly rightwing populists, at their own game by co-opting their policies on immigration or multiculturalism \u2013 in the hope of stemming the \u201cdemand\u201d for populist alternatives to mainstream parties. In the Netherlands\u2019 2017 elections, centre-right Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte sought to stem the challenge from the populist radical right Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/f8cfd8b0f9d8491e8b4f42345762c241\" title=\"\">telling immigrants</a> who did not integrate to his liking to \u201cbehave normally or go away\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/19/dutch-election-rutte-wilders-good-populism-bad-\" title=\"\">defending</a> racist traditions such as the Dutch Christmas character Black Pete (<em>Zwarte Piet</em>).

      "bodyText": "You\u2019ve probably heard some version of it in recent years. Maybe you\u2019ve even said or thought it yourself. \u201cPoliticians are always fighting!\u201d \u201cPolitics has become totally irrational!\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t politicians just compromise, find some consensus and solve our problems?\u201d For many people, these views have come to seem like basic common sense. In this era of extreme partisanship, the argument goes, what we need is more unity and moderation to bring us together. And if there is one group of politicians who have been blamed for the sorry state we find ourselves in, it is populists. Since the twin shocks of 2016 \u2013 the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump \u2013 a cottage industry of authors, pundits and organisations has emerged with the shared goal of fighting populism. Books with names such as The People vs Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How Save It, and Anti-Pluralism: The Populist Threat to Liberal Democracy have been published on both sides of the Atlantic. Tony Blair has set up his Institute for Global Change to find \u201can answer to the new populism of left and right which exploits the anger and drives the world apart\u201d. Elsewhere, two of the most prominent politicians defeated by populist competitors, Hillary Clinton and Matteo Renzi, have offered their tips about how to stop populists (too little, too late). And in a truly remarkable bit of chutzpah, populist extraordinaire Silvio Berlusconi has tried to reinvent himself as a pro-EU unifier, here to save Italy from populism. Even the pontiff has warned against populism, with Pope Francis stating that \u201cpopulism is evil and ends badly\u201d. What unites these self-styled defenders of democracy, ready to roll up their sleeves and take the apparent populist scourge head-on? It\u2019s certainly not a clear ideology. Nor is it opposition to a particular variety of populism. It is something far more disparate than that. So how about we just call this phenomenon, simply, anti-populism? While populism itself has received an enormous amount of media attention over the past several years, anti-populism has not. Yet this is somewhat curious, given that anti-populism \u2013 with its call for a more sensible, moderate politics \u2013 has become one of the most widely held views across the western political mainstream. It\u2019s not hard to see why anti-populist ideas are popular: they have intuitive appeal in a time when two-party politics seems to be breaking down in the US, UK and Australia; when genuinely dangerous rightwing populists are winning power across the world; and when politics and public debate seem increasingly divisive and volatile. In this context, the key values of anti-populism \u2013 civility, maturity, deliberation \u2013 sound rather nice. Yet it is worth asking how we got to this point, and considering how opposing populism \u2013 a term that in some contexts, particularly in the US, until recently had positive connotations \u2013 became the supposedly sensible position to take. Crucially, it is also worth asking whether anti-populism is effective. If the aim is to defeat populists, do the solutions proposed by the anti-populists \u2013 running the gamut from borrowing some populist policies to refusing to negotiate with them at all \u2013 actually work? Or do they ultimately succumb to what the philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has called \u201cthe populist temptation\u201d: where the self-declared opponents of populism end up becoming a watered-down version of the thing they were fighting against in the first place? * * * Unlike other \u201cisms\u201d, anti-populism is not a clear ideological disposition or mode of governance, but rather an odd mix of ideological and strategic allies pulled together in a temporary coalition. Anti-populism can draw together politicians from all over the left-right spectrum. They don\u2019t have a shared view of the role of the state, military intervention, fiscal regulation and so on \u2013 but what they do share is a broader vision of how politics should be \u201cdone\u201d. Although populists on the left and right clearly have very different stances, there are a number of things that tend to unite them \u2013 and mobilise anti-populists\u2019 concerns. First, while populists appeal to \u201cthe people\u201d against \u201cthe elite\u201d, anti-populists see this as a crude and patently false way to divide society. The political theorist Jan-Werner M\u00fcller argues that populists\u2019 \u201cidea of the single, homogenous, authentic people is a fantasy\u201d. Instead, anti-populists argue that we should acknowledge that there are many overlapping, competing characterisations of \u201cthe people\u201d in society, and that such collective identities are only ever made up by individuals anyway. This liberal individualism chafes against populism\u2019s insistence on groups \u2013 the people and the elite \u2013 as the primary actors in political struggles. Anti-populists also tend to object to the nationalist and even isolationist visions that that idea of \u201cthe people\u201d implies. While populists of both the right and left tend to be critics of globalisation \u2013 variously blaming it for increasing migration, weakening national sovereignty or lowering wages \u2013 anti-populists tend to defend a world of free markets and free movement of peoples, as well as acknowledging the important role of transnational economic and political bodies in our globally interdependent era. Second, populists tend to champion political mechanisms that allegedly give voice to the people (such as referendums, plebiscites and forms of direct democracy), whereas anti-populists see such mechanisms as rather crude and divisive, potentially leading to mob rule. For anti-populists, politics is a relatively rational activity in which politicians debate one another, hopefully finding consensus by convincing the other side with the strength of their arguments. For them, politics is not a battle of passions, but rather something of a puzzle to be solved. This is a supposedly rational view of politics \u2013 sober, mature and graceful \u2013 against the allegedly immature, kneejerk and sensational politics of populists. This notion of rationality is central to anti-populism. Populists are cast as peddlers of lies, manipulating people\u2019s emotions, playing on their basest fears and whipping up hysteria, while anti-populists see themselves as taking a clear-eyed view of the world. This is evident in the way \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cpost-truth\u201d have somehow become synonymous with populism: while populists are relativists who bend reality to their will, anti-populists see themselves as concerned with the capital-T Truth. Anti-populists also share an opposition to the way that populists behave in the political sphere. While populists are often defined by their bad manners \u2013 think here of Donald Trump\u2019s lack of respect for any modicum of decorum, or of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines calling Barack Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d \u2013 anti-populists find such breaches of the supposed rules of political conduct inexcusable. Furthermore, they are dismayed by populists\u2019 lack of respect for proceduralism \u2013 that is, populists\u2019 tendency to crash through the usual processes of checks and balances. Anti-populists have a more West Wing-esque vision of politics as full of people with (generally) good intentions, who might have different ideological views, but who above all respect the rules of the game. Connected to all this, perhaps the most important tendency of anti-populism, is a valourisation of consensus in politics. For anti-populists, we are no longer living in \u201cordinary times\u201d in which consensus rules. Characterising these good old days, the political scientist and journalist Yascha Mounk notes that for decades, \u201cdeveloped democracies in North America, western Europe and beyond appeared to be remarkably stable. Moderate parties and politicians were dominant. Independent institutions were strong. A broad political consensus created a sense that the future was highly predictable.\u201d For anti-populists, a return to this consensus would represent a healthy return to \u201cnormal\u201d politics. * * * Yet it is worth asking the question: when it comes to politics, what is normality anyway? Behind such calls for consensus and order, there are some significant problems with anti-populism. For one thing, there is little questioning of who this particular consensus actually worked for. Some would argue that the alleged consensus of post-cold war politics was actually the result of the capitulation of the centre-left to the right, rather than any real moderation. The anti-populist call for consensus politics in many ways resembles the third way \u201cbeyond left or right\u201d position offered by Blair and the British sociologist Anthony Giddens in the 90s, and adapted by parties and leaders across the world. One cannot help but feel a sense of deja vu \u2013 in 2002, in the face of populist Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s progression to the second round of the French presidential elections, Giddens wrote that \u201cthe renewed polarisation of politics on the left and right is plainly threatening to political stability\u201d, and that \u201cthe third way can beat the far right by modernising, liberalising and being tough on immigration\u201d. Fast-forward 16 years, and we find Blair singing from the same hymnbook, claiming that \u201cthe political space for argument and debate has become very, very hard to curate and understand because everything is just sucked into this vortex of highly inflamed political rhetoric and exchanges of position without people trying to really reach much common ground\u201d, and arguing that the way to fight the far right is by forcing migrants to integrate more. And it\u2019s not only Blair and his coterie: the international enthusiasm for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cnot left, nor right\u201d politics in France is also evidence of an attempted rehabilitation of the third way, with Macron decrying the \u201cpopulist and nationalist leprosy\u201d of Europe. Here, one starts to get the feeling that addressing the so-called populist threat is less about fighting actual populism, and more about rehabilitating and rebranding the third way for a new era. But it\u2019s not clear that the third way\u2019s vision of consensus politics is actually desirable in a democracy. As the late political scientist Peter Mair argued, a world in which major parties ideologically converge is one where party democracy becomes hollowed out and politicians become unresponsive to the demands of voters. The second weakness of anti-populism is that it creates an atmosphere where any politician that deviates from the \u201cnorm\u201d \u2013 that is, the centre-left or centre-right \u2013 risks being tarnished with the populism label. This can have sometimes end up delegitimising worthy challengers to the existing political consensus, which in turn means that we get stuck with more of the same. The populism label is also often used to bundle together very different figures or parties. It is true that anti-populists usually acknowledge, correctly, that the threat posed by radical right populists, with their often explicit threats against minorities, tends to be far greater than that posed by populists on the left, who focus their anger on the economic elite. To see just how dangerous rightwing populism can be, look to India, where the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has passed new laws that effectively make the country\u2019s Muslim minority into second-class citizens, or the US, where Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric has inspired a spate of violent attacks on minorities, journalists and opponents. Yet that doesn\u2019t stop some of the more fervent anti-populists drawing an equivalence between the populist left and right. Take, for example, the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg\u2019s comments, from 2019, about populist sentiment in the US: \u201cIt just kind of turns you against the system in general, and then you\u2019re more likely to want to vote to blow up the system. Which could lead you to somebody like Bernie, and it could lead you to somebody like Trump. That\u2019s how we got where we are.\u201d The message here is that Trump and Sanders are the same in being expressions of democratic discontent: the subtext is that such anti-system sentiment is immature, destructive and dangerous. Similarly, Mounk, who bills himself as \u201cone of the world\u2019s leading experts on the crisis of liberal democracy and the rise of populism\u201d, argues that there are good reasons to worry about the \u201cauthoritarian tendencies\u201d of left-populists \u201cwhether it\u2019s the Chavistas in Venezuela or even Podemos in Spain\u201d. This is because \u201cthe populist logic ultimately works the same way on the left as it does on the right: once you\u2019ve said that you alone speak for the whole of the people, any form of opposition to you immediately becomes illegitimate.\u201d While this may be the case in Venezuela, it is absurd to claim that the likes of Podemos, or more importantly, left populists who have actually held government \u2013 such as Syriza in Greece or Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in Mexico \u2013 pose as great a threat to democracy to someone like Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil or Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, who have well and truly set about dismantling liberal democracy in their respective countries. A third weakness of anti-populism is that when it becomes a dominant frame in our thinking about liberal-democratic politics, it tends to reinforce the false opposition between liberalism (with its rule of law, freedom of speech and checks and balances) and democracy (with its popular sovereignty and majoritarianism) \u2013 a binary, ironically, that populists also tend to promote. On one side, populists tend to argue that within liberal democracies, we\u2019ve gone too far towards the liberal side of things, with unelected bodies and elites undermining the voice of the people. On the other side, we have anti-populists seeking to fight populism tooth and nail, even if this means playing into arguably not-so-democratic solutions (such as attempting to rerun or ignore referendums that give the \u201cwrong\u201d result) or rigidly defending distant and not particularly representative or responsive institutions or bodies (such as the European troika in the battles over the Greek government debt crisis). But this opposition is too simplistic. As the political theorist Chantal Mouffe has argued, the very strength of liberal democracy is that it is characterised by the productive tension between these two forces. If we go too far towards majoritarian-style democracy, we end up with mob rule; if we go too far towards liberalism, we end up with detached technocracy. Instead, we need liberalism and democracy to keep one another in line \u2013 pushing the other back when it oversteps its mark or is out of balance. * * * Setting aside these criticisms of anti-populism, there is a much simpler question that needs to be answered: does anti-populism actually work? Is it an effective way to stem the rise of populists? When it comes to opposing individual populist leaders, the answer often seems to be no. With Trump, for instance, the anti-populist approach favoured by Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2013 symbolised by her disastrous \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d comments \u2013 enhanced the feeling of ostracism and victimhood among his supporters, and burnished Trump\u2019s claims that he is hated by the elite, which only added to his populist appeal. Even when anti-populist leaders who claim to be beyond left or right have prevailed, such as Macron in France, the recipe has quickly soured. Macron\u2019s politics have taken a rightward turn; his popularity has taken an enormous hit; he faced sustained protest from the gilets jaunes; and some have accused him of \u201cenabling the populism he was supposed to defeat\u201d, as the standing of Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally, continues to rise. On the level of party politics, the evidence of anti-populism\u2019s efficacy is more mixed. On one hand, the most explicit form of anti-populism has come in the form of the cordon sanitaire, a French phrase that was originally used to describe the use of barriers to stop the spread of an infectious disease, but now means refusing to co-operate, negotiate or govern with the populist right. This worked in Belgium throughout the 1990s and 2000s, leading to the demise of the far-right Vlaams Blok and the poor showing of its successor party, Vlaams Belang. However, the same tactic has failed in Sweden, where a cordon sanitaire against the Sweden Democrats has played into their voters\u2019 sense of aggrievement. The party\u2019s share of the vote increased from 12.9% in 2014 (when the cordon sanitaire began) to 17.5% in 2018. A very different anti-populist tactic has been to try to beat populists, particularly rightwing populists, at their own game by co-opting their policies on immigration or multiculturalism \u2013 in the hope of stemming the \u201cdemand\u201d for populist alternatives to mainstream parties. In the Netherlands\u2019 2017 elections, centre-right Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte sought to stem the challenge from the populist radical right Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom by telling immigrants who did not integrate to his liking to \u201cbehave normally or go away\u201d, and defending racist traditions such as the Dutch Christmas character Black Pete (Zwarte Piet). When his party won the election, Rutte then claimed that his \u201cgood populism\u201d had defeated the radical right\u2019s \u201cbad populism\u201d (a tactic he has since abandoned as new right-populist challengers have emerged in the Netherlands). Similar debates are currently taking place in the Labour parties of the UK and Australia following their recent electoral defeats, where some are suggesting the left needs to move rightwards on immigration. The problem with this tactic is that while it might sometimes work in the short term, it doesn\u2019t defeat populism in the long term. In my native Australia, the centre-right Coalition shut down the political success of the populist radical right One Nation party in the late 90s by co-opting many of its policies. While One Nation itself suffered, its ideas were transferred into the political mainstream and legitimised, leading to a depressing race to the bottom by the major parties on issues of immigration and asylum seekers in Australia. The result is that Australia now has one of the most punitive asylum detention regimes in the western world \u2013 to the extent that Trump, in a leaked conversation with Australia\u2019s prime minister in 2017, admiringly said of the system: \u201cThat is a good idea. We should do that too. You are worse than I am.\u201d When you are attracting the praise and adulation of Trump, along with other radical right populists, this does not seem like a great anti-populist victory. This is the great danger of co-opting populist policies: it is hard to avoid ending up actually doing many of the things that you criticise populists for. In the name of staving off the threat of National Rally in France, the centre-right Republicans party has adopted much of its platform; mandatory assimilation or integration classes have been put in place by several European governments, such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, that otherwise present themselves as active in the fight against populism; and while the leader of the European People\u2019s party in the EU parliament, Manfred Weber, has presented himself as an anti-populist and defender of liberal democracy, he has in reality shielded arch-populist Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party from any serious sanctions for years. The hypocrisy on show here is unavoidable. The populist temptation is strong for a reason: the elite often deserve their unpopularity and disdain; the media landscape favours populist messaging; and we seem to be pinballing from crisis to crisis. All of this plays into the hands of those who can speak cannily in the name of the people against the elite. Anti-populism, by contrast, struggles in this context. It is clear that we are not living in times conducive to consensus politics. Rather, it seems that populists and anti-populists alike are driven by a nostalgia for days gone by. Populists seek a simpler imagined time, where jobs were plentiful, national sovereignty was intact and borders were stronger. Anti-populists, too, are stuck in the past, imagining a time of consensus politics, a supposedly sane and rational period where consensus reigned, and representatives worked together to solve political problems for the greater good. The reality is that we are no longer living in either of these situations. The question is which side will snap out of its daydream first \u2013 and in the long term, what the ultimate cost will be if we choose to stay asleep. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

This is where 20 years ago the teenage Camille Berthomier became obsessed with music and escaping to London, far from Catholicism and sexual repression. \u201cIn my head, it was always about leaving,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then I moved properly at 20, 21, and didn\u2019t really look back.\u201d</p> <p>When she met Nicolas Cong\u00e9 16 years ago, they christened themselves Jehnny Beth and Johnny Hostile and played together from 2006 to 2011, although they\u2019re still a couple. Then Beth joined uncompromising punk four-piece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/14/savages-adore-life-review-the-looser-lighter-sound-of-a-band-moving-forward\" title=\"\">Savages</a>, who, given rock\u2019s dwindling currency, are one of Britain\u2019s only recent significant bands: two Mercury-nominated albums; transcendent shows where Beth commanded fans to abandon distraction and embrace desire. They were also weirdly controversial, with misogynist critics certain they were manufactured; a retrograde tribute band without a cause. Whole articles were written about the fact that they didn\u2019t smile much. Today, Beth laughs raucously, sometimes out of self-deprecation, sometimes at my delusion that I could persuade her to reveal things she has absolutely no intention of revealing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd3b6b05f06d0bb1f24557232ebfc6f1d9d11cc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3b6b05f06d0bb1f24557232ebfc6f1d9d11cc0/0_313_2499_3122/800.jpg\" alt=\"Beth with Johnny Hostile, 2007.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth with Johnny Hostile, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from music company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The band offered the freedom she had craved. \u201cYou\u2019re a gang against the world,\u201d she says.

I found some sharpness again, creatively, from putting myself on edge.\u201d</p> <p>Beth has never exactly taken the soft option \u2013 she sobered up in 2013 in part to experience the unadulterated exposure of playing live, and routinely intimidated journalists with her withering gaze and frank sex talk. Still, David Bowie\u2019s death in 2016 reinvigorated her do-or-die mentality. \u201cYou spend a lot of time in life saying: \u2018I\u2019ll do this one day, I\u2019ll say to this person, I love you, I\u2019ll \u2026\u201d She pauses: \u201cStart crochet!\u201d (Nobody in history has been less likely to start crochet.)</p> <p>\u201cIt was a moment of urgency,\u201d she adds, \u201cwhere I felt I needed to <em>do</em> instead of saying: \u2018I\u2019ll do it some time.\u2019 Whenever I can, I need to revisit that feeling.\u201d</p> <p>That also involved looking back. Hostile had moved to Paris (they have an open relationship; she enjoyed the space). When the opportunity arose to get a studio, she followed him, started therapy and the process of reconciling herself with a past that she had rejected so successfully, she could now better express herself in English. \u201cIn your 20s, you search for who you are,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt I had done that \u2013 Savages being the loudest expression of that \u2013 and it was time to not forget.\u201d</p> <p>In London, Beth had distanced herself from home, valuing the family she had found in music because she had chosen it: \u201cI wanted to find who I was and not necessarily be only the product of my upbringing.\u201d She couldn\u2019t do that, such as expressing her bisexuality, \u201cif I have to still be my parents\u2019 daughter\u201d.

Beth says she experiences those anxieties like everybody else: \u201cThat you\u2019re afraid you\u2019re not up to the task.\u201d She also shows a softer side. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to show you really care,\u201d she apologises to a lover on the ballad French Countryside.</p> <p>With Savages, she sung about sex, but never intimacy. \u201cI liked the contrast,\u201d she says. \u201cFour women with aggression in the music, that was something I felt I hadn\u2019t seen before. Four women talking about care, that didn\u2019t seem like something that was missing.\u201d She sidelined softness \u201cas an artistic decision\u201d. It\u2019s only recently that she discovered her nurturing side. \u201cI can take care of people who are suffering,\u201d she says, heavily. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could.\u201d</p> <p>If the album has a theme, says Beth, it is \u201cthe multiplicity and complexity of being human\u201d. She mentions raging single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQCBCJkG5Y\" title=\"\">I\u2019m the Man</a>, where she embodies a hated figure: \u201cThere\u2019s no bitch in town who doesn\u2019t understand how hard my dick can be,\u201d she sneers. She is disappointed to see it labelled a \u201cgender song\u201d; for her it was about how \u201cwe sometimes love people who have done things that we think are monstrous, but we can\u2019t deny that we belong to the same humanity. We have to face the human truth that evil exists in the world\u201d.</p> <p>She won\u2019t say what inspired the song, but it seems linked to a story in Crimes Against Love Manifesto, a book of graphic sex writing (accompanied by Hostile\u2019s photos) that she is publishing this summer. One story, The Millionaire, describes a disgraced man who undergoes ritual humiliation to edify people who want to witness \u201cthe version of the world you believe in\u201d. The song and the story seem clearly about a Weinstein type. \u201cNo,\u201d Beth says categorically. No? \u201cNo!\u201d She swears she hadn\u2019t thought of that, and sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t do activist art, OK? I don\u2019t have anything to defend.\u201d The book shouldn\u2019t be read from \u201ca social or moral\u201d perspective, she insists. \u201cThat\u2019s not what art is supposed to be. I wrote something that belongs to the land of the imagination and to fantasy and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s political.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQCBCJkG5Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sUQCBCJkG5Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But stories about a paedophilic liaison and a man biting a woman\u2019s neck during sex and eventually consuming her directly challenge social mores. That is implicitly political. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I like to find humanity in monsters,\u201d she says. \u201cBut also, fantasies are not real. There shouldn\u2019t be any boundaries in that. What I\u2019m interested in is the freedom of the imagination about sexuality and the fact that behind closed doors, when you\u2019re not hurting anybody, you can imagine and do whatever you want.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should tell you this,\u201d she says of the cannibalism story, \u201cbut whatever. It\u2019s the one that made me the most horny when I was writing it, which I didn\u2019t expect. It\u2019s so strange, the way we\u2019re connected. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t judge myself for it: it\u2019s exactly as if you were judging your dream.\u201d Still, she knows the book might be too ripe for some: \u201cDe Sade was not read during his time, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/07/marquis-de-sade-120-days-of-sodom-published-classic\" title=\"\">read the century after</a>!\u201d</p> <p>While some critics dismissed Savages for being defiantly apolitical, their purpose \u2013 deeper self-understanding, uncompromising pleasure \u2013 is evident in the decisive Beth, who annihilated the Catholic guilt that taught her \u201cthat even a thought could be a sin\u201d, never mind sexuality itself. For her, fantasies are creatively inspiring, sex a safe form of exploration. \u201cEven if you surrender control, you\u2019re still in control,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re able to scare yourself but not be hurt.\u201d The stage is similar. \u201cYou can scare the shit out of yourself! But once you understand you\u2019re absolutely safe, suddenly you can do anything \u2013 look at Iggy Pop. I see sex the same way \u2013 a wonderful way to test yourself. It is important because once you test yourself, you know yourself. You need that as a person and you need that as an artist.\u201d</p> <p>She takes the role seriously. While writing the album, a song called Heroism kept eluding her. Madley-Croft, then Flood, then Hostile, pushed her towards what she really wanted to say: \u201cAll I want is, all I need, is to be a heroine.\u201d The title changed. \u201cIt took me all these people to realise that sometimes you look for role models everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you have to think: I am the role model and I have to accept that.\u201d</p> <p>If the art that lasts \u201cshows us our complexity and asks us, why do I desire that? Or why do I not want it?\u201d says Beth, \u201cI would like to be a mirror for that.\u201d What happens at the end of that questioning? \u201cThere isn\u2019t <em>one</em> answer,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so disturbing for people.\u201d She returns to the book and the potential for it to be misunderstood as readers seek definitive explanations. \u201cThey don\u2019t wanna stay in the space where living must occur. I wanna stay in the place where <em>thinking</em> must occur,\u201d she says severely. \u201cFuck the closure. Fuck the full stop.\u201d</p> <p><em>To Love Is to Live is out on 8 May on Caroline.</em></p>",

But once you understand you\u2019re absolutely safe, suddenly you can do anything \u2013 look at Iggy Pop. I see sex the same way \u2013 a wonderful way to test yourself. It is important because once you test yourself, you know yourself. You need that as a person and you need that as an artist.\u201d She takes the role seriously. While writing the album, a song called Heroism kept eluding her. Madley-Croft, then Flood, then Hostile, pushed her towards what she really wanted to say: \u201cAll I want is, all I need, is to be a heroine.\u201d The title changed. \u201cIt took me all these people to realise that sometimes you look for role models everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you have to think: I am the role model and I have to accept that.\u201d If the art that lasts \u201cshows us our complexity and asks us, why do I desire that? Or why do I not want it?\u201d says Beth, \u201cI would like to be a mirror for that.\u201d What happens at the end of that questioning? \u201cThere isn\u2019t one answer,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so disturbing for people.\u201d She returns to the book and the potential for it to be misunderstood as readers seek definitive explanations. \u201cThey don\u2019t wanna stay in the space where living must occur. I wanna stay in the place where thinking must occur,\u201d she says severely. \u201cFuck the closure. Fuck the full stop.\u201d To Love Is to Live is out on 8 May on Caroline.",

The accepted wisdom was that the Polynesian settlers of the Chatham Islands, who arrived hundreds of years before M\u0101ori, were wiped out by invading M\u0101ori tribes, who killed and enslaved their population after landing on the islands in 1835. But more than 600 years since the Moriori arrived in New Zealand, their descendants have signed a treaty with the government that enshrines their rights and been awarded NZ$18m in compensation. The treaty includes an agreed historical account and a Crown apology. The settlement package includes the transfer of lands of cultural and spiritual significance to Moriori on R\u0113kohu (Chatham Islands) and Rangihaute (Pitt Island) as cultural redress, and $18m in financial redress. In the 1990s the Moriori began to rebuild their culture and traditions, officially becoming recognised as the Chatham Islands\u2019 Indigenous inhabitants in a Waitangi tribunal decision. According to the 2006 census, 945 people said they were of Moriori descent and today the New Zealand government recognised their decades-long struggle for recognition. The chief negotiator for the Moriori, Maui Solomon, said the settlement had brought his tribe and their descendants some peace. \u201cThe truth is that Moriori made a conscious decision to set aside warfare and killing and to live in peace over 600 years ago,\u201d Solomon told RNZ. \u201cThey adhered to this ancient law of peace even when their island was invaded in 1835 and have maintained this unbroken covenant to the present day.\u201d Treaty negotiations minister Andrew Little said \u201cmyths and misconceptions\u201d had circulated for years about the Moriori, with some children being told they had gone extinct, or indeed never existed at all. \u201cWhat I learnt at school was that Moriori were gone, they were an original race and they were effectively eliminated by M\u0101ori,\u201d he said. \u201cThe claims by Moriori were first filed in 1988.

      "body": "<p>In 2017 Dmitry Ananiev was at the peak of his success. He and his brother Alexei owned a bank, an IT firm and an office complex overlooking the Moscow River. There was a <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/embezzled-russian-art-found-1701258\">Russian art collection</a> (Alexei\u2019s), a private plane and \u2013 of course \u2013 a yacht. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/dmitry-ananyev/#536adde67b7b\">Forbes</a> put Ananiev\u2019s fortune at $1.4bn. For seven years he served as a senator in Russia\u2019s upper chamber.</p> \n<p>Three years on, Ananiev\u2019s circumstances have changed dramatically. In late 2017 the authorities seized his bank, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/02/24/what-happens-when-a-russian-bank-goes-bust/#7d1011877655\">Proms</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/02/24/what-happens-when-a-russian-bank-goes-bust/#7d1011877655\">vyazbank</a>, alleging holes in its balance sheet. Russian prosecutors accuse him of fraud and money-laundering. A court in London has frozen his assets. Angry Russian investors say he ripped them off and misrepresented the bank\u2019s financial health.</p> \n<p>Ananiev, however, says his case is a textbook example of how any businessman in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia can fall into the mincer. \u201cI\u2019m presented as a criminal. It doesn\u2019t connect in my head,\u201d he says, speaking in his first interview with a western newspaper since he fled Moscow two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a really unpleasant feeling when you see your country trying to hit you.\u201d</p> \n<p>In recent years there has been a steady stream of exiles from Russia to the villas and mansions of Cyprus, Monaco and Mayfair. Some of them are long-term opponents of Putin, who last month unveiled constitutional plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/putin-calls-for-constitution-changes-that-would-weaken-successor\">to extend his rule indefinitely. </a>Others from Russia\u2019s ruling inner circle suddenly develop an opposition voice after going abroad.</p> \n<p>Ananiev claims he is in the independent camp, having built up a successful business over 25 years, only to see the state whisk it away. Since 2018 he has been living in comfortable exile in Cyprus. His home <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/26/cyprus-russian-invasion\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/26/cyprus-russian-invasion\">Limassol</a> is a colonial-style, bougainvillea-covered property overlooking the sea, with a garden of palms, spiky pines and sparrows.</p> \n<p>In his analysis, KGB-trained officials with little understanding of the market are ruining Russia. The Kremlin has taken strategic areas of the economy under quasi-state ownership \u2013 first oil and gas, and from 2010 onwards, banks, he says. The method involves gobbling up private assets. Officials, however, insist they are merely cleaning up corrupt crony-run banks, in a sector that got out of control.</p> \n<p>Ananiev says his problems began around 2015 after the west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/12/europe-russia-sanctions-ukraine-kalashnikov\">imposed sanctions on Moscow.</a> Russia\u2019s central bank \u2013 on whose supervisory board he sat \u2013 decided to help the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/12/europe-russia-sanctions-ukraine-kalashnikov\">struggling defence industry</a>. Their idea was to nationalise Ananiev\u2019s privately owned bank, which he founded in 1995, and make it a special lender to the military.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey told me several times. If you don\u2019t [sell], a criminal case awaits you,\u201d he says. He received death threats. They were delivered by phone and email. Suspicious cars followed him around. As the pressure grew, Ananiev developed heart problems. He blames this ugly campaign on Russia\u2019s security agencies and the \u201coppressive machine of the state\u201d.</p> \n<p>In December 2017 the central bank took over Promsvyazbank, saying it was undercapitalised and loaded with bad risk. Ananiev fled to Cyprus with his family, including his 85-year-old mother. His brother stayed in Russia for another year trying to salvage their business empire. Their assets, including another bank, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0af7f5e8-9fcc-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4\">Vozrozhdenie</a>, were all lost. Alexei is now in London.</p> \n<p>A former insider, Ananiev is reluctant to criticise Putin directly. But he describes Russia\u2019s political system as a \u201cone-man show\u201d and says a terrified elite wait on the president\u2019s every decision. Five well known close friends of Putin are in charge, he says. Anyone who has an independent position is vulnerable to arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>The Kremlin\u2019s statist approach has led to weak economic growth, with Russia\u2019s GDP smaller than Italy\u2019s, he argues. With its vast natural resources Russia could be the world\u2019s richest country. Instead, it is in the grip of decline and stagnation. It is currently unable to produce anything the world wants to buy, he says.

      "bodyText": "In 2017 Dmitry Ananiev was at the peak of his success. He and his brother Alexei owned a bank, an IT firm and an office complex overlooking the Moscow River. There was a Russian art collection (Alexei\u2019s), a private plane and \u2013 of course \u2013 a yacht. Forbes put Ananiev\u2019s fortune at $1.4bn. For seven years he served as a senator in Russia\u2019s upper chamber. Three years on, Ananiev\u2019s circumstances have changed dramatically. In late 2017 the authorities seized his bank, Promsvyazbank, alleging holes in its balance sheet. Russian prosecutors accuse him of fraud and money-laundering. A court in London has frozen his assets. Angry Russian investors say he ripped them off and misrepresented the bank\u2019s financial health. Ananiev, however, says his case is a textbook example of how any businessman in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia can fall into the mincer. \u201cI\u2019m presented as a criminal. It doesn\u2019t connect in my head,\u201d he says, speaking in his first interview with a western newspaper since he fled Moscow two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a really unpleasant feeling when you see your country trying to hit you.\u201d In recent years there has been a steady stream of exiles from Russia to the villas and mansions of Cyprus, Monaco and Mayfair. Some of them are long-term opponents of Putin, who last month unveiled constitutional plans to extend his rule indefinitely. Others from Russia\u2019s ruling inner circle suddenly develop an opposition voice after going abroad. Ananiev claims he is in the independent camp, having built up a successful business over 25 years, only to see the state whisk it away. Since 2018 he has been living in comfortable exile in Cyprus. His home in Limassol is a colonial-style, bougainvillea-covered property overlooking the sea, with a garden of palms, spiky pines and sparrows. In his analysis, KGB-trained officials with little understanding of the market are ruining Russia. The Kremlin has taken strategic areas of the economy under quasi-state ownership \u2013 first oil and gas, and from 2010 onwards, banks, he says. The method involves gobbling up private assets. Officials, however, insist they are merely cleaning up corrupt crony-run banks, in a sector that got out of control. Ananiev says his problems began around 2015 after the west imposed sanctions on Moscow. Russia\u2019s central bank \u2013 on whose supervisory board he sat \u2013 decided to help the country\u2019s struggling defence industry. Their idea was to nationalise Ananiev\u2019s privately owned bank, which he founded in 1995, and make it a special lender to the military. \u201cThey told me several times. If you don\u2019t [sell], a criminal case awaits you,\u201d he says. He received death threats. They were delivered by phone and email. Suspicious cars followed him around. As the pressure grew, Ananiev developed heart problems. He blames this ugly campaign on Russia\u2019s security agencies and the \u201coppressive machine of the state\u201d. In December 2017 the central bank took over Promsvyazbank, saying it was undercapitalised and loaded with bad risk. Ananiev fled to Cyprus with his family, including his 85-year-old mother. His brother stayed in Russia for another year trying to salvage their business empire. Their assets, including another bank, Vozrozhdenie, were all lost. Alexei is now in London. A former insider, Ananiev is reluctant to criticise Putin directly. But he describes Russia\u2019s political system as a \u201cone-man show\u201d and says a terrified elite wait on the president\u2019s every decision. Five well known close friends of Putin are in charge, he says. Anyone who has an independent position is vulnerable to arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d he says. The Kremlin\u2019s statist approach has led to weak economic growth, with Russia\u2019s GDP smaller than Italy\u2019s, he argues. With its vast natural resources Russia could be the world\u2019s richest country. Instead, it is in the grip of decline and stagnation. It is currently unable to produce anything the world wants to buy, he says. Ordinary Cypriots \u2013 with fewer natural advantages \u2013 are better off. A Moscow court has demanded his arrest and Ananiev is consequently nervous about leaving Cyprus. He points to the fate of Sergei Skripal \u2013 the former GRU officer poisoned in 2018 in Salisbury \u2013 and to the assassination last August of a Chechen exile in a Berlin park. \u201cThe security agencies can hit anybody without evidence. They create the evidence,\u201d he says. As a senator Ananiev represented the Yamal region of north-west Siberia. In 2013 he quit the upper chamber, unhappy \u2013 he says \u2013 that it rubber-stamped laws. He describes Russian politics as a \u201cmuppet show\u201d, devoid of meaningful debate. \u201cAt least with the muppet show it\u2019s possible to change the muppets once they get older,\u201d he notes.

      "body": "<p>Germany was plunged into political crisis this week when members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) \u2013 a conservative party that has governed and shaped the country in 50 out of the past 70 years \u2013 defied a party ban on cooperating with the rightwing populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), siding with them to elect a state leader in the small eastern state of Thuringia.</p> <p>The shock move highlighted the inability of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the CDU\u2019s leader, to impose discipline.</p> <p>It also laid bare the deep shifts in German politics, as well as emphasising the divisions within the CDU over whether it should continue on the centrist course of its previous leader and current chancellor, Angela Merkel, or embrace a more vigorous conservatism in the hope of winning back some of the millions of voters it has lost to the AfD.</p> <h2><strong>Who </strong><strong>is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> <p>The 57-year-old was supposed to be the vehicle by which Merkel could elegantly slip out of office. She would not only take over the reins of the CDU and, by extension, be the party\u2019s lead candidate for the chancellery, but would preserve her legacy, hence her nickname of \u201cmini-Merkel\u201d. At least that is what Merkel \u2013 who is serving her final term in office \u2013 had hoped. Kramp-Karrenbauer was a relatively low-key political figure when she was narrowly elected into the post of CDU leader in December 2018, having previously served as the party\u2019s deputy leader for less than a year. Prior to that, she had governed the small western German state of Saarland.</p> <h2>Was she popular?</h2> <p>German voters were never in favour of Kramp-Karrenbauer becoming chancellor and she had a rocky ride from the start, suffering a string of embarrassing gaffes \u2013 including a joke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/04/cdu-leader-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-gender-neutral-bathrooms-row\">about gender-neutral toilets</a> \u2013 and comments on fake news, on which she was forced to backtrack. More significantly, she failed to unite the party on its trickiest topic: migration. Divisions had been opened up by Merkel\u2019s open-door policy on refugees in late 2015, which led to the arrival of almost a million newcomers and fuelled the rise of the AfD. As the party rowed, it lost increasing numbers of voters to both the Greens and the AfD, whose rise in eastern Germany in particular has threatened to topple the CDU as the largest conservative force. </p> <h2>Why was she forced to step down?</h2> <p>Kramp-Karrenbauer said she did not have the full backing of the party, and that was borne out by events in Thuringia, where she had expressly ordered the CDU\u2019s delegates not to cooperate with the AfD but they did so anyway. The fallout continued when Kramp-Karrenbauer called for new elections to take place in the state but was ignored by local party leaders. She had little choice but to resign. Her rivals within the party, who made it clear they would not support her, are expected to run against her for the office.</p> <h2>Is Merkel still in charge?</h2> <p>She is still the chancellor and so remains the most powerful politician in Germany. But the fact that her succession plans have badly failed means that in her remaining months in office she increasingly resembles a lame duck. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s resignation may speed up Merkel\u2019s departure, because she is seen at least in part to blame for the debacle: with Merkel still in office, Kramp-Karrenbauer inevitably lacked authority not least because she didn\u2019t have the final say on government policy. But the Social Democrats, the junior partners in the grand coalition government, have said they will resign if Merkel is ousted ahead of schedule, which would most likely lead to early elections, so she is expected to stay in place until elections in 2021.</p> <h2><strong>Who will replace Kramp-Karrenbauer</strong><strong> now?</strong></h2> <p>There are three main contenders for the job. One is Friedrich Merz, a prominent CDU member who in December 2018 campaigned on a ticket of shifting the party more to the right, and narrowly lost to Kramp-Karrenbauer. He has blamed Merkel for creating a culture in which conflict is avoided, which has led to a repression of political aspirations on which the AfD have seized. In a poll, about 13% of Germans said they could imagine him as chancellor.</p> <p>Jens Spahn, the health minister, came third in the December 2018 contest. At 39, the youngest candidate by some way, he has previously been a staunch critic of Merkel\u2019s refugee policy. The same poll showed he would have only 4.7% of support.</p> <p>Armin Laschet is the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia and the candidate most likely to continue Merkel\u2019s more moderate path. Unlike the other two, he has yet to state his intentions.</p> <h2>What would happen if there was a general election tomorrow?</h2> <p>The latest polls compiled by Statista show the CDU would top polling with 27-29%, the SPD would receive 13 or 14% and the Greens 20-24%. The AfD would get 10-15%, Die Linke 6-9% and the pro-business FDP 6-9%. This would mean the grand coalition could only continue as a minority government. One of several possibilities would be a so-called Jamaica coalition between the CDU, and Greens and FDP, though talks for that collapsed in 2017 and the option would be relatively unattractive for the Greens.</p>",

German voters were never in favour of Kramp-Karrenbauer becoming chancellor and she had a rocky ride from the start, suffering a string of embarrassing gaffes \u2013 including a joke about gender-neutral toilets \u2013 and comments on fake news, on which she was forced to backtrack. More significantly, she failed to unite the party on its trickiest topic: migration. Divisions had been opened up by Merkel\u2019s open-door policy on refugees in late 2015, which led to the arrival of almost a million newcomers and fuelled the rise of the AfD. As the party rowed, it lost increasing numbers of voters to both the Greens and the AfD, whose rise in eastern Germany in particular has threatened to topple the CDU as the largest conservative force. Why was she forced to step down? Kramp-Karrenbauer said she did not have the full backing of the party, and that was borne out by events in Thuringia, where she had expressly ordered the CDU\u2019s delegates not to cooperate with the AfD but they did so anyway. The fallout continued when Kramp-Karrenbauer called for new elections to take place in the state but was ignored by local party leaders. She had little choice but to resign. Her rivals within the party, who made it clear they would not support her, are expected to run against her for the office. Is Merkel still in charge? She is still the chancellor and so remains the most powerful politician in Germany. But the fact that her succession plans have badly failed means that in her remaining months in office she increasingly resembles a lame duck. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s resignation may speed up Merkel\u2019s departure, because she is seen at least in part to blame for the debacle: with Merkel still in office, Kramp-Karrenbauer inevitably lacked authority not least because she didn\u2019t have the final say on government policy. But the Social Democrats, the junior partners in the grand coalition government, have said they will resign if Merkel is ousted ahead of schedule, which would most likely lead to early elections, so she is expected to stay in place until elections in 2021. Who will replace Kramp-Karrenbauer now? There are three main contenders for the job. One is Friedrich Merz, a prominent CDU member who in December 2018 campaigned on a ticket of shifting the party more to the right, and narrowly lost to Kramp-Karrenbauer. He has blamed Merkel for creating a culture in which conflict is avoided, which has led to a repression of political aspirations on which the AfD have seized. In a poll, about 13% of Germans said they could imagine him as chancellor. Jens Spahn, the health minister, came third in the December 2018 contest. At 39, the youngest candidate by some way, he has previously been a staunch critic of Merkel\u2019s refugee policy. The same poll showed he would have only 4.7% of support. Armin Laschet is the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia and the candidate most likely to continue Merkel\u2019s more moderate path. Unlike the other two, he has yet to state his intentions. What would happen if there was a general election tomorrow? The latest polls compiled by Statista show the CDU would top polling with 27-29%, the SPD would receive 13 or 14% and the Greens 20-24%. The AfD would get 10-15%, Die Linke 6-9% and the pro-business FDP 6-9%. This would mean the grand coalition could only continue as a minority government. One of several possibilities would be a so-called Jamaica coalition between the CDU, and Greens and FDP, though talks for that collapsed in 2017 and the option would be relatively unattractive for the Greens.",

He has also misled the parliament, yet again. And he will have to correct the record when parliament resumes in a week\u2019s time.\u201d</p> <p>Although the ANAO found in its report, <a href=\"https://www.anao.gov.au/work/performance-audit/award-funding-under-the-community-sport-infrastructure-program\">published in January</a>, that \u201cno applications assessed as ineligible [by Sport Australia] were awarded grant funding\u201d, ANAO officials revealed on Thursday that some 290 projects subsequently became ineligible.</p> <p>The majority of these (272) were ineligible because work had started by the time agreements were signed, a result of the community sport infrastructure grant program being extended to a second and third round months before the 2019 federal election.</p> <p>The Coalition senators Matt Canavan and Eric Abetz were stunned by the ANAO officials\u2019 evidence on Thursday, seeking to confirm that no ineligible projects were funded only to be contradicted by Brian Boyd, the ANAO performance audit services group executive director, who replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not what we found.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, the government doubled down, with the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack and the finance minister Mathias Cormann both defending the eligibility of projects.</p> <p>\u201cNo project which was funded was assessed as ineligible at the time the assessment was made,\u201d Cormann told reporters in Perth.</p> <p>\u201cThe point here is when the minister exercised her discretion in relation to funding decisions \u2026 not a single project which received funding had been assessed as ineligible.\u201d</p> <p>In Sunshine Beach, McCormack committed to consider the Senate committee\u2019s report after it had concluded rather than rush to judgment on evidence from the first night of what he called a \u201cpolitically charged\u201d inquiry.</p> <p>Earlier, Albanese described the sports grants program as \u201ca scandal of massive proportions\u201d both because of the number of ineligible projects funded and because volunteers in community sporting organisations had spent \u201chundreds of hours putting forward submissions to a scheme that they thought would be funded on the basis of merit and we now know it was all about politics\u201d.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/coalition-gave-out-100m-election-grants-not-assessed-merit\">its scathing report</a> the ANAO found the $100m community sport infrastructure fund was targeted at marginal or Coalition target electorates, eventually prompting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/02/bridget-mckenzie-resigns-following-sports-rort-affair\">McKenzie to resign on 2 February</a> over a conflict of interest in one grant.</p> <p>Albanese seized on revelations that dozens of emails were exchanged between Morrison and McKenzie\u2019s offices about the program.</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder it took them so long to sack Bridget McKenzie because, quite clearly, Scott Morrison was in this right up to his neck,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/13/sports-rorts-almost-half-projects-funded-ineligible-audit-office-says\">Sports rorts: almost half the projects funded were ineligible, audit office says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Thursday the auditor general, Grant Hehir, said that although Morrison\u2019s office made both direct and indirect representations about which projects should be funded, not all representations changed the outcome of funding decisions.</p> <p>The ANAO did not find sufficient correlation between representations and an outcome to make it a focus of the audit.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence before us was that the minister [Bridget McKenzie] was the decision-maker,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had have identified someone else as the decision-maker, we would have gone down that path.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Morrison was caught by surprise by the new evidence, telling reporters at a press conference to discuss the coronavirus that he hadn\u2019t seen the ANAO statement.</p> <p>Earlier, Albanese dismissed the relevance of mere \u201celigibility\u201d, arguing it is \u201cspin\u201d that does not mean the most meritorious projects won funding.</p> <p>\u201cI am eligible to play Davis Cup for Australia.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has accused Scott Morrison of personal involvement in the Coalition\u2019s controversial $100m sports grant program and misleading parliament by claiming that all projects funded were eligible. The Labor leader cited evidence from the Australian National Audit Office on Thursday evening that in fact 43% of projects, 290 in total, were ineligible for the community sport infrastructure grant program when agreements were signed. The evidence stunned the Morrison government, which had relied on the ANAO\u2019s conclusion that \u201cno applications assessed as ineligible were awarded grant funding\u201d to defend the program, only to discover at the Senate inquiry hearing that statement referred only to the point in time projects were assessed by Sport Australia and not their current status. ANAO officials also revealed the prime minister\u2019s office made \u201cdirect\u201d representations about which projects to fund, including the exchange of dozens of emails with the former sport minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office and several versions of controversial spreadsheets that colour-coded projects by electorate and party. On Friday, Albanese told reporters in Sydney that Morrison had said 18 times \u2013 including in the parliament \u2013 that all projects were eligible. In press conferences and interviews in the past month, Morrison has variously said that \u201cthe auditor general found that there were no ineligible projects\u201d, \u201cthere [were] no issues about ineligibility of any projects\u201d and \u201cthere were no ineligible projects that were funded under this scheme\u201d. \u201cThey were all eligible projects,\u201d Morrison told the House of Representatives on 5 February. Albanese said \u201cin fact\u201d that 43% of projects were not eligible, suggesting Morrison is \u201cloose with the truth\u201d and had attempted to use \u201cmarketing and spin\u201d to solve a political problem. \u201cHe has misled the Australian people. He has also misled the parliament, yet again. And he will have to correct the record when parliament resumes in a week\u2019s time.\u201d Although the ANAO found in its report, published in January, that \u201cno applications assessed as ineligible [by Sport Australia] were awarded grant funding\u201d, ANAO officials revealed on Thursday that some 290 projects subsequently became ineligible. The majority of these (272) were ineligible because work had started by the time agreements were signed, a result of the community sport infrastructure grant program being extended to a second and third round months before the 2019 federal election. The Coalition senators Matt Canavan and Eric Abetz were stunned by the ANAO officials\u2019 evidence on Thursday, seeking to confirm that no ineligible projects were funded only to be contradicted by Brian Boyd, the ANAO performance audit services group executive director, who replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not what we found.\u201d On Friday, the government doubled down, with the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack and the finance minister Mathias Cormann both defending the eligibility of projects. \u201cNo project which was funded was assessed as ineligible at the time the assessment was made,\u201d Cormann told reporters in Perth. \u201cThe point here is when the minister exercised her discretion in relation to funding decisions \u2026 not a single project which received funding had been assessed as ineligible.\u201d In Sunshine Beach, McCormack committed to consider the Senate committee\u2019s report after it had concluded rather than rush to judgment on evidence from the first night of what he called a \u201cpolitically charged\u201d inquiry. Earlier, Albanese described the sports grants program as \u201ca scandal of massive proportions\u201d both because of the number of ineligible projects funded and because volunteers in community sporting organisations had spent \u201chundreds of hours putting forward submissions to a scheme that they thought would be funded on the basis of merit and we now know it was all about politics\u201d. In its scathing report the ANAO found the $100m community sport infrastructure fund was targeted at marginal or Coalition target electorates, eventually prompting McKenzie to resign on 2 February over a conflict of interest in one grant. Albanese seized on revelations that dozens of emails were exchanged between Morrison and McKenzie\u2019s offices about the program. \u201cNo wonder it took them so long to sack Bridget McKenzie because, quite clearly, Scott Morrison was in this right up to his neck,\u201d he said. On Thursday the auditor general, Grant Hehir, said that although Morrison\u2019s office made both direct and indirect representations about which projects should be funded, not all representations changed the outcome of funding decisions. The ANAO did not find sufficient correlation between representations and an outcome to make it a focus of the audit. \u201cThe evidence before us was that the minister [Bridget McKenzie] was the decision-maker,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had have identified someone else as the decision-maker, we would have gone down that path.\u201d On Thursday, Morrison was caught by surprise by the new evidence, telling reporters at a press conference to discuss the coronavirus that he hadn\u2019t seen the ANAO statement. Earlier, Albanese dismissed the relevance of mere \u201celigibility\u201d, arguing it is \u201cspin\u201d that does not mean the most meritorious projects won funding. \u201cI am eligible to play Davis Cup for Australia. I play for Marrickville lawn tennis club \u2026 I am in division two, grade five,\u201d he said. \u201cSo chances are there are tens of thousands of players who are better suited to play Davis Cup rather than me.\u201d",

None of the eight teams who have got the better of Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s men in Championship this season have won their subsequent match \u2013 seven of them have lost it. Nottingham Forest were the latest to find that beating Bielsa\u2019s side takes a heavy toll, as on the back of last weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/nottingham-forest-leeds-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 win at the City Ground</a>, they flopped to a home defeat by Charlton. But they are still only two points off the automatic promotion places and could foil West Brom\u2019s attempt to pull away at the top again by winning at the Hawthorns on Saturday. To do that, Sabri Lamouchi would be well advised to reverse the changes he made for the Charlton game and deploy the lineup that beat Leeds, assuming Lewis Grabban, Samba Sow and Sammy Ameobi have overcome the knee problems that forced them to miss the midweek match. <strong>PD</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>West Bromwich Albion v Nottingham Forest: Saturday, 12.30pm (all times GMT)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5f119f0c-bb0f-41fd-a4e6-9040ce6f04a4\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2 ) Farke to risk a back three against Liverpool?</strong></h2> \n<p>Ben Godfrey played every minute of Norwich\u2019s first 17 league games at centre-back, before sustaining a relatively minor knee ligament injury against Leicester in December. He missed five games, and the entire festive schedule, but on returning to fitness was thrown straight back into the starting XI alongside Christoph Zimmermann for the club\u2019s last home fixture, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/norwich-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 1-0 win against Bournemouth</a>, whereupon he was promptly sent off and forced to sit out another two matches. The last of those, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/01/newcastle-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a goalless draw at Newcastle</a>, featured an assured defensive display from a rearguard in which Zimmerman was paired with Grant Hanley, and the team\u2019s only clean sheet all season that didn\u2019t come against Bournemouth. Daniel Farke must therefore decide whether to bring back the 22-year-old Godfrey, stick with the more experienced Hanley, or perhaps play all of them at the same time. Farke did experiment with a back three in pre-season but last used it in a competitive game nearly two years ago, and if there\u2019s any opponent who will ruthlessly expose any defensive uncertainty it is Liverpool. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Norwich City v Liverpool: Saturday, 5.30pm</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/13/sacking-managers-often-does-not-work-just-look-at-the-premier-league\">Sacking managers often doesn't work \u2013 just look at the Premier League | Eni Aluko</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>3) Salzburg face stiffest test in title six-pointer</strong></h2> \n<p>The Austrian Bundesliga resumes after its winter break on Friday night with an absolute cracker, pitting first against second in what could come to be seen as a premature title decider. Should Lask be defeated at RB Salzburg they would be five points and a good chunk of goal difference behind, and stuck chasing a side that have not lost in the league all season; should they win they would lead by a point, and the race is on. They have done well to stay within touching distance of a fearsome Salzburg side who have scored 29 more goals than their closest domestic rivals in only 18 matches, but while Lask have the benefit of consistency the leaders have lost Erling Braut Haaland (to Dortmund), Takumi Minamino (Liverpool) and the centre-back Marin Pongracic (Wolfsburg) since their last league game and this could be the ideal time to face them. With any luck it will be as dramatic as the teams\u2019 first meeting of the season in September, when Lask roared into a two-goal lead, Petar Filipovic was sent off with quarter of an hour to play and Patson Daka scored his second of the game to equalise in the last minute. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>RB Salzburg v Lask: Friday, 6pm</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/13/reiss-nelson-arsenal-jadon-sancho-whos-better-mikel-arteta\">Reiss Nelson: 'It was always, Reiss and Jadon Sancho, who's better?'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>4) Can Arteta get Arsenal\u2019s attack firing?</strong></h2> \n<p>Mikel Arteta has made the point more than once that, in a hectic first six weeks at Arsenal, there was little time to get anything bar the simplest of messages across to his players. He did a good job of that, even if five draws from seven league games denote little more than a steadying of the ship, but a fortnight let loose on such an underperforming squad should have allowed them to take a few more steps forward. Arsenal spent four days on the training pitch in Dubai during that time and the noises that have emerged from Arteta and his players are, albeit perhaps predictably, uniformly positive. \u201cWe are improving every day,\u201d Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang said.

      "bodyText": "1) Forest need to be back to full-strength at West Brom Leeds are falling apart. Maybe. But here\u2019s the thing: anyone who beats them ends up falling apart too. None of the eight teams who have got the better of Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s men in Championship this season have won their subsequent match \u2013 seven of them have lost it. Nottingham Forest were the latest to find that beating Bielsa\u2019s side takes a heavy toll, as on the back of last weekend\u2019s 2-0 win at the City Ground, they flopped to a home defeat by Charlton. But they are still only two points off the automatic promotion places and could foil West Brom\u2019s attempt to pull away at the top again by winning at the Hawthorns on Saturday. To do that, Sabri Lamouchi would be well advised to reverse the changes he made for the Charlton game and deploy the lineup that beat Leeds, assuming Lewis Grabban, Samba Sow and Sammy Ameobi have overcome the knee problems that forced them to miss the midweek match. PD \u2022 West Bromwich Albion v Nottingham Forest: Saturday, 12.30pm (all times GMT) 2 ) Farke to risk a back three against Liverpool? Ben Godfrey played every minute of Norwich\u2019s first 17 league games at centre-back, before sustaining a relatively minor knee ligament injury against Leicester in December. He missed five games, and the entire festive schedule, but on returning to fitness was thrown straight back into the starting XI alongside Christoph Zimmermann for the club\u2019s last home fixture, the 1-0 win against Bournemouth, whereupon he was promptly sent off and forced to sit out another two matches. The last of those, a goalless draw at Newcastle, featured an assured defensive display from a rearguard in which Zimmerman was paired with Grant Hanley, and the team\u2019s only clean sheet all season that didn\u2019t come against Bournemouth. Daniel Farke must therefore decide whether to bring back the 22-year-old Godfrey, stick with the more experienced Hanley, or perhaps play all of them at the same time. Farke did experiment with a back three in pre-season but last used it in a competitive game nearly two years ago, and if there\u2019s any opponent who will ruthlessly expose any defensive uncertainty it is Liverpool. SB \u2022 Norwich City v Liverpool: Saturday, 5.30pm 3) Salzburg face stiffest test in title six-pointer The Austrian Bundesliga resumes after its winter break on Friday night with an absolute cracker, pitting first against second in what could come to be seen as a premature title decider. Should Lask be defeated at RB Salzburg they would be five points and a good chunk of goal difference behind, and stuck chasing a side that have not lost in the league all season; should they win they would lead by a point, and the race is on. They have done well to stay within touching distance of a fearsome Salzburg side who have scored 29 more goals than their closest domestic rivals in only 18 matches, but while Lask have the benefit of consistency the leaders have lost Erling Braut Haaland (to Dortmund), Takumi Minamino (Liverpool) and the centre-back Marin Pongracic (Wolfsburg) since their last league game and this could be the ideal time to face them. With any luck it will be as dramatic as the teams\u2019 first meeting of the season in September, when Lask roared into a two-goal lead, Petar Filipovic was sent off with quarter of an hour to play and Patson Daka scored his second of the game to equalise in the last minute. SB \u2022 RB Salzburg v Lask: Friday, 6pm 4) Can Arteta get Arsenal\u2019s attack firing? Mikel Arteta has made the point more than once that, in a hectic first six weeks at Arsenal, there was little time to get anything bar the simplest of messages across to his players. He did a good job of that, even if five draws from seven league games denote little more than a steadying of the ship, but a fortnight let loose on such an underperforming squad should have allowed them to take a few more steps forward. Arsenal spent four days on the training pitch in Dubai during that time and the noises that have emerged from Arteta and his players are, albeit perhaps predictably, uniformly positive. \u201cWe are improving every day,\u201d Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang said. Now they need to show it against a Newcastle side that will, if little else, be well drilled. Arteta believes a good run can still propel them towards the Champions League spots but that will be a short-lived hope if home assignments such as this cannot be ticked off without fuss. Having calmed Arsenal\u2019s defence down, the logical next step is for Arteta to get their attackers firing: the extent of any improvement on Sunday may well reveal whether they can hope to achieve anything of note over the next three months.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has extended its travel ban on people who have travelled through China by another week, Scott Morrison has announced. The ban, initially set for 14 days and due to expire on Saturday, was extended on Thursday on the advice of Australia\u2019s health authorities and the national security committee. The ban would be reviewed every week, the prime minister said. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family are exempt from the ban, designed to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, now named Covid-19. In its original statement on 1 February, the government said foreign nationals in mainland China \u201cwill not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they have left or transited through mainland China\u201d. The ban does not apply to people who left China before 1 February, or to travellers from Hong Kong and Macau. Overnight, the number of new cases of Covid-19 rose by 14,887 in the Hubei province where it first emerged \u2013 a sevenfold increase on the day before. China recorded 245 new deaths, taking the national total to 1,359. Globally, more than 60,000 people have been infected by the virus, and 1,369 have died. There have been 15 cases of Covid-19 in Australia, with no deaths, and five people have recovered from the virus. There have been no recorded human-to-human transmissions of Covid-19 in the general community in Australia. All cases in Australia contracted the disease while in Wuhan, except for one person who had contact, in China, with a person with the virus. On Thursday Morrison said arrangements to protect Australia from coronavirus \u201care working\u201d. \u201cThis afternoon we have agreed to accept the recommendations to maintain the ban on entry restrictions on foreign nationals from mainland China for a further week. This is something we will continue to review on a weekly basis, and consider all the medical evidence on a weekly basis.\u201d He encouraged Australians to support members of the Chinese Australian community, who have been subject to a range of racist responses to the outbreak. \u201cAs we go into the weekend I encourage everyone to support Chinese-Australian businesses ... they are such an integral part of Australian life and it is important that all Australians are putting their arms around them and supporting them, in any way they can.\u201d He also extended his thoughts to China, saying \u201cwe will bounce back together\u201d. The prime minister said he was \u201cvery mindful of the economic impacts\u201d of the extended ban, but was not currently looking at providing financial assistance to the tourism and education sectors. International students contributed $34bn to the Australian economy last year, and the ban is expected to result in $8bn of losses. A range of universities have delayed the start of semester, or allowed international students to enrol later. Earlier on Thursday it was revealed that China had agreed to relax some of its internet restrictions so students could study online as they waited to enter the country. \u201cIt is still some four to six weeks before we reach a period of time when it will start impacting on the [academic] year,\u201d Morrison said on Thursday. \u201cThey have put in measures like online learning which can address that for now.\u201d Queensland state Labor MP Kate Jones said she \u201ccould not believe\u201d Morrison had not yet offered financial assistance, and that the state\u2019s tourism council had written to him \u201ccrying out for funding\u201d. All people, including Australian citizens and residents, must isolate themselves for 14 days after they have left China, or if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the continued expansion of the outbreak outside of the locked-down province of Hubei was the rationale for extending the travel ban. \u201cWe\u2019ve recommended the continuation of the travel ban for an additional week at this time. There has been significant growth in Hubei province, in other provinces in China there has been slower growth, perhaps not at the same rate as we\u2019ve seen previously, but still growth. \u201cThat is the reason why we would like to maintain the travel ban at the moment,\u201d he said. Murphy said if Chinese authorities were able to stop the smaller outbreaks outside of Hubei, Australia would be able to review the ban. The chief medical officer said there had been no new cases detected in Australia, and commended those Australians who\u2019d returned from China and \u201cbehaved impeccably\u201d in adhering to self-isolation. There are no confirmed cases among the 538 Australian citizens and permanent residents currently in quarantine on Christmas Island or Manigurr-Ma work camp in the Northern Territory. The economic impact of the travel ban on Australia\u2019s tourism and education sectors is estimated to slash 0.5% from Australia\u2019s GDP growth in the first quarter, according to analysts from ANZ bank.",

It\u2019s possible the same thing is about to happen with Sanders after his victory in New Hampshire and effective tie in Iowa. <br></p> <p>Joe Biden provided a preview of that attack during Friday\u2019s debate, telling Sanders his proposal \u201cwill cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes aren\u2019t going to go up is just crazy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sanders had a reply: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans. What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a case he\u2019s likely to be asked to make again in the next few weeks.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4548278f086a28115ab099\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T13:01:44.620Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump does not seem too worried about the snowballing controversy over his interference in the Roger Stone case (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/feb/13/us-politics-donald-trump-roger-stone-case-live-updates?page=with:block-5e45202e8f086a28115aae98#block-5e45202e8f086a28115aae98\">see earlier</a>). </p> <p>Echoing the case made by Fox News (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/feb/13/us-politics-donald-trump-roger-stone-case-live-updates?page=with:block-5e452aab8f0811db2faf6df4#block-5e452aab8f0811db2faf6df4\">here</a>), the president has tweeted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227939838751657984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now it looks like the fore person in the jury, in the Roger Stone case, had significant bias.

      "bodyText": "Bill Barr, the attorney general, complained that Donald Trump\u2019s tweets about justice department cases \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and said he would not be \u201cbullied\u201d into doing the president\u2019s bidding. The White House responded that Trump \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by Barr\u2019s comments. Critics have questioned Barr\u2019s sincerity, given his record going along with what the president wants. A federal judge dismissed Trump\u2019s criticisms of the court\u2019s handling of the Roger Stone case, issuing a rare statement to say, \u201cThe judges of this court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them\u201d and not based on \u201cpublic criticism or pressure\u201d. The Democratic National Committee had oversight of the faulty app used in the Iowa caucuses, according to a report. Nevada\u2019s influential Culinary Union declined to endorse a candidate ahead of the caucuses next week. The union has criticized Bernie Sanders\u2019 health plan and complained of \u201cvicious attacks\u201d from Sanders\u2019 supporters. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign is carrying on after placing third in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire. Elizabeth Warren is in Virginia, holding her first campaign event since the New Hampshire primaries. After placing third in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire, Warren is campaigning as a \u201cconsensus\u201d candidate who can unite progressives and liberals. Donald Trump will be the guest of honor at a fundraiser where donors are paying $580,600 per couple to attend. The Washington Post reports that the dinner on Saturday will take place at the Palm Beach estate of billionaire Nelson Peltz: The dinner, taking place just a few miles from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, shows how enthusiastically Trump has embraced big-dollar fundraising in his bid for a second term \u2014 a dramatic about-face from 2016, when he criticized the influence of wealthy donors on the politicians who court them. It also shows the special access enjoyed by many of Trump\u2019s wealthiest donors, including business executives and lobbyists, who get the chance to air their grievances with the president\u2019s tariffs or promote their pet projects, often while dining on Trump\u2019s favorite foods. The event will be the most expensive fundraising event for Trump since he took office. A federal judge dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s criticisms of the Roger Stone case. \u201cPublic criticism or pressure is not a factor\u201d in the court\u2019s decisions, said Beryl Howell, the chief US district judge of Washington. Howell issued a rare statement in response to Trump\u2019s criticisms of her colleague Amy Berman Jackson, the sentencing judge in the Roger Stone case. \u201cThe Judges of this Court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them; the applicable sentencing guidelines and statutory factors; the submissions of the parties, the Probation Office and victims; and their own judgment and experience,\u201d she said. Report: the Democratic National Committee had oversight of app that caused chaos in Iowa The DNC was involved throughout the development of the mobile app that was meant to collect and tally results of the Iowa caucuses, according to Yahoo News. Party officials had access to the software \u2013 designed by Shadow \u2013 for testing before it was used Iowa, according to a contract obtained by Yahoo: An unaffiliated Democratic operative in Iowa provided Yahoo News with a copy of the contract between Shadow and the Iowa Democratic Party. The contract, which was signed on Oct. 14 and refers to Shadow as the \u201cConsultant,\u201d specified that the company had to work with the DNC and provide the national party with access to its software for testing. \u201cConsultant agrees to work with the DNC Services Corporation / Democratic National Committee (\u2018DNC\u2019) on an on-going basis as Consultant develops the software,\u201d the contract reads. The contract also specifies that Shadow agrees to \u201cprovide DNC continual access to review the Consultant\u2019s system configurations, security and system logs, system designs, data flow designs, security controls (preventative and detective), and operational plans for how the Consultant will use and run the Software for informational dissemination, pre-registration, tabulation, and reporting throughout the caucus process.\u201d The DNC has tried to distance itself from the debacle in Iowa; chair Tom Perez has blamed state Democratic party, which directly oversaw the caucuses. After this election cycle, the party will \u201chave a further conversation about whether or not state parties should be running elections\u201d, Perez said in an interview with CNN. In his resignation letter, the Iowa Democratic party chair, Troy Price, said, \u201cI am deeply sorry for what happened and bear the responsibility for any failures on behalf of the Iowa Democratic party.\u201d Following the app\u2019s failure in Iowa, the DNC abandoned plans to use a similar system from Shadow in the upcoming Nevada caucuses. On Fox News, Senate leader Mitch McConnell said the president should listen to attorney general Bill Barr. \u201cI think the president should listen to his advice,\u201d McConnell told Fox News host Bret Baier. \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d Donald Trump \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by the attorney general Bill Barr\u2019s comments, according to the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham. \u201cPresident Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country.\u201d In an interview with ABC, Barr said \u201cthe president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d but added that the president\u2019s tweets about the Roger Stone case and the Department of Justice\u2019s work \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d. Before the president met with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, today, he not only insulted Cuomo\u2019s brother \u2013 the CNN political analyst Chris Cuomo \u2013 he also implied that the administration\u2019s policies toward New York were linked to the state\u2019s ongoing investigations into Trump\u2019s finances. \u201cNew York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits &amp; harassment, start cleaning itself up, and lowering taxes,\u201d he tweeted, before the meeting. The administration and New York have been at odds over a state law that allows undocumented people to apply for drivers licenses. Federal officials banned New York residents from applying to a federal program that lets travelers avoid long security lines. Picking up on Trump\u2019s ask that New York drop lawsuits, the representative Val Demings, one of the impeachment managers who made the case to remove Trump from office, said the president is \u201cholding New York state hostage to try to stop investigations into his prior tax fraud\u201d. \u201cThe president is now expanding his abuse of power to blackmailing US,\u201d she said. Neither the president nor Cuomo has commented on whether they reached a resolution after today\u2019s meeting. The acting homeland security secretary, Chad Wolf, described the meeting as \u201cproductive\u201d. \u201cNew York is the only state that restricts CBP access to their data across the board \u2013 from law enforcement, customs, trade and travel facilitation purposes,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cDespite that, we will continue discussions with the State of New York to find a mutually agreeable solution.\u201d New York is one of several states that allow undocumented immigrants to have drivers licenses. Still, last week, Ken Cuccinelli, the homeland security department acting deputy secretary, said that New Yorkers would no longer be eligible to apply or reapply for the Global Entry program because the state\u2019s policies made it harder for border agents to confirm immigration status. New York responded with a lawsuit against the administration. Vindman attorney: the president is \u2018encouraging breaking the law\u2019 The president claimed that \u201cmany of the people in the building started applauding\u201d when Lt Col Alexander Vindman was escorted out after he was fired from his post at the National Security Council. Vindman and his twin brother were abruptly recalled from their positions in a campaign of retribution against officials who cooperated with the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. \u201cVindman was the guy that, when we took him out of the building, the building applauded,\u201d Trump said in a radio interview with host Geraldo Rivera. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard that.\u201d \u201cJust so you understand, many of these people I\u2019ve never met,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a fan of Vindman, no question about it.\u201d In response, an attorney for Vindman responded that the president\u2019s public attacks are \u201cdesigned to intimidate and punish\u201d the Ukraine expert, who provided key testimony in the impeachment case. \u201cBy using the power of his office to repeatedly humiliate and punish those following the law, the president is encouraging breaking the law,\u201d said attorney David Pressman. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands: Attorney general Bill Barr said he would not be \u201cbullied\u201d into allowing the president to influence justice department decisions after Trump tweeted about the case of his former associate, Roger Stone. Barr complained that Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Trump\u2019s comments on Stone represented \u201can abuse of power\u201d. The Senate passed a resolution aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s authority to launch military operations in Iran, but the proposal seems unlikely to survive the president\u2019s expected veto. A judge has temporarily halted Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing work for the Pentagon in response to a lawsuit from Amazon, which claims the company lost the contract partly because of Trump\u2019s bias against Jeff Bezos. The Pentagon informed Congress it intends to shift $3.8bn in funds away from projects like fighter jets and national guard equipment to pay for Trump\u2019s border wall. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 workers in Nevada, declined to endorse a Democratic presidential candidate ahead of the state\u2019s caucuses next Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard to make sure members know what\u2019s going on with the candidates, and we\u2019re not stopping that,\u201d the union secretary-treasurer Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline said during a press conference. \u201cWe\u2019re going to endorse our goals, what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re not going to endorse a political candidate.\u201d There was some speculation that the union would endorse Joe Biden, the only specific candidate Arg\u00fcello-Kline mentioned during the press conference. But although she described Biden as \u201cour friend\u201d, the union did not offer an explicit endorsement. The announcement comes after the union distributed a flier criticizing the Medicare-for-all plans embraced by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The union later said it was subjected to \u201cvicious attacks\u201d by Sanders\u2019 supporters over the flier. The White House reportedly received little notice about attorney general Bill Barr\u2019s comments to ABC News. Interestingly, Bill Barr said he hoped Trump would respond to the attorney general\u2019s criticism of the president\u2019s comments on Roger Stone. \u201cI hope he will react,\u201d Barr told ABC News\u2019 Pierre Thomas. \u201cAnd respect it?\u201d Thomas asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Barr replied. Despite attorney general Bill Barr insisting he will not be \u201cbullied\u201d by Trump on Justice Department matters, some commentators were skeptical that Barr was actually trying to distance himself from the president. From an Obama-era Justice Department official: In his ABC interview, attorney general Bill Barr ackowledged his comments about Trump could leave him open to backlash from the president, who is notoriously intolerant of criticism from his aides. But Barr said he was determined to lead the Justice Department without being influence by outside forces, including the president. \u201cI think the essential role of the attorney general is to keep law enforcement, the criminal process sacrosanct to make sure there is no political interference in it. And I have done that and I will continue to do that,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy to say that, in fact the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.\u201d The attorney general insisted he made his own decision that the sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone, the president\u2019s former associate, should be revised, but Trump\u2019s tweets on the matter complicated the issue. \u201cDo you go forward with what you think is the right decision or do you pull back because of the tweet?\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd that just sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be.\u201d In an interview with ABC News, attorney general Bill Barr said Trump\u2019s tweets about Roger Stone\u2019s case \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr told ABC. The attorney general emphasized Trump \u201chas never asked me to do anything in a criminal case,\u201d but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it\u2019s Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do what I think is right. And you know \u2026 I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\u201d Trump suggested he may stop allowing aides to listen in to his calls with foreign leaders, a clear reaction to the Ukraine controversy. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019ve done over the years, when you call a foreign leader, people listen,\u201d the president told Geraldo Rivera in a radio interview that aired today. \u201cI may end the practice entirely, I may end it entirely.\u201d The impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint stemming from Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president, during which the US president asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d and went on to discuss potential investigations of Democrats. It\u2019s a long-running practice to allow administration officials to listen in on presidential calls with world leaders to keep senior advisers updated on foreign policy. The Pentagon has informed Congress of plans to shift $3.8 billion away from fighter jets and National Guard equipment, among other resources, to pay for Trump\u2019s border wall. Politico reports: The surprise reprogramming of another $3.8 billion ... means the Pentagon will have forked over nearly $10 billion since last year to help pay for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. But this shift in funding marks a new phase for the administration, which until now had used money set for military construction and counterdrug operations, not combat equipment. The fiscal 2020 money will be moved into drug interdiction accounts that the Pentagon tapped last year to fund border barrier projects. The money will be drawn from a host of procurement accounts, many of which are popular on Capitol Hill. The move includes a cut of two Marine Corps F-35B fighter jets at a cost of $223 million; $100 million from the Army National Guard\u2019s Humvee modernization program; $650 million cut from the Navy\u2019s amphibious assault ship replacement; and $261 million from the Expeditionary Fast Transport ship. The reprogramming also trimmed two Air Force C-130J transport aircraft for a cut of $196 million and $180 million from the service\u2019s light attack aircraft program. The plan sparked criticism from at least one Republican lawmaker, congressman Mac Thornberry, but he has already said he will not seek reelection next year. A judge has temporarily blocked Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing work with the Pentagon after Amazon complained that it lost the contract partly because of Trump\u2019s bias against the company. Trump has repeatedly lashed out against Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of the Washington Post. CNBC reports: A judge ordered Thursday a temporary block on the JEDI cloud contract, which was awarded to Microsoft, in response to a suit filed by Amazon. Shares of Microsoft fell on the news, while Amazon\u2019s stock rose slightly. A court notice announcing the injunction was filed on Thursday, but wasn\u2019t public. It\u2019s unclear why the documents were sealed. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is instructed to earmark $42 million for any \u2018costs and damages\u2019 that could be incurred in the event that the \u2018injunction was issued wrongfully,\u2019 the filing states. Amazon must file a notice with the courts indicating it has obtained the $42 million by Feb. 20. Microsoft and Amazon must respond to the filing by Feb. 27. The eight Republicans who supported the Iran War Powers resolution in the Senate were: Todd Young, Mike Lee, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Rand Paul, Bill Cassidy, Jerry Moran and Lamar Alexander. The resolution, aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s authority to launch military operations in Iran, was expected to attract some Republican support, but the number of defections was surprising. But again, the resolution is unlikely to attract the two-thirds Senate majority that it would need to survive Trump\u2019s likely veto. With the support of eight Republicans, a Democratic resolution to limit Trump\u2019s authority to launch military operations in Iran has passed the Senate. The AP reports: The measure, authored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., says Trump must win approval from Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran. Eight Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the resolution by a 55-45 vote. Kaine and other supporters said the resolution was not about Trump or even the presidency, but instead was an important reassertion of congressional power to declare war. ... The Democratic-controlled House passed a separate, nonbinding war powers resolution last month. The House could take up the Senate resolution later this month, said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. But considering Trump\u2019s expected veto, the resolution will not likely be able to attract the two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate that it would need to become law. The influential Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 workers in Nevada, will announce its presidential endorsement ahead of the state\u2019s caucuses next Saturday. It\u2019s unknown who the union will endorse, but Joe Biden is attending a union-hosted event on Saturday. The union has also criticized the Medicare-for-all proposals embraced by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, so it seems unlikely that either candidate will win the organization\u2019s endorsement. Trump previewed his meeting today with New York governor Andrew Cuomo and insulted Cuomo\u2019s brother, Chris Cuomo, by once again referring to the CNN anchor as \u201cFredo.\u201d The meeting between Trump and Cuomo comes amid an ongoing standoff between the administration and New York over a state law allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver\u2019s licenses. The New York Times reports: Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would seek to give federal officials access to state driving records for applicants to Global Entry and other federal programs that allow travelers to quickly pass through airports and borders. The announcement by Mr. Cuomo comes days after federal officials banned New York residents from applying to \u2014 and re-enrolling in \u2014 the programs, known as the Trusted Traveler Program. Senator lights into GOP over silence on Trump impunity Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has slammed Senate Republicans for enabling Donald Trump in his post-impeachment \u201cretribution tour\u201d, as he called it. After sounding off during a committee hearing yesterday, Brown appeared on CNN this morning and criticized some Republicans who reckoned the president would \u201clearn a lesson\u201d from the humiliating process of being impeached, and behave more appropriately. \u201cHe\u2019s learned his lesson,\u201d said Brown. The lesson being that \u201che can do whatever he wants. The \u2018retribution tour\u2019 will continue, and we all know that.\u201d Trump ousted impeachment witnesses Alexander Vindman and Gordon Sondland last week, just two days after being acquitted at his Senate impeachment trial. Brown continued that Republican senators criticize Trump in private and were \u201cvery concerned about the Ukraine call and the cover-up\u201d that lead to the impeachment. \u201cBut they fear that the president will turn on them. They know his character. [After impeachment] the first stop was the prayer breakfast [during which he obliquely slammed Nancy Pelosi and Mitt Romney], then the East Room [where Trump made a triumphalist and vindictive post-acquittal \u201ccelebration\u201d speech] and all these senators stood and applauded him.\u201d Many had been keen for Brown to run for president, but he didn\u2019t. In response to some of his congressional colleagues\u2019 concerns that his nomination could weaken down-ballot Democrats, Bernie Sanders predicted he would increase turnout if he were the presidential nominee. However, there is some skepticism that Sanders\u2019 nomination would increase turnout, considering the turnout in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump\u2019s comments about the case of Roger Stone, his former associate, as \u201can abuse of power.\u201d Jessie Liu, the former US attorney whose Treasury nomination was withdrawn in part because of her involvement with the Stone case, has resigned. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s former communications director, is returning to the White House. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. North Dakota election officials have agreed to implement new measures that will make it easier for Native Americans to vote, a major victory for groups suing the state over an issue that dogged the 2018 midterm elections. The law illegally disenfranchised Native Americans in the state, groups challenging the law argued, because it required them to have a form of identification listing a residential address in order to vote. Many Native Americans who live on reservations don\u2019t have traditional addresses. The issue exploded into the national spotlight in 2018 in a closely-watched US Senate Race when Republican Kevin Kramer defeated incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp. Tribal governments went into a sprint in the days before the election to issue addresses and tribal identification cards so people could vote. Under a proposed settlement, North Dakota election officials will allow people without a traditional address to locate their homes on a map for the 2020 election. The burden will be on the state, not voters, to verify the address and give that information to both the tribe and voter. The state also agreed to work with tribal governments to provide free identification within 30 days of an election. \u201cNative American voters, whether they\u2019re just turning 18 and becoming eligible to vote, or whether they\u2019ve moved, will be able to vote without having to go the same extreme measures that the tribes went through last time,\u201d said Molly Danahy, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center who helped challenge the law. As Bernie Sanders cements his position as the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary, some congressional Democrats are voicing concerns that the Vermont senator\u2019s nomination could weaken down-ballot candidates. Sanders has pushed back against that argument, telling CNN on Sunday that his nomination would lead to \u201cincredible gains for down-ballot Democrats.\u201d Congressman Jerry Nadler, one of the impeachment managers during Trump\u2019s Senate trial, responded to the president\u2019s demand that \u201cbad people\u201d get \u201cout of our government\u201d by suggesting that he resign. Appearing on \u201cThe View,\u201d Joe Biden criticized Trump as \u201cthe most corrupt president\u201d and once again called on him to release his tax returns. After disappointing performances in the first two voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden is counting on a strong showing in next week\u2019s Nevada caucuses to reenergize his campaign. In addition to the return of former White House communications director Hope Hicks, Trump is also moving his former body man John McEntee into a new role. McEntee\u2019s new job overseeing presidential personnel appointments is a bit of a surprise, considering he was fired by former chief of staff John Kelly after being denied a security clearance, in part because of an online gambling problem. A quick addition on that last post: the RNC office Trump is unexpectedly visiting is actually his campaign headquarters in Arlington. In an unexpected addition to the president\u2019s schedule today, Trump has left the White House to visit a Republican National Committee office in Arlington, Virginia. The White House said the president was there for some meetings and to offer thanks to campaign officials. The president has an otherwise empty public schedule today, with the exception of a closed-door meeting with New York governor Andrew Cuomo at 3 pm ET. As the debate contines over whether Trump is jeopardizing the rule of law, the House has just voted to remove a 1982 deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The Washington Post reports: The vote on a resolution introduced by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) pushes the issue to the Senate, where Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have introduced a similar measure. During debate on the House floor, Republicans leaned on anti-abortion and constitutional arguments to oppose the ERA, arguing that enshrining protections for women in the Constitution would mean abortion could not be restricted. Democrats focused on the legality of deadlines and the importance of equal rights. ... Three-quarters of the states must ratify a proposed amendment for it to be added to the Constitution. With new Democratic majorities in both chambers, the Virginia General Assembly last month met that threshold, becoming the 38th state to ratify the ERA. But the bill faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate, and some states that previously ratified the amendment have said they no longer support it. Even liberal Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has long championed the ERA, suggested earlier this week that the amendment\u2019s supporters should \u201cstart over.\u201d Trump has just sent yet another tweet bashing one of his former aides. This time, it\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly, who defended Lt Col Alexander Vindman for raising concerns about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Vindman was fired from the National Security Council last week in apparent retaliation for the lieutenant colonel testifiying about his concerns that Trump conditioned Ukraine\u2019s military assistance on an investigation of Joe Biden. \u201cHe did exactly what we teach them to do from cradle to grave,\u201d Kelly said of Vindman during an event at Drew University last night. \u201cHe went and told his boss what he just heard.\u201d Kelly also more broadly criticized Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, which were at the center of the president\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThrough the Obama administration up until that phone call, the policy of the US was militarily to support Ukraine in their defensive fight against \u2026 the Russians,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd so, when the president said that continued support would be based on X, that essentially changed. And that\u2019s what [Vindman] was most interested in.\u201d During her weekly press conference, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump\u2019s comments on Roger Stone\u2019s case represent an \u201cassault on the rule of law\u201d and an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d \u201cThis is an abuse of power that the president is again trying to manipulate federal law enforcement to serve his political interests,\u201d Pelosi said. The Democratic speaker called on Republican lawmakers to \u201cspeak out\u201d against the president\u2019s actions and specifically criticized the attorney general for his handling of the Stone case. \u201cThe attorney general has stooped to such levels,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWhat a sad disappointment to our country.\u201d Jessie Liu, the former US attorney whose nomination for a top Treasury post was withdrawn because of her involvement in the prosecution of former Trump associate Roger Stone, has reportedly resigned. CNN reports: Jessie Liu, who previously headed the US attorney\u2019s office in Washington, submitted her resignation to the Treasury Department, effective Wednesday evening. She went to the Treasury Department with the intention of filling a Senate-confirmed position, which is no longer available after her nomination was withdrawn earlier Wednesday, the official said. While head of the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Washington, Liu inherited many of the major ongoing cases from Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation and was also handling the politically charged case of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire who is also a CNN contributor. Trump\u2019s decision to abruptly withdraw her nomination was directly tied to her former job. Democratic congressman Joaquin Castro has introduced a resolution calling for the resignation of Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s adviser who has helped to craft the president\u2019s immigration agenda. In a statement, Castro criticized Miller as \u201ca known white nationalist and believer of white supremacist ideology.\u201d \u201cStephen Miller\u2019s presence in the Trump White House has allowed him to sow hate into federal policy, grind our immigration system to a halt, and encourage the President\u2019s own xenophobic beliefs,\u201d Castro said. Kamala Harris is expected to introduce a similar resolution in the Senate. According to a series of reports released by the Souther Poverty Law Center, Miller endorsed white nationalist books and websites in emails to a writer for the far-right website Breitbart. Pete Buttigieg is now wading into a controversy surrounding a flier from the influential Culinary Union in Nevada, with nine days to go until the state\u2019s caucuses. With Bernie Sanders becoming the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary, the union distributed a flier warning the Vermont senator\u2019s Medicare-for-all plan would jeopardize workers\u2019 popular healthcare plan. The union then said it was \u201cviciously attacked\u201d by Sanders\u2019 supporters, and Buttigieg is now coming to the union\u2019s defense. To reiterate, Buttigieg needs an impressive performance in Nevada to prove he can win over voters outside the mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg is releasing a new Spanish-language television ad in Nevada, which will hold its caucuses next Saturday. The ad features Buttigieg, who speaks Spanish and several other languages, saying what has becoming a common line at his campaign rallies: \u201cI want you to picture the first day after the Donald Trump presidency.\u201d Buttigieg had impressive performances in the first two voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, but his path to the Democratic nomination is uncertain as the primary moves on to more racially diverse states. The former Indiana mayor is currently polling in the low single digits with voters of color. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s former White House communications director, is reportedly returning to the administration to work under Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser. The New York Times reports: Ms. Hicks, 31, worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign from its inception and followed him to the White House after he was elected, eventually becoming communications director. Her return will come as his re-election campaign intensifies and as his advisers say the superstitious president has talked about recreating some aspects of that first race. Ms. Hicks\u2019s title when she left belied her influence with Mr. Trump, who felt more personal comfort with her than with almost any other adviser. But on her return, she will report to Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and work with the White House political director, Brian Jack. Her title will be \u2018counselor to the president.\u2019 The senior administration official said that Ms. Hicks would work on projects that Mr. Kushner oversees, including the re-election campaign. She will not rejoin the communications office. Speaking at a campaign event in the Super Tuesday state of North Carolina, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg thanked Trump for giving him the attention boost of a presidential tweet. On Trump\u2019s nickname for him of \u201cMini Mike,\u201d Bloomberg said, \u201cDonald, where I come from, we measure your height from neck up.\u201d Trump\u2019s insults to Bloomberg come as national polls show the former New York mayor in third place in the Democratic primary, trailing only Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. It seems America just can\u2019t shake Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s former press secretary who first came to fame by making false claims about the size of the crowd at the president\u2019s inauguration. After performing on the most recent season of \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d Spicer is now getting his own show for the conservative website Newsmax. In a press release announcing Spicer\u2019s new show, Newsmax\u2019s CEO applauded the former press secretary for \u201coff the charts\u201d ratings during his press conferences, which were often riddled with inaccuracies and controversial comments. In addition to the false claims about the inaguration crowd size, Spicer once said of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons against civilians, \u201cYou know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn\u2019t even sink to using chemical weapons.\u201d This morning, Trump had some insults to throw at Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, who is using his vast personal fortune to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign ads. Bloomberg responded in kind by suggesting those in the New York business community call Trump \u201ca carnival barking clown\u201d: The relationship between Trump and Bloomberg goes back years because the two men were both so well known in New York. But much of their current animosity seems to stem from comments Bloomberg made about Trump during the 2016 Democratic convention. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s running his business? God help us,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.\u201d The Democratic establishment is worried about Bernie Sanders becoming the party\u2019s nominee, as the New York Times, the Hill, Politico and others report today. To summarise, centrist Democrats \u2013 including Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and reportedly Barack Obama \u2013 are concerned about the prospect of his success in the primary race for four interlinked reasons: They think he\u2019s too leftwing for voters\u2019 tastes They think he\u2019s too leftwing for their own tastes They think he\u2019s not a real Democrat (he sits in the Senate as an independent) They dislike him personally and blame him for Clinton\u2019s 2016 defeat Many leading media commentators seem to share their fears. In the New York Times, Nick Kristof argues that \u201cthere is one kind of candidate that Americans remain hostile to. Only 45 percent say that they would be willing to vote for a socialist\u201d. In the Washington Post, a sceptical Charles Lane wants to ask Sanders \u201ca few serious questions\u201d, while Max Boot writes: \u201cGiven the terrible track record of far-left candidates in the 2018 midterm election and in the recent British election (Jeremy Corbyn lost in a landslide), [Sanders] is a risk we cannot afford to run.\u201d Over at the Wall Street Journal, Daniel Henninger asks of Sanders\u2019 plan to replace the health insurance industry with a publicly run model: \u201cCome Election Day in November, will 50% of the electorate actually believe Democrats today could competently administer a national health-care system in the US?\u201d When Elizabeth Warren briefly seemed to become a frontrunner in the Democratic race last year, her policies \u2013 particularly her healthcare plan, which is similar to Sanders\u2019 \u2013 came in for sustained criticism and her position in the race began to fade. It\u2019s possible the same thing is about to happen with Sanders after his victory in New Hampshire and effective tie in Iowa. Joe Biden provided a preview of that attack during Friday\u2019s debate, telling Sanders his proposal \u201cwill cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes aren\u2019t going to go up is just crazy.\u201d Sanders had a reply: We are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans. What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money. It\u2019s a case he\u2019s likely to be asked to make again in the next few weeks. Donald Trump does not seem too worried about the snowballing controversy over his interference in the Roger Stone case (see earlier). Echoing the case made by Fox News (see here), the president has tweeted: The New York Times reports on the Instagram posts by leading meme-makers that Mike Bloomberg has bought. The self-deprecating and somewhat meta posts pretend to be screenshots of messages from the former New York mayor to the memestagrammers asking them to make memes that make him look cool. Still following? Here\u2019s one example: The posts \u2013 which state that they are sponsored by the presidential candidate \u2013 are an illustration of how freely the billionaire businessman is able to spend on the Democratic primary, and met a mixed response from commenters. \u201cYou may have bought a third mayoral term, @mikebloomberg but you\u2019re not buying the presidency. #endcorruption,\u201d wrote glassslipper below a post by fuckjerry. \u201cThese are trash and flooding my timeline,\u201d wrote onekitwonder under a post that used a picture of Bernie Sanders that has become a meme recently. \u201cwhy is every meme page doing this?\u201d asked piraetje. \u201ci don\u2019t get it, is it because i\u2019m Dutch?\u201d It\u2019s interesting to see how the more pro-Trump sections of the US media are reporting the Stone controversy. Breitbart sent out an email this morning headlined: \u201cJustice for Roger Stone!\u201d The newsletter\u2019s lead story is an opinion piece by John Nolte that defends cutting the guidelines for Stone\u2019s sentencing with the following argument: Regardless of your opinion of Stone, he was only found guilty of lying to Congress (which plenty of people have done without being prosecuted), interfering in the House investigation of the Russia Collusion Hoax, and tampering with a witness ... Hey, I\u2019m no Roger Stone fan, and it actually sounds like he deserves some prison time, but there are murderers and rapists and child molesters who don\u2019t serve seven to nine years. Meanwhile Fox News\u2019 morning email focuses on the revelation that the foreperson in Stone\u2019s trial had a \u201chistory of Democratic activism and a string of her anti-Trump, left-wing social media posts\u201d. This, Fox states, has \u201craised questions about how the case was handled and whether Stone\u2019s lawyers could seek a new trial\u201d. Good morning. Controversy continues to rage over Donald Trump\u2019s intervention in the sentencing of his friend and unofficial adviser Roger Stone \u2013 which Democrat Chuck Schumer has called \u201ca crisis in the rule of law in America\u201d. Yesterday William Barr, the US attorney general, agreed to testify before a congressional committee over alleged political interference at the justice department, Democrats said, as they warned of \u201ca crisis in the rule of law in America\u201d. The entire prosecution team in the case resigned in protest after the justice department considerably softened its sentencing recommendations in the case. That followed Trump tweeting of Stone\u2019s original sentence recommendation: \u201cThis is a horrible and very unfair situation ... Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!\u201d The final decision on Stone\u2019s fate will rest with US district judge Amy Berman Jackson, who repeatedly took a harsh tone with Stone during his trial for obstruction of justice, lying to Congress and witness tampering. Stone\u2019s sentencing is expected on 20 February. David Smith has more here: And he explains the background to the case and what\u2019s at stake here: Meanwhile, Ed Pilkington has spoken to lawyers who say the US justice system is facing a crisis of credibility that could undermine the integrity of federal prosecutors, politicize the legal handling of Trump\u2019s friends and enemies, and ultimately threaten democracy itself: He notes that Trump is also reported to have tried to interfere with the sentencing of another ally, former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Today Trump has a meeting with New York governor Andrew Cuomo, while Democratic presidential candidates continue to campaign across the country ahead of the next primary contests. Joe Biden will be in New York, Michael Bloomberg in North Carolina and Texas, Pete Buttigieg in Indiana and Nevada, Elizabeth Warren in Virginia, and Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar in Nevada. We\u2019ll cover all today\u2019s US politics news here throughout the day, and here\u2019s a bit of further reading to get you started:",

      "bodyText": "UK Athletics was thrown into yet more turmoil on Thursday night when its chair, Chris Clark, resigned after barely seven months in charge on the day the troubled organisation also announced its new chief executive. Joanna Adams, the highly regarded CEO of England Netball from 2015 to 2019, has been given the substantial task of rebuilding the battered reputation of UK Athletics. Her starting date is yet to be confirmed but she will join a sport that has lost two chairs, two chief executives and its performance director Neil Black in the last 17 months \u2013 and this week also became the subject of a major UK Sport review. That review could well lead to job losses and a cut in lottery funding, and to make matters potentially worse UK Athletics will also soon announce the findings of a separate independent review into its relationship with the US coach Alberto Salazar, who received a four-year ban for doping last year. There are also questions over the long-term state of the organisation\u2019s finances, with the Guardian revealing on Wednesday that the BBC was willing to pay only a fraction of the \u00a33m-a-year fee it currently pays the organisation for live coverage. Adams will become the organisation\u2019s first full-time chief executive since Niels de Vos left in 2018. The post was originally due to be filled by Zara Hyde Peters in December but she stepped down before starting after questions were raised over whether she allowed her husband to coach at a local athletics club after he had an \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with a 15-year-old schoolgirl. Adams is credited with professionalising netball by bringing in major sponsors and television agreements while growing grassroots participation during her 10 years in the sport \u2013 which included hosting the most successful World Cup in the sport\u2019s history in 2019. After leaving England Netball last August she became the first chief commercial officer at the London Legacy Development Corporation, the organisation responsible for the regeneration of east London and delivering legacy after the London 2012 Olympics. When Adams starts her new role there will be a game of musical chairs at UK Athletics with Clark \u2013 who took over from Richard Bowker last year \u2013 stepping down as chair to take on the development of a commercial plan for track and field. Nic Coward, who took over as acting chief executive only last month, will become chair for the rest of 2020. \u201cThe role of chair for UKA clearly now requires a huge time commitment during this crucial period,\u201d said Clark, who was said by insiders to be surprised that a job that was supposed to take up five days a month was consuming far more of his time. \u201cMy other commitments to regulated businesses and public sector organisations have significantly increased since commencing the role and I have to concede that I cannot give it the time commitment it deserves right now. \u201cHowever, I am delighted to have the opportunity to continue working with UK Athletics on the commercial strategy and Joanna\u2019s appointment and her track record of success in not only sports governance but also commercial, marketing and competition structures means we have excellent leadership to take the sport in a positive future direction.\u201d Clark added: \u201cNic has already made a very positive impact and retaining his expertise for this transition period was an important consideration when the board debated the changes we needed to make. The focus now has to be the future and how we will apply the learnings and best practice from the ongoing reviews and ensure the sport has a hugely successful future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand\u2019s largest city is on the cusp of its longest-ever dry spell, as a total fire ban is declared for the entire North Island, home to millions of people. According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), on Saturday, Auckland will mark 40 days of no rain \u2013 breaking the previous record from 2013, when no rain fell for 39 days. A dry day is classified as one in which less than 1mm of rain falls, with records for the Auckland region dating back to 1943. The conditions have brought water restrictions and drought to many parts of the North Island with animals such as the iconic Kiwi also feeling the strain. According to Niwa regions in Far Northland are now in \u201csevere drought\u201d, with water tankers having to be brought in to replenish supplies. Niwa meteorologist Ben Noll said some areas of the North Island would now require several heavy rain events \u2013 or a month of steady rain \u2013 to replenish parched lakes, rivers and soil. \u201cThere remains at least some hope that some moisture could move toward the North Island between the 20th and the end of the month, but at least until then, rainfall chances appear few and far between,\u201d Noll said. \u201cIt would take several soaking rainfall events to alleviate the extremely dry conditions that are affecting parts of the country.\u201d Associate Professor Cate Macinnis-Ng from the school of biological sciences at the University of Auckland said the drought would not only impact agriculture and farms, but forests and other ecosystems too. \u201cAround the world, there are growing records of forest dieback due to increasing frequencies and intensities of drought due to climate change,\u201d Macinnis-Ng said. \u201cEstablished forests may be relatively safe from drought impacts, [but] seedlings and restoration plantings are vulnerable as developing root systems of smaller plants do not have access to deep soil water stores. If drought continues for extended periods, carbon uptake may be reduced as plant productivity slows.\u201d So far the New Zealand bushfire season has been relatively quiet, but fire and emergency services say \u201cunprecedented\u201d dry conditions in the North Island prompted them to issue a total fire ban this week. Tim Mitchell, rural fire manager at Fire and Emergency New Zealand, described the current fire risk in the North Island as \u201cextreme\u201d and said it was unusual for regions such as Northland, Auckland and Waikato to experience such a long and extreme-risk fire season. \u201cThere is a very real risk that in the current conditions a fire could easily spread and get out of control,\u201d Mitchell said. The warnings come just a week after 2,000 people were evacuated from Southland in the South Island, after days of torrential rains washed away roads, which resulted in the worst flooding the region in the South Island has seen in decades. Meanwhile in western and southern parts of the South Island severe weather warnings have been issued for the weekend, as ex-Tropical Cyclone Uesi passes by.",
