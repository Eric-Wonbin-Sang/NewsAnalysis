Under the plans, low-income households would be able to apply for a grant, paying no upfront costs. They would keep most of the savings on their bills, though part would be used to pay for a proportion of the work. Wealthier households would be able to claim interest-free loans for the work, with the loans claimed back through their bills.</p> <p>Labour said that, through the scheme, 6.34m homes would have heat pumps and 5.3m homes would have solar thermal systems by 2030.

The party says that the Warm Homes for All scheme will create 450,000 jobs over the next decade. Under the plans, low-income households would be able to apply for a grant, paying no upfront costs. They would keep most of the savings on their bills, though part would be used to pay for a proportion of the work. Wealthier households would be able to claim interest-free loans for the work, with the loans claimed back through their bills. Labour said that, through the scheme, 6.34m homes would have heat pumps and 5.3m homes would have solar thermal systems by 2030.

But that may change. As Remain voters become aware of the local tactical context, they may decide that a vote for the Lib Dems is effectively helping Johnson into No 10. Conversely, weeks of \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d rhetoric may convince harder-line, \u201cno deal\u201d Leave voters that a vote for the Brexit party is worth the local risk in order to send a clear message to the political class.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95238d903cb2ff4be0105e3bdcbae03d35c20837\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95238d903cb2ff4be0105e3bdcbae03d35c20837/0_101_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Worcester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worcester is a traditional marginal constituency, where both main parties face losing votes to Leave or Remain insurgents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. The Tory Remain flank <br></h2> <p>While the Conservatives will be looking to advance in Leave territory, Labour and the Liberal Democrats will seek gains on the Tory Remain flank. The most vulnerable part of this flank is seats the party is defending from the Liberal Democrats \u2013 a Lib Dem vote is more attractive than a Labour one to Tory Remainers on both Brexit and domestic-politics grounds. There are a couple of dozen Conservative seats with a Remain skew where the Lib Dems either start in second or where history and local-elections strength suggest they could be in contention \u2013 typically, wealthy suburban places such as Winchester or St Albans.</p> <p>There are also many seats in Remainia where the Conservatives will be fending off a Labour challenge. While direct Conservative-to-Labour switching may seem less likely, plenty of it happened in the last election, and many of these formerly safe seats are now much more vulnerable. Labour can gain more from a small swing in Remain seats than the Conservatives can gain from a small swing in Leave seats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f84d4ce868160f92127cf410db6957bb9a6c380\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f84d4ce868160f92127cf410db6957bb9a6c380/948_296_4418_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester Withington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even solid Labour seats such as Manchester Withington could see a surge to the Lib Dems by disgruntled Remainers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Fryer/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Red Remain redemption? <br></h2> <p>Much of the Remain vote is densely packed into Labour-held city-centre and university seats that support EU membership by landslide margins. The Liberal Democrats will hope to exploit their surging support with Remainers in these Remain bastions, exploiting disappointment with Labour to open up a second front. Tactical-squeeze arguments will not work in such seats, as typically the Conservatives are completely out of the running, so intense Remainer disappointment with Brexit obfuscation could pose serious risks for Labour even in apparently rock-solid seats such as Manchester Withington or Hornsey and Wood Green.</p> <h2>5. Scotland<br></h2> <p>While some voters live in marginal seats, Scots live in a marginal country. Most Scottish seats would change hands on a small swing, virtually none are safe, and many are three- or even four-horse races. The Conservatives face a tough battle to hold on to their 2017 gains against a resurgent Scottish Nationalist party, while the Liberal Democrats will hope for gains too, given Scotland\u2019s strong Remain lean.</p> <h2>6. Wales and Northern Ireland<br></h2> <p>The other smaller nations of the UK will also be hotly contested. Labour support has slumped in Wales, opening up opportunities for the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru. Tactical alliances between Remain or Leave parties could prove crucial here in chaotic four- or five-party contests. Northern Irish polling suggests the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in could find it hard to replicate their 2017 clean sweep. This could have crucial implications for the Westminster balance of power if DUP MPs are replaced by others less sympathetic to the Conservatives or Brexit, or if Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who never take their seats in parliament are replaced by pro-Remain MPs who do.</p> <h2>7. Independents and wildcards<br></h2> <p>Thanks to unprecedented churn in this turbulent parliament, there will be an unusually large crop of high-profile MPs standing as independents, or standing for new parties (and often in new seats). Their presence on the ballot adds a wildcard element to many contests.</p> <p>For example, Luciana Berger\u2019s presence on the ballot as a Liberal Democrat gives the party a chance in Finchley, a seat that would otherwise be hopeless for it. Sam Gyimah and Chuka Umunna could lift Lib Dem prospects elsewhere in London. Labour\u2019s prospects for Broxtowe will be boosted by former Tory Anna Soubry\u2019s presence on the ballot as a Change UK candidate. Dominic Grieve\u2019s Lib Dem-supported run as an independent puts the otherwise rock-solid Conservative seat of Beaconsfield into play, and former MPs running under various banners will complicate Labour\u2019s defences of various seats.</p> <p><em>Rob Ford is professor of political science at the University of Manchester</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson knew of Vote Leave\u2019s overspend during the 2016 EU referendum, but appears to have failed to tell the authorities, according to explosive new claims from a senior MP. The payment was subsequently ruled to be illegal. Ian Lucas revealed that he has seen correspondence obtained during the parliamentary inquiry into disinformation and democracy which showed that Johnson\u2019s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, told the Electoral Commission that the prime minister, and his cabinet colleague Michael Gove, knew of the overspend by the pro-Brexit organisation. The Electoral Commission last year judged that Vote Leave had broken electoral law by overspending during the EU referendum, after the campaign funnelled \u00a3675,000 through another pro-Brexit group, BeLeave, to avoid spending limits. The revelation comes as it was confirmed that prosecutors have received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police that could lead to criminal charges against the Vote Leave campaign, which was spearheaded by Johnson and Cummings. After nearly 16 months of investigating Vote Leave, the Metropolitan Police has handed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service and are seeking \u201cearly investigative advice\u201d on how to develop the case against the pro-Brexit organisation. Vote Leave has always denied any wrongdoing. Veteran Labour MP Lucas, who sat on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee inquiry into fake news, said the correspondence showing that the prime minister had apparently failed to report an offence raised serious questions over Johnson\u2019s judgement. Lucas told the Observer: \u201cJohnson and Gove both knew about the illegal payments to BeLeave. I\u2019ve seen it in writing. We finally forced the Electoral Commission to hand over its correspondence with Dominic Cummings; it\u2019s there in black and white. It\u2019s Cummings himself saying this.\u201d The Wrexham MP also revealed that the disclosure by Cummings was part of a strategy to protect the prime minister and Gove, with Johnson\u2019s chief adviser insisting that both politicians only discovered the overspend after the EU referendum vote, though it\u2019s unknown when exactly it is believed to be. \u201cThe astonishing thing is, he actually said this in the context of defending them. He said they didn\u2019t know at the time, they only knew after the referendum. That means he\u2019s been sitting on this information the entire time,\u201d said Lucas. He added: \u201cIt is totally unacceptable that the prime minister had knowledge that this overspend had occurred and he hasn\u2019t come forward with this evidence,\u201d said Lucas, who recently announced he would stand down at the next general election. \u201cWhat\u2019s quite clear is Cummings, Johnson and Gove are absolutely in this up to their necks. They must now come clean about everything they knew about these offences. Boris Johnson is simply not fit to be prime minister. He clearly has no respect for the law,\u201d Lucas said. Gavin Millar QC of Matrix Chambers said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got two very senior politicians in positions of great responsibility and they have never been required to give an account of what they knew. In the US they would have been hauled in front of a committee.\u201d The development arrives at a particularly delicate period for Johnson and Cummings with fresh pressure on Downing Street yesterday to release a potentially incendiary report into the extent of Russian interference in British politics.

      "bodyText": "Anyway, that\u2019s your lot. Jacob Steinberg was our man at Vicarage Road, and here\u2019s his take on a fine Chelsea attacking show. Thanks for reading the MBM! Frank Lampard holds a post-match debrief with Sky. He\u2019s very happy with his team, save a \u201csloppy\u201d period just before half-time. He\u2019s particularly pleased with his midfield engine room of Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho. Also the manner in which his defenders played out from the back ... though he admits they might have got \u201cover-confident\u201d just before conceding the penalty. But it\u2019s been a good day for him on balance, with Arsenal drawing at home to Wolves and Manchester United going down at Bournemouth. Wow, Chelsea made a meal of that. They could, and arguably should, have been streets ahead. But they missed a fair few chances, while Watford keeper Ben Foster pulled off a series of heroic saves. Gerard Deulofeu\u2019s cheaply purchased late penalty gave Watford a sniff of an unlikely point, and they nearly salvaged a draw at the death. Foster hugs Kepa as the whistle blows on a tale of two keepers. What marvellous entertainment! Foster comes up ... and nearly sends a diving header into the bottom right! But Kepa turns it away, the last touch of the match! Chelsea hang on for their seventh away win in a row ... and Watford remain rooted to the bottom of the table. 90 min +6: Or is it?! Doucoure drives down the left and is clipped by Mount, who is booked for then kicking the ball away. A free kick. Watford load the box! 90 min +5: Willian is replaced by James. Mariappa flings a long throw into the Chelsea mixer, but Dawson can\u2019t get his head on it. Then Masina flashes one harmlessly wide, and that will surely be that. 90 min +4: Willian is down, so Chelsea are effectively seeing this out with ten men. And there\u2019s a game of head tennis in their area, Doucoure unable to meet Deulofeu\u2019s right-wing cross flush. Yet again, Chelsea clear, though they\u2019re in a big panic now. 90 min +3: Deulofeu dances down the right, pushing Chelsea back towards their own box. But he can\u2019t find anyone in yellow and black with his cross. Chelsea clear their lines again. 90 min +2: Deulofeu and Hughes work hard down the right wing, but can\u2019t prise Chelsea open. The visitors hold their shape with ease. 90 min +1: ... and yet they\u2019re now hanging on, the crowd having been energised by the announcement of five added minutes. Doucoure has a dig from distance, but his effort is blocked. How on earth have Chelsea got themselves into this position?! 90 min: Batshuayi spins Mariappa and romps clear. He should score, but hesitates and allows Masina to come across and block. It\u2019s really not clear how Chelsea have only scored two goals this evening. They should have had a hatful. 89 min: Jorginho is booked for taking an age over a free kick out on the right. He\u2019ll miss the upcoming game against Crystal Palace as a result. 88 min: Batshuayi comes on for Abraham. 87 min: Deulofeu and the gloriously chippy Jorginho lock horns over something or other. VAR has a quick look but it\u2019s deemed a lot of noise over nothing, grown men and all. 86 min: Willian drives down the right. His low cross is nearly hooked goalwards by Hudson-Odoi, but the hosts clear. 84 min: Masina attempts a shot from distance that\u2019s at the very upper end of ambitious. And the ball nestles in the very upper end of the stand behind the goal. What a waste of good territory. Also a chance for Chelsea to take their sweet time to restart. 83 min: Pulisic is replaced by Hudson-Odoi. A rare old atmosphere at Vicarage Road now, and we have ourselves a denouement! 82 min: Dawson comes sliding in on Emerson. You\u2019ve seen red cards given for challenges like that, his studs showing. But it\u2019s just a yellow, and VAR\u2019s not of a mind to overturn it. Well, well. 81 min: Watford could easily have been on the end of a Southampton-sized humiliation, were it not for Foster\u2019s heroics. But now the game\u2019s suddenly in the balance! Football, huh. Deulofeu slams the penalty into the bottom left. Kepa with no chance! 79 min: After an age, VAR gives a penalty to Watford! There was contact, even if Deulofeu went down in instalments. He\u2019ll take the spot kick himself! 78 min: Now the crowd are belting out the modern classic Fuck VAR. Preach on, everyone. 77 min: Deulofeu goes down in the box after being tapped on the ankle by Jorginho. This one\u2019s going to VAR. It\u2019s a theatrical tumble, and a delayed reaction, though that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019ll not get the decision. 75 min: Janmaat is replaced by Kiko. It\u2019s not a popular decision, and the Watford faithful launch into a rendition of You Don\u2019t Know What You\u2019re Doing. Po\u2019 Quique. His second honeymoon period at the club hasn\u2019t lasted too long, has it. 73 min: Mount exchanges quick passes with Jorginho and has a dig from the edge of the box. He doesn\u2019t quite catch it ... but Foster does. Chelsea look like scoring every time they go forward. 71 min: Some space for Janmaat down the right. He reaches the byline and stands one up for Hughes in the centre. Hughes is free, ten yards out, but his attempt to connect head to bouncing ball is both strange and not very good. 70 min: Nothing comes of the set piece, though Jorginho comes together with Hughes on the edge of the box, and he\u2019s after a penalty. He\u2019s not getting it. There is some official action soon after, though, as Janmaat is booked for a silly slide on Pulisic. 69 min: Chelsea play their way out of a tight spot at the back. Mount should spring Pulisic clear, but overhits the pass. No matter, because the visitors are soon coming back at their hosts. The increasingly influential Kovacic twists down the middle and dinks forward for Abraham, who turns on a sixpence and nearly gets a shot on target. Instead, the ball\u2019s deflected away for a corner. 67 min: Hughes comes on for Chalobah. 66 min: Chelsea ping it around, and their fans enjoy every kick. 64 min: Willian causes more bother down the right. He cuts back for Kovacic, who shoots towards the bottom left. The ball flies wide, though Abraham isn\u2019t far away from turning the poor effort into a successful cross, an inch or so shy of poking home from six yards. Goal kick. This isn\u2019t going to end 0-2, surely not. More goals to come. 62 min: Willian slips Azpilicueta clear on the overlap down the right. The Chelsea captain stands one up. It\u2019s half cleared, but drops to Kovacic on the edge of the box. The resulting shot whistles straight down Foster\u2019s throat. Sure, Watford might not be the toughest opponents ... but even so, Chelsea are really good to watch in full flight. 60 min: That\u2019s Foster\u2019s fifth fine save of the evening. You couldn\u2019t really fault him had he let all those chances past. This could have been a very embarrassing scoreline. It still might be, because Chelsea don\u2019t look in the mood to stop piling forward. 58 min: Willian has the wind in his sail. He goes on a blistering run down the right, but can\u2019t quite find Pulisic with a diagonal pass. Then Kovacic drives down the middle ... and he does find Pulisic, sending him into the area down the left. Pulisic\u2019s low shot across Foster is heading into the bottom right. But the keeper sticks out a leg to divert. 57 min: That will have been a sickener for Watford, who had attacked with positivity since the restart. It\u2019s an uphill task now, though. Another week spent rock bottom looks likely. Willian drives forward down the centre. He slips a ball to his right for Abraham, who squares it across goal. Pulisic arrives to slam home from six yards. Easy as that. Four in two for the young American! 53 min: In an attempt to win a 50-50 challenge in midfield, Dawson spins Abraham around in a headlock. Free kick, though he\u2019s pretty fortunate to escape a booking. 52 min: Willian is down complaining after being legitimately whacked by a hard-tackling Chalobah. He should be OK to continue, though. 50 min: Watford deal with Pulisic\u2019s corner easily. Foster has been immense tonight. Watford would be getting spanked without him. 49 min: A stunning pitch-long move by Chelsea, started by Pulisic near his own left-hand corner flag. Willian scampers towards the Watford box and feeds Mount to his left. Mount pearls a shot goalwards, but it\u2019s parried well by Foster. It\u2019s a corner. 47 min: Emerson takes a fresh-air kick and allows Deulofeu to make good towards the Chelsea box down the right. Deulofeu slips the ball across to Gray, who looks like having a free crack from the penalty spot ... but out of nowhere comes Zouma, sliding across to block at the very last second! That was Watford\u2019s best move of the match, but what sensational defending by Zouma to deny them an equaliser. 46 min: Emerson and Pulisic combine neatly in the middle. The former bursts into a lot of space, and is cynically clipped by Kabasele, who is booked for his trouble. Watford get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes. Half-time reading. Here\u2019s how the two teams currently above Chelsea did earlier this afternoon. Plenty of late drama just a click away! After going behind early doors to Tammy Abraham\u2019s fine goal, Watford have done well to stay in this game. Having said that, without Ben Foster, they\u2019d be four goals down. As things stand, Chelsea will rise to third place this evening. 45 min: A free kick for Watford out on the right. They load the box. Deulofeu whips it in, but Mariappa can\u2019t get a decent connection on his header. There will be one added minute. 43 min: Mount dribbles sensationally around a couple of challenges on the left, real ball-glued-to-boot stuff in a tight spot. He then launches an equally wonderful shot towards the top right from 25 yards. Foster gets a fingernail to it, and diverts it from the corner onto the underside of the bar and out! That was top-drawer football all round. What a save (pt.III in a continuing series)! But what a talent Mount is. 41 min: Watford are beginning to create proper chances now. Deulofeu\u2019s cute flick down the right allows Doucoure to make his way towards the Chelsea box. His shot isn\u2019t all that, and easily deflected away from danger. This is a brave effort by Watford after their dreadfully slow start. 39 min: Deulofeu wins a corner down the right. Chelsea half clear the set piece, but Deulofeu is able to come straight back at Chelsea, dribbling at pace down the same flank, cutting inside, and lashing a low diagonal shot inches wide of the left-hand post. A decent effort, although he\u2019ll be annoyed not to have hit the target at the very least. 38 min: Pulisic attempts to release Abraham down the middle with a basic hoof, and nearly succeeds, but Dawson battles hard and Foster is able to deal with the situation. 36 min: Pereyra feeds Doucoure down the right. Doucoure\u2019s low cross, intended for Gray in the middle, is blocked by Emerson. Watford are at least finding some good areas now, even if they\u2019re yet to seriously work Kepa. 35 min: ... nothing happens. They faff about with a short corner, and suddenly the ball\u2019s shuttled all the way back to Kepa! What total nonsense. 34 min: Pulisic slides a pass down the inside left for Mount, who reaches the byline and cuts back, hoping to find Willian. Watford bundle the ball out for a corner on the left. From which ... 32 min: Watford are working their way into this now. Pereyra nearly releases Deulofeu with a long rake down the right, but his team-mate can\u2019t bring the ball down. Then Gray is sent scampering along the left. He doesn\u2019t back himself against Zouma and turns tail. But the crowd are a little happier now, as Watford spend a bit of quality time in the Chelsea half at last. 30 min: Willian dribbles down the right and cuts inside. He\u2019s afforded a preposterous amount of time to shoot, but his attempt to curl a shot into the bottom corner is weak and easily gathered by Foster. 28 min: Chalobah has a crack from the best part of 30 yards. The ball is blocked the second it leaves his boot. Watford have suddenly stepped it up, harassing Chelsea into a couple of loose passes. Small acorns, and all that. 26 min: Zouma dawdles and allows Pereyra to strip him of the ball. But as Pereyra advances towards the box, he\u2019s quickly swarmed and Chelsea clear their lines. This is all too easy for the visitors at the minute. 25 min: Doucoure tries to inject some zest into Watford\u2019s game, barging through the middle of the park. But he doesn\u2019t have any options. Possession\u2019s given up soon enough. 23 min: Willian sends Azpilicueta into space down the right. The Chelsea captain whistles a low diagonal ball through the box. Watford are forced to concede a corner, and deal with the subsequent set piece easily enough. But Chelsea look like scoring every time they pile forward. 21 min: Masina makes his way down the right and crosses into the Chelsea box. Doucoure competes but can\u2019t connect. A little better from the hosts. 20 min: Cathcart can\u2019t continue. He makes way for Mariappa. 19 min: And from the set piece, another stunning save by Foster! Willian\u2019s corner from the right is met by Pulisic at the near post. He sends a looping header across goal, towards the top left. It\u2019s dropping in, but Foster heroically back-pedals and claws it out! He\u2019s just kept Watford in this game ... though for how long is moot, given the way the rest of the team are playing right now. 18 min: Mount tears towards the Watford box. His shot is deflected left, into the path of Abraham, who is clear in the area! His shot is parried brilliantly by Foster. Corner. 17 min: ... though on the whole, Watford are struggling to get a foothold in this game. Chelsea have enjoyed nearly 70 percent possession so far. 15 min: This is better from Watford. Deulofeu causes some bother down the right. The ball ends up clanking around in the Chelsea area. Chalobah imposes a little control, cushioning a pass back to tee up the in-rushing Pereyra, who sidefoots harmlessly into the arms of Kepa. A tame finish, but perhaps that little passage of play will help build some much-needed confidence. 14 min: Space for Willian down the right. He launches a 100mph ball across the face of goal. A toenail to that, and it was flying into the net. But nobody in blue can get there fast enough. 13 min: Cathcart is down, frowning. The medical staff come on and give him the once over. It looks as though he\u2019ll be good to continue, whatever\u2019s up with him. 12 min: Willian tries to lob Foster from the halfway line, pretty much. It\u2019s always floating wide. But there\u2019s confidence for you. It\u2019s coursing through the veins of the Chelsea collective. 11 min: Deulofeu tries to get something going for Watford down the left, but there\u2019s nobody around to help him in his quest. Chelsea are looking very comfortable, Watford already slightly panicky and desperate. 9 min: Mount wastes the good position by ballooning his delivery miles over the bar. A shot that redefined ambition. 8 min: More of the Chelsea passing. Chalobah gets fed up with it and bundles Mount over. A free kick in a dangerous position out on the left. Chelsea load the box. 6 min: Watford look stunned. The crowd, falling quiet, certainly sound it. Willian threatens to break dangerously down the right, but can\u2019t quite stay in control. The Premier League\u2019s bottom side need to get their act together, and quick. Well this didn\u2019t take long. Kovacic passes infield from the right, on the halfway line. Jorginho plays a delightful long curling pass down the inside-right channel, releasing Abraham, who beats Foster to the ball and sidefoots over the keeper from the edge of the box. What a lovely finish ... and some pass, too. 4 min: See 2 min, though Watford might be getting a little sick of it now. 2 min: It\u2019s all Chelsea possession early doors. Ping, pass, ping, pass. All in the midfield, and Watford don\u2019t seem to mind too much. And we\u2019re off! Chelsea get the ball rolling. If they win tonight, it\u2019ll be their seventh consecutive away win, and it\u2019d equal a club record set back in the days when they were managed by Bobby Campbell and played in the old Second Division. The teams are out! Watford are in their trademark yellow and black, arranged in Victorian-era halves, while Chelsea wear 1980s distressed blue. It\u2019s still a miserable evening. We\u2019ll be off soon, after a minute\u2019s quiet reflection ahead of Remembrance Day. And now it\u2019s a quick word with Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores. \u201cWe are improving, getting more solid. We will try to take the next step and win. We need more possession in the last third, and we need to relax more making our decisions.\u201d Frank Lampard talks to Sky. \u201cI\u2019m aware of how the Premier League works, and it\u2019s easy and casual to say what\u2019s expected today because of the league positions. That doesn\u2019t come into my thinking at all. I see a team that were strong last year, have pretty much similar personnel, and have a reason to get a result and get up the table. They\u2019re a more dangerous animal where they are than possibly anywhere else in the league! So we have to be on our game. We\u2019ve been good away from home and we want to continue that.\u201d Big stakes tonight at Vicarage Road, now all the 3pm matches are done and dusted. Chelsea will move into third place, above Leicester City, should they avoid defeat. Watford can only move off the bottom if they win, though if they manage to pick up their first three-point haul of the season, they\u2019ll leapfrog Norwich City and Southampton into 18th place. Avant-garde weather report. Watford make one change to the XI that started the goalless draw with Bournemouth. Tom Cleverley is replaced by Andre Gray. Chelsea also make one change to the team named for the win against Burnley. Marcos Alonso drops to the bench, to be replaced by Emerson. Watford: Foster, Dawson, Cathcart, Kabasele, Janmaat, Doucoure, Chalobah, Masina, Deulofeu, Pereyra, Gray. Subs: Gomes, Mariappa, Hughes, Femenia, Success, Holebas, Foulquier. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Emerson Palmieri, Jorginho, Kovacic, Willian, Mount, Pulisic, Abraham. Subs: Alonso, Caballero, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi, James, Gilmour. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). This is asking for trouble, of course it is. But there could be plenty of goals here this evening. Entertainment a-go-go! You see, bottom-of-the-league Watford are a shambles right now. They\u2019ve yet to win in the Premier League this season. They\u2019ve already shipped three goals twice at Vicarage Road, against Brighton on the opening day and against West Ham not long after that. They were also absolutely battered by the last top and in-form team they played, shipping eight at Manchester City. Solidity is very much a pipe dream at present. So they\u2019ll doubtless be less than thrilled to see Chelsea heaving into view. Frank Lampard\u2019s young side have already scored 16 goals on their travels in this campaign. Then again, that defence isn\u2019t the finished article quite yet, and they\u2019ve also let 11 in. The Hornets can also take succour from their recent form under returning manager Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores. Three draws in a row might not represent sparkling form, though they were four minutes and one VAR decision away from a win at Spurs, and in any case you\u2019ve got to start the rebuild slowly. Chelsea are favourites for this, then, not least because they\u2019ve won five of their last six matches against Watford. The hosts will take a little heart from the one other match in that sequence - a 4-1 skelping of the Blues in February 2018 - and from the fact that a first league win of the season has to come at some point. Doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

I\u2019m sick of listening to them, no one gives you a straight yes or no. I know I should vote, but sod that. I can\u2019t be bothered any more,\u201d said Anthony McMillin, 60. McMillin comes from a \u201cwhole family\u201d of Labour voters, and he voted Labour in every election until two years ago, when he switched to Ukip. He left school at 16 for a job in the local steelworks, which lasted three years until the plant closed in 1975. Then he was a swimming pool attendant, and later played in a band until the gigs dried up.

      "body": "<p>Given that it was little more than a duel between Ben Foster and Chelsea\u2019s forwards at times, it would have been a strange twist if the goalkeeper had rescued a point for Watford with the game\u2019s final act. They were into the sixth minute of added time when Foster, who had kept his side in it with countless saves, decided to charge forward after Mason Mount conceded a free-kick deep on the left, and it would have been an extraordinary ending if the 36-year-old\u2019s downward header had crept beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p> <p>It was not to be. Arrizabalaga plunged down to his left to make a superb save and the Spaniard\u2019s heroics stopped Chelsea blowing the chance to move into third place, ensuring that there were limits to Frank Lampard\u2019s anger after the late VAR intervention that gave Gerard Deulofeu, who had tumbled after feeling minimal contact from Jorginho, the chance to drag Watford back into the game from the penalty spot in the 80th minute.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s last-gasp heroics seal Liverpool\u2019s dramatic win at Aston Villa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have to be careful but last week we saw a change in VAR, a clear change in penalties getting overturned,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI was at a managers\u2019 meeting in midweek and we spoke a lot about it. The consensus from managers, referees, the Premier League was the penalties or decisions are not going to get overturned unless they\u2019re absolutely clear and obvious, and the VAR absolutely saw something that the referee on the pitch didn\u2019t see.</p> <p>\u201cThis didn\u2019t, it nowhere near showed that, and the longer it took the more worried I got. I\u2019m so surprised from coming away from that meeting to have that decision today. We\u2019re not in a great place with it, are we?

Chelsea might have rued their generous finishing on another day and their manger was not alone in struggling to understand how Watford, who are bottom of the league and winless in their first 11 games, almost snatched an unlikely point.</p> <p>Chelsea had taken control from the start and there were five minutes on the clock when Jorginho carved Watford open with an assist that meant Tammy Abraham did not even have to take a touch before scoring his ninth goal of the season. It was a stunning pass from the midfielder, delivered with enough pace and bend to expose Craig Dawson\u2019s slack positioning in central defence, and Abraham ran clear before dinking a lovely finish over Foster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/manchester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kyle Walker sink brave Southampton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watford\u2019s hopes of containment were in tatters. They had lined up in a cautious 5-4-1 system but Chelsea cut through them at will and only a series of wonderful saves from Foster meant the game hung in the balance at the break. The veteran goalkeeper showed quick reflexes to deny Abraham a second, he leapt to his right to claw Christian Pulisic\u2019s header aside and he completed a hat-trick of brilliant stops on the stroke of half-time, springing to his left to tip Mount\u2019s thunderous effort on to the bar.</p> <p>There was little to inconvenience Chelsea at the other end, save for a drive from Deulofeu that skidded wide, and they doubled their lead in the 55th minute. Foster had just made another fine stop from Mount when Willian fed Abraham, who drilled in a low cross that Pulisic converted from close range.</p> <p>It threatened to become an ordeal for Watford after the American winger\u2019s fourth goal in three games, following his hat-trick in the 4-2 win at Burnley last Saturday. There were widespread jeers when Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores replaced Daryl Janmaat with Kiko Femen\u00eda in the 75th minute and it is doubtful that the disgruntled home fans were fooled by the late flurry that followed Deulofeu\u2019s penalty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Given that it was little more than a duel between Ben Foster and Chelsea\u2019s forwards at times, it would have been a strange twist if the goalkeeper had rescued a point for Watford with the game\u2019s final act. They were into the sixth minute of added time when Foster, who had kept his side in it with countless saves, decided to charge forward after Mason Mount conceded a free-kick deep on the left, and it would have been an extraordinary ending if the 36-year-old\u2019s downward header had crept beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga. It was not to be. Arrizabalaga plunged down to his left to make a superb save and the Spaniard\u2019s heroics stopped Chelsea blowing the chance to move into third place, ensuring that there were limits to Frank Lampard\u2019s anger after the late VAR intervention that gave Gerard Deulofeu, who had tumbled after feeling minimal contact from Jorginho, the chance to drag Watford back into the game from the penalty spot in the 80th minute. \u201cI have to be careful but last week we saw a change in VAR, a clear change in penalties getting overturned,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI was at a managers\u2019 meeting in midweek and we spoke a lot about it. The consensus from managers, referees, the Premier League was the penalties or decisions are not going to get overturned unless they\u2019re absolutely clear and obvious, and the VAR absolutely saw something that the referee on the pitch didn\u2019t see. \u201cThis didn\u2019t, it nowhere near showed that, and the longer it took the more worried I got. I\u2019m so surprised from coming away from that meeting to have that decision today. We\u2019re not in a great place with it, are we? Anything that takes that long means there\u2019s something they\u2019re not sure about, so why aren\u2019t we using the screen at the side of the pitch?\u201d Lampard was also annoyed the margin of victory was not more emphatic as his slick side equalled a club record with their seventh consecutive away win in all competitions. Chelsea might have rued their generous finishing on another day and their manger was not alone in struggling to understand how Watford, who are bottom of the league and winless in their first 11 games, almost snatched an unlikely point. Chelsea had taken control from the start and there were five minutes on the clock when Jorginho carved Watford open with an assist that meant Tammy Abraham did not even have to take a touch before scoring his ninth goal of the season. It was a stunning pass from the midfielder, delivered with enough pace and bend to expose Craig Dawson\u2019s slack positioning in central defence, and Abraham ran clear before dinking a lovely finish over Foster. Watford\u2019s hopes of containment were in tatters. They had lined up in a cautious 5-4-1 system but Chelsea cut through them at will and only a series of wonderful saves from Foster meant the game hung in the balance at the break. The veteran goalkeeper showed quick reflexes to deny Abraham a second, he leapt to his right to claw Christian Pulisic\u2019s header aside and he completed a hat-trick of brilliant stops on the stroke of half-time, springing to his left to tip Mount\u2019s thunderous effort on to the bar. There was little to inconvenience Chelsea at the other end, save for a drive from Deulofeu that skidded wide, and they doubled their lead in the 55th minute. Foster had just made another fine stop from Mount when Willian fed Abraham, who drilled in a low cross that Pulisic converted from close range. It threatened to become an ordeal for Watford after the American winger\u2019s fourth goal in three games, following his hat-trick in the 4-2 win at Burnley last Saturday. There were widespread jeers when Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores replaced Daryl Janmaat with Kiko Femen\u00eda in the 75th minute and it is doubtful that the disgruntled home fans were fooled by the late flurry that followed Deulofeu\u2019s penalty.",

      "bodyText": "Question: how many progressive Labor MPs does it take to change a lightbulb? Answer: no idea \u2013 first we need to find one willing to stand up and be counted. There has been a fair bit of talk since the election that the ALP has to rediscover the centre and stop trying to appeal to progressives. Mostly it involves imitating the Australian\u2019s Paul Kelly about needing to connect with quiet Australians and let go of fashionable causes. It all sounds very sensible \u2013 or would, if there was any real evidence that the ALP was actually progressive in any meaningful sense. The ALP mostly indulges in progressive cosplay. It dabbles but the commitment is not there \u2013 it will get pushed over by the barest mention of national security or talk of traditional values, and voters know it. In reality, most in the party are glued to the centre. This week the former US president Barack Obama suggested to college students that \u201cthis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re politically woke, and all that stuff \u2013 you should get over that quickly\u201d. His words were unsurprisingly greeted with joy by those for whom centrism is the great security blanket and by conservatives who could rejoice that Obama was calling out the \u201ccancel culture\u201d of the left. His words echoed those of Labor MP Clare O\u2019Neil, who in a speech this week to the John Curtin Research Centre, said \u201cthere is a culture developing in the progressive movement where membership is granted with a box of ideas. And if you don\u2019t accept one of the ideas in the box, you do not merely have a different opinion, you are obviously wrong, probably stupid and possibly subhuman\u201d. But the problem with criticism of the \u201ccancel culture\u201d is it ignores that the ones doing most of the cancelling are conservatives. Conservatives in this country have cancelled progressive taxation, have tried for 40 years to cancel public health and education, have cancelled any attempts to increase Newstart, been doing their best to cancel the NBN and have cancelled a price on carbon, any effective action on climate change, and tried in vain to cancel moves to allow gender equality. Most recently we had conservatives in New South Wales trying with all their might to cancel legal abortion. And of course the most egregious example of cancel culture in Australia was by the Australian newspaper, which used a short Facebook post by Yassmin Abdel-Magied as an excuse to hound her out of work and in the end the country. On the other side, progressives get annoyed when Alan Jones uses the N word, Sky News and the ABC interview Nazis or far-right extremists, and political parties continue to mouth platitudes about climate change and then seek to foster growth in the coal industry. And then we have the ALP\u2019s deputy, Richard Marles, stating that they are open to supporting new laws to outlaw the type of protest engaged by organisations such as Extinction Rebellion. A labour party not willing to stand up for the right to protest is one so utterly bereft of soul it has cancelled its own history. If you think the ALP has become beholden to leftwing university radicals, you probably think leftwing university radicals are still sitting around listening to U2. The ALP is devoid of the one thing that stamps out all progressive parties around the world \u2013 inspiration. In her speech, O\u2019Neil suggested the way to bring people together is by \u201cdefining and nourishing not who we are against but what we have in common\u201d and that \u201cJacinda Ardern\u2019s irrepressible likability and her vivid, genuine commitment to her country\u201d was a prime example. The problem, of course, is that there is no room for anyone like Ardern in the ALP leadership group. Were she in the ALP she\u2019d be told to wait her turn \u2013 such as occurred with O\u2019Neil, who is the same age as the 39-year-old Ardern but who dropped out of running for the deputy ALP position this year to clear the way for Marles.

O\u2019Neil referenced the time journalist Chris Uhlmann tweeted a photo of gender-neutral toilets at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. She suggested that the \u201cprime minister, who cannot find time to develop a coherent economic or energy policy, springs immediately into action. The crowd on Twitter fire up on their issue of the day. The toilet signage is changed. And the caravan moves on.\u201d Well yes, but the caravan didn\u2019t move on for those who are transgender. For them, all they saw was a conservative journalist and the prime minister band together to pick on them for reasons of spite while notionally progressive politicians thought the best response was to mock it as being a trivial issue not worthy of fighting. Cripes, show some spine. By contrast Paul Keating in 2007 said of John Howard celebrating that he had overturned political correctness, that \u201cin other words what he thought was really good was to be politically incorrect, you know, to be able to sling off at someone\u2019s colour or their religion, you know.

It needs progressives. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "body": "<p>With their sharply curved grey beaks and talons, ear-splitting screech, snow-white feathers and crest flaring in a shock of yellow, sulphur-crested cockatoos are some of Australia\u2019s most distinctive native birds.</p> \n<p>They are also some of the nation\u2019s smartest and most destructive. They are known to open the lids of wheelie bins, flicking rubbish everywhere while rummaging for food. They are notorious for destroying wooden window frames, decking or house fittings.

When Guardian Australia arrived to investigate, it did not contain any cockatoos. But a likely suspect was certainly very well known among the locals.</p> \n<p>Seated in the morning sun outside one of Katoomba Street\u2019s many cafes, the sculptor and Katoomba resident Melanie Weine told Guardian Australia there was one cockatoo that had a habit of sitting on the bin next to a bench outside the French bread shop, waiting for unsuspecting tourists to come along with their lunch. Was this our bird?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe tourist will sit on that bench and start to feed the cockatoo a bit of his sandwich,\u201d Weine said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve seen the cockatoo eat that, and when the guy\u2019s not looking, take the whole sandwich and take off.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the sulphur-crested cockatoos had become increasingly numerous over the past five years. \u201cThey\u2019re very friendly with tourists,\u201d she said. \u201cThey perform all sorts of stunts around this place.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the newsagency not far away, the proprietor, Ray Cameron, immediately recognised the bird in question.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s one in particular that hangs around the coffee shop down here, the waffle shop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sits and people feed it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/19/birds-of-a-green-and-yellow-feather-flock-together-in-artistic-glory\">Birds of a green and yellow feather flock together in artistic glory</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the waffle shop, True to the Bean, the staff were frustrated. \u201cThey destroy everything. They eat chips from next door,\u201d the barista and self-described domestic goddess, Cheyenne Foong, said of the cockatoos.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get the broom out,\u201d said her colleague, the cafe owner Mel Jones. \u201cThey\u2019re very naughty.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones agreed that the cockatoos appeared to have increased in number. \u201cWe are a really big tourist area so the tourists pay a lot of attention to them, and will feed them bread and chips to take photos with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like me particularly because I do chase them with the broom.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia stood in front of Katoomba\u2019s various shopfronts holding some delicious baked goods, hoping to lure out this most-maligned bird, to no avail. It wasn\u2019t until we made our way up to the gardens of the posh hilltop hotel, the Carrington, with its beautifully managed botanical gardens, that we discovered there was more to the story than one bird\u2019s desire for salty carbs.</p> \n<p>The Carrington\u2019s gardener, Vicki Skeen, said the local cockatoo population were bullies. \u201cI had freesias planted around all the edges [of the garden beds], I\u2019ve been building them up for years,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis year, they methodically went through everything bar one box [and] they threw the tops all over the ground and ate the bulbs. You can\u2019t replant them. And then when the magnolias started coming on they chewed out the tops of those and bit off all the buds before they could open. Then the echium came \u2013&nbsp;they love that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Skeen was surprised by the apparent elusiveness of the usually very conspicuous cockatoos. \u201cI think probably the calendulas are coming on somewhere now, and I haven\u2019t seen them around today.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cTesting has shown that cockatoos are about as smart as a two-year-old human,\u201d said Dr John Martin, a terrestrial ecologist from Taronga Conservation Society. \u201cIn the animal world, it\u2019s actually one of the more intelligent.\u201d</p> \n<p>Martin said cockatoo behaviour wasn\u2019t innately naughty, because that would be to suggest the parrot had a kind of human moral compass.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are wild birds behaving naturally, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not in the bush,\u201d he said. \u201cDid it really appreciate that what it was doing was being perceived as a bad action?

      "bodyText": "With their sharply curved grey beaks and talons, ear-splitting screech, snow-white feathers and crest flaring in a shock of yellow, sulphur-crested cockatoos are some of Australia\u2019s most distinctive native birds. They are also some of the nation\u2019s smartest and most destructive. They are known to open the lids of wheelie bins, flicking rubbish everywhere while rummaging for food. They are notorious for destroying wooden window frames, decking or house fittings. They lop the tops off flowers, uproot seedlings, hollow out trees and generally make a big old mess. And they are loud. Since moving to Sydney a few years ago I have come to love this cheeky species, even befriending a local pair who have become regular, albeit occasionally raucous, visitors to my balcony birdbath. It was thanks to my familiarity with these wily locals that I was charged with the job of finding Australia\u2019s naughtiest bird as part of the Guardian/BirdLife Australia\u2019s bird of the year 2019 poll. The investigation began with a tip from a member of the public that the bird most deserving of the title was a particular sulphur-crested cockatoo, to be found somewhere in the town of Katoomba in the heart of New South Wales\u2019 Blue Mountains. Isaac Sherring-Tito, a longtime Katoomba resident, had captured footage in July of the avian fiend methodically pulling all the bird spikes off a council building and throwing them into the town\u2019s main street, leaving a long line of bird spikes littering the road. Like many witnesses to the cockatoo\u2019s antics, Sherring-Tito was on his way to partake of local culinary delicacies when he captured the incident on his smartphone. \u201cI was just on my lunch break, walking down the street to get something to eat,\u201d Sherring-Tito told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd I came back and they were ripping [the bird spikes] off.\u201d Katoomba\u2019s bustling high street contains an array of bakeries, eateries, antique shops and variety stores. When Guardian Australia arrived to investigate, it did not contain any cockatoos. But a likely suspect was certainly very well known among the locals. Seated in the morning sun outside one of Katoomba Street\u2019s many cafes, the sculptor and Katoomba resident Melanie Weine told Guardian Australia there was one cockatoo that had a habit of sitting on the bin next to a bench outside the French bread shop, waiting for unsuspecting tourists to come along with their lunch. Was this our bird? \u201cThe tourist will sit on that bench and start to feed the cockatoo a bit of his sandwich,\u201d Weine said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve seen the cockatoo eat that, and when the guy\u2019s not looking, take the whole sandwich and take off.\u201d She said the sulphur-crested cockatoos had become increasingly numerous over the past five years. \u201cThey\u2019re very friendly with tourists,\u201d she said. \u201cThey perform all sorts of stunts around this place.\u201d At the newsagency not far away, the proprietor, Ray Cameron, immediately recognised the bird in question. \u201cThere\u2019s one in particular that hangs around the coffee shop down here, the waffle shop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sits and people feed it.\u201d At the waffle shop, True to the Bean, the staff were frustrated. \u201cThey destroy everything. They eat chips from next door,\u201d the barista and self-described domestic goddess, Cheyenne Foong, said of the cockatoos. \u201cI get the broom out,\u201d said her colleague, the cafe owner Mel Jones. \u201cThey\u2019re very naughty.\u201d Jones agreed that the cockatoos appeared to have increased in number. \u201cWe are a really big tourist area so the tourists pay a lot of attention to them, and will feed them bread and chips to take photos with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like me particularly because I do chase them with the broom.\u201d Guardian Australia stood in front of Katoomba\u2019s various shopfronts holding some delicious baked goods, hoping to lure out this most-maligned bird, to no avail. It wasn\u2019t until we made our way up to the gardens of the posh hilltop hotel, the Carrington, with its beautifully managed botanical gardens, that we discovered there was more to the story than one bird\u2019s desire for salty carbs. The Carrington\u2019s gardener, Vicki Skeen, said the local cockatoo population were bullies. \u201cI had freesias planted around all the edges [of the garden beds], I\u2019ve been building them up for years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year, they methodically went through everything bar one box [and] they threw the tops all over the ground and ate the bulbs. You can\u2019t replant them. And then when the magnolias started coming on they chewed out the tops of those and bit off all the buds before they could open. Then the echium came \u2013 they love that.\u201d Skeen was surprised by the apparent elusiveness of the usually very conspicuous cockatoos. \u201cI think probably the calendulas are coming on somewhere now, and I haven\u2019t seen them around today.\u201d \u201cTesting has shown that cockatoos are about as smart as a two-year-old human,\u201d said Dr John Martin, a terrestrial ecologist from Taronga Conservation Society. \u201cIn the animal world, it\u2019s actually one of the more intelligent.\u201d Martin said cockatoo behaviour wasn\u2019t innately naughty, because that would be to suggest the parrot had a kind of human moral compass. \u201cThese are wild birds behaving naturally, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not in the bush,\u201d he said. \u201cDid it really appreciate that what it was doing was being perceived as a bad action? Was there malice underlying this behaviour? We don\u2019t really know. \u201cThe behaviour that we\u2019ve seen is an indication of them being exploratory and inquisitive, which is fundamental to adapt to urban landscapes. If they weren\u2019t tolerant of road and noise and buildings then they wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d He said anthropomorphising the birds \u2013 seeing their behaviour through a human lens \u2013 wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as it meant people were paying attention to them and trying to understand what they were doing. Indeed, everyone seemed to have a naughty cockatoo story. \u201cThere was a cockatoo, had a reputation in Mount Isa for unscrewing valve caps on cars and pushing his beak into the valve to get the air out to cool himself off,\u201d said a retired telephone technician, Perry Langdon, in Katoomba on holiday. A local artist, Sophie Miller, said: \u201cOutside the bakery I saw two cockatoos on two separate cars pulling the rubber lining out from in between the door and the roof of the car. Both of them, on separate cars.\u201d Guardian Australia was unable to conclusively confirm that Katoomba was home to Australia\u2019s naughtiest bird but strong feelings nevertheless prevailed. \u201cThey\u2019re the clowns of the bird world, really,\u201d Weine said. \u201cWe love them. They can do anything. Nothing will stop them.\u201d Said Jones: \u201cThey\u2019re like Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s birds. They are not after human flesh but they are after the human chip.\u201d \u2022 Vote now in Guardian Australia\u2019s bird of the year poll \u2022 Do you have a naughty cockatoo story?

      "body": "<p>Megan Holgate couldn\u2019t quite believe where she was.</p> <p>It was the height of the Aids crisis and she was in the waiting room of an inner-city STI clinic, frequented by those most at risk of HIV: gay men, injecting drug users, sex workers.</p> <p>Not, as she had been, a monogamous married businesswoman.</p> <p>She had felt \u201ctoo ashamed\u201d to ask her doctor for the HIV test. A positive result, back then, would have been a death sentence.</p> <p>In the clinic a friendly gay counsellor asked Megan to step into his room and asked her if everything was OK. No, she said. No, it absolutely was not.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I lost the plot,\u201d Megan, now 52, tells me as we sit in a gastrobar on a rainy Sydney evening. \u201cThis poor gay guy was the target for all my built-up anger.\u201d</p> <p>Megan threw her chair across the room at the petrified counsellor, first screaming, then crying, then sobbing, until \u2013 now outside Sydney\u2019s Albion Street clinic \u2013 she vomited on the street. People gave her a cautious, wide berth.</p> <p>Her worried dad was on his way to pick up his distraught daughter, now lying in the gutter, covered in her own tears and vomit.</p> <p>\u201cAt that moment, a homeless man I\u2019d stepped over on the way in reached out to gently check in on me,\u201d Megan says, crying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1e90effbc15c5995ec8d91c8a8efe2d4db28610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e90effbc15c5995ec8d91c8a8efe2d4db28610/85_64_927_1268/731.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Holgate and her late husband Steven pictured on their wedding day.\" width=\"731\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Megan Holgate and Steven on their wedding day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Holgate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She softened; it was the first tender moment she\u2019d experienced in a period of terrifying isolation. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten him,\u201d Megan says. As her dad pulled up she opened her purse, fat with notes, and pushed them all into the bewildered man\u2019s hands before being whisked home.</p> <p>Megan is one of a potentially dying breed of women: those who married closeted gay men. As countries such as Australia and Britain progress towards LGBTQI equality, it\u2019s a social phenomenon that could vaporise within a generation.</p> <p>When a married man comes out later in life, positive reactions can be heartening. Rainbow garlands are unfurled. People applaud his bravery. They empathise with his struggle. They marvel at how he came through it and celebrate that he can finally be himself. They express gratitude we live in more enlightened times.</p> <p>Often entirely missing from this narrative is the woman\u2019s voice.</p> <p>She has had to face her marriage breakdown and potential infidelity and wrestle with feelings that her relationship was a sham. Then there\u2019s the judgment of others who, sometimes openly, say surely she must have suspected \u2013 how naive can a person be? Occasionally she is blamed for being the person holding the man back from who he truly is or wants to be.</p> <p>Just one service in Australia specifically exists to help these women: the <a href=\"https://www.womenpartners.org.au/\">Women Partners of Bisexual Men service</a>, run by the Leichhardt Women\u2019s Centre in Sydney. It\u2019s believed to be one of the only government-funded services of its kind in the world.</p> <p>To mark its 25th anniversary, the service is releasing a new book, There\u2019s Something I Have To Tell You<em>, </em>featuring 20 stories from the women\u2019s perspective.</p> <p>One hundred women of all ages and backgrounds use the service, comprising group support and specialised individual counselling. </p> <p>One woman, Annabel, flies to Sydney from Melbourne fortnightly especially for the peer group sessions. \u201cA few times I was in foetal position bawling and had drank too much wine,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I was extremely grateful for the group.\u201d</p> <p>Roxanne McMurray has been running the support service for 19 years. Daily she hears \u201cheartbreaking stories\u201d like Megan\u2019s.</p> <p>She says<em> </em>women present with depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, high blood pressure, eating issues and fears their children will be bullied. \u201cSome women contact the service before their husband is even aware they know he\u2019s gay,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women found out because they were diagnosed with HIV or another STI. And yes, some women say the group saved their lives; they were suicidal when they contacted us.\u201d</p> <p>Megan says a service like this would have been a \u201clifesaver\u201d. She suffered a nervous breakdown after discovering her husband\u2019s secret. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have our daughter, Lucy, I can understand how you\u2019d be suicidal after that level of deception,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Steven, Megan\u2019s husband, had been a high-flying, jet-setting schmoozer who rose from a socially conservative family in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs to be a financial director on a seven-figure salary.</p> <p>He first met Megan, his second wife, when she was 22 and he was 26. After their first date, he sent four dozen roses to her work. \u201cIt was OTT but I was swept away,\u201d Megan says. \u201cI grew up with real Aussie blokes \u2013 this was something I\u2019d never experienced.\u201d</p> <p>After their wedding, when the couple were living in Hong Kong for work, Steven pushed her to have a baby, even though she wasn\u2019t entirely happy in the relationship. Never once did she suspect he was gay. \u201cWe had a pretty normal healthy sex life, it\u2019s not like it was once a year. If I had a dollar for everyone who asked: are you sure you didn\u2019t know?\u201d she says, sighing.</p> <p>Eight weeks after their daughter Lucy was born, the relationship nosedived. \u201cI thought he was having an affair, and created a big fight to get it out of him,\u201d she says. \u201cFinally he said, \u2018I\u2019m not attracted to you, I have some feelings towards men. I\u2019m not gay but really confused and I think I need you to move back to Australia so I can work myself out.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58d44482fcd0322575c543e6238369b4f96bac9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58d44482fcd0322575c543e6238369b4f96bac9e/30_53_1263_1827/691.jpg\" alt=\"The book released by the Leichhardt Women\u2019s Centre.\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The book released by the Leichhardt Women\u2019s Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leichhardt Women\u2019s Centre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through tears, Megan describes her world collapsing. \u201cI was a woman deranged,\u201d she says. \u201cI was devastated, yet somehow also relieved the problem wasn\u2019t me, as he\u2019d often made me feel.\u201d</p> <p>On the plane home, she took stock. \u201cIn 24 hours I lost my husband, marriage, home, friends, support group, career. And I had an eight-week-old baby.\u201d</p> <p>She later discovered her husband was on a flight the next day to the Caribbean with his male lover. \u201cHe was a pathological liar,\u201d Megan says. \u201cI was so angry \u2013 I could understand how a woman could kill her husband.\u201d </p> <p>A year later, Megan realised she needed to let go of the anger when she collapsed with internal bleeding caused by a stress-related ulcer. \u201cI decided to stop hating him,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Steven got a new boyfriend, who Megan adored. \u201cHe was a beautiful man, and wonderful to my daughter Lucy,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Both Steven and his partner died of Aids-related illnesses.</p> <p>Clearly distraught, Megan stops the interview as she describes watching the men become paraplegic, then die. \u201cSuch a waste. Me and my daughter are so sad,\u201d she says. Lucy, now 24, hid at school the fact her dad was gay. \u201cNow she\u2019d be the coolest kid in school,\u201d Megan says. \u201cThey\u2019d go shopping; they\u2019d have a ball.\u201d</p> <p>But she admits to hoping for a deathbed confession. \u201cI always dreamed I\u2019d finally get the truth. Why marry me? I don\u2019t believe in bisexuality, I think he was gay,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you love someone and you know you\u2019re gay, you don\u2019t marry them. That\u2019s wrong, to me.\u201d</p> <p>Megan\u2019s experience chimes with many of the moving stories in the new book, which aims to increase the reach of the Women Partners of Bisexual Men service \u2013 it will be sent to counsellors, family relationship services and lawyers across Australia.</p> <p>Common themes emerge from their 20 stories. More than once the phrase appears that \u201che stole my life\u201d. One woman, Beth, describes the discovery as \u201c17 years stolen from me\u201d.</p> <p>The physical impact of the sheer shock on these women is confronting. Lucy\u2019s hair fell out, she had tremors and experienced dramatic weight loss. \u201cEveryone was telling me how great I looked!\u201d she writes. \u201cI kept thinking: I\u2019m dying<em>. </em>The only man who\u2019d ever been attracted to me actually hadn\u2019t been, so all those horrible thoughts I\u2019d felt about myself were actually true.\u201d</p> <p>Some describe feeling like widows; the men they knew were apparitions. And many of the men, emboldened by the sense of freedom and fresh excitement afforded them by discovering the gay scene, completely transformed.</p> <p>Amal describes the impact it had on her children. \u201cMy sons\u2019 friends would come over and ask, is your dad gay? The way he walked, sat, smiled, dressed \u2013 all changed.\u201d Many times the women are left questioning: who is he; did I ever really know him?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/17/im-gay-married-and-not-leaving-my-church\">I\u2019m gay, married, and not leaving my church | Joel Hollier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those who were gaslighted describe relief that they weren\u2019t, after all, going mad for suspecting. Others, convinced the problem was their own inadequacy, describe similar complex relief. But that relief is often accompanied by anger.</p> <p>Several women, half-jokingly, discuss hiring hitmen. When Amal discovered her husband had been bringing his secret boyfriend of five years to the house \u2013 even to sit at family dinners under the guise of a friend \u2013 she \u201ccalled him a disgusting creature\u201d, she writes. \u201cThey\u2019re manipulative because they\u2019re ashamed of who they are, but the woman pays the price.\u201d</p> <p>The insensitivity of celebrating the man\u2019s coming out is something many women grapple with. \u201cI get angry because everyone\u2019s said to him how fantastic, aren\u2019t you courageous, what a hero,\u201d writes Beth. \u201cI wanted to beat the living shit out of him for what he did to our family. There were no repercussions for him. My anger was mind-blowing.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, Patricia took issue with the blokes who took her husband out for a beer so they didn\u2019t look homophobic. \u201cIf he\u2019d shot me, would they take him out for a beer?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d</p> <p>Other people\u2019s positive reactions to the coming out can cause unintended pain, such as in Lucy\u2019s case. Her husband\u2019s parents responded by saying he would always be their son. \u201cThat hit me hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI realised yes, he\u2019d always be their son. But I wouldn\u2019t be their daughter any more.\u201d</p> <p>Some reactions are more surprising. Service manager Roxanne says a post-disclosure honeymoon period can happen, and sex begins again because it brings back emotional intimacy. Such was the case for Madeleine. \u201cInterestingly, after it came out, we had a brief spurt of sex together. The first time it happened, I cried.

      "bodyText": "Megan Holgate couldn\u2019t quite believe where she was. It was the height of the Aids crisis and she was in the waiting room of an inner-city STI clinic, frequented by those most at risk of HIV: gay men, injecting drug users, sex workers. Not, as she had been, a monogamous married businesswoman. She had felt \u201ctoo ashamed\u201d to ask her doctor for the HIV test. A positive result, back then, would have been a death sentence. In the clinic a friendly gay counsellor asked Megan to step into his room and asked her if everything was OK. No, she said. No, it absolutely was not. \u201cThat\u2019s when I lost the plot,\u201d Megan, now 52, tells me as we sit in a gastrobar on a rainy Sydney evening. \u201cThis poor gay guy was the target for all my built-up anger.\u201d Megan threw her chair across the room at the petrified counsellor, first screaming, then crying, then sobbing, until \u2013 now outside Sydney\u2019s Albion Street clinic \u2013 she vomited on the street. People gave her a cautious, wide berth. Her worried dad was on his way to pick up his distraught daughter, now lying in the gutter, covered in her own tears and vomit. \u201cAt that moment, a homeless man I\u2019d stepped over on the way in reached out to gently check in on me,\u201d Megan says, crying. She softened; it was the first tender moment she\u2019d experienced in a period of terrifying isolation. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten him,\u201d Megan says. As her dad pulled up she opened her purse, fat with notes, and pushed them all into the bewildered man\u2019s hands before being whisked home. Megan is one of a potentially dying breed of women: those who married closeted gay men. As countries such as Australia and Britain progress towards LGBTQI equality, it\u2019s a social phenomenon that could vaporise within a generation. When a married man comes out later in life, positive reactions can be heartening. Rainbow garlands are unfurled. People applaud his bravery. They empathise with his struggle. They marvel at how he came through it and celebrate that he can finally be himself. They express gratitude we live in more enlightened times. Often entirely missing from this narrative is the woman\u2019s voice. She has had to face her marriage breakdown and potential infidelity and wrestle with feelings that her relationship was a sham. Then there\u2019s the judgment of others who, sometimes openly, say surely she must have suspected \u2013 how naive can a person be? Occasionally she is blamed for being the person holding the man back from who he truly is or wants to be. Just one service in Australia specifically exists to help these women: the Women Partners of Bisexual Men service, run by the Leichhardt Women\u2019s Centre in Sydney. It\u2019s believed to be one of the only government-funded services of its kind in the world. To mark its 25th anniversary, the service is releasing a new book, There\u2019s Something I Have To Tell You, featuring 20 stories from the women\u2019s perspective. One hundred women of all ages and backgrounds use the service, comprising group support and specialised individual counselling. One woman, Annabel, flies to Sydney from Melbourne fortnightly especially for the peer group sessions. \u201cA few times I was in foetal position bawling and had drank too much wine,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I was extremely grateful for the group.\u201d Roxanne McMurray has been running the support service for 19 years. Daily she hears \u201cheartbreaking stories\u201d like Megan\u2019s. She says women present with depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, high blood pressure, eating issues and fears their children will be bullied. \u201cSome women contact the service before their husband is even aware they know he\u2019s gay,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women found out because they were diagnosed with HIV or another STI. And yes, some women say the group saved their lives; they were suicidal when they contacted us.\u201d Megan says a service like this would have been a \u201clifesaver\u201d. She suffered a nervous breakdown after discovering her husband\u2019s secret. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have our daughter, Lucy, I can understand how you\u2019d be suicidal after that level of deception,\u201d she says. Steven, Megan\u2019s husband, had been a high-flying, jet-setting schmoozer who rose from a socially conservative family in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs to be a financial director on a seven-figure salary. He first met Megan, his second wife, when she was 22 and he was 26. After their first date, he sent four dozen roses to her work. \u201cIt was OTT but I was swept away,\u201d Megan says. \u201cI grew up with real Aussie blokes \u2013 this was something I\u2019d never experienced.\u201d After their wedding, when the couple were living in Hong Kong for work, Steven pushed her to have a baby, even though she wasn\u2019t entirely happy in the relationship. Never once did she suspect he was gay. \u201cWe had a pretty normal healthy sex life, it\u2019s not like it was once a year. If I had a dollar for everyone who asked: are you sure you didn\u2019t know?\u201d she says, sighing. Eight weeks after their daughter Lucy was born, the relationship nosedived. \u201cI thought he was having an affair, and created a big fight to get it out of him,\u201d she says. \u201cFinally he said, \u2018I\u2019m not attracted to you, I have some feelings towards men. I\u2019m not gay but really confused and I think I need you to move back to Australia so I can work myself out.\u2019\u201d Through tears, Megan describes her world collapsing. \u201cI was a woman deranged,\u201d she says. \u201cI was devastated, yet somehow also relieved the problem wasn\u2019t me, as he\u2019d often made me feel.\u201d On the plane home, she took stock. \u201cIn 24 hours I lost my husband, marriage, home, friends, support group, career. And I had an eight-week-old baby.\u201d She later discovered her husband was on a flight the next day to the Caribbean with his male lover. \u201cHe was a pathological liar,\u201d Megan says. \u201cI was so angry \u2013 I could understand how a woman could kill her husband.\u201d A year later, Megan realised she needed to let go of the anger when she collapsed with internal bleeding caused by a stress-related ulcer. \u201cI decided to stop hating him,\u201d she says. Steven got a new boyfriend, who Megan adored. \u201cHe was a beautiful man, and wonderful to my daughter Lucy,\u201d she says. Both Steven and his partner died of Aids-related illnesses. Clearly distraught, Megan stops the interview as she describes watching the men become paraplegic, then die. \u201cSuch a waste. Me and my daughter are so sad,\u201d she says. Lucy, now 24, hid at school the fact her dad was gay. \u201cNow she\u2019d be the coolest kid in school,\u201d Megan says. \u201cThey\u2019d go shopping; they\u2019d have a ball.\u201d But she admits to hoping for a deathbed confession. \u201cI always dreamed I\u2019d finally get the truth. Why marry me? I don\u2019t believe in bisexuality, I think he was gay,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you love someone and you know you\u2019re gay, you don\u2019t marry them. That\u2019s wrong, to me.\u201d Megan\u2019s experience chimes with many of the moving stories in the new book, which aims to increase the reach of the Women Partners of Bisexual Men service \u2013 it will be sent to counsellors, family relationship services and lawyers across Australia. Common themes emerge from their 20 stories. More than once the phrase appears that \u201che stole my life\u201d. One woman, Beth, describes the discovery as \u201c17 years stolen from me\u201d. The physical impact of the sheer shock on these women is confronting. Lucy\u2019s hair fell out, she had tremors and experienced dramatic weight loss. \u201cEveryone was telling me how great I looked!\u201d she writes. \u201cI kept thinking: I\u2019m dying. The only man who\u2019d ever been attracted to me actually hadn\u2019t been, so all those horrible thoughts I\u2019d felt about myself were actually true.\u201d Some describe feeling like widows; the men they knew were apparitions. And many of the men, emboldened by the sense of freedom and fresh excitement afforded them by discovering the gay scene, completely transformed. Amal describes the impact it had on her children. \u201cMy sons\u2019 friends would come over and ask, is your dad gay? The way he walked, sat, smiled, dressed \u2013 all changed.\u201d Many times the women are left questioning: who is he; did I ever really know him? Those who were gaslighted describe relief that they weren\u2019t, after all, going mad for suspecting. Others, convinced the problem was their own inadequacy, describe similar complex relief. But that relief is often accompanied by anger. Several women, half-jokingly, discuss hiring hitmen. When Amal discovered her husband had been bringing his secret boyfriend of five years to the house \u2013 even to sit at family dinners under the guise of a friend \u2013 she \u201ccalled him a disgusting creature\u201d, she writes. \u201cThey\u2019re manipulative because they\u2019re ashamed of who they are, but the woman pays the price.\u201d The insensitivity of celebrating the man\u2019s coming out is something many women grapple with. \u201cI get angry because everyone\u2019s said to him how fantastic, aren\u2019t you courageous, what a hero,\u201d writes Beth. \u201cI wanted to beat the living shit out of him for what he did to our family. There were no repercussions for him. My anger was mind-blowing.\u201d Similarly, Patricia took issue with the blokes who took her husband out for a beer so they didn\u2019t look homophobic. \u201cIf he\u2019d shot me, would they take him out for a beer?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d Other people\u2019s positive reactions to the coming out can cause unintended pain, such as in Lucy\u2019s case. Her husband\u2019s parents responded by saying he would always be their son. \u201cThat hit me hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI realised yes, he\u2019d always be their son. But I wouldn\u2019t be their daughter any more.\u201d Some reactions are more surprising. Service manager Roxanne says a post-disclosure honeymoon period can happen, and sex begins again because it brings back emotional intimacy. Such was the case for Madeleine. \u201cInterestingly, after it came out, we had a brief spurt of sex together. The first time it happened, I cried. It had been eight years.\u201d Just like many gay men do, their wives can go through denial periods, Roxanne says, believing they can work things out. For some like Val, they make a conscious or practical decision to stay; her husband was 72 when she found out. Pam, whose main concern upon discovering was protecting her husband from losing his friends, also concedes she\u2019ll probably stay with him. For her, it\u2019s all about sacrificing one thing to get something else \u2013 in this case, a continuing family for her children. \u201cI know my husband is gay, he can\u2019t stop himself from being with men, it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m realistic. We talk a lot.\u201d Elizabeth is reflective on how she ended up with her husband. \u201cThere\u2019s a stereotype that closeted men seek out a certain type of woman because we have qualities of acceptance, tolerance, understanding, empathy \u2013 but even if it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re gullible,\u201d she writes. She even picked him up from his first date with a man. Her anger wasn\u2019t at him, but at his family and culture for not letting him be who he should have been in the first place: \u201cIt was like he didn\u2019t know how to be gay.\u201d Roxanne remembers, as Australia\u2019s marriage equality postal vote was happening, clients contacting the service asking: have you done it yet, have you voted? I ask her if any were no voters, given their experiences. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were enthusiastic about creating a new world \u2013 so no other woman would go through what they did.\u201d Megan Holgate relates to that. She remembers being unable to go to Mardi Gras one year her colleagues invited her, as the sight of two men kissing was just too distressing. Today she cheers such affection: \u201cI think, go for it. You\u2019ve met someone you love; that\u2019s what makes the world go round.\u201d Roxanne challenges me when I put it to her that this could soon be a social phenomenon of the past. \u201cI think that\u2019s a long way off,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople still go to beats [public places where gay men meet discretely for sex]. People still have private parts of themselves which don\u2019t always coexist honestly with their public life.\u201d On that point, I recall the book\u2019s most poignant line. It comes from Lucy, who \u2013 in her acute distress \u2013 did the most intrusive thing a person can do to invade another\u2019s privacy: she found and read her husband\u2019s teenage diary. She knew it wasn\u2019t right, but was desperate for explanations. \u201cThe way he described the boys: \u2018he\u2019s very handsome\u2019, \u2018he\u2019s very muscular\u2019. He probably didn\u2019t know he was gay at the time,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt broke my heart to read the diary of a sweet young boy on the verge of making the wrong choice. \u201cAnd that choice was me.\u201d To contact The Women Partners of Bisexual Men Service, call 1800 787 887 or email info@womenpartners.org.au",

      "bodyText": "The appeal by Sydney newspaper the Daily Telegraph against the record $2.9m in damages it was ordered to pay Geoffrey Rush after a series of defamatory articles about the Oscar-winning actor will begin on Monday. Set down for two days, the appeal was brought by the Telegraph through its parent company, Nationwide News, after a judge ruled the paper had defamed Rush by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during a theatre production of King Lear in 2015. The Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid announced in May that it would appeal the verdict, citing 16 grounds on which it claims the trial was miscarried and that federal court justice Michael Wigney\u2019s conduct in the case \u201cgave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d. If the appeal fails, Rush is due to receive $2.9m in damages based on past and future lost earnings. It is the largest ever defamation payout to a single person in Australia after the Victorian court of appeal last year slashed the actor Rebel Wilson\u2019s damages payout from $4.5m to $600,000 over defamatory articles in Woman\u2019s Day magazine. Published under the headline \u201cKing Leer\u201d in November 2017, the Daily Telegraph reported the Sydney Theatre Company had received the anonymous complaint but provided no further details. Follow-up articles were published the next day, which Wigney said \u201cdoubled down\u201d on the story. Rush sued the newspaper and the journalist Jonathon Moran, claiming the articles conveyed the imputation that Rush was a \u201cpervert\u201d, a \u201csexual predator\u201d and \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d. Heard over two weeks in November last year, much of the trial centred on the evidence of Rush\u2019s co-star Eryn Jean Norvill, who made the initial complaint about the actor to the Sydney Theatre Company. Despite being at the centre of the Telegraph\u2019s articles, before the trial Norvill said she had never previously spoken publicly about Rush\u2019s alleged behaviour towards her. After she complained to the theatre company, Norvill said she did not want to take the issue further, and did not want Rush to be informed of her complaint. She was not named in the Telegraph\u2019s stories and did not cooperate in their publication. Over two days, Norvill told the court that Rush \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s best-known actors \u2013 engaged \u201cdaily\u201d in a pattern of \u201csexual harassment\u201d including \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and groping gestures that made her feel \u201cbelittled\u201d, \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d. The trial also included a rollcall of prominent members of Australia\u2019s film, television and theatre community giving testimony on behalf of Rush. The Oscar nominee Judy Davis and US agent Fred Specktor both took the stand to give evidence for the actor, while the director of the King Lear production, Neil Armfield, and two actors, Robyn Nevin and Helen Buday, told the court they did not witness any inappropriate behaviour from Rush during the production. In his judgment, Wigney found in favour of Rush and said the reports in the Daily Telegraph were \u201cin all the circumstances, a recklessly irresponsible piece of sensationalist journalism of the worst kind\u201d. The judge said that while he was \u201cacutely conscious of and had regard to the difficulties and disadvantages that are often encountered by complainants in cases involving allegations of sexual harassment\u201d, he ultimately rejected Norvill\u2019s evidence and instead accepted the version of Rush\u2019s witnesses. He said Norvill\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot only uncorroborated but contradicted by ... the evidence of Rush, [director Neil] Armfield, [and cast members Robyn] Nevin and [Helen] Buday.\u201d During the verdict, Norvill closed her eyes as the judge said she was a witness \u201cprone to exaggeration and embellishment\u201d. In the closing stages of the trial, lawyers for Nationwide News had attempted to introduce evidence from someone who became known as \u201cwitness x\u201d alleging separate acts of a \u201csexual nature\u201d against Rush. However, the evidence was refused, and it wasn\u2019t until May when a suppression order was lifted that it was revealed \u201cwitness x\u201d was the Hollywood actress Yael Stone, star of the Netflix series Orange is the New Black. In an interview with the New York Times in December, Stone alleged that, during a 2010 Belvoir St theatre production of The Diary of a Madman, Rush held a mirror above her while she showered, danced naked in front of her and touched her back in an \u201cunwanted\u201d and \u201cvery sensual manner\u201d. Rush denied the allegation, saying in a statement issued through his lawyers at the time that the allegations were \u201cincorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context\u201d. \u201cHowever, clearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work,\u201d he said. \u201cI sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress. This, most certainly, has never been my intention. \u201cWhen we performed in The Diary of a Madman eight years ago, I believe we engaged in a journey as artistic comrades. Over the years we have shared correspondence that always contained a mutual respect and admiration. \u201cAs I have said in the past, I abhor any behaviour that might be considered as harassment or intimidation to anyone \u2013 whether in the workplace or any other environment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Residents of a remote Indigenous community near Alice Springs are taking a legal fight about the right to \u201chumane\u201d housing to the supreme court, in a case that could prompt widespread housing reform in the Northern Territory. They are also arguing that rental agreements struck in the wake of the Northern Territory intervention are invalid and are seeking the return of rental payments. The case concerns two residents of the remote community of Santa Teresa, an Arrernte community about 80km south-east of Alice Springs. The plaintiffs, Enid Young and Robert Conway, were among a shortlist of four who represented more than 70 households in Santa Teresa in a successful class action against the department of housing in the Northern Territory civil and administrative tribunal (NTCAT) in February. The community had lodged more than 600 requests for urgent repairs in five years, complaining of leaking roofs, missing shower heads, unlockable doors and windows, and constant leaks. The tribunal found the community had the right to safe and habitable housing, as defined in the Residential Tenancies Act, and awarded a combined $14,000 in compensation on the finding that the houses were, for extended periods, so dangerous as to have rendered them \u201cuninhabitable\u201d. The community is now appealing that decision, arguing that rental agreements signed as far back as 2011 were void, that the conduct of the department in entering into those agreements was unconscionable, and that the condition of the houses, while not in all cases immediately hazardous to health, should be held to a higher standard. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dan Kelly, a solicitor with Australian Lawyers for Remote Aboriginal Rights, said the supreme court action would appeal that decision using a precedent set in Manchester during the second world war, which argues that tenants have the right to housing that is \u201chumane\u201d and not merely not hazardous. \u201cThe NTCAT took a narrow view of what habitability means \u2026 as relating to issues of safety or issues that might cause danger to health,\u201d Kelly told Guardian Australia. \u201cIn our appeal we\u2019re arguing that it should be interpreted on a wider basis, as providing a humane place to live where people can live with dignity and a reasonable level of comfort.\u201d Lou Dargan, head of strategic litigation at Grata Fund, a not-for-profit that is funding the legal challenge, says they are anticipating a \u201clandmark decision\u201d. \u201cThis is an opportunity to get real change to housing conditions in the territory,\u201d she says. Young, who is in her 70s, was without a backdoor for three months and without an air conditioner for 540 days, when summer temperatures regularly reach 40 degrees. That rendered her house uninhabitable, the tribunal found. She signed her rental agreement 18 months after the tenancy period began, and did so without translators, despite having little spoken and no written English. She told the tribunal she was visited by a \u201cwhitefella I had never seen before\u201d, who spoke to her in English, asked her to sign a piece of paper, and \u201cdidn\u2019t explain what I was signing\u201d. A poor repair to Conway\u2019s shower caused water to get in behind the tiles and flood the toilet, causing a slip hazard that lasted 109 days. Another community member, Jasmine Cavanagh, had to get up at midnight every night to mop her bathroom from an overflowing toilet, which mixed with the water from a leaking shower. Her house was deemed uninhabitable for 269 days. But lesser issues, like the failure to install a smoke alarm, were not considered to render houses uninhabitable and only afforded $100 in compensation.

The department says it is \u201ccommitted to ensuring its premises are safe, secure and habitable, as specified under the Residential Tenancies Act and other relevant legislation\u201d. The class action was filed in 2016, and a delay to the supreme court appeal, which was initially scheduled for this month, means residents could be waiting five years for a resolution. If the appeal is successful, Kelly says, it will have a wide impact on the standard of housing in remote communities in the NT. At the moment the \u201cvast majority\u201d of houses in both Santa Teresa and other similar communities do not meet the standard of providing a reasonable level of comfort. \u201cI think reasonable comfort is expected by tenants in any sort of major centre and the law doesn\u2019t differentiate between a major centre and a remote community,\u201d he says. Kelly says he is concerned that his clients, many of whom are elderly and unwell, may not live to see the case resolved. \u201cWe are anxious about trying to get the thing resolved quickly,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "At the office of Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker, the flood of companies rushing to declare that they have underpaid their workers has become a torrent \u2013 a torrent that she admits she might need more money to deal with. Speaking to Guardian Australia this week after supermarket giant Woolworths admitted to underpaying staff by as much as $300m over almost a decade, Parker says it felt like big companies were coming forward almost weekly to declare their wrongdoing. Just don\u2019t call it a crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t accept the word crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cI am pleased companies are coming forward and are willing to rectify this issue.\u201d Crisis or not \u2013 and unions definitely think it is \u2013 the Woolworths case highlights a culture in Australian corporate management of failing to pay workers what they\u2019re due. At the top end of town, companies that have confessed to tens of millions in underpayments include Wesfarmers, Qantas, Commonwealth Bank, Super Retail Group and Michael Hill Jewellers. And then there are the likes of franchisees at convenience store chain 7-Eleven, who underpaid workers $160m as part of what was allegedly an entrenched system of deliberate rorting; the Made Establishment empire fronted by celebrity chef George Calombaris, which underpaid restaurant workers $7.8m; and a string of employers across the economy who have underpaid vulnerable migrant workers. Even the ABC, which has broken news about wage theft, and labour law firm Maurice Blackburn, which campaigns against it, have confessed to underpayments. Whether it\u2019s through apparent negligence, as in the case of Woolworths, or through deliberate wage theft, as at 7-Eleven, it has become obvious that underpayment is endemic across the economy. Corporations are on notice The Woolworths debacle has also shone a harsh light on an excuse beloved of corporate Australia: that the country\u2019s industrial relations system is just too complicated for hapless executives to comply with. If Woolies is able to track thousands of products from warehouses to stores scattered across the nation in near real time, how can complexity be to blame? Just as a multi-billion-dollar compensation bill has shocked bankers into taking seriously the risk posed by ripping off their customers, the rest of corporate Australia is now on notice that they need to tackle their underpayment problem. If they don\u2019t, they will face a wave of emboldened activist investors and a fed-up regulator that is grappling with its own credibility problem, as well as running foul of new laws proposed by the Morrison government. \u201cThey should know better and they should do better,\u201d Parker says of Woolworths. \u201cWhen I say disappointing, it\u2019s because I\u2019m pretty confident that they did all the other stuff right \u2013 the ordering of their products, knowing what\u2019s going on in their network, keeping tabs on their widgets. \u201cIt\u2019s almost cavalier in the sense that you don\u2019t put the effort in to make sure your greatest asset is getting paid properly.\u201d She has had 22 self-disclosures since the start of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s suddenly become a large number,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s weekly. I think the corporate sector has woken up and they\u2019re madly checking their payrolls.\u201d She accepts corporate contentions that Australia\u2019s award system, which sets 122 minimum pay rates for various occupations and has been in place since 1904, can be complicated \u2013 something unions dismiss. \u201cWhat I find pretty hard to cope with is these are often their own enterprise agreements that they\u2019re getting wrong, which are carefully negotiated line by line. \u201cThey have been lax and lazy and just let somebody else do it.\u201d She says the corporate influx is pushing her office towards becoming a corporate regulator, a \u201cbig change\u201d that requires a new set of skills. Does this mean she\u2019ll be asking for more money? \u201cWe\u2019ve had good support from the minister but I think it\u2019s fair to say the extent and complexity of these sort of disclosures is greater than we could ever have envisaged, our workload has significantly increased and we\u2019ll be looking at that,\u201d she says. In the meantime, she dismisses the persistent criticism from the union movement that her office has been unwilling to prosecute \u2013 criticism that sounds very familiar to anyone who\u2019s followed the troubles experienced by the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Parker isn\u2019t ready to follow Asic\u2019s lead and move to a \u201cwhy not litigate\u201d approach to demonstrate some steel. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a really good job, we\u2019ve got $40m recovered for workers last financial year,\u201d she says. \u2018We need to change the system\u2019 The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, wants penalties for underpayment beefed up and unions given back the right to check pay records, which they lost under the Howard government. She scoffs at the line that industrial law is too hard. \u201cSome of the companies in the hospitality sector, for example, which have been involved in the massive instances of wage theft in recent months, have multiple locations in different states, manage the complex logistics involved in supplying fresh food to those businesses, manage rental arrangements, marketing promotions \u2026 we simply don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s beyond the capability of these businesses to pay their workers correctly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of what businesses can do, but what they think they need to do, and what they think they can get away with. \u201cUnfortunately under the current system many businesses make the calculation that ripping off workers and getting caught will still be cheaper than paying them correctly in the first place.

In an inadvertent demonstration of how much attitudes in corporate Australia need to change, industry body AI Group used a recent submission to a Western Australian inquiry into wage theft to complain that companies already \u201cdivert\u201d substantial resources into paying staff properly. \u201cWe could have worded that differently,\u201d Steve Smith, AI Group\u2019s head of industrial relations, says. \u201cBut the point we were making is that most businesses put a lot of resources into compliance.\u201d He is sticking to the line that it\u2019s all too complicated, even though his own body offers an advice service to help businesses figure out which of the 122 awards they are covered by. \u201cThere are hundreds if not thousands of issues that come up about how one award relates to another, how various penalties apply,\u201d he says. Calling in the auditors Former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Allan Fels, who headed an inquiry into the exploitation of migrant labour and ran a compensation scheme for ripped-off 7-Eleven workers until he was sacked by the company, isn\u2019t buying the complexity excuse. \u201cThere is this view that the award system is too complicated, but while that\u2019s true the cases I\u2019ve seen involved people deliberately underpaying people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a widespread culture of substantial underpayment of temporary migrant workers \u2013 that is, students and backpackers \u2013 and that culture has nothing to do with awards being complex.

The ACCR intends to expand its existing program of activism over exploitation in supply chains \u2013 such as fresh food, in the case of supermarkets \u2013 to cover directly employed staff. It has already asked to meet Woolworths over the underpayment debacle. And for the year ahead, she makes it clear that there is a spectre haunting corporate Australia \u2013 the spectre of wage underpayment. \u201cThere are significant gaps in corporate governance and it shows they haven\u2019t been looking at employee issues,\u201d she says. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s an area of massive corporate risk both in terms of reputation and the underpayments themselves.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In April this year, the health minister, Greg Hunt, introduced reforms the government said would make private health insurance easier to understand and more affordable. The changes, described by the federal government as the most significant reforms to the private health insurance system in a decade, included classifying the some 70,000 private health insurance policies available into gold, silver, bronze and basic categories, and discounts for young people. A review from the consumer advocacy group Choice published on Wednesday found the opposite. More than 215 \u201csilver\u201d and \u201csilver plus\u201d policies cost more than \u201cgold\u201d policies, the report found, leaving consumers as confused by their options as ever. An Australian Medical Association report published one day later warned private health policies remained unaffordable and non-transparent. The other cornerstone of the reforms \u2013 lower premiums for people under 30 \u2013 has failed to stop the exodus of young people from the system, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [Apra] data shows. The financial authority in May issued a directive to the private health industry to take responsibility for the decline in affordability and uptake of insurance rather than rely on government reforms. The situation has several health economists and policy experts questioning whether the private health insurance industry, far from being salvageable through reform, is worth saving at all. Apra executive board member Geoff Summerhayes said it was \u201cfrustrating to see little evidence that insurers are taking actions that reflect their own assessment of the heightened risks in this challenging environment\u201d. \u201cApra recognises the industry has been under duress for some time, and the main factors, such as rising demand for health services and the soaring cost of treatments, are beyond insurers\u2019 direct control,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not an excuse for doing nothing and hoping the government will fix everything.\u201d According to the Consumers Health Forum and the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association [AHHA] the only way forward is for the federal government to order an independent Productivity Commission review of the whole healthcare system, both public and private components. Unlike previous examinations of the private health insurance industry, this review should not be ordered from the starting point that the private health insurance must be saved, rather would question whether it should be. AHHA acting chief executive Dr Linc Thurecht said the review should also investigate the public policy objectives that are being served by government support or private health insurance through publicly-funded subsidies. \u201cWhile there is a cost associated with holding such a review, this must be seen in the context of the latest data we have showing that Australia spent $185bn a year on healthcare,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cAHHA would not say that the death of private health insurance is inevitable. But we need to hold all levels of government to account in reforming our healthcare system to better coordinate the delivery of healthcare, to take a longer-term view of individual\u2019s healthcare journey, to remove low value care, to stop some healthcare providers charging exorbitant fees, to remove inequities in access to healthcare and health outcomes, and to improve transparency on outcomes and costs that matter to people. \u201cPrivate health insurance is seen by virtually all as being too expensive, too complicated and opaque, and not offering value for money.\u201d Grattan Institute health economist Dr Stephen Duckett said the death of the private health industry was inevitable.

But it won\u2019t be the left squirming in moral horror when someone dares to show up on the BBC sans poppy between now and Armistice Day.

The rightwing commentator Douglas Murray, invited on to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme to discuss Obama\u2019s comments, described the quest for \u201cwrongthink\u201d as the purview of his ideological opponents. But it won\u2019t be the left squirming in moral horror when someone dares to show up on the BBC sans poppy between now and Armistice Day. (Bonus: Murray got to play the cancel culture victim when the host Nick Robinson challenged him on his past remarks.) So the right has its cancel culture and pretends to abhor it; the left, less hypocritically but more incoherently, digs in to defend the indefensible. Obama is, of course, correct. The pursuit of purity is not just a wound in civil society, it\u2019s also the opposite of politics. \u201cThat\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\u201d But he assumes here that people engage in politics in order to bring about change and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true. As political affiliation becomes more and more a matter of tribal identity, patrolling the borders of the in-group and singling out enemies takes on increasing importance. After all, it just feels good. \u2022 Sarah Ditum is a writer on politics and culture",

They think we are stupid.</p> <p>And yet their actions show that cynics who doubt everything trust Nigel Farage, even though he takes them for absolute idiots. It was an education to watch him make his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50261647\" title=\"\">offer of a Leave alliance</a> to Boris Johnson on Friday. Farage\u2019s warm-up acts played all the old tunes. Richard Tice, a property investor who has the well-cut suits and fading good looks of the type of charmer who cons widows out of their savings, said the Tories lived in the \u201cstinking rotten borough of Westminster\u201d.

The Tories were among the elitists, scoffing behind their manicured hands and calling Brexiters \u201cxenophobes, ignorant and far right\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ann-widdecombe\" title=\"\">Ann Widdecombe</a> came next. I won\u2019t pretend to understand all, or most, of what she said. But her drift was that the Tories were a pack of liars who would betray Brexit and all who believed in it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Compromise would betray the Brexit purists. But Farage and Johnson are already betraying them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Farage then strode to the stage like a televangelist to the pulpit. He posed as the last honest politician in England. Unless Johnson agreed to ditch his deal with the EU, he would run Brexit party candidates against the Conservatives in every seat. Liberals were ecstatic. As Johnson cannot agree to destroy his own settlement, Remainers were relieved. The pro-Remain campaign group Best for Britain estimates that an <a href=\"https://www.bestforbritain.org/\" title=\"\">unspoken agreement</a> between the Brexit and Conservative parties could deliver Johnson a comfortable majority. Now Agent Farage, the Remainer mole, was sabotaging the Tories\u2019 chances and with them the chances of Brexit.</p> <p>Yet for a supposedly iron man, Farage sounded remarkably flexible. He praised Johnson\u2019s energy and sympathised with his difficulties. He emphasised that he had until mid-November to decide where to run candidates and would almost certainly not run them against the Tory right. \u201cThis is a ferret searching for a hole to reverse down,\u201d I thought.</p> <p>The election campaign has achieved what many thought impossible and lowered the standards of public debate. Johnson does not have a \u201cdeal\u201d with the EU, merely a withdrawal agreement. Every circle of hell remains available for Britain if his Brexit passes, including a few the devil himself has yet to discover.</p> <p>Farage could spin a quiet rapprochement with Johnson a dozen different ways. We remain in the single market and customs union until December 2020. Johnson hopes to negotiate a trade agreement by then. But trade deals take years to complete. Farage and the Tory right could tell their followers we could crash out in December or in June, when we would have to ask for an extension to the transition period to <a href=\"https://infacts.org/johnsons-deal-means-crash-out-in-a-year-or-a-crap-fta/\" title=\"\">keep the negotiations going</a>.</p> <p>Farage could say he would stand down candidates to stop Corbyn. He could say that he had discovered a \u201cCanada-style trade deal\u201d is possible and rely on the fact that the majority of people do not know what a Canada deal is or why the EU would demand harsher terms from Britain than it demands of a country thousands of miles away.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>if there is any meaning in the word, 'populism' can be defined as the willingness of voters to be lied to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Compromise would betray Brexit purists. But Farage and Johnson are already betraying them. Both say they expect to win in south Wales, the north of England and Midlands, the very areas whose manufacturing industries would be hardest hit by pulling us out of the single market.</p> <p>Then there is the revealing game Farage has played with Brexit party members, which shows how little he thinks of them. He persuaded at least 3,000 to apply to become parliamentary candidates and charged them <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2019/07/19/weve-been-misled-brexit-party-mp-hopefuls-left-out-in-the-cold/\" title=\"\">\u00a3100 apiece for the privilege</a>. Yet when the candidates were announced, there were many of the same faces from Farage\u2019s Ukip days or Fox\u2019s Revolutionary Communist turned Reactionary Chauvinist party. Otto English of the <em>Byline Times</em>, who <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2019/08/06/brexit-party-mp-candidates-chums-and-comrades-the-intrigue-continues/\" title=\"\">covered the story,</a> received private emails from working-class hopefuls who said they were told to campaign in byelections to \u201cincrease your chances of being selected\u201d. When they got there, no one took their names. Straight afterwards, they received a \u201cyou have not been selected\u201d mass email.</p> <p>Individuals have walked away from Farage. But his core stayed loyal, as the core of populist movements always does. For if there is any meaning in the vapid word, \u201cpopulism\u201d can be defined as the willingness of voters to be lied to.

      "bodyText": "Brexit supporters expect \u201cthe elite\u201d, \u201cthe establishment\u201d, \u201cthe Westminster bubble\u201d to \u201crig the system\u201d to stop them \u201ctaking our country back\u201d. The enemy imposed metric measurements, drink-driving laws, immigrants and smoking bans and now it wants to stop Brexit. They take us for fools. They think we are stupid. And yet their actions show that cynics who doubt everything trust Nigel Farage, even though he takes them for absolute idiots. It was an education to watch him make his offer of a Leave alliance to Boris Johnson on Friday. Farage\u2019s warm-up acts played all the old tunes. Richard Tice, a property investor who has the well-cut suits and fading good looks of the type of charmer who cons widows out of their savings, said the Tories lived in the \u201cstinking rotten borough of Westminster\u201d. Claire Fox, who, satisfyingly, looks as malicious in the flesh as you would expect a member of the Revolutionary Communist party who ended up on the hard right via a spell denying the massacre of Bosnia\u2019s Muslims to look, followed up. The Tories were among the elitists, scoffing behind their manicured hands and calling Brexiters \u201cxenophobes, ignorant and far right\u201d. Ann Widdecombe came next. I won\u2019t pretend to understand all, or most, of what she said. But her drift was that the Tories were a pack of liars who would betray Brexit and all who believed in it. Farage then strode to the stage like a televangelist to the pulpit. He posed as the last honest politician in England. Unless Johnson agreed to ditch his deal with the EU, he would run Brexit party candidates against the Conservatives in every seat. Liberals were ecstatic. As Johnson cannot agree to destroy his own settlement, Remainers were relieved. The pro-Remain campaign group Best for Britain estimates that an unspoken agreement between the Brexit and Conservative parties could deliver Johnson a comfortable majority. Now Agent Farage, the Remainer mole, was sabotaging the Tories\u2019 chances and with them the chances of Brexit. Yet for a supposedly iron man, Farage sounded remarkably flexible. He praised Johnson\u2019s energy and sympathised with his difficulties. He emphasised that he had until mid-November to decide where to run candidates and would almost certainly not run them against the Tory right. \u201cThis is a ferret searching for a hole to reverse down,\u201d I thought. The election campaign has achieved what many thought impossible and lowered the standards of public debate. Johnson does not have a \u201cdeal\u201d with the EU, merely a withdrawal agreement. Every circle of hell remains available for Britain if his Brexit passes, including a few the devil himself has yet to discover. Farage could spin a quiet rapprochement with Johnson a dozen different ways. We remain in the single market and customs union until December 2020. Johnson hopes to negotiate a trade agreement by then. But trade deals take years to complete. Farage and the Tory right could tell their followers we could crash out in December or in June, when we would have to ask for an extension to the transition period to keep the negotiations going. Farage could say he would stand down candidates to stop Corbyn. He could say that he had discovered a \u201cCanada-style trade deal\u201d is possible and rely on the fact that the majority of people do not know what a Canada deal is or why the EU would demand harsher terms from Britain than it demands of a country thousands of miles away. Compromise would betray Brexit purists. But Farage and Johnson are already betraying them. Both say they expect to win in south Wales, the north of England and Midlands, the very areas whose manufacturing industries would be hardest hit by pulling us out of the single market. Then there is the revealing game Farage has played with Brexit party members, which shows how little he thinks of them. He persuaded at least 3,000 to apply to become parliamentary candidates and charged them \u00a3100 apiece for the privilege. Yet when the candidates were announced, there were many of the same faces from Farage\u2019s Ukip days or Fox\u2019s Revolutionary Communist turned Reactionary Chauvinist party. Otto English of the Byline Times, who covered the story, received private emails from working-class hopefuls who said they were told to campaign in byelections to \u201cincrease your chances of being selected\u201d. When they got there, no one took their names. Straight afterwards, they received a \u201cyou have not been selected\u201d mass email. Individuals have walked away from Farage. But his core stayed loyal, as the core of populist movements always does. For if there is any meaning in the vapid word, \u201cpopulism\u201d can be defined as the willingness of voters to be lied to. The louder they scream \u201call politicians are liars\u201d, the harder they fall for the big lie from their chosen demagogue. Political scientists define devoted supporters of Farage, Trump and Corbyn as \u201clow-trust\u201d voters, who believe nothing they hear on the news. And yet they turn as trusting as children when their great leaders lead them on. In the case of Brexit, they are easy to lead and to fool. The divide in Brexit Britain is not based on class but on age and education: 70% of voters whose educational attainment was only GCSE or lower and 64% of over-65s voted to leave. I am not saying that having a degree ensures you are wise or even clever or that every pensioner is suffering from mental decline. But there are good reasons why pyramid sellers and faith healers prey on the uneducated and conmen target widows.

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has urged supporters to \u201cget on with the job\u201d of securing a new independence referendum, as the Conservative and Labour parties harden their stance on granting Holyrood the powers to hold second vote, before a Scottish election campaign that promises to be dominated once again by the constitution. At a rally in Glasgow on Saturday afternoon, the first minister and Scottish National party leader described the forthcoming general election as \u201cthe most important one Scotland has faced in our life times\u201d. She told thousands of cheering independence supporters to \u201cmake sure we persuade everyone we know to get out on 12 December and send the biggest, loudest, most resounding message to Westminster that it\u2019s time for Scotland to choose its own future\u201d. Sturgeon intends to make holding a second independence referendum in 2020 central to her party\u2019s campaign, and confirmed on Friday that she would demand the Westminster government transfer the powers to do so, regardless of the election result, by the end of the year. But while she insisted that electoral success would create an \u201cirresistible demand\u201d for another vote, the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said in an interview with the Herald on Saturday that even if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats they would \u201cabsolutely not have a mandate\u201d, while Jeremy Corbyn on Friday dismissed a second referendum as \u201cneither desirable or necessary\u201d. The SNP leader told the rally in Glasgow\u2019s George Square, organised by Scotland\u2019s only independence-supporting daily newspaper, the National: \u201cWe are gathered here for one simple purpose, to demand the right to choose a better future for our country.\u201d She promised that, if Scots voted in December \u201cto escape the chaos, division and misery of Brexit\u201d, then she would lead the country to an independence referendum next year. The pedestrian square, described by Glasgow city council leader Susan Aitken earlier in the rally as \u201cthe spiritual home of our great yes movement\u201d, was a sea of saltires on Saturday. The SNP logo was present but by no means pervasive, as most rally-goers waved the colourful Yes flags of the wider pro-independence movement. Sturgeon had not addressed a gathering of the broader yes movement since 2014 and has been criticised by some activists for not supporting a series of well-attended marches held across Scotland over the summer. The crowd, which organisers estimated reached 20,000 at its busiest, heard from speakers across the pro-independence movement, including members of Women for Independence and the Scottish Independence Convention, and Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who made an appeal for a \u201cbroad and inclusive\u201d campaign. A noisy counter-demonstration, cordoned by police on the opposite side of the square from the main rally stage, attempted to drown out speakers by blowing whistles and singing Rule Britannia. Sitting on a bench in the middle of the square, wrapped in a saltire flag, 75-year-old Edna Matteson said that she believed support for independence and the fairness it could bring was growing across the country. \u201cPeople have had enough. Children should not be living in poverty in this day and age. I was born at the end of world war two when we didn\u2019t have one food bank, let alone thousands.\u201d Matteson, a former Labour voter who travelled from Greenock to attend Saturday\u2019s rally, said she was aware that some \u201cblamed\u201d the older generation for voting no in 2014. \u201cPeople assume we\u2019re afraid of losing our pensions, but those were the fear tactics used in 2014. I want independence for the children who are growing up now.\u201d Amy Watt, a business management student from north Glasgow, said it was important to show the strength of support for independence. \u201cThe yes movement never went away, but we accepted the result in 2014. Now too much has changed. Look how diverse it is: young, old, all different colours and backgrounds.\u201d Watt added: \u201cI\u2019m happy that Nicola Sturgeon has kept away until now because this was never about the SNP or one political party, but now the SNP can be the vehicle to independence.\u201d Pointing to her teenage brother and his friends who had accompanied her to the event, she explained: \u201cEveryone is politically engaged now because of Brexit.\u201d",

We felt we needed that win for our own confidence and impetus into our season.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r felt the international break reinvigorated his squad but, after going behind here, his side surrendered all tempo and they struggled to hurt the hosts until the substitute Mason Greenwood rattled a post eight minutes from time. A crude challenge on Marcus Rashford aside, the Bournemouth captain Cook \u2013 the first player to make 150 Premier League appearances for the club \u2013 further enhanced his reputation, shepherding the backline brilliantly as a stirred United tried to up the ante. Scott McTominay, in front of the watching Scotland assistant coach, Steven Reid, forced Ramsdale to parry but Bournemouth held on to leapfrog United. \u201cCould\u2019ve, should\u2019ve \u2013 that\u2019s football,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThe front four looked promising but flattered to deceive. It looked like we could create chances but didn\u2019t have the last pass, or the last finish. That\u2019s something we need to improve on.\u201d",

Premier League: Paul MacInnes was at the London Stadium, where Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez and Jonjo Shelvey got the goals that won the points for Newcastle. Premier League: Louise Taylor went to Bramall Lane to see a side that ranks \u201camong the division\u2019s most interesting and entertaining teams\u201d pulverise their visitors. Premier League: Paul Doyle was at Villa Park to see what could come to be seen as a season-defining smash-and-grab from Liverpool, who left it very late to take all three points. Premier League: Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad Stadium to see Manchester City come from behind and record their second win in a week over Southampton. Premier League: \u201cGranit Xhaka spent the afternoon away from the Emirates but Arsenal proceeded to show that their problems extend far beyond one man,\u201d writes Nick Ames at the Emirates. Premier League: Ben Fisher was at the Vitality Stadium, where Bournemouth scored the only goal of a diabolically bad game to take the points and send Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men home empty-handed.

All you need to know about the Premier League table, where Liverpool lead Manchester City by six points, although the top of top tier looked likely to take on a very different complexion with just three minutes of their match against Aston Villa to go.

Sadio Mane scores with a flick-on from a late, late, late 94th minute corner to snatch all three points for Liverpool. The players of Aston Villa and Manchester City will be devastated. Championship: Sheffield Wednesday and Blackburn trade goals at Ewood Park, where it\u2019s 1-1. At the Cardiff City Stadium, the hosts have conceded a second goal scored by Birmingham\u2019s Ivan Sunjic and now only lead 3-2. But what\u2019s this? Joe Ralls responds with his second of the day to make it 4-2. At Elland Road, Leeds have doubled their lead over QPR, with Jack Harrison doing the honours. It\u2019s 2-0 to Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s men. Premier League: The goals are raining in late doors and Robert Snodgrass scores his second in two games to keep West Ham in with a shout of rescuing a most unlikely point. Premier League: Andy Robertson scores his third goal for Liverpool and it\u2019s a timely one. They\u2019re level at Villa Park. Premier League: Shane Duffy prods home from a free-kick to double Brighton\u2019s lead. There\u2019s a VAR consultation to see if he was offside, but the goal stands. Premier League: Alex McCarthy misses a cross from the right and Kyle Walker is on hand to capitalise. In very bad news indeed for Liverpool as well as Southampton, the champions lead.

Championship: At the Madejski Stadium, Jordan Obita has given Reading a ninth-minute lead over Millwall with a low drive into the corner.

Not long now: Teams are click-clacking their way down tunnels all over the country with just a couple of minutes to go before today\u2019s three o\u2019clocker get under way. Ben Fisher drew what turned out to be a very short straw indeed and trekked off to a wet and windy Vitality Stadium to watch Bournemouth beat Manchester United in a terrible game of football. Here\u2019s how he saw the action unfold ... Full time: Wigan Athletic 1-2 Swansea City Championship: Sam Surridge struck late in the game to win the game for Swansea City by the odd goal of three. The Swans have gone top of the Championship, a point clear of West Brom \u2013 who don\u2019t play until Monday \u2013 having played one game more. Premier League: On a wet and windy day at the Vitality Stadium, Josh King provided the one moment of quality in a match that won\u2019t live long in the memory to take the points for Bournemouth on the stroke of half-time.

After his impressive performance for Arsenal in their midweek Carabao defeat at the hands of Liverpool, Mesut Ozil starts for Arsenal. Granit Xhaka, you will be unsurprised to hear, does not. There\u2019s no place for the club captain in Unai Emery\u2019s match-day squad. League Two At the top of the table, Crewe entertain Port Vale, who are eight points and 10 places behind them. In second place, Exeter City travel to Bradford City, who will overtake their visitors in the event of victory. League One A couple of days after Sunderland chief executive Charlie Methven confirmed there has been a significant but unspecified investment of funds into the club by the American consortium FPP Sunderland Group, Phil Parkinson\u2019s side play struggling Southend at the Stadium of Light. A relatively new recruit like his opposite number, Sol Campbell will be in the adjacent technical penalty area. Having originally been slated to play Bury, who have been expelled from the league, leaders Ipswich Town have the weekend off. Behind them on goal difference, Wycombe will go top with a win or draw over Shrewsbury Town. A win for Peterborough at Blackpool will also send them a point clear of Ipswich. Championship Barnsley and Bristol City played out a 2-2 draw at Oakwell last night, while the DW Stadium is the venue for today\u2019s early game. Wigan Athletic are currently hosting Swansea City and its all square at the interval, with both sides having scored a goal apiece. Premier League The weekend\u2019s Premier League action kicked off at the Vitality Stadium, where Bournemouth are entertaining Manchester United in today\u2019s lunchtime kick-off. It\u2019s been hammering down with rain on the south coast and the standard of football fare on offer has been almost comically bad. Bournemouth have taken the lead, however, with Josh King putting them a goal up with his third goal of the season just moments before the half-time whistle. The second half has just got under way. Welcome to Saturday Clockwatch, your one-stop shop for all the news from today\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs. We\u2019ll bring you team news, build-up and news of all the major talking points from six Premier League games, flagging up goals as they go in (and are subsequently disallowed by VAR) around the grounds.

It is our job to try and attack them.</p> <p>\u201cI knew it in the Carabao Cup. Our big problem in the last two games is one team who suffer with their own pride and they are not going to accept under any circumstances what happened against Leicester again. After the goal we conceded it is more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>City began the afternoon imperiously. Raheem Sterling\u2019s instant control was followed by him moving inside. Ag\u00fcero let fly a header. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan sought to play David Silva in with chipped balls along the left. Kevin De Bruyne smacked a shot at Jack Stephens.</p> <p>The next time one was fired the visitors scored, though, from a simple move. Nathan Redmond fed Stuart Armstrong, who took aim from 20 yards. Ederson fumbled \u2013 a rare error from him \u2013 and Ward\u2011Prowse finished.</p> <p>Guardiola saw what he would wish in response: City continuing to probe along the channels and across the Southampton \u2018D\u2019. The two Silvas \u2013 David and Bernardo \u2013 had efforts repelled by a Saints body. Here was a relentless blue wave that would surely engulf Southampton.</p> <p>But no. Soon Guardiola was berating Angeli\u00f1o for holding too deep a position and G\u00fcndogan for hesitating in possession. City ended the half facing a wall of black\u2011and\u2011yellow shirts that proved impossible to breach. Guardiola walked off at the interval maybe debating a change for the second half.</p> <p>When it commenced he had \u2013 Gabriel Jesus on for the injured David Silva. The issue remained the same, though: could City turn all the ball they enjoyed into an equaliser? Jesus operated alongside Ag\u00fcero in what was a front four, Bernardo Silva and Sterling completing the quartet.</p> <p>City\u2019s effort was admirable, their devilry lacking. When Guardiola raced to retrieve the ball for a Southampton throw-in an hour had not yet gone, so his franticness seemed premature. The manager\u2019s mood was reflected in him kicking a bottle of water and darkened further when a Silva cross landed sweetly on Ag\u00fcero\u2019s head only for the striker to miss.</p> <p>The City No 10 did not do so on 70 minutes. Walker pulled the ball back and Ag\u00fcero\u2019s volley beat Alex McCarthy through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs. Now came City\u2019s grandstand finish, culminating in Walker\u2019s goal from seven or eight yards after McCarthy had mishandled an Angeli\u00f1o cross. The scorer showed composure considering the stage of the match and what was at stake \u2013 and the result might have been even better for City if not for Liverpool\u2019s later show in coming from behind to win at Aston Villa. \u201cWhen we win, Liverpool still win,\u201d Guardiola said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they win many games in the last minute, it is because of special character. The first season we won the treble, we won four or five games in the last minute.\u201d</p> <p>He had ended the game infuriated at the officiating, causing Hasenh\u00fcttl to offer a telling observation. \u201cWe have seen him be a little bit nicer than today,\u201d said the Austrian. \u201cThe reason \u2013 because he was a little bit nervous because he could lose this game.\u201d</p>",

After the goal we conceded it is more difficult.\u201d City began the afternoon imperiously. Raheem Sterling\u2019s instant control was followed by him moving inside. Ag\u00fcero let fly a header. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan sought to play David Silva in with chipped balls along the left. Kevin De Bruyne smacked a shot at Jack Stephens. The next time one was fired the visitors scored, though, from a simple move. Nathan Redmond fed Stuart Armstrong, who took aim from 20 yards. Ederson fumbled \u2013 a rare error from him \u2013 and Ward\u2011Prowse finished. Guardiola saw what he would wish in response: City continuing to probe along the channels and across the Southampton \u2018D\u2019. The two Silvas \u2013 David and Bernardo \u2013 had efforts repelled by a Saints body. Here was a relentless blue wave that would surely engulf Southampton. But no. Soon Guardiola was berating Angeli\u00f1o for holding too deep a position and G\u00fcndogan for hesitating in possession. City ended the half facing a wall of black\u2011and\u2011yellow shirts that proved impossible to breach. Guardiola walked off at the interval maybe debating a change for the second half. When it commenced he had \u2013 Gabriel Jesus on for the injured David Silva. The issue remained the same, though: could City turn all the ball they enjoyed into an equaliser? Jesus operated alongside Ag\u00fcero in what was a front four, Bernardo Silva and Sterling completing the quartet. City\u2019s effort was admirable, their devilry lacking. When Guardiola raced to retrieve the ball for a Southampton throw-in an hour had not yet gone, so his franticness seemed premature. The manager\u2019s mood was reflected in him kicking a bottle of water and darkened further when a Silva cross landed sweetly on Ag\u00fcero\u2019s head only for the striker to miss. The City No 10 did not do so on 70 minutes. Walker pulled the ball back and Ag\u00fcero\u2019s volley beat Alex McCarthy through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs. Now came City\u2019s grandstand finish, culminating in Walker\u2019s goal from seven or eight yards after McCarthy had mishandled an Angeli\u00f1o cross. The scorer showed composure considering the stage of the match and what was at stake \u2013 and the result might have been even better for City if not for Liverpool\u2019s later show in coming from behind to win at Aston Villa. \u201cWhen we win, Liverpool still win,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWhen they win many games in the last minute, it is because of special character. The first season we won the treble, we won four or five games in the last minute.\u201d He had ended the game infuriated at the officiating, causing Hasenh\u00fcttl to offer a telling observation. \u201cWe have seen him be a little bit nicer than today,\u201d said the Austrian. \u201cThe reason \u2013 because he was a little bit nervous because he could lose this game.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Is it possible to be cautiously optimistic that the not-so-golden TV era of bear-baiting people in the name of entertainment is finally passing?</p> <p>The digital, culture, media and sport committee viewed leaked backstage footage of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50254900\" title=\"\"><em>The Jeremy Kyle Show</em></a><em> </em>as part of an inquiry into reality TV, going on to condemn the programme\u2019s \u201cbullying methodology\u201d and \u201ccomplete abdication of the duty of care\u201d. The committee was set up after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/07/jeremy-kyle-show-guest-said-i-wish-i-was-dead-coroner-told\" title=\"\">Steve Dymond</a> (who killed himself after appearing on the Kyle show to take a lie detector test), and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/05/love-island-star-mike-thalassitis-death-was-suicide-coroner-rules\" title=\"\">suicides of two <em>Love Island</em> contestants</a>. However, while television networks have long been guilty of putting \u201cgood television\u201d before participant welfare, this is also about us, the viewers, and the wider culture of dehumanisation that made exposing and goading often uneducated, generally skint people feel like acceptable telly.</p> <p>This went far beyond <em>The Jeremy Kyle Show</em>. Over the years, even as the numbers of working-class actors have dwindled for lack of funds and opportunity, there seemed to be little about real working-class culture that couldn\u2019t be plundered for television, with shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/12/channel-4-benefits-street-viewers\" title=\"\"><em>Benefits Street</em> </a>confirming sneering prejudices. While Kyle\u2019s type of show called those being exploited \u201cguests\u201d, other reality genres started refashioning people as \u201ccast members\u201d.</p> <p>This culture of treating human beings as free or cheap, small-screen livestock hit its nadir with shows such as <em>Love </em><em>Island</em> (watch them at it!), which was supposed to be fine, because \u2013 yay! \u2013 sunshine and bikinis were involved and contestants made money at the end.</p> <p>Other reality shows have been coarser, verging on pornographic, yet were still clearly considered appropriate to commission, film, broadcast and watch. All of which exposes a fundamental disconnect at the heart of collective morality. On the one hand, the recent use of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/31/katie-hill-double-standard-congress-final-speech\" title=\"\"> nude images of US congresswoman Katie Hill</a> to shame her was rightly universally condemned. Yet, in Britain, it\u2019s become routine to film young, working-class people fighting, vomiting and copulating, with debasing footage that could haunt them forever.</p> <p>There\u2019s still no shortage of such shows, particularly when you deep-dive into the satellite television channels. However, things do appear to be changing and for the better. While <em>Love Island</em> used to be a high-profile part of the problem, now it\u2019s evolved into something closer to a solution. Operating under the new guidelines, the most recent series was vastly improved, with a drastic reduction in exploitative sexual content.</p> <p>Elsewhere, while there\u2019s still a cynical fascination with people on benefits (that grisly low-budget addiction to poverty porn that never quite goes away), there at least appear to be genuine attempts to enlighten people, rather than relentlessly pushing the scrounger angle. Moreover, not only was <em>The Jeremy Kyle Show</em> axed after Dymond\u2019s death, ITV made it clear it would not be commissioning similar programmes. Am I imagining it or is the treatment of people, especially working-class people, on television becoming marginally fairer and kinder? It\u2019s just a tragedy that people had to die before we got there.</p> <h2>Has it come to this, that women must \u2018disappear\u2019?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2751640f1a605a7dfb8d457a8f300088a77b8df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2751640f1a605a7dfb8d457a8f300088a77b8df/0_27_2960_1775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift: champion of body neutrality.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sick of your body being objectified \u2013 how about getting rid of it?

I wonder if people like Hugh Grant think they are part of the elite and they look down on working-class people no matter what station they reach in life.\u201d<br>Hmm. I\u2019m always up for a bit of class war, I\u2019m also increasingly concerned about the loss of press freedoms, but Javid\u2019s account is disingenuous at leastbest. Grant wasn\u2019t referring to celebrity friends, rather, ordinary people whose personal tragedies were exploited and who\u2019d met Javid, only to be treated in a way that was \u201cborderline contemptuous\u201d.</p> <p>So Grant\u2019s snubbing was inspired by Javid\u2019s prior elitist behaviour. An elitist, furthermore, who went on to fret about \u2013 what exactly? The death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/09/sajid-javid-denounced-shamima-begums-baby-dies-syria\" title=\"\">Shamima Begum\u2019s baby</a> in a Syrian refugee camp after Javid, posing as a hard-man home secretary, refused to allow the child to return to receive hospital care in Britain?

Perhaps Javidhe needs to get his priorities straight. Moreover, I cringed at the telling term \u201cstation in life\u201d, implying that, in Javid\u2019s view, it would have been understandable had Grant refused to shake the hand of a dustman.

      "bodyText": "Is it possible to be cautiously optimistic that the not-so-golden TV era of bear-baiting people in the name of entertainment is finally passing? The digital, culture, media and sport committee viewed leaked backstage footage of The Jeremy Kyle Show as part of an inquiry into reality TV, going on to condemn the programme\u2019s \u201cbullying methodology\u201d and \u201ccomplete abdication of the duty of care\u201d. The committee was set up after the death of Steve Dymond (who killed himself after appearing on the Kyle show to take a lie detector test), and the suicides of two Love Island contestants. However, while television networks have long been guilty of putting \u201cgood television\u201d before participant welfare, this is also about us, the viewers, and the wider culture of dehumanisation that made exposing and goading often uneducated, generally skint people feel like acceptable telly. This went far beyond The Jeremy Kyle Show. Over the years, even as the numbers of working-class actors have dwindled for lack of funds and opportunity, there seemed to be little about real working-class culture that couldn\u2019t be plundered for television, with shows such as Benefits Street confirming sneering prejudices. While Kyle\u2019s type of show called those being exploited \u201cguests\u201d, other reality genres started refashioning people as \u201ccast members\u201d. This culture of treating human beings as free or cheap, small-screen livestock hit its nadir with shows such as Love Island (watch them at it!), which was supposed to be fine, because \u2013 yay! \u2013 sunshine and bikinis were involved and contestants made money at the end. Other reality shows have been coarser, verging on pornographic, yet were still clearly considered appropriate to commission, film, broadcast and watch. All of which exposes a fundamental disconnect at the heart of collective morality. On the one hand, the recent use of nude images of US congresswoman Katie Hill to shame her was rightly universally condemned. Yet, in Britain, it\u2019s become routine to film young, working-class people fighting, vomiting and copulating, with debasing footage that could haunt them forever. There\u2019s still no shortage of such shows, particularly when you deep-dive into the satellite television channels. However, things do appear to be changing and for the better. While Love Island used to be a high-profile part of the problem, now it\u2019s evolved into something closer to a solution. Operating under the new guidelines, the most recent series was vastly improved, with a drastic reduction in exploitative sexual content. Elsewhere, while there\u2019s still a cynical fascination with people on benefits (that grisly low-budget addiction to poverty porn that never quite goes away), there at least appear to be genuine attempts to enlighten people, rather than relentlessly pushing the scrounger angle. Moreover, not only was The Jeremy Kyle Show axed after Dymond\u2019s death, ITV made it clear it would not be commissioning similar programmes. Am I imagining it or is the treatment of people, especially working-class people, on television becoming marginally fairer and kinder? It\u2019s just a tragedy that people had to die before we got there. Has it come to this, that women must \u2018disappear\u2019? Sick of your body being objectified \u2013 how about getting rid of it? Apparently, there\u2019s a switch from \u201cbody positivity\u201d (celebrating bodies in all their shapes and sizes) to \u201cbody neutrality\u201d, where you completely ignore your body, render it an intellectual-cum-emotional non-issue, and hope others do too. Recently popularised by everyone from Taylor Swift to Jameela Jamil, body neutrality means that you don\u2019t have to worry about being criticised or sexualised \u2013 you can just be. That sounds emancipating, not least after a week when a Michelin chef in Leeds was criticised for requesting that waiting staff applicants send in photographs with their CVs (was he concerned their faces would shatter the crockery?). However, is there also a sense of feminist endgame to this? A generation of women so traumatised by unwanted attention that they\u2019re actually driven to fantasising about not having bodies \u2013 physical presences \u2013 at all? Could this tie in a little too closely with that size zero nonsense of yesteryear, or even with food disorders where sufferers often say that they want to \u201cdisappear\u201d? In terms of freedom from judgment, body neutrality sounds intriguing, but why should women have to go to the extremes of vanishing their bodies in order to feel free and be taken seriously? Hugh Grant was quite right to snub Sajid Javid Why has Hugh Grant been slated as an elitist when it was Sajid Javid who behaved like one? The chancellor of the exchequer has spoken about how Grant refused to shake his hand at The Irishman film premiere: \u201c[Grant] said, \u2018When you were culture secretary, you didn\u2019t support my friends in [anti-media intrusion campaign] Hacked Off\u2019.\u201d Javid added: \u201c I think that is incredibly rude. I wonder if people like Hugh Grant think they are part of the elite and they look down on working-class people no matter what station they reach in life.\u201d Hmm. I\u2019m always up for a bit of class war, I\u2019m also increasingly concerned about the loss of press freedoms, but Javid\u2019s account is disingenuous at leastbest. Grant wasn\u2019t referring to celebrity friends, rather, ordinary people whose personal tragedies were exploited and who\u2019d met Javid, only to be treated in a way that was \u201cborderline contemptuous\u201d. So Grant\u2019s snubbing was inspired by Javid\u2019s prior elitist behaviour. An elitist, furthermore, who went on to fret about \u2013 what exactly? The death of Shamima Begum\u2019s baby in a Syrian refugee camp after Javid, posing as a hard-man home secretary, refused to allow the child to return to receive hospital care in Britain? Or, more recently, as chancellor, his refusal to carry out a thorough assessment of the economic dangers of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, claiming it was \u201cself-evidently in our nation\u2019s economic interest\u201d? No, Javid is peeved that a celebrity refused to shake his hand at a film premiere. Perhaps Javidhe needs to get his priorities straight. Moreover, I cringed at the telling term \u201cstation in life\u201d, implying that, in Javid\u2019s view, it would have been understandable had Grant refused to shake the hand of a dustman. Again, who is the elitist? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "On a summer\u2019s day in 1476 a scribe called Moses Ibn Zabarah put the finishing touches to an enormous and magnificently illustrated Hebrew Bible commissioned by the son of a wealthy Jewish family from Galicia, north-western Spain. \u201cThe blessed Lord grant that he study it, he and his children and his children\u2019s children throughout all generations,\u201d he wrote. The Bible, whose pages teem with dragons, monkeys, peacocks, intricate geometric patterns and a slightly alarmed Jonah entering the whale\u2019s mouth head first, took 10 months to complete and would have demanded careful study. But the scribe\u2019s wish was not to be fulfilled. Sixteen years later Spain\u2019s Jews \u2013 who had already endured a century of persecution that led many to convert to Catholicism \u2013 were ordered to leave the country by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. The expulsion cast the family and their precious Bible into exile. From Spain, the book was taken to Portugal, North Africa, Gibraltar and Scotland before finally ending up in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Today, after 527 peripatetic years, the book is finally coming home \u2013 albeit temporarily. The Kennicott Bible, named after Benjamin Kennicott, the scholar and librarian on whose advice the work was bought by Oxford University, has been loaned to the regional government of Galicia and will be on show in Santiago de Compostela from Friday until next April. It forms the centrepiece of the first of three major exhibitions intended to reflect on Galicia\u2019s contributions to world culture and history. \u201cThe Kennicott is one of the world\u2019s great Bibles and it has a dual value: a technical one because of its spectacular artistry, but also a symbolic one,\u201d said Rom\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, minister for culture and tourism in the regional government. \u201cIt shows how, at one time, people of three religions \u2013 Jews, Muslims and Catholics \u2013 coexisted in Spain. It also shows that there was a strong cultural and economic Jewish presence in Galicia, but which was forced out \u2013 as Jews were in the rest of Spain.\u201d Despite the Kennicott\u2019s Galician heritage and global renown, Rodr\u00edguez said the region had no plans to ask for its permanent return: \u201cIt\u2019s Galician, no matter where it is.\u201d His words will have soothed C\u00e9sar Merch\u00e1n-Hamann, curator of Hebraica and Judaica at the Bodleian. Merch\u00e1n-Hamann describes the Kennicott, illustrated by Joseph Ibn Hayyim, as the \u201cjewel in the crown\u201d of the collection he oversees. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and unique,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a lot survived of the whole tradition of manuscript production in the Spanish lands, Christian and Muslim, through the middle ages.\u201d For Merch\u00e1n-Hamann and his fellow scholars, the Kennicott represents the last great cultural cry of a community that was being slowly but surely squeezed out of existence. While the casual observer might detect Islamic influences in its painstaking geometric designs, or Christian overtones to its animal illuminations, the Bible itself is the culmination of centuries of Judeo-Spanish tradition. \u201cIt just so happens that some of the things that people are very enchanted with, and which seem so creative, are also found on a few manuscripts that have survived from a lot earlier \u2013 two or three centuries before \u2013 and which display the same features here and there,\u201d said Merch\u00e1n-Hamann. \u201cYou realise that, great as the artist of the Kennicott may have been, these can\u2019t all be things that he thought of himself.\u201d While the Kennicott miraculously survived centuries of travel and exile and, in doing so, became a metaphor for Spain\u2019s scattered Jews, it remains a lonely exception. \u201cImagine if, because of some terrible catastrophe, most of English literature was lost, and you had to pick 10 books, or 20, or 50 out of thousands of works,\u201d said Merch\u00e1n-Hamann. \u201cIn many cases, the survival of books was completely random and you\u2019re in a terrible situation when you know there\u2019s something big behind all this but you can only try to reconstruct it.

Her office is in the house she had built two years ago with her husband, the racing-car driver Eugenio Amos, which they share with their sons Otto, six, and Augusto, four. Step into it and it is as though her eclectic account has sprung to life.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the one place in the house where I can really let go,\u201d she says, her face breaking into a smile as she points to and picks up mementos from the G Plan shelves she discovered on a thrifting trip to Brussels before she even knew they would fit. Against a backdrop of hand-painted floral wallpaper, they are laden with sentimental objects: photos of Margherita on stage in New York from her short-lived acting career; a painting given to her on her 20th birthday by an artist friend; figurines collected on her travels to India, Singapore and Sardinia; and porcelain baskets placed on vintage plates picked up in another time and place.</p> <p>It looks like a lovingly curated antique shop-cum-fashion salon and, although it is a happily haphazard mix (\u201cI don\u2019t like things that are too literal,\u201d she says), it is impeccably organised. It\u2019s a character trait that is exemplified by the tower of boxes on the adjacent wall. Covered in traditional Italian drawer-lining paper, they are home to clippings on style, travel and interiors research, wedding photographs, craft paper, beads and stationery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fffd583075d8b5e328a1729c5ecca53954bf8c46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fffd583075d8b5e328a1729c5ecca53954bf8c46/0_1312_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ordered boxes in the bedroom and jackets hanging.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dressing is a way of expressing myself\u2019: carefully ordered boxes in the bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Bertolini/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI love cataloguing, as it\u2019s a way to get my head straight,\u201d she says. \u201cBy organising everything I get a lot of inspiration for my home and M Missoni, because I can see everything again and again.\u201d She explains that she inherited her collector gene from her grandmother, 88-year-old Rosita Missoni, who founded and ran the family brand, Missoni, with her husband Ottavio in 1953 before passing the baton to Angela in 1997. It was with her that Margherita scoured flea markets around Europe as a child \u2013 and continues to do so. Although now she can be found burning the midnight oil scrolling through online auction sites, such as <a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/\" title=\"\">eBay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pamono.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pamono</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/\" title=\"\">Catawiki</a>.</p> <p>Rosita\u2019s acquisitions and influence can be felt all around her granddaughter\u2019s creative haven. There are the blinds embroidered with daisies (Margherita\u2019s adopted emblem) that are made from fabric she picked up in a flea market before they were transformed by seamstress to the stars Lilou Marquand in Paris. And there\u2019s the bright blue coffee table that once stood in Rosita\u2019s London apartment. Her influence is most obvious in the rail of coats from Margherita\u2019s new capsule collection that takes centre stage here.</p> <p>The collection was the first thing Margherita designed for the M Missoni label (and they were immediately snapped up by <a href=\"https://www.matchesfashion.com/\" title=\"\">matchesfashion.com</a> where they launch this month). They are made from patterns, original yarns and re-used fabrics that Rosita herself would have manufactured. It is the most tangible example of how symbiotic Margherita\u2019s new job is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57d5ddaa05f6d21e2d9cfef0d06b626404dc06d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57d5ddaa05f6d21e2d9cfef0d06b626404dc06d0/0_791_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The outside of the house Margherita had built two years ago with her husband.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside edge: the house Margherita had built two years ago with her husband.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was always something in me that thought I might do this \u2013 I know my grandma was desperate for me to [work in the family business] when I wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Margherita, who ran several successful fashion lines independently, before she was asked to relaunch M Missoni last year.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was 18 I moved away to do something different and find out who I was, because I felt like a branch on a tree, not an individual. But then I realised that fashion is what is most immediate for me. It\u2019s what I do best and I saw that I could strengthen Missoni as a company through this brand by adding a new layer in this way.\u201d</p> <p>As with her penchant for collecting and cataloguing rare finds, the new brand gives her the same satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m much happier when I have to work within a constraint. I like to collect and find things and then use them.\u201d</p> <p>Her personal style is as instinctive as her surroundings. \u201cDressing is totally a way of expression for me,\u201d she says, pointing to the giant Catherine Walker oil painting that hangs behind her desk and depicts three women sitting side-by-side on a bench wearing exactly the same thing. \u201cI really look forward to the moment I have a uniform and I dress the same everyday. I envy people who have a very strict aesthetic conviction,\u201d she says, before mischievously adding: \u201cI don\u2019t yet. I\u2019m too curious still.\u201d And so the legacy lives on.</p>",

Her office is in the house she had built two years ago with her husband, the racing-car driver Eugenio Amos, which they share with their sons Otto, six, and Augusto, four. Step into it and it is as though her eclectic account has sprung to life. \u201cThis is the one place in the house where I can really let go,\u201d she says, her face breaking into a smile as she points to and picks up mementos from the G Plan shelves she discovered on a thrifting trip to Brussels before she even knew they would fit. Against a backdrop of hand-painted floral wallpaper, they are laden with sentimental objects: photos of Margherita on stage in New York from her short-lived acting career; a painting given to her on her 20th birthday by an artist friend; figurines collected on her travels to India, Singapore and Sardinia; and porcelain baskets placed on vintage plates picked up in another time and place. It looks like a lovingly curated antique shop-cum-fashion salon and, although it is a happily haphazard mix (\u201cI don\u2019t like things that are too literal,\u201d she says), it is impeccably organised. It\u2019s a character trait that is exemplified by the tower of boxes on the adjacent wall. Covered in traditional Italian drawer-lining paper, they are home to clippings on style, travel and interiors research, wedding photographs, craft paper, beads and stationery. \u201cI love cataloguing, as it\u2019s a way to get my head straight,\u201d she says. \u201cBy organising everything I get a lot of inspiration for my home and M Missoni, because I can see everything again and again.\u201d She explains that she inherited her collector gene from her grandmother, 88-year-old Rosita Missoni, who founded and ran the family brand, Missoni, with her husband Ottavio in 1953 before passing the baton to Angela in 1997. It was with her that Margherita scoured flea markets around Europe as a child \u2013 and continues to do so. Although now she can be found burning the midnight oil scrolling through online auction sites, such as eBay, Pamono, and Catawiki. Rosita\u2019s acquisitions and influence can be felt all around her granddaughter\u2019s creative haven. There are the blinds embroidered with daisies (Margherita\u2019s adopted emblem) that are made from fabric she picked up in a flea market before they were transformed by seamstress to the stars Lilou Marquand in Paris. And there\u2019s the bright blue coffee table that once stood in Rosita\u2019s London apartment. Her influence is most obvious in the rail of coats from Margherita\u2019s new capsule collection that takes centre stage here. The collection was the first thing Margherita designed for the M Missoni label (and they were immediately snapped up by matchesfashion.com where they launch this month). They are made from patterns, original yarns and re-used fabrics that Rosita herself would have manufactured. It is the most tangible example of how symbiotic Margherita\u2019s new job is. \u201cThere was always something in me that thought I might do this \u2013 I know my grandma was desperate for me to [work in the family business] when I wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Margherita, who ran several successful fashion lines independently, before she was asked to relaunch M Missoni last year. \u201cWhen I was 18 I moved away to do something different and find out who I was, because I felt like a branch on a tree, not an individual. But then I realised that fashion is what is most immediate for me. It\u2019s what I do best and I saw that I could strengthen Missoni as a company through this brand by adding a new layer in this way.\u201d As with her penchant for collecting and cataloguing rare finds, the new brand gives her the same satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m much happier when I have to work within a constraint. I like to collect and find things and then use them.\u201d Her personal style is as instinctive as her surroundings. \u201cDressing is totally a way of expression for me,\u201d she says, pointing to the giant Catherine Walker oil painting that hangs behind her desk and depicts three women sitting side-by-side on a bench wearing exactly the same thing. \u201cI really look forward to the moment I have a uniform and I dress the same everyday. I envy people who have a very strict aesthetic conviction,\u201d she says, before mischievously adding: \u201cI don\u2019t yet. I\u2019m too curious still.\u201d And so the legacy lives on.",

Imposing and inspired, it is also sharp and cool, as in chilly rather than trendy.</p> <p>The same could be said of Arnault, 70, a trim, cultured and slightly awkward man who started his life as the son of an industrialist in Roubaix, a poor town in France\u2019s post-industrial rust belt. He rose through hard work and a certain creativity to become the undisputed master of the luxury goods universe as president of LVMH, the \u20ac196bn (\u00a3169bn) group whose name is an abbreviation of its cornerstone brands: Louis Vuitton, the world\u2019s biggest luxury house, and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, the champagne and cognac producer.

Tiffany said it was reviewing the proposal, which has been driven by Arnault\u2019s desire to bolster LVMH\u2019s presence in the \u201chard luxury\u201d \u2013 or jewellery and watches \u2013 market, where it owns Bulgari but still trails Swiss rival Richemont.</p> <p>It would be the most valuable deal of a career that always seemed destined for the top. After graduating from the elite engineering school \u00c9cole Polytechnique, whose alumni include three Nobel prize winners and three former presidents, Arnault spent a short time working for his father\u2019s construction business before convincing Arnault senior to ditch the building side and concentrate on real estate. In 1984, he acquired Boussac Saint-Fr\u00e8res, a failing textile company hiding a gem \u2013 the Christian Dior brand.</p> <p>After a spell in the US, Arnault returned to France determined to take on the country\u2019s traditional corporate leaders \u2013 the aristocrats, major wine chateaux and family dynasties \u2013 with an aggressive American-style approach to business.</p> <p>In 1989 he made a hostile takeover of LVMH and it became a launchpad for the acquisitions of some of the world\u2019s most prestigious labels. Today, LVMH is made up of more than 70 companies, including haute couture labels Dior and Fendi, watchmakers Tag Heuer and Hublot, upmarket jeweller Bulgari, and the Veuve Clicquot and Dom P\u00e9rignon champagne houses. It made a profit of \u20ac10bn on \u20ac46.8bn of sales in 2018.</p> <p>Lloyd Blankfein, the former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, says Arnault\u2019s skill was in realising the global demand for luxury products. \u201cHe was a complete visionary. He saw the increase of wealth in the world,\u201d Blankfein <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/lvmh-ceo-bernard-arnault-how-frances-richest-man-stays-in-fashion.html\" title=\"\">said last year</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"581fef80e580bb73abab8b362301a77d4e45138a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/581fef80e580bb73abab8b362301a77d4e45138a/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiffany\u2019s on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiffany\u2019s on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.

      "bodyText": "French billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault has been called many things: the Wolf in Cashmere, the Exterminating Angel, Tintin \u2013 for his neat, boyish looks \u2013 and Lord of the Logos among them. But it is perhaps a building that portrays him better than nicknames. In the woodland of Paris\u2019s Bois de Boulogne, the Louis Vuitton Foundation rises like a displaced iceberg in a pool of meltwater: the \u00a380m structure, designed by American architect Frank Gehry, is creative, complex and visionary, but not entirely admired or popular. Imposing and inspired, it is also sharp and cool, as in chilly rather than trendy. The same could be said of Arnault, 70, a trim, cultured and slightly awkward man who started his life as the son of an industrialist in Roubaix, a poor town in France\u2019s post-industrial rust belt. He rose through hard work and a certain creativity to become the undisputed master of the luxury goods universe as president of LVMH, the \u20ac196bn (\u00a3169bn) group whose name is an abbreviation of its cornerstone brands: Louis Vuitton, the world\u2019s biggest luxury house, and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, the champagne and cognac producer. He is the world\u2019s third-richest man, with a fortune worth $97bn (\u00a375bn). Last week LVMH said it was looking to add US jeweller Tiffany &amp; Co to its stable with a $14.5bn bid. Tiffany said it was reviewing the proposal, which has been driven by Arnault\u2019s desire to bolster LVMH\u2019s presence in the \u201chard luxury\u201d \u2013 or jewellery and watches \u2013 market, where it owns Bulgari but still trails Swiss rival Richemont. It would be the most valuable deal of a career that always seemed destined for the top. After graduating from the elite engineering school \u00c9cole Polytechnique, whose alumni include three Nobel prize winners and three former presidents, Arnault spent a short time working for his father\u2019s construction business before convincing Arnault senior to ditch the building side and concentrate on real estate. In 1984, he acquired Boussac Saint-Fr\u00e8res, a failing textile company hiding a gem \u2013 the Christian Dior brand. After a spell in the US, Arnault returned to France determined to take on the country\u2019s traditional corporate leaders \u2013 the aristocrats, major wine chateaux and family dynasties \u2013 with an aggressive American-style approach to business. In 1989 he made a hostile takeover of LVMH and it became a launchpad for the acquisitions of some of the world\u2019s most prestigious labels. Today, LVMH is made up of more than 70 companies, including haute couture labels Dior and Fendi, watchmakers Tag Heuer and Hublot, upmarket jeweller Bulgari, and the Veuve Clicquot and Dom P\u00e9rignon champagne houses. It made a profit of \u20ac10bn on \u20ac46.8bn of sales in 2018. Lloyd Blankfein, the former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, says Arnault\u2019s skill was in realising the global demand for luxury products. \u201cHe was a complete visionary. He saw the increase of wealth in the world,\u201d Blankfein said last year. Pierre Mallevays, former head of acquisitions at LVMH, who now runs the boutique financial advisory firm Savigny Partners, said: \u201cArnault is a man of great vision. He did not invent luxury brands but he invented the luxury industry. He singlehandedly helped transform a landscape which was a collection of family-run businesses into organised, professionally run groups with synergies and benefits of scale. He anticipated that more and more people would want to buy luxury products and organised himself to ride that growth.\u201d In business, Arnault is considered ferocious and predatory.

      "body": "<p>Astronomers have reached a fundamental impasse in their understanding of the universe: they cannot agree how fast it is flying apart. And unless a reasonable explanation can be found for their differing estimates, they may be forced to completely rethink their ideas about time and space. Only new physics can now account for the cosmic conundrum they have uncovered, many believe.</p> <p>\u201cFive years ago, no one in cosmology was really worried about the question of how fast the universe was expanding. We took it for granted,\u201d says astrophysicist Daniel Mortlock of Imperial College London. \u201cNow we are having to do a great deal of head scratching \u2013 and a lot of research.\u201d</p> <p>This view is backed by the US astrophysicist and Nobel prize winner Adam Riess, of Johns Hopkins University. \u201cI think this issue has become a big deal. We were getting better and better<strong> </strong>at understanding the universe and yet the closer we have been looking, the more we have found there are all these mysterious components.\u201d</p> <p>Over the decades, these surprises have included the discovery of dark matter \u2013 believed to be made up of as yet undetected particles \u2013 whose extra gravitational pull explains why galaxies do not fly apart. In addition, astronomers have also discovered the existence of dark energy, which is accelerating the rate at which the cosmos is expanding.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dark matter and dark energy are two question marks hanging over our understanding. I\u00a0do\u00a0not feel the need\u00a0for a third</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Mortlock</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThose two discoveries were remarkable enough,\u201d adds Riess who won his Nobel for his involvement in the discovery of dark energy. \u201cBut now we are facing the fact there may be a third phenomenon that we had overlooked \u2013 though we haven\u2019t really got a clue yet what it might be.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists first realised the universe was expanding in the 1920s, when the US astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the greater the distance between two galaxies, the faster they are moving apart. It remains one of the most important scientific discoveries ever made.</p> <p>One way to think about this phenomenon is to imagine a fruit loaf that is being cooked in an oven. As its dough rises and expands, the raisins and sultanas embedded inside the loaf move farther away from each other. The universe is like that fruit loaf. It is expanding and causing the galaxies \u2013 the raisins and sultanas embedded in it \u2013 to speed away from each other.</p> <p>But if the universe was getting bigger and bigger, one key question remained: what is the exact rate of this expansion? Just how quickly is the cosmos flying apart? Or to be more precise: what is the exact value of the Hubble constant, as the speed of the universe\u2019s expansion was subsequently termed? It is a highly important, much sought-after value because it will tell us a great deal about the origin, age, evolution, and ultimately the fate, of the cosmos. Hence the effort astronomers have made over the past century to find a precise answer.</p> <p>These observations have been based on two very different approaches, however. One has focused on the behaviour of galaxies near our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and has involved scientists working out \u2013 with increasing precision \u2013 just how fast they are speeding away from each other. \u201cThat\u2019s the local approach,\u201d says Riess whose own work has concentrated on trying to perfect the measurement of distances between galaxies in our region of the universe. (See \u201cHubble\u2019s constant and Henrietta Leavitt\u201d, below.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"253991741b58c5fea0f9c8504910d884a3a12622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/253991741b58c5fea0f9c8504910d884a3a12622/0_0_3600_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cosmic microwave background of the universe, mapped from space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cosmic microwave background of the universe, mapped from space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other method for establishing the Hubble constant has involved astronomers looking at the rippling pattern of light, called the cosmic microwave background, that formed just after the big bang birth of the cosmos 13.8bn years ago. This background has been surveyed with increasing precision by US and European satellites \u2013 most recently by the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Planck\" title=\"\">Planck observatory</a> \u2013 and these observations have allowed scientists to build a model that takes account of dark energy and dark matter and that shows how the early universe\u2019s growth would probably have produced an expansion that astronomers can measure today.</p> <p>And until very recently, these two different approaches produced estimates that appeared to be consistent with each other, although there were considerable uncertainties associated with both measurements. \u201cEveryone\u2019s best bet was that the difference between the two estimates was just down to chance, and that the two values would converge as more and more measurements were taken,\u201d says Mortlock. In other words, as the two values were tested with greater and greater precision, their differences would disappear.</p> <p>Unfortunately for astronomers seeking a simple fix to the problem, this has not happened. \u201cIn fact, the opposite has occurred,\u201d says Mortlock, who is also based at Stockholm University. \u201cThe discrepancy has become stronger. The estimate of the Hubble constant that had the lower value has got a bit lower over the years and the one that was a bit higher has got even greater.\u201d</p> <p>Today, those using Planck and cosmic background data to obtain a value for the Hubble constant get a figure of 67.4 plus or minus 0.5. By contrast the local approach gives a figure of 73.5 plus or minus 1.4. These values represent the two different values we have for the expansion of the universe. (See \u201cA matter of metrics\u201d, below.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A revalued cosmic chronology is a bit difficult to stomach. Stars take\u00a0time to form,\u00a0after all</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dissimilarity may not sound great but it is significant. They say there is now less than a one in 100,000 chance that this difference can be accounted for by chance. \u201cThis is not just two experiments disagreeing,\u201d says Riess. \u201cWe are measuring something fundamentally different. One is a measurement of how fast the universe is expanding today as we see it. The other is a prediction based on the physics of the early universe and on measurements of how fast it ought to be expanding. And these measurements have now been independently corroborated by other groups so that the discrepancy does not depend on any one tool or any one team.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if these values don\u2019t agree, that means there is a very strong likelihood that we\u2019re missing a factor in the cosmological model that connects the two eras.\u201d In short, something appears to be absent from our understanding of the universe and the Hubble constant has become the focus of a hotly contested battle to discover the nature of this invisible influence.</p> <p>For a start, the difference between two values has implications for the age of the universe, lopping off more than a billion years of its existence in one case. \u201cChanging the Hubble constant from 67.4 to 73.5 would mean it must have been flying apart faster than previously supposed and so must be younger than its currently accepted age of 13.8bn years,\u201d says Mortlock. \u201cIn fact it would cut to 12.7bn years.\u201d</p> <p>And this does cause problems. There are some very old stars in the universe that have estimated ages of around 12bn years, and this makes a revalued cosmic chronology a bit difficult to stomach. Stars take a long time to form, after all.</p> <p>However, that is not the real issue, says Mortlock. \u201cThe basic problem is that having two different figures for the Hubble constant measured from different perspectives would simply invalidate the cosmological model we made of the universe. So we wouldn\u2019t be able to say what the age of the universe was until we had put our physics right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f834a54b3a5f4b2371dc12a800279468c31a0cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f834a54b3a5f4b2371dc12a800279468c31a0cb/0_274_2723_3403/800.jpg\" alt=\"Edwin Hubble uses the Schmidt telescope at Mount Palomar, California, 1949.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edwin Hubble uses the Schmidt telescope at Mount Palomar, California, 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boyer/Roger Viollet via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of the independent corroborations, Riess has become more confident there must be a fundamental discrepancy involved, one that is not due to methodological flaws or mistakes in observations but caused by a feature of our universe of which scientists have had no previous inkling. \u201cI think that there is something interesting going on,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I do not consider measurement errors interesting.\u201d</p> <p>But if measurement error can no longer be considered a cause of the differences in Hubble constant values, what new concepts could explain this discrepancy? Astronomers have already put forward a number of suggestions.</p> <p>One idea proposes that the universe contains a new class of subatomic particle that travels close to the speed of light. These entities are called dark radiation and could also include already known particles such as neutrinos. These would affect the speed of the universe\u2019s expansion.</p> <p>Another idea is there was a special, intense dark-energy episode not long after the big bang, which expanded the universe faster than astronomers had previously appreciated.</p> <p>And finally there is the possibility that the particles that make up dark matter interact more strongly with normal matter than previously assumed. Again this would have an impact on the Hubble constant.</p> <p>Not every scientist is over the moon about the prospect that one of these proposals is the answer to their measurement quandary and still hope that in the end it may be possible to reconcile the two values they get for the Hubble constant. This point is stressed by Mortlock. \u201cWe already have found that our universe is dominated by dark matter and by dark energy whose effects we can observe but whose basic nature is a mystery.

      "bodyText": "Astronomers have reached a fundamental impasse in their understanding of the universe: they cannot agree how fast it is flying apart. And unless a reasonable explanation can be found for their differing estimates, they may be forced to completely rethink their ideas about time and space. Only new physics can now account for the cosmic conundrum they have uncovered, many believe. \u201cFive years ago, no one in cosmology was really worried about the question of how fast the universe was expanding. We took it for granted,\u201d says astrophysicist Daniel Mortlock of Imperial College London. \u201cNow we are having to do a great deal of head scratching \u2013 and a lot of research.\u201d This view is backed by the US astrophysicist and Nobel prize winner Adam Riess, of Johns Hopkins University. \u201cI think this issue has become a big deal. We were getting better and better at understanding the universe and yet the closer we have been looking, the more we have found there are all these mysterious components.\u201d Over the decades, these surprises have included the discovery of dark matter \u2013 believed to be made up of as yet undetected particles \u2013 whose extra gravitational pull explains why galaxies do not fly apart. In addition, astronomers have also discovered the existence of dark energy, which is accelerating the rate at which the cosmos is expanding. \u201cThose two discoveries were remarkable enough,\u201d adds Riess who won his Nobel for his involvement in the discovery of dark energy. \u201cBut now we are facing the fact there may be a third phenomenon that we had overlooked \u2013 though we haven\u2019t really got a clue yet what it might be.\u201d Scientists first realised the universe was expanding in the 1920s, when the US astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the greater the distance between two galaxies, the faster they are moving apart. It remains one of the most important scientific discoveries ever made. One way to think about this phenomenon is to imagine a fruit loaf that is being cooked in an oven. As its dough rises and expands, the raisins and sultanas embedded inside the loaf move farther away from each other. The universe is like that fruit loaf. It is expanding and causing the galaxies \u2013 the raisins and sultanas embedded in it \u2013 to speed away from each other. But if the universe was getting bigger and bigger, one key question remained: what is the exact rate of this expansion? Just how quickly is the cosmos flying apart? Or to be more precise: what is the exact value of the Hubble constant, as the speed of the universe\u2019s expansion was subsequently termed? It is a highly important, much sought-after value because it will tell us a great deal about the origin, age, evolution, and ultimately the fate, of the cosmos. Hence the effort astronomers have made over the past century to find a precise answer. These observations have been based on two very different approaches, however. One has focused on the behaviour of galaxies near our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and has involved scientists working out \u2013 with increasing precision \u2013 just how fast they are speeding away from each other. \u201cThat\u2019s the local approach,\u201d says Riess whose own work has concentrated on trying to perfect the measurement of distances between galaxies in our region of the universe. (See \u201cHubble\u2019s constant and Henrietta Leavitt\u201d, below.) The other method for establishing the Hubble constant has involved astronomers looking at the rippling pattern of light, called the cosmic microwave background, that formed just after the big bang birth of the cosmos 13.8bn years ago. This background has been surveyed with increasing precision by US and European satellites \u2013 most recently by the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck observatory \u2013 and these observations have allowed scientists to build a model that takes account of dark energy and dark matter and that shows how the early universe\u2019s growth would probably have produced an expansion that astronomers can measure today. And until very recently, these two different approaches produced estimates that appeared to be consistent with each other, although there were considerable uncertainties associated with both measurements. \u201cEveryone\u2019s best bet was that the difference between the two estimates was just down to chance, and that the two values would converge as more and more measurements were taken,\u201d says Mortlock. In other words, as the two values were tested with greater and greater precision, their differences would disappear. Unfortunately for astronomers seeking a simple fix to the problem, this has not happened. \u201cIn fact, the opposite has occurred,\u201d says Mortlock, who is also based at Stockholm University. \u201cThe discrepancy has become stronger. The estimate of the Hubble constant that had the lower value has got a bit lower over the years and the one that was a bit higher has got even greater.\u201d Today, those using Planck and cosmic background data to obtain a value for the Hubble constant get a figure of 67.4 plus or minus 0.5. By contrast the local approach gives a figure of 73.5 plus or minus 1.4. These values represent the two different values we have for the expansion of the universe. (See \u201cA matter of metrics\u201d, below.) The dissimilarity may not sound great but it is significant. They say there is now less than a one in 100,000 chance that this difference can be accounted for by chance. \u201cThis is not just two experiments disagreeing,\u201d says Riess. \u201cWe are measuring something fundamentally different. One is a measurement of how fast the universe is expanding today as we see it. The other is a prediction based on the physics of the early universe and on measurements of how fast it ought to be expanding. And these measurements have now been independently corroborated by other groups so that the discrepancy does not depend on any one tool or any one team. \u201cAnd if these values don\u2019t agree, that means there is a very strong likelihood that we\u2019re missing a factor in the cosmological model that connects the two eras.\u201d In short, something appears to be absent from our understanding of the universe and the Hubble constant has become the focus of a hotly contested battle to discover the nature of this invisible influence. For a start, the difference between two values has implications for the age of the universe, lopping off more than a billion years of its existence in one case. \u201cChanging the Hubble constant from 67.4 to 73.5 would mean it must have been flying apart faster than previously supposed and so must be younger than its currently accepted age of 13.8bn years,\u201d says Mortlock. \u201cIn fact it would cut to 12.7bn years.\u201d And this does cause problems. There are some very old stars in the universe that have estimated ages of around 12bn years, and this makes a revalued cosmic chronology a bit difficult to stomach. Stars take a long time to form, after all. However, that is not the real issue, says Mortlock. \u201cThe basic problem is that having two different figures for the Hubble constant measured from different perspectives would simply invalidate the cosmological model we made of the universe. So we wouldn\u2019t be able to say what the age of the universe was until we had put our physics right.\u201d Because of the independent corroborations, Riess has become more confident there must be a fundamental discrepancy involved, one that is not due to methodological flaws or mistakes in observations but caused by a feature of our universe of which scientists have had no previous inkling. \u201cI think that there is something interesting going on,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I do not consider measurement errors interesting.\u201d But if measurement error can no longer be considered a cause of the differences in Hubble constant values, what new concepts could explain this discrepancy? Astronomers have already put forward a number of suggestions. One idea proposes that the universe contains a new class of subatomic particle that travels close to the speed of light. These entities are called dark radiation and could also include already known particles such as neutrinos. These would affect the speed of the universe\u2019s expansion. Another idea is there was a special, intense dark-energy episode not long after the big bang, which expanded the universe faster than astronomers had previously appreciated. And finally there is the possibility that the particles that make up dark matter interact more strongly with normal matter than previously assumed. Again this would have an impact on the Hubble constant. Not every scientist is over the moon about the prospect that one of these proposals is the answer to their measurement quandary and still hope that in the end it may be possible to reconcile the two values they get for the Hubble constant. This point is stressed by Mortlock. \u201cWe already have found that our universe is dominated by dark matter and by dark energy whose effects we can observe but whose basic nature is a mystery. They are two huge question marks that are already hanging over our understanding of the cosmos. Personally, I do not feel the need for a third.\u201d For his part, Riess takes a slightly more optimistic view. \u201cWe are not made of dark matter or dark energy but we have uncovered their existence even though, intuitively, they are not part of our experience of life on Earth. That suggests we are heading in the right direction in understanding the universe \u2013 though it just may be that we have at least one other step to take.\u201d Hubble\u2019s constant and Henrietta Leavitt Stars known as Cepheid variables have played a critical role in our understanding of the expansion of the universe. These stars, which are relatively common, vary in brightness over periods of days or weeks. In 1908 Henrietta Leavitt discovered there was a relationship between the brightness of a Cepheid variable star and the time it took to go through a full cycle of change in its luminosity. As a result, by measuring the period of a Cepheid variable, it became possible to calculate its true brightness. Then, by comparing this to its apparent brightness, astronomers could calculate the distance of the star \u2013 and the galaxy in which it is found. Hubble used this understanding in his work to calibrate cosmological distances, and Cepheids today continue to provide key calibration for astronomical distances for the local method for calculating the Hubble constant. A matter of metrics A Hubble constant of 70 would mean that the universe is expanding at a rate of 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec.

Mocking an infamous Vanity Fair interview in which O\u2019Rourke said he was born for the presidency, Trump said: \u201cHe said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven, he came down.\u201d O\u2019Rourke made his announcement in a Medium post and a series of tweets, saying: \u201cOur campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.\u201d Speaking to supporters in Iowa, he said he made the decision \u201creluctantly\u201d and would stay active in the fight to defeat Trump. \u201cI will be part of this and so will you,\u201d he said. The three-term congressman rose to national prominence with a strong performance in a 2018 US Senate race against the Republican Ted Cruz, a contest he lost narrowly. He parlayed that run into a presidential bid which started strongly, as donors and voters were drawn to his unconventional background and energetic style. Born Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke to a solidly Irish American family, he nonetheless had a Hispanic nickname and a past including arrests and membership of a punk band which helped him stand out in a diverse field. His time in Congress as a rare Texas Democrat, from a border district, was valued and his habit of giving speeches while standing on tables celebrated, before the latter tactic began to be roundly mocked. O\u2019Rourke experienced very public misfires, including the Vanity Fair article and photoshoot and controversy over a joke about his wife, Amy, raising his children without him. Such reverses led to a public apology for his white male privilege but he never made a serious impression on the polls or in the crowded debates. O\u2019Rourke could not match progressive favourites Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders or muster the centrist appeal of Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. Some of his policies, such as an assault-weapon buyback to stop mass shootings such as that which killed 22 people in his home town in August, were popular with liberals but prompted ferocious criticism, even threats, from Republicans in his home state and on the national stage. En route to a rally in Mississippi which he mistakenly tweeted would be in Louisiana, Trump first mocked O\u2019Rourke in surprisingly muted tones. \u201cOh no,\u201d the president wrote, \u201cBeto just dropped out of race for president despite him saying he was \u2018born for this\u2019. I don\u2019t think so!\u201d He was harsher in front of a crowd, saying: \u201cAnybody who says they were born for this, they\u2019re in trouble. \u201cHe came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be.\u201d O\u2019Rourke thanked volunteers and supporters and said: \u201cLet us continue to fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together. Whether it is ending the epidemic of gun violence or dismantling structural racism or successfully confronting climate change, we will continue to organize and mobilize and act.\u201d He said he would support the Democratic nominee. The frontrunners in the still-unwieldy field are former vice-president Biden, senators Warren and Sanders and Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. O\u2019Rourke has also trailed Senator Kamala Harris, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and representative Tulsi Gabbard. But he has consistently polled ahead of senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, the pro-impeachment billionaire Tom Steyer and the former federal housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who all remain in the race. Candidates including Warren and Sanders were quick to send O\u2019Rourke on his way with tweeted thanks. Most concentrated on his advocacy for gun control reform. Castro, who attacked O\u2019Rourke on the debate stage on immigration, a key part of the former congressman\u2019s platform, said his opponent \u201cinspired millions of Americans \u2026 and rallied Texans and El Pasoans after the tragedy that struck his hometown\u201d. Harris, whose own campaign has refused to catch fire after a strong start, thanked O\u2019Rourke on Twitter \u201cfor always speaking from the heart. Your passion for your community and conviction to create a future free from gun violence have enriched this campaign and shown us the leader you are.\u201d At 47, O\u2019Rourke seemed to many to have a long political future, perhaps focused on the next Texas US Senate race, against the senior Republican John Cornyn. But on Friday an aide told the New York Times O\u2019Rourke would not mount another run. That perhaps reflected a realisation that the former congressman reached too far too soon. That is certainly a view held by many of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s critics, that as the Daily Beast put it: \u201cReacting to losing to Ted Cruz by running for president is like failing to land a role in a community theatre production and deciding to take your talents to Broadway.\u201d In a statement, the Texas Democratic party chair, Gilberto Hinojosa, called O\u2019Rourke \u201ca fighter, advocate and leader\u201d. \u201cIn the wake of the El Paso shootings,\u201d he said, \u201che made the entire country proud as he focused his campaign on ending gun violence and the rise of white supremacy. We thank him for his service and leadership. He made Texas proud. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke has done amazing things for the Democratic party in Texas, and we look forward to his future.\u201d",

The sport was long associated with South Africa\u2019s white minority.

      "bodyText": "The crowd swelled as the game went on. From scores to hundreds to a thousand or more, young and old, men and women, all gathered in front of the big screen in the square of Newtown Junction, in the very centre of Johannesburg. No one spread the word that victory for the Springboks was possible, let alone imminent. No one needed to. By the middle of the second half, there were no more shoppers hunting for bargains. The gym in the mall was empty. The queues at KFC, the Indian takeaway and the grilled sausage stand had disappeared. And, as unseasonable grey skies gave way to the usual brilliant blue and it became clear that victory was assured, the celebrations began. \u201cI\u2019m so proud. It\u2019s our first win with a black captain,\u201d said Sibusiso Radebe, 37, an insurance underwriter, referring to Siya Kolisi. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d shouted Kwenzi Vilakai, a 26-year-old fitness trainer, amid the whoops, yells and cheers. \u201cWhatever we do, we have to be united and support each other. It makes me hopeful for my country.\u201d Her friend Cathy Shabalala, a 25-year-old student, danced. \u201cAs South Africans, this feels so great. We are not always like this. And the bonus is we have played against our old colonisers and we have beaten them! We have killed them!\u201d The crowd had been subdued when the Springboks took to the field and sang South Africa\u2019s multilingual national anthem. There was even a brief moment when the chorus of Swing Low Sweet Chariot from England fans in the stadium in Yokohama was audible over speakers from almost 14,000km away. As the South Africans\u2019 strength on the field became clear though a new song rang out, drowning out all else and the crowd, arms aloft, began to sway. Shosholoza, a stirring call and response chant with rolling harmonies and haunting lyrics, once kept gold miners swinging their picks under the apartheid regime. But since the coming of democracy, it has become a much loved staple of sporting events, famously sung when the Springboks won the Rugby World Cup in 1995, a year after South Africa\u2019s first free election. That victory, and the presentation of the trophy to Francois Pienaar by Nelson Mandela, helped heal a traumatised nation. As the lines \u201cGo forward, go forward\u201d rang out around the square, Tsholoselfo Ranyane, 26, said she felt very patriotic, and that that was a good thing because \u201cSouth Africans need to be more patriotic right now\u201d. For years, the 55 million citizens of the rainbow nation have had little to cheer. The country remains one of the most unequal in the world. There is deep public frustration with soaring joblessness, patchy delivery of basic services and widespread official corruption. Drought is causing severe water shortages. There are rolling power cuts. The centre of Johannesburg, the zone around the Newtown square, has a well-earned reputation for violent crime. \u201cWe have a lot of issues so this is really about bringing people together,\u201d said Haick Avakian, a 31-year-old accounts manager, as the second half of the match began. That rugby has acted as a unifier is a small miracle. The sport was long associated with South Africa\u2019s white minority. Black players were banned from competing under apartheid and the country\u2019s national side was excluded from international tournaments. A key factor in the current breadth of support for the Springboks is the diversity of the team. Only around half the players are white. A second factor is Kolisi, who came from desperate poverty to fight his way up through the intensely competitive ranks of South African rugby to became the first black player to captain the international side. The 28-year-old is married to a white woman, has adopted his two half siblings, has two children of his own and represents the progress that, though undeniably patchy, South Africa has made over recent decades. \u201cHe\u2019s just a great example of what South Africa and South Africans can do if we try,\u201d said David Dlamini, 55, as the crowd cheered a missed England penalty. With 10 minutes to go, the shouts of \u201cGo, Bokke\u201d grew louder, the crowd denser. Images of the word \u201cSouth\u201d being etched on to the Webb Ellis trophy in preparation for the now certain victory raised further cheers. Then the final whistle blew. Beer was flung into the air, flags waved, Shosholoza rang out again. Two security guards danced, their nightsticks held in the air. A portly older woman in a purple dress shuffled happily next to a man in a bright yellow suit. Grinning, jumping teenagers exchanged elaborate series of fist bumps and high fives. Below the screen, now showing close-ups of the jubilant Springboks, two children skipped happily, the backs of their T-shirts bearing a simple legend: \u201cSouth Africa, your time is now.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>My longest relationship began seven years ago. I think I can say that I\u2019ve been a dedicated partner. Like any relationship, we\u2019ve had our fair share of ups and downs. There have been times that felt like nothing could possibly come between us. Then there have been times that felt so dark I thought the only choice we had was to go our separate ways. For better or worse, we have always found our way back to one another. This love is addictive and all-encompassing. This love I\u2019m referring to is my long-term, codependent relationship with Instagram.</p> <p>There were others before Instagram. Myspace was my first, then a moment with Facebook and a liaison with Twitter. I was cutting my teeth, learning how to communicate with the world beyond me. When Instagram rolled in, I was ready for the long-term. I loved that it was image-focussed; having worked as a model for most of my life, I knew how to make something look desirable.</p> <p>When I joined the site in 2012, the affair was a casual one. I recently scrolled all the way back to the beginning, more than 4,000 posts ago. The first photos were so sweet, so innocent and so naive: heavily filtered \u201cfun\u201d breakfasts I made for my then boyfriend, screenshots of texts between my sister and me about J-Lo, and photos of random cats I found under people\u2019s cars.</p> <p>Since then, Instagram has become the overall facilitator of life, a hub to find work, friends, romantic relationships and holiday destinations.</p> <p>When my body changed as I hit my early 20s, I found myself at a very average UK size 12 \u2013 and no longer skinny enough to model for \u201cnormal\u201d brands. Modelling is a job where every day your role is to be a different version of yourself \u2013 the version a brand or client wants you to be. But now it felt as if the world didn\u2019t want me to be anything. I scanned TV, movies and magazines and realised that it was rare to see a woman who wasn\u2019t sample size. So Instagram became the place where I could channel my frustration with narrow-minded perspectives on beauty by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/naomishimada/?hl=en\" title=\"\">posting the kinds of images</a> I wanted to see in the world.</p> <p>In 2015, then at a UK size 14/16, I posted a photo of myself on the beach in Brazil in a tiny string bikini. My hair was wet from the ocean and I was drinking a cold beer and laughing because, at that moment, I felt so free. Now everyone is posting this sort of thing \u2013 but, at the time, seeing a body like mine in a swimsuit was radical. Those beach shots became a BBC headline (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/bodypositive/35287055\" title=\"\">Naomi Shimada on Body Positivity and Bikin</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/bodypositive/35287055\" title=\"\">is</a>\u201d).</p> <p>Soon, my photos \u2013 sometimes nude, sometimes dressed in rainbow-hued outfits \u2013 were re-posted countless times, and my follower count started to shoot up. My inbox would be full to the brim with touching messages from other women who wanted to see themselves reflected in the media. I remember the high I felt \u2013 and I began to believe I was on to something, that a shift was starting to happen in the world; a shift where people wanted to see different kinds of approaches to beauty and living.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Posting shots of a\u00a0body like mine in a swimsuit was radical</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this sweet honeymoon stage soon came crashing down. Last year I had a wake-up call on the effect social media was having on my state of mind when I went through a period of acute anxiety and struggled to function for months. My love affair with Instagram and my new sense of self had turned ugly. Eventually, the idea of performing on the platform when I didn\u2019t want to trigger such deep feelings that even fulfilling the smallest of tasks \u2013 from getting to my dance class to doing my weekly shop \u2013 felt daunting. </p> <p>It turns out I was a statistic. A study published in the journal <em><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2749480\" title=\"\">JAMA Psychiatry</a> </em>in September found that of 6,600 young people, those who spent more than three hours a day on social media were more likely to develop mental health problems, including anxiety and depression.</p> <p>As Instagram exploded, becoming a platform for celebrity as well as political and social influence, everything on my feed suddenly seemed to need to become more veneered \u2013 and more self-promotional.

What do you lose when you start commodifying your essence and your authenticity? Do you become less you? I became increasingly aware that happiness on social media is intertwined with capitalistic ideals of success. Is this what I actually wanted, or was this an ideal I had absorbed from social media\u2019s societal messaging? I was getting lost in the culture of comparison that apps like Instagram create.</p> <p>I was forced to seriously question these ideals when I found myself in an actual romantic relationship with someone who I met on Instagram. By swiftly examining his profile I decided he ticked all of what I thought were my \u201cboxes\u201d. My spy-like examination of his page told me he was smart, beautiful and that we had many similar interests. When we eventually started to speak via DMs, our conversations flowed easily.

I quickly started to fantasise what a future together could look like for us. Meeting in real life was intoxicating. A digital fantasy had, seemingly, become reality. Our relationship moved quickly because we were both in love with another image, the one we\u2019d created of the other person \u2013 an image that was almost purely based on each other\u2019s social media profiles.</p> <p>And so, just as quickly as it started, things swiftly took a downward spiral as we woke up to the reality, rather than the perfect avatar versions, of each other. The work, holiday and family photos that had made me feel so drawn to him, were not, of course, all that he was: there was a huge amount of complexity beneath those images. For both of us, our behaviour and the reality of who we were didn\u2019t match up to the other\u2019s expectations, which led to us breaking up.</p> <p>While writing a book about our relationship with social media, I realised it was exactly that: a relationship. And I needed to treat it like one. For it to be healthy and functional, I needed boundaries, I needed breaks, I needed room to breathe. And I needed to set my own expectations. </p> <p>Still, the thought of completely stepping away from social media is unimaginable. I think I would feel very lost. After all, it\u2019s how I\u2019ve met some of my best friends. It\u2019s also my biggest resource for being able to see things from different perspectives. I still want to be a person of the digital world, but I needed to take into account that apps like Instagram want to keep me hooked.</p> <p>By taking breaks and choosing when to be online, I\u2019ve found that there is a richness in the quiet, a secret symphony in airplane mode. Having learned that, I am now hopeful that I can continue to be a part of sharing and creating the world I want to see and be a part of.</p> <p>The most important lesson has been to realise that my self-worth is not based on a number \u2013 of followers or likes.

I still believe in goals, it\u2019s just that the goals look very different now. Just because something looks good doesn\u2019t mean it is good, so I\u2019m going to keep making decisions based on how things feel over how they look.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, in an all-too-brief interlude between conquering a severe fear of flying and the advent of buzzkill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/stayontheground-swedes-turn-to-trains-amid-climate-flight-shame\" title=\"\">flight shame</a>, I settled into a transatlantic journey, stuffed with cheesy pasta, flanked by an adorable number of miniature wine bottles, and prepared to watch the ultimate comfort film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/26/bridesmaids-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bridesmaids</em></a>.</p> <p>In my happy carby stupor, I had forgotten that it opens with Kristen Wiig jiggling around on top of Jon Hamm for far longer than the woman next to me felt comfortable with. I saw her glance over, and glance back, then repeat the manoeuvre, her disapproval silent but deadly. I looked down at my abandoned bread roll, hoping to convey the message that I was only there for Maya Rudolph\u2019s food poisoning in a wedding dress. Somehow, to acknowledge it by turning it off would have been worse, so I left them to bounce on, unwatched, yet judged.</p> <p>Olivia Wilde directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/25/olivia-wilde-booksmart-review-fast-funny-feminist\" title=\"\"><em>Booksmart</em></a>, 2019\u2019s most joyous and life-affirming film, a righteous celebration of the brightness of teenage girls. Wilde had the displeasure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/31/no-scissor-emoji-olivia-wilde-criticises-airline-censorship-of-booksmart\" title=\"\">watching her own movie</a> on a flight recently and I knew it could not be the same liberated airline that had provided my <em>Bridesmaids</em> incident. Fans had been in touch to tell her about strange and savage cuts that had been made to some of its most crucial scenes and, on watching it herself, Wilde took to Twitter to list them. They are extravagantly prudish, homophobic and sexist, which is particularly egregious given that one of the main strengths of the film is to rally against such idiocy with class and wit.</p> <p>The word \u201cvagina\u201d is muted or cut, as is the word \u201cgenitals\u201d, while \u201cfuck\u201d is left to fly free. \u201cMost disappointingly, they cut most of Amy and Hope\u2019s love scene in the bathroom, which involves zero nudity, but does involve an essential plot point for a lead character. \u201cWtfffff,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliviawilde/status/1189604886142509058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1189604886142509058&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2019%2Foct%2F31%2Fno-scissor-emoji-olivia-wilde-criticises-airline-censorship-of-booksmart\" title=\"\">Wilde wrote</a>.</p> <p>It is wearying beyond belief to once again receive the familiar and harmful message that a same-sex storyline is disgusting, or porny, or NSFW, to be chopped out and hidden away. The implication that it is shameful is so terribly damaging. Wilde has urged airlines not to work with the third-party company responsible for the edits, which has enormous power in deciding what might be \u201cappropriate\u201d. Instead of coming for sweet, funny romance, it would have been far more useful for them to step in and tell me not to watch <em>Avatar</em> on a screen the size of a paperback.</p> <h2>Judd Apatow: no to Netflix\u2019s fast-forwarding</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ede122d4ef9691ebb394284b4854d9a9e48f147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ede122d4ef9691ebb394284b4854d9a9e48f147/0_259_3331_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Judd Apatow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judd Apatow: \u2018We give you nice things.

Netflix is far better than that.\u201d</p> <p>The thought of being able to play something faster fills me with horror and not entirely because of the imposition on a film-maker\u2019s artistic vision.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, in an all-too-brief interlude between conquering a severe fear of flying and the advent of buzzkill flight shame, I settled into a transatlantic journey, stuffed with cheesy pasta, flanked by an adorable number of miniature wine bottles, and prepared to watch the ultimate comfort film, Bridesmaids. In my happy carby stupor, I had forgotten that it opens with Kristen Wiig jiggling around on top of Jon Hamm for far longer than the woman next to me felt comfortable with. I saw her glance over, and glance back, then repeat the manoeuvre, her disapproval silent but deadly. I looked down at my abandoned bread roll, hoping to convey the message that I was only there for Maya Rudolph\u2019s food poisoning in a wedding dress. Somehow, to acknowledge it by turning it off would have been worse, so I left them to bounce on, unwatched, yet judged. Olivia Wilde directed Booksmart, 2019\u2019s most joyous and life-affirming film, a righteous celebration of the brightness of teenage girls. Wilde had the displeasure of watching her own movie on a flight recently and I knew it could not be the same liberated airline that had provided my Bridesmaids incident. Fans had been in touch to tell her about strange and savage cuts that had been made to some of its most crucial scenes and, on watching it herself, Wilde took to Twitter to list them. They are extravagantly prudish, homophobic and sexist, which is particularly egregious given that one of the main strengths of the film is to rally against such idiocy with class and wit. The word \u201cvagina\u201d is muted or cut, as is the word \u201cgenitals\u201d, while \u201cfuck\u201d is left to fly free. \u201cMost disappointingly, they cut most of Amy and Hope\u2019s love scene in the bathroom, which involves zero nudity, but does involve an essential plot point for a lead character. \u201cWtfffff,\u201d Wilde wrote. It is wearying beyond belief to once again receive the familiar and harmful message that a same-sex storyline is disgusting, or porny, or NSFW, to be chopped out and hidden away. The implication that it is shameful is so terribly damaging. Wilde has urged airlines not to work with the third-party company responsible for the edits, which has enormous power in deciding what might be \u201cappropriate\u201d. Instead of coming for sweet, funny romance, it would have been far more useful for them to step in and tell me not to watch Avatar on a screen the size of a paperback. Judd Apatow: no to Netflix\u2019s fast-forwarding Judd Apatow is one of a number of creative types expressing disapproval at a feature that Netflix appears to have rolled out as a test to some Android users, which would allow them to adjust the playback speed of a show or series. \u201cWe give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen,\u201d wrote The 40-Year-Old Virgin director. Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul also spoke out against the idea, tweeting that it \u201cwould mean they are completely taking control of everyone else\u2019s art and destroying it. Netflix is far better than that.\u201d The thought of being able to play something faster fills me with horror and not entirely because of the imposition on a film-maker\u2019s artistic vision. It suggests streaming services are trying to expand our tired, bloated, binge-bent minds, so we can accommodate even more entertainment than we ever thought possible. I already feel regular prickles of panic about being behind on absolutely everything and there are only so many must-see series that one can actually see. Allowing them to artificially alter the notion of time so we can stuff ourselves with ever more shows will only encourage them to make even more shows and then our brains will explode. Peter Kyle: he\u2019s not word-perfect and he knows it The Hove and Portslade MP, Peter Kyle, has written about his experience of having acute dyslexia, especially when it comes to communicating with people online, which, naturally, largely relies on the written word. \u201cTwitter can be a pretty unforgiving place for people with unseen challenges,\u201d he said, at the beginning of a long and honest thread explaining that when he got the spelling of \u201cborder\u201d and \u201cboarder\u201d mixed up recently, he had been called \u201cthick\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d and told to resign.

If you stop and ponder it for a minute, it is really something remarkable for the President of the United States to be practicing tax avoidance boldly, in full view of the voting public. The person most responsible for spending our collective tax payments is, himself, so committed to contributing less of his own money to the public till that he is willing to forgo many relaxing weeks in a Midtown penthouse that <a href=\"https://www.travelchannel.com/videos/trump-towers-5-star-bathroom-0175781\">looks</a> like what might happen if King Midas stumbled drunkenly into a Pottery Barn. </p> <p>It takes a very special type of moral fortitude to fly around on your own jumbo jet, bragging about your multi-billion dollar fortune, giving a trillion-dollar tax cut to the rich and ostentatiously dodging income taxes yourself, and then hold rallies in Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana telling lower middle class people that you are on their side. I almost admire it, in the same way that I can almost admire a dog that unabashedly begs for a treat right after chewing your personal possessions to shreds. In both cases, the absolute lack of self-consciousness is amazing to behold for those of us cursed with normal human emotions.</p> <p>I grew up in Florida. Thankfully not in the ghoulish billionaire-infested Palm Beach part of Florida, but Florida nonetheless. It is a beautiful state. Yet the burden now being placed on Floridians is now becoming wholly unreasonable. In order to live there and enjoy the beaches and sunshine, it has always been necessary to tolerate a few natural obstacles: hurricanes; mosquitoes; alligators in the drainage ditch, snakes in the backyard, and jellyfish in the tide pools. Then there are the more man-made dangers: the racist sheriffs; the real estate developers stubbornly building gleaming condo towers on rapidly eroding sand; and, of course, the assholes who moved in from New York.</p> <p>The truth is that Donald Trump will fit right in in Florida. As a rule, rich New Yorkers who move to Florida are jerks. They think that the atmosphere of the Sunshine State is more relaxed, when in fact it is just that the lower population density means fewer people staring menacingly at them when they do something rude. Floridians understand this well. They have built an entire economy on attracting these people with the lure of lower state taxes, and then making up the difference by selling them plots of rattlesnake-infested swampland at unimaginable prices and getting their children addicted to Disney World. Florida, a paradise that exists only because of air conditioners and advertising campaigns, is a scam. It attracts con men. And usually, it cons them too.</p> <p>It is ethically revolting that a sitting US president would rearrange his entire life in order to avoid paying the taxes that fund public goods and services for the citizens that he serves--but then again, there are many ethically revolting things about Donald Trump. It is legitimately concerning that a sitting US president is so mentally incoherent that he would issue a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190375834529468423\">statement</a> attributing his move to the fact that someone poured water on a New York police officer--but we all know that there are many legitimately concerning things about Donald Trump. </p> <p>We can\u2019t go getting upset about every major ethical scandal by a dangerously demented man holding the most powerful position on earth, can we? Of course not. We must be selective. The only takeaway from this Trumpian change of venue that is really worth remarking on is the effect that it will have on Florida itself. The state will now have one more loud, ignorant, pasty New York guy talking Republican politics at the golf club. The more of these people that trickle into the state, the more pissed off all the normal residents get, and the bluer the state turns. </p> <p>Every time a man with a Titleist hat and a Queens accent makes an ignorant remark about immigrants in the checkout line of an Orlando-area Starbucks, the Democratic party in Florida gains a vote. The presence of Donald Trump will amount to this dynamic magnified by a million. Is his self-serving, dishonorable action an affront to good government and moral leadership? Certainly. Is he a big coward who can\u2019t stand the heat of the collective honesty of New Yorkers unafraid to direct obscenities up towards the penthouse of Trump Tower? No doubt about it. And will his irritating, mendacious presence itself be enough to turn a swing state blue in protest? The outlook is promising, yes.</p> <p>It\u2019s not such a bad thing that Trump is relocating now. When he\u2019s evicted from Washington next year, he\u2019ll have somewhere warm to go cry.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hamilton Nolan is a writer based in New York City</p></li> </ul>",

In order to live there and enjoy the beaches and sunshine, it has always been necessary to tolerate a few natural obstacles: hurricanes; mosquitoes; alligators in the drainage ditch, snakes in the backyard, and jellyfish in the tide pools. Then there are the more man-made dangers: the racist sheriffs; the real estate developers stubbornly building gleaming condo towers on rapidly eroding sand; and, of course, the assholes who moved in from New York. The truth is that Donald Trump will fit right in in Florida. As a rule, rich New Yorkers who move to Florida are jerks. They think that the atmosphere of the Sunshine State is more relaxed, when in fact it is just that the lower population density means fewer people staring menacingly at them when they do something rude. Floridians understand this well. They have built an entire economy on attracting these people with the lure of lower state taxes, and then making up the difference by selling them plots of rattlesnake-infested swampland at unimaginable prices and getting their children addicted to Disney World. Florida, a paradise that exists only because of air conditioners and advertising campaigns, is a scam. It attracts con men. And usually, it cons them too. It is ethically revolting that a sitting US president would rearrange his entire life in order to avoid paying the taxes that fund public goods and services for the citizens that he serves--but then again, there are many ethically revolting things about Donald Trump. It is legitimately concerning that a sitting US president is so mentally incoherent that he would issue a statement attributing his move to the fact that someone poured water on a New York police officer--but we all know that there are many legitimately concerning things about Donald Trump. We can\u2019t go getting upset about every major ethical scandal by a dangerously demented man holding the most powerful position on earth, can we? Of course not. We must be selective. The only takeaway from this Trumpian change of venue that is really worth remarking on is the effect that it will have on Florida itself. The state will now have one more loud, ignorant, pasty New York guy talking Republican politics at the golf club. The more of these people that trickle into the state, the more pissed off all the normal residents get, and the bluer the state turns. Every time a man with a Titleist hat and a Queens accent makes an ignorant remark about immigrants in the checkout line of an Orlando-area Starbucks, the Democratic party in Florida gains a vote. The presence of Donald Trump will amount to this dynamic magnified by a million. Is his self-serving, dishonorable action an affront to good government and moral leadership? Certainly. Is he a big coward who can\u2019t stand the heat of the collective honesty of New Yorkers unafraid to direct obscenities up towards the penthouse of Trump Tower? No doubt about it. And will his irritating, mendacious presence itself be enough to turn a swing state blue in protest? The outlook is promising, yes. It\u2019s not such a bad thing that Trump is relocating now. When he\u2019s evicted from Washington next year, he\u2019ll have somewhere warm to go cry. Hamilton Nolan is a writer based in New York City",

Essex police announced on Friday that they believed they knew the nationality of all the victims, having previously suggested that some were of Chinese heritage when the bodies were discovered on 23 October. Eight women and 31 men were discovered in a refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry in an industrial park in Grays. Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for Vietnam\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, said the government was deeply saddened by the incident and wished to extend its heartfelt condolences to the victims\u2019 families. She said the Vietnamese embassy in the UK had been working closely with the British authorities to support families and help identify the victims. Hang said: \u201cVietnam strongly condemns human trafficking and considers it a serious crime subject to strict penalties. \u201cVietnam calls upon countries in the region and around the world to step up cooperation in combating human trafficking in order to prevent the recurrence of such tragedy. \u201cWe are grateful that the British government and other relevant authorities have actively conducted the investigation [and] provided identification information and worked in close coordination with the Vietnamese competent authorities. \u201cWe hope that the British side [will] soon complete the investigation to bring those responsible for this tragedy to justice.\u201d Assistant chief constable Tim Smith said the force was in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK and believed it had identified families for some of the victims. He said the force was awaiting \u201cconfirmatory evidence\u201d in order to present the case to the coroner. Smith added: \u201cThis evidence is being gathered across a number of jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, we cannot at this time announce the identity of any of the victims.\u201d Essex police have initiated extradition proceedings to bring suspect Eamonn Harrison, 22, from Ireland to the UK. Harrison, of Newry in County Down, Northern Ireland, appeared in Dublin high court on Friday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, along with human trafficking and immigration offences, and was remanded in custody. Detectives have also urged Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, said to have links with the road haulage and shipping industries, to hand themselves in. The pair, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. It is understood Ronan Hughes spoke to police shortly after the driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, 25, was arrested following the discovery. Robinson, of Craigavon, Northern Ireland, appeared at Chelmsford magistrates court on Monday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Three other people arrested in connection with the incident \u2013 two men aged 38 and 46, and a 38-year-old woman \u2013 have been released on bail. In Vietnam, local media reported that police in Ha Tinh province had arrested two people in connection with the deaths after launching an investigation into suspected human trafficking of workers. It is still not known how the victims entered the lorry trailer before it travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet in Essex.",

But something more insidious may have also had a hand in pushing Hill out: nude photographs that were intentionally distributed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/28/katie-hill-congress-house-of-representatives-rightwing-media\">shame and humiliate her</a>. If we want more young women to run for office \u2013 and stay there \u2013 the dissemination of nude photos for degradation and revenge is a problem we have to address now.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get this out of the way: Hill\u2019s affair with the campaign staffer was wrong, and by most accounts, including Hill\u2019s, a major error in judgment requiring serious consequences. Yes, affairs with staffers are nearly as old as campaigns themselves, and men have gotten away with this kind of bad behavior for generations. Several of those men remain in Congress, despite actions far more exploitative than Hill\u2019s. But standards are finally changing to recognize that power imbalances in the workplace distort the ability of subordinates to fully consent to a sexual relationship, and make it even more difficult for them to refuse. Women should be held to these higher standards as well. Hill held herself to them when she stepped down.</p> <p>Now that she\u2019s taken responsibility and relinquished her seat, the conversation has to shift to what we can do to make sure that no woman sees her political or professional ambitions dimmed by public sexual humiliation. Hill may have resigned primarily because of the affair, but the publication of her photos crossed a real line, and there\u2019s little doubt that at some point in the not-too-distant future a political operative will shop around nude photos of a female politician he would like to take down, no affair with a staffer necessary. That scenario alone probably intimidates women out of running: according to <a href=\"https://womenrun.rutgers.edu/barriers-to-progress/\">a new report</a> by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, one of the most significant barriers to women running for office is harassment and threats of violence \u2013 particularly sexualized harassment and threats \u2013 and fear of those threats. The publication of intimate photos, or even images photoshopped to look like intimate photos, is part of the system of abuse and harassment that scares women away from public office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/31/politics-nude-video-katie-hill\">I work in politics.

Women whose nude photographs have been published online without their consent have <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/revenge-porn-took-my-career-the-law-couldnt-get-it-bac-1827572768\">lost their jobs</a>. Vengeful and abusive exes have used sexual photos to intimidate and <a href=\"https://www.ordwaylawgroup.com/blog/2014/04/father-threatens-mother-with-revenge-porn-in-child-custody-case.shtml\">threaten mothers</a> in child custody battles. <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/revenge-porn-what-to-do-if-youre-victim\">More than half</a> of survivors of what is now known as \u201crevenge porn\u201d have suicidal thoughts \u2013 and some have indeed <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/dear-revenge-porn-victims-it-gets-better\">died by suicide</a>.</p> <p>Men, of course, can be victims of revenge porn, too. But naked photos don\u2019t damage men\u2019s career prospects nearly as significantly as they do women\u2019s, because men don\u2019t face the same penalties women do for being perceived as sexually licentious. Just look at our president, who has five children with three different women \u2013 can you imagine a woman with that family makeup sitting in the Oval Office? Make the fictional candidate a black woman, and, with the racist, misogynist stereotypes that would be hurled at her, it wouldn\u2019t even approach possibility.</p> <p>The sexual shaming and harassment of women is not new. Nor are nude renderings \u2013 people have been enjoying erotic images for a very long time (perhaps as long as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/erotic-cave-paintings-could-be-37000-years-old-9188709.html\">37,000 years</a>). It\u2019s not the impulse or even the act of making oneself the subject of that erotica that\u2019s novel; it\u2019s the technology. Smartphones have made it normal to document every aspect of our lives, and so those who grew up with them are unsurprisingly also documenting their naked bodies. Smartphones have also made it much easier to keep and disseminate those images even years after they were taken, as opposed to the relative effort it took to retain and then publicize an old Polaroid picture or a VHS tape \u2013 not to mention a cave etching.</p> <p>But while our technology has advanced dramatically, our views of sexual women have been slower to evolve. Men have some leeway to be both sexual and powerful; women do not. Donald Trump\u2019s lurid affairs were met with a shrug when he ran for president, and he has bragged about his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/clinton-trump-second-debate-election-2016/donald-trumps-faulty-vision-of-manhood\">sexual prowess</a> (not to mention sexual assault) to conservative accolades; Scott Brown, who ran against Elizabeth Warren for her Massachusetts Senate seat, posed <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a3118/scott-brown-from-cosmo-to-congress/\">naked in Cosmo</a>. For women, it\u2019s always a choice between sexual or serious.</p> <p>Even when we choose serious, the sexual is always hanging in the background, threatening to be used as a cudgel against us. Online trolls superimpose the faces of powerful women on to the bodies of porn actors. Rightwing media outlets have published nude or semi-nude photos of women and suggested they are prominent young Democrats; with the Hill story, the website RedState went as far as to provide an abusive ex a platform for revenge porn. Last year, the Daily Caller posted an image of a woman in a bathtub, some of her body visible in the faucet\u2019s reflection, under the headline: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/nyregion/ocasio-cortez-fake-nude-photo.html\">Here\u2019s the Photo Some People Described as a Nude Selfie of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> (it wasn\u2019t). Another image making the rounds on pro-Trump Facebook groups <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/feb/26/viral-image/no-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-was-not-photographed-h/\">purported to show</a> Ocasio-Cortez being held up by a young man, spread-eagle and laughing (it wasn\u2019t her). In a secret Facebook group, border patrol agents <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-border-patrol-facebook-group-agents-joke-about-migrant-deaths-post-sexist-memes\">shared a photoshopped image</a> of Ocasio-Cortez giving oral sex to a migrant, with the caption \u201cLucky Illegal Immigrant Glory Hole Special Starring AOC\u201d; another portrayed Donald Trump orally raping her \u2013 something that was supposed to be demeaning to <em>her</em> but flattering to Mr Trump. The website Pornhub features several videos claiming to be secret sex tapes of Ocasio-Cortez (they are not). An entirely innocent video of her dancing to a popular song was released as a smear (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-dance-video.html\">it backfired spectacularly</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"858ea35a2ec5d540f5f0a587f35513c69fcf7f07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/858ea35a2ec5d540f5f0a587f35513c69fcf7f07/0_0_3000_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has faced a series of sexualized smear efforts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has faced a series of sexualized smear efforts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin Scott/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sexualizing women is a tried-and-true way of antagonizing and degrading them. Even though nearly 100% of people will have sex at some point in their lives \u2013 the overwhelming majority before marriage, often with more than one person over the course of one\u2019s life, and usually purely for pleasure \u2013 there remains a pervasive believe that, as the feminist writer <a href=\"https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2975/jessica-valenti-purity-myth/\">Jessica Valenti</a> put it, \u201c[women\u2019s] moral compass lies somewhere between our legs\u201d. Sexual mores have shifted enough that it\u2019s no longer noteworthy if a woman is divorced, unmarried but cohabitating, or single and presumably sexually active. But the second there\u2019s photographic evidence of a sex life, even if those photos were meant to be private and shared only with a partner a woman already trusted enough to have sex with or even marry, and her judgment, morality and dignity are called into question.</p> <p>Women know this. And as we encourage younger women in particular to run for office, how many are looking at the conservative sites that published Katie Hill\u2019s intimate photos and concluding that a selfie they took years earlier may be a lifelong disqualifier \u2013 that they don\u2019t want to risk having their most intimate moments on display to their moms, their neighbors, their colleagues and total strangers? How many are looking at the treatment of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and deciding they don\u2019t want to put their families through that kind of digital abuse?</p> <p>One would hope that self-styled news websites would have the restraint to not publish misogynist harassment and revenge porn, but too many of the conservative ones have demonstrated they don\u2019t. One would hope social media platforms would remove these kinds of images and ban users who post them; they don\u2019t. We can lecture young women about not capturing nude images at all, but that cat got out of the bag a few thousand years ago \u2013 people have always enjoyed sexy images of their paramours, and heaping more sexual shame on women doesn\u2019t solve a problem that is rooted in sexually shaming women.</p> <p>What might solve it: understanding that the non-consensual publication of nude images is a form of sexual abuse and domestic violence, and then creating serious, consistent penalties for people and platforms that distribute those images. This is where Congress should step in to develop thoughtful legislation that aims to curb these abuses, while also protecting publications\u2019 first amendment rights. The rest of us should step back from blaming the victim \u2013 \u201cwhy did she take that photo in the first place?\u201d \u2013 and instead shame and castigate those who engage in such profoundly betraying and misogynist violations. As long as women can be intimidated and humiliated by evidence that we are naked under our clothes, women won\u2019t be equal in politics or anywhere else.</p>",

Let\u2019s get this out of the way: Hill\u2019s affair with the campaign staffer was wrong, and by most accounts, including Hill\u2019s, a major error in judgment requiring serious consequences. Yes, affairs with staffers are nearly as old as campaigns themselves, and men have gotten away with this kind of bad behavior for generations. Several of those men remain in Congress, despite actions far more exploitative than Hill\u2019s. But standards are finally changing to recognize that power imbalances in the workplace distort the ability of subordinates to fully consent to a sexual relationship, and make it even more difficult for them to refuse. Women should be held to these higher standards as well. Hill held herself to them when she stepped down. Now that she\u2019s taken responsibility and relinquished her seat, the conversation has to shift to what we can do to make sure that no woman sees her political or professional ambitions dimmed by public sexual humiliation. Hill may have resigned primarily because of the affair, but the publication of her photos crossed a real line, and there\u2019s little doubt that at some point in the not-too-distant future a political operative will shop around nude photos of a female politician he would like to take down, no affair with a staffer necessary. That scenario alone probably intimidates women out of running: according to a new report by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, one of the most significant barriers to women running for office is harassment and threats of violence \u2013 particularly sexualized harassment and threats \u2013 and fear of those threats. The publication of intimate photos, or even images photoshopped to look like intimate photos, is part of the system of abuse and harassment that scares women away from public office. And among young people, nude photos are a part of life: according to one study, 70% of people age 18-24 had received a nude photo; according to a less-scientific survey of mostly young women by Cosmopolitan, close to 90% had taken one. While taking nude photos is increasingly normal for both men and women, it\u2019s women who suffer disproportionate consequences when those photos are made public. Women whose nude photographs have been published online without their consent have lost their jobs. Vengeful and abusive exes have used sexual photos to intimidate and threaten mothers in child custody battles. More than half of survivors of what is now known as \u201crevenge porn\u201d have suicidal thoughts \u2013 and some have indeed died by suicide. Men, of course, can be victims of revenge porn, too. But naked photos don\u2019t damage men\u2019s career prospects nearly as significantly as they do women\u2019s, because men don\u2019t face the same penalties women do for being perceived as sexually licentious. Just look at our president, who has five children with three different women \u2013 can you imagine a woman with that family makeup sitting in the Oval Office? Make the fictional candidate a black woman, and, with the racist, misogynist stereotypes that would be hurled at her, it wouldn\u2019t even approach possibility. The sexual shaming and harassment of women is not new. Nor are nude renderings \u2013 people have been enjoying erotic images for a very long time (perhaps as long as 37,000 years). It\u2019s not the impulse or even the act of making oneself the subject of that erotica that\u2019s novel; it\u2019s the technology. Smartphones have made it normal to document every aspect of our lives, and so those who grew up with them are unsurprisingly also documenting their naked bodies. Smartphones have also made it much easier to keep and disseminate those images even years after they were taken, as opposed to the relative effort it took to retain and then publicize an old Polaroid picture or a VHS tape \u2013 not to mention a cave etching. But while our technology has advanced dramatically, our views of sexual women have been slower to evolve. Men have some leeway to be both sexual and powerful; women do not. Donald Trump\u2019s lurid affairs were met with a shrug when he ran for president, and he has bragged about his sexual prowess (not to mention sexual assault) to conservative accolades; Scott Brown, who ran against Elizabeth Warren for her Massachusetts Senate seat, posed naked in Cosmo. For women, it\u2019s always a choice between sexual or serious. Even when we choose serious, the sexual is always hanging in the background, threatening to be used as a cudgel against us. Online trolls superimpose the faces of powerful women on to the bodies of porn actors. Rightwing media outlets have published nude or semi-nude photos of women and suggested they are prominent young Democrats; with the Hill story, the website RedState went as far as to provide an abusive ex a platform for revenge porn. Last year, the Daily Caller posted an image of a woman in a bathtub, some of her body visible in the faucet\u2019s reflection, under the headline: Here\u2019s the Photo Some People Described as a Nude Selfie of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (it wasn\u2019t). Another image making the rounds on pro-Trump Facebook groups purported to show Ocasio-Cortez being held up by a young man, spread-eagle and laughing (it wasn\u2019t her). In a secret Facebook group, border patrol agents shared a photoshopped image of Ocasio-Cortez giving oral sex to a migrant, with the caption \u201cLucky Illegal Immigrant Glory Hole Special Starring AOC\u201d; another portrayed Donald Trump orally raping her \u2013 something that was supposed to be demeaning to her but flattering to Mr Trump. The website Pornhub features several videos claiming to be secret sex tapes of Ocasio-Cortez (they are not). An entirely innocent video of her dancing to a popular song was released as a smear (it backfired spectacularly). Sexualizing women is a tried-and-true way of antagonizing and degrading them. Even though nearly 100% of people will have sex at some point in their lives \u2013 the overwhelming majority before marriage, often with more than one person over the course of one\u2019s life, and usually purely for pleasure \u2013 there remains a pervasive believe that, as the feminist writer Jessica Valenti put it, \u201c[women\u2019s] moral compass lies somewhere between our legs\u201d. Sexual mores have shifted enough that it\u2019s no longer noteworthy if a woman is divorced, unmarried but cohabitating, or single and presumably sexually active. But the second there\u2019s photographic evidence of a sex life, even if those photos were meant to be private and shared only with a partner a woman already trusted enough to have sex with or even marry, and her judgment, morality and dignity are called into question. Women know this. And as we encourage younger women in particular to run for office, how many are looking at the conservative sites that published Katie Hill\u2019s intimate photos and concluding that a selfie they took years earlier may be a lifelong disqualifier \u2013 that they don\u2019t want to risk having their most intimate moments on display to their moms, their neighbors, their colleagues and total strangers? How many are looking at the treatment of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and deciding they don\u2019t want to put their families through that kind of digital abuse? One would hope that self-styled news websites would have the restraint to not publish misogynist harassment and revenge porn, but too many of the conservative ones have demonstrated they don\u2019t. One would hope social media platforms would remove these kinds of images and ban users who post them; they don\u2019t. We can lecture young women about not capturing nude images at all, but that cat got out of the bag a few thousand years ago \u2013 people have always enjoyed sexy images of their paramours, and heaping more sexual shame on women doesn\u2019t solve a problem that is rooted in sexually shaming women. What might solve it: understanding that the non-consensual publication of nude images is a form of sexual abuse and domestic violence, and then creating serious, consistent penalties for people and platforms that distribute those images. This is where Congress should step in to develop thoughtful legislation that aims to curb these abuses, while also protecting publications\u2019 first amendment rights. The rest of us should step back from blaming the victim \u2013 \u201cwhy did she take that photo in the first place?\u201d \u2013 and instead shame and castigate those who engage in such profoundly betraying and misogynist violations. As long as women can be intimidated and humiliated by evidence that we are naked under our clothes, women won\u2019t be equal in politics or anywhere else.",

Owusu edited the anthology <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/safe-9781409182634.html\" title=\"\"><em>Safe: On Black British Men Reclaiming Space</em></a> (2019) and is a marketing executive for audio at Penguin Books. </p> <p><strong>How did <em>That Reminds Me</em> come about?</strong><br>I started writing it when I was in a mental health facility last year and I created the character of K to try to understand going through a breakdown. I started writing fragments of memory and initially it was going to be a poetry collection, and then it turned into something different. I sent it to Stormzy\u2019s manager and she loved it. I wanted to convey the symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Before my BPD diagnosis, I just thought I was strange. My emotions were always fluctuating. I was often angry. When I was diagnosed it was a relief. It\u2019s important to share awareness with the people around you so they know what you\u2019re going through. The NHS have been amazing. They saved my life a couple of times.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel attitudes towards men\u2019s mental health are being destigmatised?</strong><br>I think we\u2019re destigmatising particular mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.

I did a lot of thinking and reading about psychoanalysis.</p> <p><strong>What are your early memories?</strong><br>I have happy memories of seven years in foster care in a village in Suffolk. It was a lot of fun. But when my mum collected me and brought me to live with my aunt in Tottenham \u2013 that was traumatic. I remember starting to write stories in year 4. I wrote a 10-page story and the teacher looked at it and said \u201cyour handwriting\u2019s terrible\u201d, then she said it in assembly, and I stopped writing. I did a school talk in east London recently and said, \u201cstand up if you know anyone who has been affected by mental health\u201d, and 200 people stood up and I thought: \u201cWow, I really needed to write this book.\u201d</p> <p><strong>You</strong><strong> write about unconventional families\u2026</strong><br>Family is very important to me as a Ghanaian \u2013 but I wanted to turn what we know as a conventional family on its head. I think it\u2019s hard for parents to see their children as three-dimensional, but I wanted to show how troubled children need to be treated like people.

Norwich! And Chelsea! Having waited since early March for an away win, that little burst of success registered a perfect ten on the Guardian\u2019s patented London Bus-o-meter\u2122. Not only that, it puts an end to talk of UNITED IN CRISIS! Seeing the last time UNITED were IN CRISIS! was the autumn of 1989, all this suggests UNITED aren\u2019t scheduled to be in CRISIS! again until mid-2049 (English civil wars and global water levels notwithstanding). Phew. Some time and space for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to do his job in peace, then!</p> <p><strong>Expectation has been revived by this recent form, not least because Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are clicking. </strong>United have suddenly remembered how good it feels to score more than one goal in a game. History is also on their side today: they\u2019ve won their last four matches against Bournemouth. United are thus expected to make it four wins on the bounce, and keep climbing back towards their accustomed habitat, the upper echelons of the Premier League table.</p> <p><strong>Will the Cherries oblige? </strong>Eddie Howe\u2019s team haven\u2019t won for over a month, since beating Southampton, against whom, well, y\u2019know. Since then, they\u2019ve been knocked out of the League Cup by Burton Albion, and are currently on a three-match run without a single, solitary goal, stretching back to September 28. On the flip side, they can point to their current position in the top half of the Premier League table, and that both their points and goals-for tallies (13 and 13) are exactly the same as today\u2019s more illustrious visitors. And as United have themselves shown, all bad runs come to an end at some point.</p> <p><strong>A goal-fest doesn\u2019t, on balance, look likely. </strong>But who knows in football? You can thank us for tempting fate when they start flying in at both ends.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s your lot. Ben Fisher was on point at Dean Court, and here\u2019s his take on Bournemouth\u2019s victory. Enjoy ... and thanks for reading the MBM! Ole\u2019s view. \u201cWe are disappointed of course, but when you come to places like this, you have to take control of the game. I thought we started really well, but a lack of quality, we couldn\u2019t get a goal. And when the game becomes like it did, the first goal is always going to be important. Every time you concede a goal it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s a bit of magic that wins the game, you\u2019ve got to say that. Maybe I should have started a few others, who knows, but they started the game well so I don\u2019t think it was that. If you want to be challenging for the top four, and moving up the table, you have to win games like this. But I am sure Bournemouth will say that as well.\u201d An extremely content Eddie Howe speaks to BT Sport. \u201cI thought it was a really good game. We were solid and competitive, we looked a real threat. We respected our opponents, but we got over the line. Another clean sheet as well. A great goal, and that would have meant a lot to Joshua King. We didn\u2019t start too well, the first ten minutes, but once we settled we were fine in the game. It was always going to be a game of few chances, but we always looked as though we would score. And we looked quite secure. The two centre halves did really well, Ake and Cook are big players for us.\u201d That\u2019s three clean sheets in a row for Bournemouth, and so Nathan Ake is named man-of-the-match by Steve McManaman on BT Sport. \u201cAfter ten minutes, we started to play really well,\u201d he says. \u201cWe worked very hard for this win, and I think we deserved it. I am very happy with the clean sheet we got.\u201d The match-winner Joshua King adds: \u201cTo get the winning goal is a good feeling. I focused on the goal, lobbed it over with my right foot. I didn\u2019t know whether anyone was there, and hit it cleanly through De Gea\u2019s legs. We know we can score goals, even though there\u2019s been a dry spell.\u201d United started strongly but lost their way midway through the first half and never got their mojo back. Bournemouth deserved their victory, earned by the one moment of true quality in the match, Joshua King\u2019s flick, spin and shot just before the break. It was a finish Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have been proud of himself, though doubtless he won\u2019t appreciate it right now. United\u2019s three-game winning run comes to an end on the south coast. Bournemouth beat them for only the third time in their history ... and move up to sixth in the Premier League as a result! They leapfrog United, who drop to eighth. 90 min +2: Williams races down the left and shifts the ball inside for Lingard, who tries to work space to shoot just outside the Bournemouth box. Lerma closes the door. 90 min +1: Fred has a pop from 20 yards, but it\u2019s straight at Ramsdale. 90 min: Callum Wilson is booked for his brazen attempt to win a free kick on the halfway line. Rightly or wrongly, the referee doesn\u2019t buy it. There will be three minutes of bonus time. 89 min: King and Fraser take turns to dribble upfield, taking the ball as far away from their goal as possible. McTominay tries to return it, but his cross from the right is no good whatsoever. Not too much quality on show right now, but it\u2019s good fun nonetheless. It\u2019s tense at Dean Court! 88 min: A poor defensive header skims off Rico\u2019s head, and that\u2019s a free corner for United out on the right. Maguire meets the set piece, but once again can\u2019t get a header on target. Goal kick to Bournemouth, and they\u2019re not rushing to take it. 86 min: Lindelof crosses from the right. Maguire clanks a header wide left from six yards. His blushes are spared by the offside flag; it wouldn\u2019t have counted anyway. Then Bournemouth make a defensively minded change, replacing Harry Wilson with Lewis Cook. 84 min: Now McTominay bashes a shot into Ramsdale\u2019s arms from distance. United are finally showing some urgency. Should they equalise, Callum Wilson will rue latching onto a long pass that sprung United\u2019s offside trap. He was offside, but dribbled goalwards anyway. Had he left it for King, Bournemouth were in. 83 min: And it nearly pays instant dividend, as Fred swings a ball in from the left. Rico loses it, and it drops to Greenwood, who slams a shot against the right-hand post from close range! 81 min: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer makes his last throw of the dice. Wan-Bissaka and James are replaced by Williams and Greenwood. Lingard is handed a sheet of paper detailing United\u2019s all-new formation. A furrowed brow. Everyone shifts around. 79 min: Another corner for United, out on the left. Young loops it into the mixer, but Ramsdale punches miles clear with confidence. However the visitors are soon coming back at the hosts, and Young earns himself another corner, which he takes. Billing heads clear, then Callum Wilson purchases a cheap free kick by running into McTominay, who is waving his arms around in the semaphore style. 78 min: Rashford and Lingard nearly one-two their way through the Bournemouth back line, but Cook clears just in time. \u201cIf Bournemouth are dressed like AC Milan,\u201d begins fashion\u2019s Peter Oh, \u201cUnited look like Palermo-lite.\u201d 76 min: From the resulting corner, Callum Wilson heads harmlessly wide from close range. A poor miss, though it wouldn\u2019t have counted anyway, as amid a rumble, McTominay had been illegally impeded. 75 min: Callum Wilson tees up his namesake Harry on the edge of the United box. Harry drops a shoulder, shifts the ball towards the right-hand edge of the D, and fizzes a low shot towards the bottom corner. It\u2019s going in, but fingertipped round the post by De Gea. What a save! 73 min: Fraser has the chance to release King down the left but dawdles and is robbed. Then Fred sends a shot towards Plymouth. Not a high-quality moment. 71 min: Lerma tries to thread a shot into the bottom right from an ambitious distance. It bobbles harmlessly wide, and De Gea had it covered in any case. 70 min: Bournemouth half clear the corner, but United are soon coming back at them. Young tears down the left and hooks into the mixer. Ake heads clear, just in time, with Martial lurking. This is better from United, who have turned it up a notch. They needed to. 69 min: Lindelof channels his inner Beckenbauer and strides forward with great purpose, nearly releasing Martial with a sliderule pass. Smith intervenes and hacks out for a corner on the left. 68 min: Harry Wilson looks to curl one into the top left, but gets it all wrong and it flies towards the top-left corner of the stand behind. Awful. Meanwhile United make their first change, replacing Pereira with Lingard. 66 min: Lerma and Callum Wilson combine nicely down the inside-right channel. Wilson looks to lay off to Smith, rushing into the box to his right. Young tugs Smith back just before he enters the area. Young is booked for his cynicism, and he\u2019ll miss the next match. Meanwhile this is a free kick just to the right of the D, and Harry Wilson really fancies it. 64 min: A hectic moment or two. Billing hoicks a ball into the United box from the right. It drops, via a deflection, to Callum Wilson, but the striker can\u2019t poke the ball past a star-jumping De Gea, who blocks. The ball breaks to Harry Wilson, who can\u2019t steer it into the unguarded net. Pereira goes up the other end and has a whack. That\u2019s blocked too. Then Lindelof is booked for clattering into the back of Harry Wilson in midfield. And breathe. 62 min: Fraser slides into James. He comes in from the side, but with excessive force, and he\u2019s late to boot. Into the book he goes. 61 min: Martial nearly bustles his way past Ake, chasing a pass straight down the middle. Ake does very well to stand firm, just as it looks as though Martial might nip through, and hooks clear. That was a good battle. 59 min: McTominay tries to take a quick free kick, and King cynically gets in the way. The referee\u2019s in a good mood, because he stops short of booking the goalscorer for his sauce. Just a quiet word. 57 min: Pereira has a dig from distance. Ramsdale turns the ball away from the bottom-left corner, a fine save. United then win a corner, which is wasted. A little bit better from the visitors, who haven\u2019t really got going in this second half. 55 min: Cook is booked for a wild slide through Rashford on the halfway line. That was needlessly aggressive, arguably out of control, and the Bournemouth defender can count himself lucky the referee didn\u2019t brandish red. He\u2019s fortunate Rashford had the wit to jump out of the road, because if his feet were planted that could have been very ugly. 54 min: Pereira tries to release Martial down the inside left, but his ball skims off the wet surface and out for a goal kick. Martial had no chance of catching that. \u201cIs this the same Man U that beat my team in Cup?\u201d wonders Paul Sinclair. \u201cOle needs to stick to a system plus give Rashford and Martital more freedom.\u201d 53 min: Ramsdale shanks the ball out of play under pressure from Martial. United are gifted good field position, but do little with it, McTominay wafting a weak shot goalwards that\u2019s easily charged down by Lerma. 51 min: A better pass down the inside-right channel by Billing for Harry Wilson, and Bournemouth are in. But it\u2019s behind Wilson, and the move putters out. United were light at the back there, and got away with one. 50 min: United, so entertaining when playing at speed last week in Norwich, have slowed down to a crawl. They\u2019re going nowhere. All very sluggish. 49 min: Harry Wilson and Smith triangulate deliciously down the right. Wilson hooks long for Fraser, racing in from the other flank. Fraser leaps, shapes and guides a volley goalwards. It\u2019s straight into De Gea\u2019s midriff. A shame for the purists, because that would have been a picture-book goal. 47 min: King races after a long ball down the left. He nearly gets the better of a leaden Lindelof, but the defender does just enough to guide the ball back to De Gea, who wallops clear. Bournemouth get the second half underway! No half-time changes ... although the weather\u2019s a lot better. No rain. And everyone in nice new dry kit, too. Half-time reading. Get ready for the 3pm kick-offs with our match previews. That\u2019s the end of Bournemouth\u2019s goal drought, then. Appropriately enough, given the conditions. They trot off soaked to the bone, but feeling all warm inside. ... so having said that, a moment of great quality! Smith dinks a cross into the United box from the right. King chests it down on the edge of the six-yard box with his back to goal and Wan-Bissaka right behind him. King dinks the ball over his own head, spins, leans back, and lashes past De Gea! What a fine finish! Although the collective defending by Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof and Maguire, statuesque to a man, wasn\u2019t all that great. 43 min: The wind is playing havoc. Ball control is at a premium right now. They should replace the TV commentary with a symphony for swanee whistle. 41 min: The wind\u2019s swirling about, and so is the ball. It doesn\u2019t make for classic viewing. 39 min: Pereira needlessly bundles Lerma to the ground, and it\u2019s a free kick for Bournemouth out on the right. The free kick finds Harry Wilson on the edge of the box, but his fierce shot is well blocked by one of those ecru shirts. 37 min: It\u2019s all got a bit scrappy. So with nothing much going on, the home crowd give Martial pelters, accusing the forward of diving back there in the hope of winning a penalty. All pantomime stuff. 35 min: It\u2019s not much of a ruck, to be honest. Nobody throws hands. But the pushing and shoving earns both Lerma and Fred a yellow card. That\u2019s earned Lerma a suspension. The resulting corner\u2019s a non-event. 33 min: Rashford and Martial combine neatly down the inside-left channel. Martial tries to break into the box for a shot. Lerma steps across him and flicks the ball out for a corner. Martial wants a penalty, but doesn\u2019t get one. Martial and Lerma lock horns, at which point a melee erupts. Wahey! 31 min: Billing tries to release Fraser down the left, but the pass is overhit and useless. Fraser is repeatedly finding some good positions; it\u2019s a shame for Bournemouth that his teammates can\u2019t find him. 30 min: A tempest rages for a couple of minutes. It dies down, and suddenly the garden-variety driving rain doesn\u2019t seem so bad. 28 min: King nearly finds Fraser again, but the Bournemouth wide man can\u2019t break through Lindelof\u2019s challenge. Had he done so, he\u2019d have been through on goal. This is better from the home side, who haven\u2019t caused United too many problems otherwise. 27 min: Bournemouth take their first shot in anger. A long punt down the right frees King into space. He swivels and finds Fraser, in acres down the inside-left channel. Fraser enters the box, and should do much better than whistling an effort straight into De Gea\u2019s chest. 25 min: Bournemouth string a few passes together. Much better from the home side. Suddenly Fraser turns on the jets down the left, and wins a corner. He then wastes it with an easy-to-read delivery. United clear. 23 min: Young challenges Smith hard from behind. No free kick, which annoys the crowd. Rashford takes off down the other end, and nearly works himself space to shoot on the edge of the box. Not quite. The Bournemouth faithful continue to give it some, while Eddie Howe has a full and frank exchange of views with the fourth official. 21 min: Pereira\u2019s free kick is abysmal. But so is Cook\u2019s clearance. The ball drops to James, to the right of the D. He hits a first-time riser towards the top right ... but it flies inches wide. So close to the opener. 20 min: James purchases a cheap free kick from a clumsy Fraser as he whizzes down the right. A free kick in a dangerous position. Essentially a corner. From which ... 19 min: But James is quickly coming back at Bournemouth, and earns another corner, off Rico. Pereira\u2019s aimless corner is easily cleared. 18 min: Rashford bombs down the left. After performing a couple of cute stepovers, he pulls one back for Fred, who pearls goalwards. His shot is deflected out for a corner, from which nothing occurs. 16 min: United make a meal of clearing the corner. Fraser tries to force his way through a thicket of players, and falls over near Maguire. The crowd want a penalty, chanting \u201cVAR! VAR!\u201d but the ref\u2019s having none of it, and anyway it looked like the Bournemouth man handled as he went over. 15 min: Harry Wilson makes a nuisance of himself down the right. He cuts into the box, one-twoing with Smith, then shoots from a tight angle. The ball\u2019s deflected out, off Lindelof, for a corner on the right. 14 min: Callum Wilson tears down the left. He crosses long for Lerma, who prepares to shoot from the edge of the box. But the ball takes an age to drop, and by the time he\u2019s pelting it goalwards, Maguire is right in his face to block. Harry Wilson tries to keep the move going, but turns out the chance is gone. 12 min: Fred is down, having taken an accidental whack in the face by Billing. Poor Phil. He\u2019s up and about again soon enough. 10 min: You can\u2019t blame them for slipping and sliding all over the shop, mind. It is a thoroughly rank day. The rain is sheeting down. 8 min: For the third time, already, James rips down the right. He loops long for Fred, who makes like Pereira did a few minutes back. If United\u2019s midfielders stop falling over, someone\u2019s going to connect soon and belt one into the net. 7 min: James goes on another unchallenged run down the right. Where\u2019s Rico? James lays off for Pereira, who lashes a high, wild shot over the bar from a tight angle. 6 min: Callum Wilson surges through the middle and tries to release Harry Wilson down the left. His ball down the flank isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s anticipated by Wan-Bissaka who intercepts and sets United off on the counter. Martial has a whack from distance, but the shot dribbles into Ramsdale\u2019s arms. 5 min: United look confident. That\u2019s what three away wins on the spin can do. They\u2019re pinging it around nicely. Crisp, speedy and fresh. Bournemouth can\u2019t get a sniff at the minute. 3 min: Martial plays a lovely ball around the corner to set James skittering down the right. James cuts a lovely low ball back for Pereira, who misses his kick from the edge of the box and falls over, aquaplaning across the wet turf. Slapstick stuff, but that was a lovely incisive move by United, performed at breakneck speed. 2 min: All a bit scrappy in the early stages, as both sets of players find their feet and get used to the conditions. And we\u2019re off! United get the ball rolling. A cracking atmosphere on the south coast, despite the awful weather. It\u2019s teeming down. And the wind\u2019s up too. Not an ideal day for defenders. And immediately a long punt by Ramsdale confuses Maguire. Fortunately for the big man, the flag goes up for offside, Callum Wilson having gone far too early. The teams are out! Bournemouth wear their stylish Milan-inspired red-and-black stripes, forcing United into a change strip of what looks suspiciously like ecru, a shade made famous by the likes of Robbie Fowler, Stan Collymore and Jason McAteer. I know United\u2019s travails post-Fergie have been compared to Liverpool\u2019s early-to-mid-90s decline, but this is taking things to extremes. Whatever next? Cream suits? What a pretty pass. Anyway, it\u2019s lashing down at Dean Court. We\u2019ll be off in a minute, after a moment\u2019s silent reflection ahead of Remembrance Day. ... and now BT Sport talk to Eddie Howe. \u201cUnlike us, we\u2019ve not been at our best in the attacking third in the last three games. Hopefully that\u2019ll change today while we keep the defensive solidity that\u2019s served us well. We\u2019re going to need everybody to get a result against Manchester United, the crowd, the players. We\u2019ll have to manage the conditions. Starting well is really important. We\u2019re certainly looking forward to the game.\u201d A pre-match chat with Ole. \u201cIt\u2019s not been as bad as everyone thought it has been, and it\u2019s probably not as great as everyone thinks it is now. You just have to be focused and take your chances. At the moment we\u2019re confident. We have loads of running power and pace, we\u2019ll create chances against any team. Bournemouth have top centre forwards and good delivery down either side. We need to defend properly, and we need to start well.\u201d Weather report. Just the one change to the Bournemouth team that served up a goalless draw with Watford last weekend. Harry Wilson comes in for Arnaut Groeneveld. Manchester United meanwhile are in if-it-ain\u2019t-broke mode. They name the same XI sent out to beat Norwich City 3-1 last Sunday. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Smith, Steve Cook, Ake, Rico, Fraser, Lerma, Billing, Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson, King. Subs: Boruc, Francis, Solanke, Danjuma, Lewis Cook, Kelly, Mepham. Manchester United: de Gea, Wan Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Young, McTominay, Fred, James, Andreas Pereira, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Mata, Lingard, Rojo, Romero, Greenwood, Garner, Williams. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). That was a hell of a seven days for Manchester United. Wins at Partizan Belgrade! Norwich! And Chelsea! Having waited since early March for an away win, that little burst of success registered a perfect ten on the Guardian\u2019s patented London Bus-o-meter\u2122. Not only that, it puts an end to talk of UNITED IN CRISIS! Seeing the last time UNITED were IN CRISIS! was the autumn of 1989, all this suggests UNITED aren\u2019t scheduled to be in CRISIS! again until mid-2049 (English civil wars and global water levels notwithstanding). Phew. Some time and space for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to do his job in peace, then! Expectation has been revived by this recent form, not least because Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are clicking. United have suddenly remembered how good it feels to score more than one goal in a game. History is also on their side today: they\u2019ve won their last four matches against Bournemouth. United are thus expected to make it four wins on the bounce, and keep climbing back towards their accustomed habitat, the upper echelons of the Premier League table. Will the Cherries oblige? Eddie Howe\u2019s team haven\u2019t won for over a month, since beating Southampton, against whom, well, y\u2019know. Since then, they\u2019ve been knocked out of the League Cup by Burton Albion, and are currently on a three-match run without a single, solitary goal, stretching back to September 28. On the flip side, they can point to their current position in the top half of the Premier League table, and that both their points and goals-for tallies (13 and 13) are exactly the same as today\u2019s more illustrious visitors. And as United have themselves shown, all bad runs come to an end at some point. A goal-fest doesn\u2019t, on balance, look likely. But who knows in football? You can thank us for tempting fate when they start flying in at both ends. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Charli XCX is a fascinating study in self-belief. Backlit, she strikes an attitude in front of an illuminated cube, bookended by more lighting. There is no band: just her, dressed a bit like a flamenco aerobics instructor. A gauzy train streams behind her, which she regularly whips for emphasis when she\u2019s not pummelling the air with her fists.</p> <p>She cuts even more of a solitary figure because her last album, third outing <em>Charli</em>, contained multitudes. There were so many guest features, you suspected the artist born Charlotte Aitchison in Cambridgeshire 27 years ago was trying to make an ironic point about the current rash of pop hook-ups \u2013 a predilection acquired from hip-hop. That, or she was just revelling in excess, a familiar habit for an artist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM33anTtEVE\" title=\"\">for whom the party never seems to end</a>.</p> <p>There are 15 guests on <em>Charli</em>. None of them are in Birmingham, but all are thanked in a recorded message at the start of the gig. It\u2019s worth listing them in full for the breadth of styles they encompass: French visionary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/christine-and-the-queens\" title=\"\">Christine and the Queens</a>, Los Angeles pop outrider <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skyferreira\" title=\"\">Sky Ferreira</a>, positivity powerhouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lizzo\" title=\"\">Lizzo</a>, soft rock auteurs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/haim\" title=\"\">Haim</a>, out pop pin-up <a href=\"https://www.troyesivan.com/\" title=\"\">Troye Sivan</a>, trans electropop singer <a href=\"https://kimpetras.com/\" title=\"\">Kim Petras</a>, Estonian mischief-maker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr92AKSfMI-quMa2UGcvWvg\" title=\"\">Tommy Cash</a>, bedroom-pop arriviste <a href=\"https://www.clairo.com/\" title=\"\">Clairo</a>, Korean-American electronic producer <a href=\"http://yaeji.com/\" title=\"\">Yaeji</a>, New Orleans bounce star <a href=\"http://www.bigfreedia.com/\" title=\"\">Big Freedia</a>, rapper <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cupcakkeafreakk\" title=\"\">Cupcakke</a>, sex-obsessed singer-rapper <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brookecandy\" title=\"\">Brooke Candy</a> and Brazilian rapper <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pabllovittar/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Pabllo Vittar</a>. Aitchison also thanks AG Cook, who produced <em>Charli</em> with her.</p> <p>So: how do you tour one of the most populous albums of 2019, a work not explicitly, but still quite clearly about female solidarity and LGBTQ+ acceptance, without the album\u2019s unique selling point \u2013 a posse? By having the brass neck to do it entirely solo.

      "bodyText": "Charli XCX is a fascinating study in self-belief. Backlit, she strikes an attitude in front of an illuminated cube, bookended by more lighting. There is no band: just her, dressed a bit like a flamenco aerobics instructor. A gauzy train streams behind her, which she regularly whips for emphasis when she\u2019s not pummelling the air with her fists. She cuts even more of a solitary figure because her last album, third outing Charli, contained multitudes. There were so many guest features, you suspected the artist born Charlotte Aitchison in Cambridgeshire 27 years ago was trying to make an ironic point about the current rash of pop hook-ups \u2013 a predilection acquired from hip-hop. That, or she was just revelling in excess, a familiar habit for an artist for whom the party never seems to end. There are 15 guests on Charli. None of them are in Birmingham, but all are thanked in a recorded message at the start of the gig. It\u2019s worth listing them in full for the breadth of styles they encompass: French visionary Christine and the Queens, Los Angeles pop outrider Sky Ferreira, positivity powerhouse Lizzo, soft rock auteurs Haim, out pop pin-up Troye Sivan, trans electropop singer Kim Petras, Estonian mischief-maker Tommy Cash, bedroom-pop arriviste Clairo, Korean-American electronic producer Yaeji, New Orleans bounce star Big Freedia, rapper Cupcakke, sex-obsessed singer-rapper Brooke Candy and Brazilian rapper Pabllo Vittar. Aitchison also thanks AG Cook, who produced Charli with her. So: how do you tour one of the most populous albums of 2019, a work not explicitly, but still quite clearly about female solidarity and LGBTQ+ acceptance, without the album\u2019s unique selling point \u2013 a posse? By having the brass neck to do it entirely solo. Aitchison plays the new album virtually in its entirety, with only volume and charisma to accompany her. She does have some company towards the end, though. Each stop on this jaunt has featured a handful of local drag queens, who cavort around the stage for Shake It, one of the album\u2019s strangest, most deconstructed noise experiments. It has taken Aitchison some time to distil her essence. Her canon contains bona fide hits (some, like 2014\u2019s Boom Clap, now retired), many standalone singles (like 2018\u2019s near-perfect Boys, played tonight), umpteen co-writes, a few EPs (2017\u2019s Vroom Vroom marked a turning point), a handful of mixtapes and two previous studio albums. But Charli marks peak Aitchison \u2013 an album of resonant, sad bangers that gives both Robyn and Mark Ronson a run for their money, and which ranks up there with Lana Del Rey in chronicling a version of LA, one where car engines and loud parties and \u201cblue and yellow pills\u201d can\u2019t quite drown out the whirl of the abyss inside. Aitchison makes a little speech about this being the music she has always wanted to make, and although the onstage effusions of pop stars can become wearing with repetition, this one rings true. She began her career as a home counties teen prodigy who decamped to LA and spent years wrangling with the pop sausage machine, eventually emerging with artistic control and rekindled success on her own terms. She sings with a British accent. Sigrid wrote Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe about being pushed around by older male operatives; Aitchison has been fighting that corner for years, bristling since 2013\u2019s True Romance. She has written for others, hiding behind the scenes. Most lately, she has turned to A&amp;R.

When Aitchison connected with a cadre of London leftfield producers like Sophie and AG Cook, working as the label PC Music (PVC music would have been a better name, given their productions all sounded like lurex rubbing against polyvinyl chloride), two disruptive imperatives chimed.

This is <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/bridget-riley\" title=\"\">Bridget Riley</a>\u2019s signature, tucked modestly round the edge of the canvas, and about the only aspect of her work that never changes. At 88, Riley is still finding new ways to dazzle and exhilarate the eyes and mind with the slenderest of means, each canvas a sustained revelation from a mind that remains forever young.</p> <p>Take a recent work from her <em>Measure for Measure</em> series. At a distance, the coloured discs on the white substrate scintillate like sequins, even in their muted tones of purple, green and brown. Walk closer and the picture performs a new magic. Green dances against purple, which sparks against brown, until the discs seem to jump and shiver; each leaving an afterimage, moreover, where the whole surface seems alive with the glistening patter of raindrops on water.</p> <p>A fourth colour appears in the next version: dull turquoise \u2013 and yet the day brightens.

This is Bridget Riley\u2019s signature, tucked modestly round the edge of the canvas, and about the only aspect of her work that never changes. At 88, Riley is still finding new ways to dazzle and exhilarate the eyes and mind with the slenderest of means, each canvas a sustained revelation from a mind that remains forever young. Take a recent work from her Measure for Measure series. At a distance, the coloured discs on the white substrate scintillate like sequins, even in their muted tones of purple, green and brown. Walk closer and the picture performs a new magic. Green dances against purple, which sparks against brown, until the discs seem to jump and shiver; each leaving an afterimage, moreover, where the whole surface seems alive with the glistening patter of raindrops on water. A fourth colour appears in the next version: dull turquoise \u2013 and yet the day brightens. The painting has its own weather. This is a marvel considering all you\u2019re looking at is an array of drab discs on white paint; more extraordinary still, that radiance seems to float free, transmitting its light to another work hanging alongside.

We think it\u2019s unnecessary, we think it\u2019s pollutive of ground water systems, and also all the evidence from Preston New Road in Lancashire is it\u2019s actually dangerous and has caused serious earth tremors.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, described the announcement as \u201ca bit of a distraction\u201d. \u201cA moratorium is half a step in the right direction, but at the end of the day this is a government that has abolished the [Department of Energy and Climate Change] and has been making it harder and preventing on-shore wind farms being built,\u201d she said. The interventions came after the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, made it clear that the moratorium was only in place \u201cuntil the science changes\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment but we\u2019ve always been clear that we will follow the science \u2026 the Oil and Gas Authority is one of the world\u2019s best regulators and they have said to us that we cannot be certain that shale gas can be extracted safely,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Asked why a permanent ban was not being imposed, she replied: \u201cBecause this is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom, but we will follow the science. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking to see now is the exploration that Cuadrilla have carried out at Preston New Road, there will be some reports of what the potential is from those wells. So we will have better information in the future once that data has been assessed.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is quite clear that we can\u2019t be certain. The science isn\u2019t accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate and therefore unless, and until we can be absolutely certain we are imposing a moratorium.\u201d Claire Stephenson from Frack Free Lancashire welcomed the end of the government\u2019s \u201cgratuitous\u201d support for fracking. \u201cOur position, however, is unchanged. We believe that only an outright ban is appropriate to protect the residents and the communities they live in, and our campaign will actively continue until one is implemented,\u201d she said. Susan Holliday, the chair of the Preston New Action Group, also called for a total ban. \u201cThe earthquakes in August were felt by thousands of people. It must be clear from this that the Fylde coast is just not suitable for fracking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt must be a huge relief for those communities that are currently under the threat of planning applications for fracking, knowing that they will now no longer need to go through what we have.\u201d Friends of the Earth\u2019s chief executive, Craig Bennett, hailed the move as a \u201ctremendous victory\u201d but urged the passage of new laws to enshrine an outright ban on fracking. \u201cWe must now ensure that legislation is passed so that the ban is made permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t stop with banning fracking here if we are going to avoid catastrophic climate change. Time is running out. The UK must stop funding fracking abroad and we must leave all fossil fuels in the ground.\u201d The Green party co-leader Si\u00e2n Berry tweeted: \u201cBanning fracking is for life, not just for Christmas.\u201d",

It is this inclusive attitude that can make single-night music events work well for a cinema audience, Corbijn believes.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, it is still fantastic to see a live concert, but not everyone can. And this is a way of getting some return on your money after a tour, now that fewer DVDs are being sold,\u201d he said. \u201cNick Cave did it, Coldplay did it and Metallica have just done it, so it is a new way to make live concert films feel live again.\u201d</p> <p>The limited cinematic release strategy \u2013 in this case courtesy of Trafalgar Releasing, which also regularly brings ballet and opera performances to the big screen \u2013 does seem to encourage fans to organise tickets for a communal event. Heavy-metal veterans Metallica banked a record-breaking \u00a34.3m last month on just the first night of a two-date run when Trafalgar released their latest concert film, <em>S&amp;M\u00b2</em>, bringing audiences the band\u2019s recent reunion show with the San Francisco Symphony orchestra.

Yet he is not tempted to return to looking at the backstage life of the stars, he said.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Control </em>was such a one-off for me, and then suddenly everybody sent me scripts about other dead singers, like Jeff Buckley, Kurt Cobain and Marvin Gaye. I\u2019ve worked with Depeche for decades now and they are different to any other band. In the late 80s, I realised my visuals and their sound go together really well. It all grew organically, with no big meetings or negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>Corbijn, 64, also suspects that Depeche Mode\u2019s fanbase is distinct from other bands\u2019 because \u201cthey all feel they are members of a big club\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Depeche has something cult-like about them, so the concert experience is special</p> <footer> <cite>Anton Corbijn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the Dutch-born director\u2019s treatment of their 115-date Global Spirit tour is appropriately centred on the fans\u2019 experience. It focuses on the stories of six devoted followers of the band who have travelled from as far afield as Colombia and Mongolia for the gig at Berlin\u2019s Waldb\u00fchne (Forest Stage) stadium.</p> <p>\u201cIt is amazing that Depeche Mode can touch so many people\u2019s lives. These fans have very diverse stories and diverse cultures, so we set about a plan to film them in their own environments and then bring them all together for the concert,\u201d said Corbijn.</p> <p>All six were inveterate Depeche Mode fans with moving personal stories. Five had already seen them play live but one, a young Mongolian tour guide, had never left her own country before.</p> <p>Corbijn suspects the band\u2019s grip on the imagination of such a disparate group is down to the lyrics of guitarist Martin Gore\u2019s songs. \u201cThe themes of Martin\u2019s songs connect a lot with people who feel they need guidance, or perhaps a helping hand,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The group, which came to fame in the electronic pop boom of the 1980s, has been through many style transformations but has somehow kept a strong emotional bond with fans. This, for Corbijn, makes Depeche Mode the perfect performers for a cinema event.</p> <p>\u201cDepeche has something cult-like about them, so the concert experience is special,\u201d said the director, who designs the stage sets and also works with U2. \u201cDepeche put out an album every four years or so and have a tour, but that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t see them on chat shows. They are sort of reclusive. Other bands, like U2, don\u2019t have quite that same cult feeling because they are very open and talk about everything.\u201d</p>",

And this is a way of getting some return on your money after a tour, now that fewer DVDs are being sold,\u201d he said. \u201cNick Cave did it, Coldplay did it and Metallica have just done it, so it is a new way to make live concert films feel live again.\u201d The limited cinematic release strategy \u2013 in this case courtesy of Trafalgar Releasing, which also regularly brings ballet and opera performances to the big screen \u2013 does seem to encourage fans to organise tickets for a communal event. Heavy-metal veterans Metallica banked a record-breaking \u00a34.3m last month on just the first night of a two-date run when Trafalgar released their latest concert film, S&amp;M\u00b2, bringing audiences the band\u2019s recent reunion show with the San Francisco Symphony orchestra. And next week pop music fans in 60 countries will be able to catch Colombian singer Shakira in a film shot on her El Dorado world tour. Corbijn, initially a noted photographer, won acclaim in 2007 for Control, his film drama about the troubled life of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis. Yet he is not tempted to return to looking at the backstage life of the stars, he said. \u201cControl was such a one-off for me, and then suddenly everybody sent me scripts about other dead singers, like Jeff Buckley, Kurt Cobain and Marvin Gaye. I\u2019ve worked with Depeche for decades now and they are different to any other band. In the late 80s, I realised my visuals and their sound go together really well. It all grew organically, with no big meetings or negotiations.\u201d Corbijn, 64, also suspects that Depeche Mode\u2019s fanbase is distinct from other bands\u2019 because \u201cthey all feel they are members of a big club\u201d. And the Dutch-born director\u2019s treatment of their 115-date Global Spirit tour is appropriately centred on the fans\u2019 experience. It focuses on the stories of six devoted followers of the band who have travelled from as far afield as Colombia and Mongolia for the gig at Berlin\u2019s Waldb\u00fchne (Forest Stage) stadium. \u201cIt is amazing that Depeche Mode can touch so many people\u2019s lives. These fans have very diverse stories and diverse cultures, so we set about a plan to film them in their own environments and then bring them all together for the concert,\u201d said Corbijn. All six were inveterate Depeche Mode fans with moving personal stories. Five had already seen them play live but one, a young Mongolian tour guide, had never left her own country before. Corbijn suspects the band\u2019s grip on the imagination of such a disparate group is down to the lyrics of guitarist Martin Gore\u2019s songs. \u201cThe themes of Martin\u2019s songs connect a lot with people who feel they need guidance, or perhaps a helping hand,\u201d he said. The group, which came to fame in the electronic pop boom of the 1980s, has been through many style transformations but has somehow kept a strong emotional bond with fans. This, for Corbijn, makes Depeche Mode the perfect performers for a cinema event. \u201cDepeche has something cult-like about them, so the concert experience is special,\u201d said the director, who designs the stage sets and also works with U2. \u201cDepeche put out an album every four years or so and have a tour, but that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t see them on chat shows. They are sort of reclusive. Other bands, like U2, don\u2019t have quite that same cult feeling because they are very open and talk about everything.\u201d",

Was harried mercilessly by Bok back row. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Youngs </strong>The scrum-half was unable to make any sniping runs but kicked well in the face of the ever\u2011present Bok back row. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Mako Vunipola </strong>He made some strong carries in the first half but had a less than comfortable 45 minutes in the scrums. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Jamie George</strong> A couple of throws at the lineouts went astray but he was strong in the loose on a difficult day for England\u2019s front row. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Kyle Sinckler</strong> The prop\u2019s third-minute collision with Itoje and Mapimpi knocked him cold. He and England could not recover. <strong>n/a</strong></p> <p><strong>Maro Itoje</strong> Could never emulate his stellar display against the All Blacks. A good display in the set piece in trying circumstances. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Courtney Lawes</strong> The lock made some telling breaks when England battered away at the Boks\u2019 tryline just before the break. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Tom Curry </strong>Another mature display that belied his years with a huge hit on Pollard that led to a penalty. Worked tirelessly. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Sam Underhill</strong> Before being replaced by Mark Wilson he made a number of thumping tackles and looked strong in rare forays with ball. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Billy Vunipola</strong> The blood pouring from a patched-up head wound was symbolic of heroic effort in lost cause from side\u2019s best forward. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Replacements: Dan Cole</strong> (for Sinckler, 3) Hard and long shift <strong>5</strong>, <strong>George Kruis</strong> (for Lawes, ht) Steadied lineout <strong>6</strong>, <strong>Joe Marler</strong> (for M Vunipola, 45) Strong in scrum <strong>6</strong>, <strong>Henry Slade</strong> (for Ford, 49) Decent contribution <strong>6</strong>, <strong>Luke Cowan-Dickie</strong> (for George, 59) <strong>6</strong>, <strong>Mark Wilson</strong> (for Underhill, 59) <strong>6</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Joseph</strong> (for May, 70) <strong>n/a</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/02/england-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-final-match-report\">Rugby World Cup: South Africa surge to glory as England fall short</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>South Africa</h2> <p><strong>Willie le Roux </strong>The full-back was very safe under any high balls that England could rain down on him.

When he did showed a Jason Robinson\u2011esque ability to find space from nowhere. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Lukhanyo Am</strong> He looked very sharp and played a big part in the Mapimpi try. Like his centre partner was very strong in defence. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Damian de Allende </strong>Wales\u2019s nemesis made a couple of powerful runs but was generally confined to a part in a stifling defensive effort. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Makazole Mapimpi </strong>However dubious the first try was, South Africa\u2019s top try\u2011scorer in Japan took it superbly. Always a danger. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Handr\u00e9 Pollard</strong> Recovered from missing a second-minute penalty to convert 22 points, points that put the Boks beyond reach. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Faf de Klerk </strong>Was his usual effervescent self behind a dominant scrum and kicked well into places England did not want the ball to go. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Tendai Mtawarira </strong>The Beast was a real menace in the scrum, giving replacement Dan Cole a rocky ride. Very strong all-round display. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Mbongeni Mbonambi</strong> The hooker lasted only 20 minutes before he was injured in a tackle by Courtney Lawes and replaced by Malcolm Marx. <strong>n/a</strong></p> <p><strong>Frans Malherbe</strong> The tighthead was part of a front row that for the first half helped squeeze the life out of the England pack. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Eben Etzebeth</strong> For an hour was a real handful for the English pack despite having treatment for a shoulder injury. Back to his best. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Lood de Jager</strong> The Bulls lock left the field at the start of the second quarter in great pain from a shoulder injury but the Springboks coped. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Siya Kolisi (capt) </strong>Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar was there to see another captain in a No 6 shirt lift the Webb Ellis Cup. Led the team superbly for 64 minutes. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Pieter-Steph du Toit</strong> The converted lock followed his exceptional game against Wales with another brutal display, not giving Ford room to breathe. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Duane Vermeulen</strong> Like the two Bok locks, the No 8 had treatment for a shoulder injury in a ferocious first half and made some big carries. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Replacements: Malcolm Marx</strong> (for Mbonambi, 21) Big impact <strong>7</strong>, <strong>Franco Mostert</strong> (for De Jager, 21) Shored up scrum <strong>7</strong>, <strong>Steven Kitshoff </strong>(for Mtawarira , 44) Strong in the scrum <strong>7</strong>, <strong>Vincent Koch</strong> (for Malherbe, 44) Powerful <strong>7</strong>, <strong>Fran\u00e7ois Louw</strong> (for Kolisi, 64) Big tackles <strong>6</strong>, <strong>Fran\u00e7ois Steyn</strong> (for Le Roux, 67) <strong>6</strong>, <strong>Herschel Jantjies</strong> (for De Klerk, 77) <strong>n/a</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "England Elliot Daly A difficult day when he was craning his neck as the aerial bombardment rained down but a tidy display. 6 Anthony Watson The Bath wing looked a danger on the odd occasion he escaped South Africa\u2019s shackles and has improved match by match. 5 Manu Tuilagi The match-winner against the All Blacks made a couple of muscular breaks but was mainly confined to defensive duties. 6 Owen Farrell His four penalties kept England in it until the sky fell in. He tackled tirelessly but unable to exert his usual authority. 6 Jonny May The good news was he kept Cheslin Kolbe under wraps. The bad news was he never had a sight of the tryline himself. 6 George Ford Ford has been one of England\u2019s best players in Japan but it was an unhappy ending. Was harried mercilessly by Bok back row. 5 Ben Youngs The scrum-half was unable to make any sniping runs but kicked well in the face of the ever\u2011present Bok back row. 5 Mako Vunipola He made some strong carries in the first half but had a less than comfortable 45 minutes in the scrums. 6 Jamie George A couple of throws at the lineouts went astray but he was strong in the loose on a difficult day for England\u2019s front row. 6 Kyle Sinckler The prop\u2019s third-minute collision with Itoje and Mapimpi knocked him cold. He and England could not recover. n/a Maro Itoje Could never emulate his stellar display against the All Blacks. A good display in the set piece in trying circumstances. 6 Courtney Lawes The lock made some telling breaks when England battered away at the Boks\u2019 tryline just before the break. 5 Tom Curry Another mature display that belied his years with a huge hit on Pollard that led to a penalty. Worked tirelessly. 6 Sam Underhill Before being replaced by Mark Wilson he made a number of thumping tackles and looked strong in rare forays with ball. 6 Billy Vunipola The blood pouring from a patched-up head wound was symbolic of heroic effort in lost cause from side\u2019s best forward. 7 Replacements: Dan Cole (for Sinckler, 3) Hard and long shift 5, George Kruis (for Lawes, ht) Steadied lineout 6, Joe Marler (for M Vunipola, 45) Strong in scrum 6, Henry Slade (for Ford, 49) Decent contribution 6, Luke Cowan-Dickie (for George, 59) 6, Mark Wilson (for Underhill, 59) 6, Jonathan Joseph (for May, 70) n/a South Africa Willie le Roux The full-back was very safe under any high balls that England could rain down on him. His old head cool under pressure. 6 Cheslin Kolbe The little wing hardly had a sniff of the ball. When he did showed a Jason Robinson\u2011esque ability to find space from nowhere. 7 Lukhanyo Am He looked very sharp and played a big part in the Mapimpi try. Like his centre partner was very strong in defence. 7 Damian de Allende Wales\u2019s nemesis made a couple of powerful runs but was generally confined to a part in a stifling defensive effort. 6 Makazole Mapimpi However dubious the first try was, South Africa\u2019s top try\u2011scorer in Japan took it superbly. Always a danger. 7 Handr\u00e9 Pollard Recovered from missing a second-minute penalty to convert 22 points, points that put the Boks beyond reach. 8 Faf de Klerk Was his usual effervescent self behind a dominant scrum and kicked well into places England did not want the ball to go. 7 Tendai Mtawarira The Beast was a real menace in the scrum, giving replacement Dan Cole a rocky ride. Very strong all-round display. 7 Mbongeni Mbonambi The hooker lasted only 20 minutes before he was injured in a tackle by Courtney Lawes and replaced by Malcolm Marx. n/a Frans Malherbe The tighthead was part of a front row that for the first half helped squeeze the life out of the England pack. 7 Eben Etzebeth For an hour was a real handful for the English pack despite having treatment for a shoulder injury. Back to his best. 7 Lood de Jager The Bulls lock left the field at the start of the second quarter in great pain from a shoulder injury but the Springboks coped. 5 Siya Kolisi (capt) Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar was there to see another captain in a No 6 shirt lift the Webb Ellis Cup. Led the team superbly for 64 minutes. 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit The converted lock followed his exceptional game against Wales with another brutal display, not giving Ford room to breathe. 7 Duane Vermeulen Like the two Bok locks, the No 8 had treatment for a shoulder injury in a ferocious first half and made some big carries. 7 Replacements: Malcolm Marx (for Mbonambi, 21) Big impact 7, Franco Mostert (for De Jager, 21) Shored up scrum 7, Steven Kitshoff (for Mtawarira , 44) Strong in the scrum 7, Vincent Koch (for Malherbe, 44) Powerful 7, Fran\u00e7ois Louw (for Kolisi, 64) Big tackles 6, Fran\u00e7ois Steyn (for Le Roux, 67) 6, Herschel Jantjies (for De Klerk, 77) n/a",

The DHSS\u2019s case rests on four instances of what it calls \u201cfailed abortions\u201d \u2013 cases where complications arose and the patient had to return to the clinic for another procedure.</p> <p>As it turns out, the DHSS is so concerned about women\u2019s health it has been keeping spreadsheets tracking the date of Planned Parenthood patients\u2019 periods, in an attempt to figure out which of them \u201chad undergone failed abortions\u201d. Let me just repeat that: American government officials are tracking the menstrual cycles of thousands of women. But, you know, it\u2019s for their own good so don\u2019t worry about it.</p> <p>Amazingly, we learned about the period spreadsheets because Dr Randall Williams, the director of DHSS \u2013 clearly thinking there was a nothing creepy about the affair \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article236773058.html\">openly testified about them on Tuesday</a>. Meanwhile Planned Parenthood and the doctors at the clinic had no idea these spreadsheets existed and were being used in this manner. Outrage rightly ensued.</p> <p>The DHSS has responded to the controversy in the most predictable and Trumpian way possible; apparently the whole thing is fake news. The health department <a href=\"https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/bc81f68b-52ff-4e74-8ac8-d107a7336aed/dhss-denies-false-allegations\">issued a statement</a> on Wednesday blasting \u201cirresponsible reporting\u201d that has led to \u201cfalse claims that Dr Randall Williams tracks the menstrual cycles of women seeking abortions at Planned Parenthood\u201d.</p> <p>The real story, according to the statement, is that \u201ca concern came up that DHSS may not be receiving complication reports for all failed surgical abortions, as required by law. Without a directive from Dr Randall Williams, regulators devised a means to efficiently investigate that concern using legally-obtained information which was required by law and which Planned Parenthood routinely submits.\u201d</p> <p>Honestly, I have to give a round of applause to whoever drafted that statement: it contains so much spin that it makes you dizzy just reading it. However, despite their best attempts at obfuscation the DHSS also makes clear that, yes, these spreadsheets exist. But they\u2019re completely legal so there\u2019s nothing to see here.</p> <p>Missouri\u2019s DHSS isn\u2019t the only government department documenting women\u2019s menstrual cycles, by the way. As Planned Parenthood <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthoods-statement-on-missouris-top-health-official-admitting-he-investigated-menstrual-cycles-of-missouri-women\">noted in a statement</a>, the spreadsheet controversy \u201cshadows <a href=\"https://www.newsandguts.com/video/maddow-exclusive-trump-administration-tracked-young-girls-periods-pregnancies/\">the Trump administration\u2019s history</a> of tracking the periods of refugee girls under the government\u2019s care\u201d. But again, the only reason the Trump administration has been doing this is because they want to protect these vulnerable women.</p> <p>You know what? Maybe I\u2019m being too cynical here. Maybe all these period spreadsheets really are just meant to protect women and keep them healthy. In that case, I think it is only right we extend the same courtesy to men. A female director of a health agency ought to keep track of when men last ejaculated and ensure they are not wasting their sperm on non-babymaking endeavours. We can call it The Ejaculist. I\u2019m sure the men of America will be touched at the government\u2019s concern for their wellbeing.</p> <h2>Delta thinks lesbian is a dirty word</h2> <p>The airline <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/468333-delta-receives-backlash-after-cutting-movies-same-sex-love\">cut a same-sex love scene</a> as well as the word \u201clesbian\u201d from its in-flight version of the movie Booksmart.

Missouri is keeping binders full of women\u2019s menstrual cycles Missouri, which has a population of over 6.1 million people, has only one abortion clinic.

Buttigieg was first on stage and it rapidly became clear he had taken the Obama model to heart, as he spoke of a need for power to change generations. \u201cI am ready to gather up an American majority that is hungry for change, that is done with division,\u201d he said in a line that might have come from the first black president. Perhaps befitting a former officer who went to Afghanistan, the South Bend, Indiana mayor at times painted scenes reminiscent of the battlefield. \u201cI am running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, pick up the pieces of our divided nation, and lead us to real action to do right by Americans who have waited far too long,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe will fight when we must fight,\u201d he said a little later. \u201cBut I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point. The point is what lies on the other side of the fight.\u201d There were plenty of echoes of Obama but it wasn\u2019t always clear what it was for, an issue that did not go unremarked on by other candidates. Biden pitched himself as a statesman ready to pick up the pieces after Trump. \u201cThe next president is going to be commander in chief of a world in disarray. There\u2019s going to be no time for on-the-job training,\u201d he said. He poured scorn on the president and, with a touch of Trumpian language, said that when it comes to the election: \u201cI will beat him like a drum if I\u2019m your nominee\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t long before Biden was turning his sights on the woman who is, for now at least, the biggest obstacle to him winning Iowa when it votes in early February. He took aim at Warren\u2019s signature policy: comprehensive and publicly funded health insurance. Hours earlier, the Massachusetts senator announced a plan to spend $20tn to provide it without increasing taxes for American workers. Biden said she was touting \u201cmade-up\u201d numbers. The former vice-president has repeatedly claimed Warren\u2019s healthcare plan is so radical it could cost the Democrats the election. His own proposal is to improve Obama\u2019s reforms without raising taxes, he said. Warren climbed on to the stage not long after, ready for the fight. Rather than defend the nuts and bolts of her policy, she bore down on what Biden\u2019s criticisms said about him as a candidate. \u201cAnyone who comes on that stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\u201d she said. Warren kept at it, promising big structural change to take American democracy back from the corporations. Change, she said, should not be feared, but celebrated. \u201cIf the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump then we will lose,\u201d she said, in a swipe at her more cautious opponents. \u201cI\u2019m not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas designed not to offend anyone.\u201d If the 2019 Liberty and Justice Celebration is remembered for anything, it will be that Warren laid out more clearly than ever the stark choice Democrats face. It drew some of the most sustained and raucous support of the evening. By comparison, Sanders was subdued. He was the only candidate to read from notes. The staples were all there but he seemed to lack Warren\u2019s fire. Squeezed between the two most radical candidates was Harris, who did little to keep her campaign alive. For those looking for something different, there was Yang. He pushed his singular policy of a universal basic income. He introduced Iowa families he has been paying $1,000 a month, seeking to show how taxing and redistributing the tech industry\u2019s booming profits could improve a lot of lives. It was, he said, a \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d. A large part of the crowd claimed its own freedom dividend once the serious contenders were out of the way, leaving the last speakers facing an ever-diminishing audience. By then, it was clear that the event was not going to deliver any surprise winners.",

South Africa fully deserved to become the second country, after the All Blacks, to win three World Cups and propelled by a dominant pack and 22 points from their fly-half Handr\u00e9 Pollard they also now have the distinction of becoming the first side to win a World Cup having lost a pool game en route, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/new-zealand-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">meeting defeat in their opener to New Zealand</a>.</p> \n<p>Those predicting a comfortable England win were guilty of overlooking South Africa\u2019s proud World Cup heritage. They had never previously fallen at the final hurdle nor conceded a try in their two previous finals. Both records remain intact. From the moment Kyle Sinckler was knocked out cold in the third minute following an accidental collision, England appeared trapped in the headlights, totally unable to gain the kind of gainline ascendancy that shocked New Zealand a week earlier.</p> \n<p>Was it big-occasion nerves that undermined them or just the incessant pummelling they took from umpteen big South Africans? Either way, they were a pale shadow of the white tornadoes who tore through the All Blacks.</p> \n<p>On a cool, windless evening the signs were ominous from the start. Pollard had already missed a long-range penalty before a shaken Sinckler was forced off. Barely had Dan Cole jogged on to replace him than England\u2019s scrum was being shunted backwards, with Tendai \u201cBeast\u201d Mtawarira leading the charge.</p> \n<p>When the Boks took the lead through a simple Pollard penalty in the 10th minute, after Owen Farrell had been caught in front of his own posts, it was well overdue.</p> \n<p>Nothing was working for England. Passes fell to earth and uncertainty began to ripple through the team. Only when South Africa were slightly unluckily penalised after Pollard juggled a high ball and the subsequent catcher, Pieter-Steph du Toit, was adjudged offside, did England enjoy a momentary lull. Farrell chipped over an equalising penalty but a botched restart collection and yet more scrum pressure allowed Pollard to restore his side\u2019s advantage.</p> \n<p>A big tackle from Sam Underhill on Du Toit offered temporarily relief but, despite a prolonged period of advantage close to the Bok line, England could only come away with another Farrell penalty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/02/england-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-final-player-ratings\">England 12-32 South Africa: Rugby World Cup final player ratings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Again it provided a brief respite. Mapimpi robbed Elliot Daly in the air and with England again clinging on illegally on the floor Pollard made it 9-6.</p> \n<p>England would definitely have settled for a three-point half-time deficit but another punishing scrum prompted J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s to extend his arm again.

The organisers opted to play John Denver\u2019s Take Me Home, Country Roads that, for a moment or two, completely changed the vibe in the stadium. It felt almost like a heartfelt farewell appreciation to the tournament and 70,000 spectators, some of whom have been away for weeks, were suddenly united as one.</p> \n<p>England, though, needed to break the spell out on the pitch. If they glimpsed a ray of hope when their chief tormentor Mtawarira and his fellow prop, Frans Malherbe, were replaced three minutes into the second half, it was merely the headlights of another onrushing train. Steven Kitshoff and Vincent Koch would make most starting XVs in the world and yet another scrum penalty allowed Pollard to make it 15-6.</p> \n<p>Bringing on Joe Marler for Mako Vunipola, in the circumstances, was a no-brainer and the Harlequins loose-head made an immediate difference. Farrell drilled home a 46-metre penalty and should have had another when Pollard, attempting to jink his way out of defence, was tap-tackled by Anthony Watson and penalised for not releasing. It was a false dawn, with Lukhanyo Am unselfishly putting an exultant Mapimpi over and Kolbe leaving Farrell sprawling down the right touchline to complete the rout.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The dramatic final act was typical of a tournament that seldom disappointed.

On the podium during the presentations Kolisi could be seen trying to persuade his coach and longtime mentor, Rassie Erasmus, to collect the trophy with him. Erasmus has done an extraordinary job of resurrecting a struggling team but there was as much chance of him allowing Kolisi to win that battle as England had of escaping the onrushing South African juggernaut once it started to rumble. The Boks had a crestfallen England exactly where they wanted them long before two last-quarter tries from the wingers, Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe, settled a wincingly physical contest. Under massive scrum pressure and lacking the accuracy and front-foot dynamism that characterised their stunning semi-final win over New Zealand, there were only fleeting moments when England looked like emulating Martin Johnson\u2019s champions of 2003. They could have no complaints, even if the final margin was a touch inflated. South Africa fully deserved to become the second country, after the All Blacks, to win three World Cups and propelled by a dominant pack and 22 points from their fly-half Handr\u00e9 Pollard they also now have the distinction of becoming the first side to win a World Cup having lost a pool game en route, after meeting defeat in their opener to New Zealand. Those predicting a comfortable England win were guilty of overlooking South Africa\u2019s proud World Cup heritage. They had never previously fallen at the final hurdle nor conceded a try in their two previous finals. Both records remain intact. From the moment Kyle Sinckler was knocked out cold in the third minute following an accidental collision, England appeared trapped in the headlights, totally unable to gain the kind of gainline ascendancy that shocked New Zealand a week earlier. Was it big-occasion nerves that undermined them or just the incessant pummelling they took from umpteen big South Africans? Either way, they were a pale shadow of the white tornadoes who tore through the All Blacks. On a cool, windless evening the signs were ominous from the start. Pollard had already missed a long-range penalty before a shaken Sinckler was forced off. Barely had Dan Cole jogged on to replace him than England\u2019s scrum was being shunted backwards, with Tendai \u201cBeast\u201d Mtawarira leading the charge. When the Boks took the lead through a simple Pollard penalty in the 10th minute, after Owen Farrell had been caught in front of his own posts, it was well overdue. Nothing was working for England. Passes fell to earth and uncertainty began to ripple through the team. Only when South Africa were slightly unluckily penalised after Pollard juggled a high ball and the subsequent catcher, Pieter-Steph du Toit, was adjudged offside, did England enjoy a momentary lull. Farrell chipped over an equalising penalty but a botched restart collection and yet more scrum pressure allowed Pollard to restore his side\u2019s advantage. A big tackle from Sam Underhill on Du Toit offered temporarily relief but, despite a prolonged period of advantage close to the Bok line, England could only come away with another Farrell penalty. Again it provided a brief respite. Mapimpi robbed Elliot Daly in the air and with England again clinging on illegally on the floor Pollard made it 9-6. England would definitely have settled for a three-point half-time deficit but another punishing scrum prompted J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s to extend his arm again. The excellent Pollard was wheeling away to the tunnel even before his fourth penalty had sailed between the uprights. What could possibly turn the tide? The organisers opted to play John Denver\u2019s Take Me Home, Country Roads that, for a moment or two, completely changed the vibe in the stadium. It felt almost like a heartfelt farewell appreciation to the tournament and 70,000 spectators, some of whom have been away for weeks, were suddenly united as one. England, though, needed to break the spell out on the pitch. If they glimpsed a ray of hope when their chief tormentor Mtawarira and his fellow prop, Frans Malherbe, were replaced three minutes into the second half, it was merely the headlights of another onrushing train. Steven Kitshoff and Vincent Koch would make most starting XVs in the world and yet another scrum penalty allowed Pollard to make it 15-6. Bringing on Joe Marler for Mako Vunipola, in the circumstances, was a no-brainer and the Harlequins loose-head made an immediate difference. Farrell drilled home a 46-metre penalty and should have had another when Pollard, attempting to jink his way out of defence, was tap-tackled by Anthony Watson and penalised for not releasing. It was a false dawn, with Lukhanyo Am unselfishly putting an exultant Mapimpi over and Kolbe leaving Farrell sprawling down the right touchline to complete the rout. The dramatic final act was typical of a tournament that seldom disappointed. From the hot springs of Beppu to the backstreets of Tokyo there was something for everyone, entirely justifying the decision to stage the event in Asia for the first time. Japan have been exceptional hosts, consistently exceeding expectations on and off the field. Even for England\u2019s disappointed players, the memories will last a lifetime.",

He and Bridget decided to visit the islands, but before they could do so, she was killed in a climbing accident on Ben More Assynt. Marsden vowed that one day he would visit the Summer Isles, but as the years passed they came to symbolise the longing for a place that exists more in the imagination than in reality. His book is therefore both a travelogue and an exploration of mythical islands, those \u201cplaces just beyond our reach, places that aren\u2019t really there at all\u201d. According to Marsden, \u201cthe ability to believe in places that are invisible, to build stories around them and inhabit them, remains the defining attribute of our species\u201d. Nowhere is richer in imaginary places than the western seas, where the fickle currents, fractured coastline and constantly changing weather made crossings dangerous and deepened the mystery around those islands lost in the mist or just over the horizon. There are countless mythical islands in these waters, from T\u00edr na n\u00d3g (land of the young), Avalon, Hinba and the Green Island, to Elysium. Marsden\u2019s own home in Cornwall was once owned by a family who lost all their money in the 16th century \u201clooking for an island called Hy-Brasil\u201d.</p> <p>Marsden\u2019s odyssey in his wooden boat, Tsambika, takes him up the western fringe of the archipelago \u2013 \u201cEurope\u2019s dreaming frontier\u201d \u2013 through a rich territory of real and imagined places. There are memorable historical anecdotes and encounters with local people on the islands he visits, such as the crofter and poet John Purser on Skye, whose words appear on the beams of Edinburgh\u2019s Library of Scottish Poetry: \u201cA nation is forged in the hearth of poetry.\u201d There is real danger, too, as Marsden faces violent storms and even a powerful whirlpool. But as he says, \u201cLooking for imaginary places isn\u2019t meant to be easy.\u201d</p> <p>He writes beautifully, and transforms what could easily have been a conventional travel book into something far more evocative and personal: \u201ca sea journey is a passage of the soul\u201d. The harsh coastal landscapes and shifting moods of the sea are vividly described. But what is so memorable and indeed magical is the way he interweaves the imaginary and the real. In these islands at the edge of the Atlantic, staring out into \u201cthe endless blue of the west\u201d, he finds a rich tradition of myth, poetry and ancient lore that still speaks to us across the gulf of time.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Summer Isles is published by Granta (\u00a320).

Marsden\u2019s odyssey in his wooden boat, Tsambika, takes him up the western fringe of the archipelago \u2013 \u201cEurope\u2019s dreaming frontier\u201d \u2013 through a rich territory of real and imagined places. There are memorable historical anecdotes and encounters with local people on the islands he visits, such as the crofter and poet John Purser on Skye, whose words appear on the beams of Edinburgh\u2019s Library of Scottish Poetry: \u201cA nation is forged in the hearth of poetry.\u201d There is real danger, too, as Marsden faces violent storms and even a powerful whirlpool. But as he says, \u201cLooking for imaginary places isn\u2019t meant to be easy.\u201d He writes beautifully, and transforms what could easily have been a conventional travel book into something far more evocative and personal: \u201ca sea journey is a passage of the soul\u201d. The harsh coastal landscapes and shifting moods of the sea are vividly described. But what is so memorable and indeed magical is the way he interweaves the imaginary and the real. In these islands at the edge of the Atlantic, staring out into \u201cthe endless blue of the west\u201d, he finds a rich tradition of myth, poetry and ancient lore that still speaks to us across the gulf of time. \u2022 The Summer Isles is published by Granta (\u00a320).

The idea that the UK is currently enjoying a golden age at something \u2013 intimate programme-making \u2013 might cheer us up right now.</p> <p>At Wigmore Hall, musical threads dive and weave across days or weeks or seasons. On Monday evening the star American cellist <strong><a href=\"https://alisaweilerstein.com/\" title=\"\">Alisa Weilerstein</a></strong> and American/Israeli pianist Inon Barnatan gave an untypical recital in which only one work, Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Sonata in D minor, Op 40, was written for the cello. Six Lieder by Brahms became songs without words in the performers\u2019 own arrangement, structures and complexities revealed with new clarity. One, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=097dIuOFI7k\" title=\"\">Regenlied,</a> linked back to the composer\u2019s \u201craindrop\u201d Violin Sonata No 1 in G, Op 78 with which Weilerstein opened the concert. The change of key (to D) and lower timbre, in this arrangement by Paul Klengel, didn\u2019t wholly communicate the work\u2019s lyrical outpourings. On the other hand, Shostakovich\u2019s final work, the austere Viola Sonata, Op 147 (arr Daniil Shafran), sounded beautiful, mournful, tender on cello. Weilerstein\u2019s performance held us spellbound.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, in a sold-out Radio 3 Lunchtime Concert (available <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0009r3k\" title=\"\">on BBC Sounds</a>), another cellist,<strong> <a href=\"https://www.jeanguihenqueyras.com/en.html\" title=\"\">Jean-Guihen Queyras</a></strong>, and the admired pianist <a href=\"https://www.alexandretharaud.com/\" title=\"\">Alexandre Tharaud</a>, shone light on their own French tradition, with Marais\u2019s Suite in D minor \u2013 both players invoking the ghost-white mood of the viola da gamba and harpsichord for which it was written \u2013 as well as Debussy\u2019s Cello Sonata. Where Weilerstein has instinctive warmth and freedom, making the instrument sing, Queyras\u2019s approach is more analytical, almost detached: great and distinctive players, both.</p> <p>Themes at Kings Place run for a year. Its ambitious <a href=\"https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/magazine/genre/venus-unwrapped/\" title=\"\">Venus Unwrapped</a>, with two months still to run, has more than 60 events focusing on female composers (but not to the exclusion of men). Yet another stellar cellist, the British player <strong><a href=\"http://www.natalieclein.com/\" title=\"\">Natalie Clein</a></strong>, was joined by pianists <a href=\"http://www.juliusdrake.com/\" title=\"\">Julius Drake</a> and <a href=\"http://matanporat.com/\" title=\"\">Matan Porat</a> and soprano <a href=\"https://www.rubyhughes.com/\" title=\"\">Ruby Hughes</a> for a fluid programme ranging from Schumann \u2013 his poignant late songs, affectingly sung by the superb Hughes \u2013 to a world premiere by Judith Weir. Her <em>On the Palmy Beach</em>, a Kings Place commission, sets four poems about the sea and shore by Wallace Stevens, Kathleen Jamie, Norman MacCaig and Emily Dickinson. Voluptuous and witty, salty and bracing, with a delicious personification of a jellyfish, this short song cycle should go straight into the repertoire. So too should the Cello Sonata by the Dutch composer Henri\u00ebtte Bosmans (1895-1952), whose troubled career was oppressed by war and prejudice. This work of grand romantic gesture, surely new to all of us, was played with characteristic passion and compelling authority by Clein.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a716cb9ee5791669081da284ba6b920b65dec29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a716cb9ee5791669081da284ba6b920b65dec29e/0_0_913_1280/713.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Lepper and Gweneth Ann Rand at the Oxford lieder festival.\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Lepper and Gweneth Ann Rand at the Oxford lieder festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The annual <strong><a href=\"https://www.oxfordlieder.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Oxford lieder festival</a></strong>, described as \u201ccelebrating song\u201d but embracing every kind of chamber music, is the brainchild of the pianist <a href=\"https://www.sholtokynoch.com/\" title=\"\">Sholto Kynoch</a>. This is its 18th year. Schubert remains at its heart, but new commissions, the involvement of local schools and the support and nurture given to young artists make this an event of spine and importance. The German soprano <a href=\"https://www.askonasholt.com/artists/dorothea-roschmann/\" title=\"\">Dorothea R\u00f6schmann</a>, with pianist <a href=\"http://martineau.info/\" title=\"\">Malcolm Martineau</a>, took a while to settle, but all her experience and gift for nuance came into play in Wagner\u2019s<em> Wesendonck Lieder</em> and, magnificently, in Schumann\u2019s bleak <em>Gedichte der K\u00f6nigin Maria Stuart</em> (Songs of Queen Mary Stuart), Op 135. Written in December 1852, they reflect Schumann\u2019s deep depression, intensified by the onset of syphilis.</p> <p>A few diehards braved stormy weather to attend a late-night concert by the British soprano <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/artists/gweneth-ann-rand/\" title=\"\">Gweneth Ann Rand</a> and pianist <a href=\"https://www.simonlepper.com/\" title=\"\">Simon Lepper</a>. They performed Messiaen\u2019s early, Wagner-related cycle <em>Harawi: Songs of Love and Death</em>. Together, Rand\u2019s sumptuous voice, technically brilliant, verbally agile and expressive, and Lepper\u2019s sonically potent pianism, conjured the entire Messiaen gamut from apes\u2019 cries and birdsong to the sounds of ankle bells used in Peruvian dancing. Head full of Schumann and Wagner, I nearly skipped it. Lucky I didn\u2019t. The concert turned out to be a contender for the fast-approaching best-of-year list.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)</em><br><em>Alisa Weilerstein</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Jean-Guihen Queyras</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Natalie Clein</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Oxford lieder festival </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p>",

On Monday evening the star American cellist Alisa Weilerstein and American/Israeli pianist Inon Barnatan gave an untypical recital in which only one work, Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Sonata in D minor, Op 40, was written for the cello. Six Lieder by Brahms became songs without words in the performers\u2019 own arrangement, structures and complexities revealed with new clarity. One, Regenlied, linked back to the composer\u2019s \u201craindrop\u201d Violin Sonata No 1 in G, Op 78 with which Weilerstein opened the concert. The change of key (to D) and lower timbre, in this arrangement by Paul Klengel, didn\u2019t wholly communicate the work\u2019s lyrical outpourings. On the other hand, Shostakovich\u2019s final work, the austere Viola Sonata, Op 147 (arr Daniil Shafran), sounded beautiful, mournful, tender on cello. Weilerstein\u2019s performance held us spellbound. Earlier in the day, in a sold-out Radio 3 Lunchtime Concert (available on BBC Sounds), another cellist, Jean-Guihen Queyras, and the admired pianist Alexandre Tharaud, shone light on their own French tradition, with Marais\u2019s Suite in D minor \u2013 both players invoking the ghost-white mood of the viola da gamba and harpsichord for which it was written \u2013 as well as Debussy\u2019s Cello Sonata. Where Weilerstein has instinctive warmth and freedom, making the instrument sing, Queyras\u2019s approach is more analytical, almost detached: great and distinctive players, both. Themes at Kings Place run for a year. Its ambitious Venus Unwrapped, with two months still to run, has more than 60 events focusing on female composers (but not to the exclusion of men). Yet another stellar cellist, the British player Natalie Clein, was joined by pianists Julius Drake and Matan Porat and soprano Ruby Hughes for a fluid programme ranging from Schumann \u2013 his poignant late songs, affectingly sung by the superb Hughes \u2013 to a world premiere by Judith Weir. Her On the Palmy Beach, a Kings Place commission, sets four poems about the sea and shore by Wallace Stevens, Kathleen Jamie, Norman MacCaig and Emily Dickinson. Voluptuous and witty, salty and bracing, with a delicious personification of a jellyfish, this short song cycle should go straight into the repertoire. So too should the Cello Sonata by the Dutch composer Henri\u00ebtte Bosmans (1895-1952), whose troubled career was oppressed by war and prejudice. This work of grand romantic gesture, surely new to all of us, was played with characteristic passion and compelling authority by Clein. The annual Oxford lieder festival, described as \u201ccelebrating song\u201d but embracing every kind of chamber music, is the brainchild of the pianist Sholto Kynoch. This is its 18th year. Schubert remains at its heart, but new commissions, the involvement of local schools and the support and nurture given to young artists make this an event of spine and importance. The German soprano Dorothea R\u00f6schmann, with pianist Malcolm Martineau, took a while to settle, but all her experience and gift for nuance came into play in Wagner\u2019s Wesendonck Lieder and, magnificently, in Schumann\u2019s bleak Gedichte der K\u00f6nigin Maria Stuart (Songs of Queen Mary Stuart), Op 135. Written in December 1852, they reflect Schumann\u2019s deep depression, intensified by the onset of syphilis. A few diehards braved stormy weather to attend a late-night concert by the British soprano Gweneth Ann Rand and pianist Simon Lepper. They performed Messiaen\u2019s early, Wagner-related cycle Harawi: Songs of Love and Death. Together, Rand\u2019s sumptuous voice, technically brilliant, verbally agile and expressive, and Lepper\u2019s sonically potent pianism, conjured the entire Messiaen gamut from apes\u2019 cries and birdsong to the sounds of ankle bells used in Peruvian dancing. Head full of Schumann and Wagner, I nearly skipped it. Lucky I didn\u2019t. The concert turned out to be a contender for the fast-approaching best-of-year list.

Tasker tapped out the post in her iPhone notes first and, 10 minutes later, found herself pressing share. \u201cI went back in and edited it for five minutes and then sat poised, waiting for the comments.\u201d</p> <p>Tasker has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/me_and_orla/?hl=en\" title=\"\">a public account</a>, with more than 200,000 followers. The post wasn\u2019t going to sit in an internet vacuum; it would be seen by strangers, friends, the other parents at her daughter\u2019s school. \u201cThis year I made over \u00a3200k,\u201d she wrote, \u201cmainly whilst sat at my kitchen table, drinking gin &amp; doing what I love\u2026 It\u2019s all possible, friends.\u201d Tasker knew there would be a reaction: \u201cIt was terrifying \u2013 I felt very vulnerable.\u201d But she wanted people to know it was possible to make a very good living in her multi-hyphenate role of influencer, photographer and coach. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t know what I did,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no evidence that it was possible to do this well.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the cynicism in some quarters about influencer culture, the response to her post was overwhelmingly positive. Tasker\u2019s success story is the palatable kind: she\u2019s a self-made northerner, who before going all-out on Instagram worked as a speech therapist in the NHS, earning \u00a321,000 a year. She believes this coloured the response to her new, six-figure salary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tasker couldn\u2019t sleep, knowing the post was sitting there. 'I took it down two days later.

I didn\u2019t want to feel like a target. It\u2019s exposing in ways that I haven\u2019t quite processed yet. The post felt bigger than me.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Talking about money is complicated. In March this year, <a href=\"https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/Media/Press-Releases/2019-press-releases/lloyds-bank/the-m-word-is-britains-biggest-taboo/\" title=\"\">YouGov research</a> found that 50% of UK adults believe that sharing personal money matters with others is taboo \u2013 although 61% of people said they feel better when they do. </p> <p>However, there are signs of a new openness, much of it led by personal revelations \u2013 from individuals sharing their salaries, to money diaries going viral, to the rise of \u201cdebtstagrammers\u201d, people who are happy to post their credit card bills to Instagram in the hope that their followers will make them accountable when it comes to paying back their debt. Even Lloyds bank\u2019s latest TV ad campaign has featured family members having halting conversations about their finances, ending with the tagline: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frQOeWSZBOw\" title=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s good to talk about money.\u201d</a></p> <p>Tasker is not the only influencer to have revealed what she earns publicly. In May, the food writer and activist Jack Monroe disclosed her salary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/12/salary-what-get-paid-talk-about-it-makes-brits-cringe\" title=\"\">\u00a321,000</a> to a Guardian journalist reporting on the squeamishness British people still feel about discussing what they earn. Earlier this year, fashion blogger Alex Stedman, AKA <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thefrugality/?hl=en\" title=\"\">The Frugality</a>, posted to her blog: \u201c<a href=\"https://the-frugality.com/my-relationship-with-money/\" title=\"\">Money, it\u2019s something we never have enough of, right?! But it\u2019s also something, I believe, we\u2019re not talking enough about.</a>\u201d Stedman started her blog, which champions affordable fashion and sustainability, because she \u201cwanted to take away the stigma of not having tons of money\u201d. She revealed that she currently<strong> </strong>pays herself a salary of \u00a330,000<strong> </strong>\u2013 the highest she\u2019s ever earned.</p> <p>Legislation that in 2018 made it mandatory for all UK companies with more than 250 staff to publish their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/05/the-uk-companies-reporting-the-biggest-gender-pay-gaps\" title=\"\">gender pay gap</a> \u2013 the disparity between what male and female employees earn \u2013 has helped propel what was once private information into the public domain. Suddenly there was no denying that our reticence to talk about money was protecting unfair pay gaps and, in some cases, illegal discrimination. On 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/11/216594/equal-pay-day-2018\" title=\"\">Equal Pay-Day</a> (the day in the year that women effectively begin working for free), <a href=\"https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/equal-pay-day\" title=\"\">the Fawcett Society</a> launched a campaign calling on people to \u201cend the culture of pay secrecy\u201d by \u201ctalking to your colleagues and asking what they earn\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec689f3e4b6120b047f34b5d2af2df0602886a1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec689f3e4b6120b047f34b5d2af2df0602886a1a/5_7_1648_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piggy bank illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is imperative for women to talk about this because, if they\u2019re not careful, over their working life they could lose out on hundreds of thousands of pounds.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: S\u00e9bastien Thibault/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month it was reported that Samira Ahmed, presenter of Newswatch, is<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/21/samira-ahmed-takes-bbc-court-unequal-pay-claim\" title=\"\">taking the BBC to an employment tribunal</a><strong> </strong>over alleged unequal pay.<strong> </strong>It follows the high profile case of broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/02/carrie-gracie-i-learned-about-equal-pay-the-hard-way\" title=\"\">Carrie Gracie</a>, who in early 2018 resigned as the BBC\u2019s China editor, citing gendered pay discrimination. She is passionate about why we need to get more comfortable with talking about money. \u201cHowever difficult that first conversation might seem, you\u2019ve got to have it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s like gym work, isn\u2019t it? You build muscle and you get stronger.\u201d Gracie recently published a book on the subject, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/equal-story-women-men-and-money-carrie-gracie-review\" title=\"\">Equal</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/equal-story-women-men-and-money-carrie-gracie-review\" title=\"\">: </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/equal-story-women-men-and-money-carrie-gracie-review\" title=\"\">A </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/equal-story-women-men-and-money-carrie-gracie-review\" title=\"\">Story </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/equal-story-women-men-and-money-carrie-gracie-review\" title=\"\">Of Women, Men </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/equal-story-women-men-and-money-carrie-gracie-review\" title=\"\">And Money</a>. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019ve written it is to say to women: \u2018You really have to be vigilant.\u2019 It is imperative for women to talk about this because, if they\u2019re not careful, over their working life they could lose out on hundreds of thousands of pounds.\u201d</p> <p>So how do you start a conversation about equal pay at work? \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very important to start off in a friendly manner,\u201d says Gracie, who ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/29/bbc-reach-equal-pay-deal-with-former-china-editor-carrie-gracie\" title=\"\">won an apology and a payout</a> from the BBC. \u201cYou need to be professional, businesslike, and show that you\u2019re serious and take yourself seriously, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be angry or emotional.\u201d And if your emotions or nerves get the better of you? \u201cIf you emerge thinking, \u2018Ugh, I wish I\u2019d handled that better\u2019, then don\u2019t worry about it: you should be proud of yourself and know that you\u2019ll get it better next time. It\u2019s a learning journey.\u201d</p> <p>Talking and sharing in this way has helped people fight other money injustices. Now that 15% of the UK workforce are self\u2011employed, more people than ever are finding themselves without the protection of HR departments or trade unions; instead, they are self-organising on social media. Campaigners Seyi Akiwowo and Gabby Edlin recently set up a Facebook group titled Fuck You Pay M\u00a3 where women and non-binary people could discuss rates and give each other money advice. \u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of being asked to work for free,\u201d wrote Edlin. \u201cTo do panels for free, run a workshop \u2018on love\u2019, or create art for companies with only the offer of \u2018exposure\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Anna Codrea-Rado started her campaign, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annacod/status/1092745531112243201?lang=en\" title=\"\">#FairPayforFreelancers</a><strong>,</strong> in February this year. It began with an open letter demanding an end to unfair and slow payment practices, which was signed by <a href=\"https://ijnet.org/en/story/open-letter-freelancers-demand-fairer-pay-and-better-treatment\" title=\"\">800 journalists</a>. \u201cThe closure of the Pool [an online women\u2019s magazine that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/31/online-womens-magazine-the-pool-enters-administration\" title=\"\">entered administration in January</a>, leaving many unpaid] was the final straw,\u201d she says. \u201cI realised that no one was protecting us.\u201d When the columnist Laura Craik went public about the \u00a37,250 that she says The Pool owed her, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-pool-website-closure-a4059031.html\" title=\"\">she </a><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-pool-website-closure-a4059031.html\" title=\"\">wrote that</a> the magazine only seemed to stop commissioning new writers \u201conce they [were] outed first on Facebook and then on Twitter by a mounting number of freelancers who [hadn\u2019t] been paid\u201d.</p> <p>In August 2019, Ben O\u2019Brien, an illustrator with more than 15 years\u2019 experience of making art for clients including the BBC, tweeted to his 25,000 followers: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benillustrator/status/1163342132071063552?lang=en\" title=\"\">Lame start to the week when I find out the job I was in line for (16 illustrations for one of the biggest smartphone brands with a major ad agency) was to be paid for with\u2026 a new phone worth \u00a31k. No thanks mate.\u201d</a> The first time O\u2019Brien had asked about the budget, his question was ignored. \u201cI had no reason to be suspicious,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge agency, so I presumed they were finalising details.\u201d But a week away from starting the job, which O\u2019Brien estimated would take a month working full-time to complete, he asked again. They replied: \u201cNo, the phone we sent you, that is the payment.\u201d Frustrated, O\u2019Brien aired his grievances on Twitter. \u201cAlthough I have great clients, illustrators are often underpaid and undervalued,\u201d he says. \u201cBy calling it out, I hope people will realise that it\u2019s not OK to presume someone will work for no actual pay.\u201d</p> <p>Another illustrator, Niki Groom, aka Miss Magpie, has founded a collective of illustrators who are open with each other about pay, allowing them to enter negotiations with clients knowing the market rate. She also took the step of posting her illustration earnings over the past 10 years online. Through <a href=\"https://www.missmagpiefashionspy.com/new-blog/2019/3/21/money-talks-my-illustration-career-in-numbers\" title=\"\">beautifully rendered pie charts</a>, she reveals that she went from earning just \u00a3160 from illustrating in 2012 to \u00a359,548 in 2018. \u201cIf people think I\u2019m showing off, then they have misunderstood,\u201d says Groom. \u201cI wanted people to know that it takes time to build earnings, but that it\u2019s possible to make a living. It\u2019s amazing how helpful a data point of one or two people can be to knowing your own worth. The most surprising thing is that even those who I\u2019d have considered my competitors have been positive and thankful.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Pay is not the only hot topic in the new, more open money conversation. Last year the UK\u2019s unsecured debt \u2013 which includes store cards, credit cards, overdrafts, payday and personal loans \u2013 reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/average-uk-household-debt-now-stands-at-record-15400\" title=\"\">its highest ever level</a> compared with income. Kirsty Good, head of campaigns and forums at <a href=\"http://moneysavingexpert.com/\" title=\"\">MoneySavingExpert.com</a>, says it is vital we learn to talk about debt, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s why financial education is needed. If people could feel more knowledgeable about their finances, they might feel more comfortable openly talking about how they\u2019ve managed to, say, shift their debt on to a 0% credit card, or how they\u2019re planning to pay for a big event, like a wedding.\u201d</p> <p>Once again, though, a shift<strong> </strong>does seem to be under way. On MoneySavingExpert\u2019s Debt Free Wannabe forums, members display an almost cultish devotion to openly discussing money. Each contributor signs off their posts with the amount of debt they owe and their predicted debt-free date. While no substitute for formal, one-on-one advice, the platform is an opportunity to speak to someone who knows how it feels to be \u00a315k in debt while earning the minimum wage. \u201cThe threads are non-judgmental places for people to swap their experiences, celebrate even the smallest of wins and, in some cases, save lives,\u201d says Good.</p> <p>I speak to a woman called Anna (not her real name), who in March this year posted a list of her debts on Instagram. From a Next credit account to an American Express card, they totalled \u00a325,438.11. She named the account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/myfrugalyear/\" title=\"\">@myfrugalyear</a> and publicly announced her intention to be debt-free by March 2021. \u201cIt was a pretty rough moment, actually,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like the protagonist of a 1990s debt consolidation advert, sitting head in hands at my kitchen table. I\u2019d just had a really difficult conversation with the bank, as we were in an unarranged overdraft. They were asking when I would be out of it, and I had to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. We were just paid last week and there is no money left.\u2019 I realised in that moment: <em>enough is enough</em>. I knew I needed to sit down and add up all my debt.\u201d</p> <p>The bank offered Anna an adviser, but she turned the offer down: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be patronised or belittled in a meeting about my finances.\u201d But if she couldn\u2019t talk about it in a private room, why post it to Instagram? \u201cI had always been influenced to spend by Instagram, and it felt like poetic justice to use it as a vehicle out of the situation,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Anna is not the only one looking to social media for a way out: the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/debtfreejourney/top/\" title=\"\">#debtfreejourney</a> has now been used half a million times on Instagram. For Anna, it\u2019s working: in six months she\u2019s paid off nearly \u00a35,000 and has 20,000 new social media followers to hold her accountable. She\u2019s also found that her relationship with Instagram has changed. \u201cThe illusion has been shattered,\u201d she says. \u201cI look at the interiors accounts I used to follow and think: what was so seductive about them? I look at my old feed and see it\u2019s just pictures of stuff. Going public has forced me to be honest with myself.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One writer posted everything from their rent, to their New Year\u2019s Eve cocaine bill, to paying their flatmate back \u00a31</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The popularity of money diaries, where people document their outgoings, is another sign of the new openness about spending. The Guardian\u2019s regular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/how-i-spend-it\" title=\"\">How I Spend It</a> column, in which readers discuss their finances, has been running since January 2018 and has proved hugely popular with people who are curious about how others save or spend. For many would-be contributors, though, the sticking point is the need to declare their earnings. \u201cThose willing to share<strong> </strong>their income details usually come from the public sector or are self-employed or on benefits,\u201d says Patrick Collinson, editor of Guardian Money. \u201cIf you are a nurse or teacher, then your salary details are already in a sense publicly available, as there are agreed scales.\u201d</p> <p>On the website <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us\" title=\"\">Refinery29</a>, anonymous female social workers, accountants and paediatricians have broken down their spending in minute detail; one writer included everything from their rent, to <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/money-diary-freelance-writer\" title=\"\">their New Year\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/money-diary-freelance-writer\" title=\"\">Eve cocaine bill</a>, to paying their flatmate back \u00a31 for a packet of crisps. Last month the BBC launched its own version, in which a 27-year-old wrote of her guilt <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-49556383\" title=\"\">over spending \u00a31.50</a> on a can of tuna. The story went viral, with readers debating whether her frugality was commendable or depressing, and the woman, who wasn\u2019t anonymous, found her spending <a href=\"https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/in-the-news/bbc-money-diary/\" title=\"\">trending on Twitter</a>. \u201cMoney is a window into our society, so people enjoying the voyeurism of the series isn\u2019t a surprise,\u201d explains Gillian Orr, head of content at Refinery29. \u201cMillennials came of age during the financial crash, so they have a different perspective on money to other generations. Whereas their parents kept conversations about finance behind closed doors, young people today are much more relaxed discussing this previously \u2018sensitive\u2019 issue with friends, partners and even strangers online.\u201d</p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://info.caci.co.uk/future-of-digital-banking-2019/\" title=\"\">25 million</a> UK customers now managing their banking though phone apps, keeping your own digital money diary has never been easier. With banks like <a href=\"https://monzo.com/\" title=\"\">Monzo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.starlingbank.com/\" title=\"\">Starling</a> displaying spending by category and retailer, it\u2019s impossible to ignore what is draining our bank accounts, whether it\u2019s Starbucks or Asos; and that in turn is prompting conversations between friends about spending habits. But while apps are making us more accountable, there is a downside. \u201cThe positives of being able to see your bank balance and have your spending itemised is being outweighed by the detrimental effect contactless payments and one-click checkouts have on our spending,\u201d says Jason Butler, an FT columnist and host of the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/real-money-stories-podcast/id1467187934\" title=\"\">Real Money Stories</a> podcast. A 2014<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.iises.net/download/Soubory/IJOES/V3N4/pp70-98_ijoesV3N4.pdf\" title=\"\">report by the Journal of Economic Sciences</a> found that contactless payments have led to an 8-10% increase in spending at the point of sale.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere\u2019s still a way to go on the money conversation. Right now we\u2019re at the awareness stage: yes, more people are sharing, and we\u2019ve started to realise the positives that can come from talking about money. But it doesn\u2019t mean everyone is ready.\u201d</p> <p>A year after that Instagram post, I ask Sara Tasker if there have been any negative consequences of revealing her salary. \u201cIt\u2019s been really positive \u2013 my friendships are definitely more honest,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess it\u2019s slightly strange when I go out for dinner with my family, and my mum and dad will pay for my siblings and not me, but that\u2019s also totally OK.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Anna of @myfrugalyear how her friends reacted to her honesty. \u201cThey were surprised,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d put on a good act over the years, and no one realised quite how much debt we were in. Afterwards some friends revealed that they are in the same situation, and having that chat was such a relief \u2013 a bonding experience.\u201d She adds that not every conversation has been that easy. \u201cOne friend who is sorted financially said, \u2018Well, now I don\u2019t feel I can talk to you about the house I\u2019m buying.\u2019 And in truth it does make me feel jealous. But at least we can work through those conversations together now, with a bit more empathy.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Honesty box: how to be straight about cash</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> You might not be ready to chat openly, but don\u2019t deceive yourself. Look at your bank account and be mindful when spending. No one should get to the end of the month saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know where all my money went.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Don\u2019t just accept that you\u2019re \u201crubbish with money\u201d. As MoneySavingExpert.com\u2019s Kirsty Good says, \u201cIt\u2019s crucial a consumer can do the maths on a discount, or know how to split the bill with a friend \u2013 it stops them being ripped off.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Try to have casual chats about money with friends, colleagues and your partner \u2013 that way, when you have to talk about it in a high-stakes situation, you\u2019ll have the vocabulary to advocate for yourself.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Money is a topic for everyone, not just for rich people. There is no one who wouldn\u2019t benefit from a conversation about it.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Talk about <em>how</em> you\u2019re paying for things, not just how much things cost. It\u2019s a chance to educate each other about good and bad sources of credit.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Holder is the author of <a href=\"https://serpentstail.com/open-up.html\">Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life (Serpent\u2019s Tail)</a></p> <p>If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "One evening, on impulse, Sara Tasker shared her salary in an Instagram caption. \u201cI just thought, I\u2019m going to be honest about this,\u201d she says now. Tasker tapped out the post in her iPhone notes first and, 10 minutes later, found herself pressing share. \u201cI went back in and edited it for five minutes and then sat poised, waiting for the comments.\u201d Tasker has a public account, with more than 200,000 followers. The post wasn\u2019t going to sit in an internet vacuum; it would be seen by strangers, friends, the other parents at her daughter\u2019s school. \u201cThis year I made over \u00a3200k,\u201d she wrote, \u201cmainly whilst sat at my kitchen table, drinking gin &amp; doing what I love\u2026 It\u2019s all possible, friends.\u201d Tasker knew there would be a reaction: \u201cIt was terrifying \u2013 I felt very vulnerable.\u201d But she wanted people to know it was possible to make a very good living in her multi-hyphenate role of influencer, photographer and coach. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t know what I did,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no evidence that it was possible to do this well.\u201d Despite the cynicism in some quarters about influencer culture, the response to her post was overwhelmingly positive. Tasker\u2019s success story is the palatable kind: she\u2019s a self-made northerner, who before going all-out on Instagram worked as a speech therapist in the NHS, earning \u00a321,000 a year. She believes this coloured the response to her new, six-figure salary. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018This is what I earn,\u2019 and it be a neutral fact,\u201d Tasker admits. \u201cIt has to be contextualised.\u201d But despite all the raised-hands emojis in the comments, Tasker couldn\u2019t sleep, knowing the post was sitting there. \u201cI took it down two days later,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d had the conversations I needed to have. I didn\u2019t want to feel like a target. It\u2019s exposing in ways that I haven\u2019t quite processed yet. The post felt bigger than me.\u201d *** Talking about money is complicated. In March this year, YouGov research found that 50% of UK adults believe that sharing personal money matters with others is taboo \u2013 although 61% of people said they feel better when they do. However, there are signs of a new openness, much of it led by personal revelations \u2013 from individuals sharing their salaries, to money diaries going viral, to the rise of \u201cdebtstagrammers\u201d, people who are happy to post their credit card bills to Instagram in the hope that their followers will make them accountable when it comes to paying back their debt. Even Lloyds bank\u2019s latest TV ad campaign has featured family members having halting conversations about their finances, ending with the tagline: \u201cIt\u2019s good to talk about money.\u201d Tasker is not the only influencer to have revealed what she earns publicly. In May, the food writer and activist Jack Monroe disclosed her salary of \u00a321,000 to a Guardian journalist reporting on the squeamishness British people still feel about discussing what they earn. Earlier this year, fashion blogger Alex Stedman, AKA The Frugality, posted to her blog: \u201cMoney, it\u2019s something we never have enough of, right?! But it\u2019s also something, I believe, we\u2019re not talking enough about.\u201d Stedman started her blog, which champions affordable fashion and sustainability, because she \u201cwanted to take away the stigma of not having tons of money\u201d. She revealed that she currently pays herself a salary of \u00a330,000 \u2013 the highest she\u2019s ever earned. Legislation that in 2018 made it mandatory for all UK companies with more than 250 staff to publish their gender pay gap \u2013 the disparity between what male and female employees earn \u2013 has helped propel what was once private information into the public domain. Suddenly there was no denying that our reticence to talk about money was protecting unfair pay gaps and, in some cases, illegal discrimination. On 2018\u2019s Equal Pay-Day (the day in the year that women effectively begin working for free), the Fawcett Society launched a campaign calling on people to \u201cend the culture of pay secrecy\u201d by \u201ctalking to your colleagues and asking what they earn\u201d. Last month it was reported that Samira Ahmed, presenter of Newswatch, is taking the BBC to an employment tribunal over alleged unequal pay. It follows the high profile case of broadcaster Carrie Gracie, who in early 2018 resigned as the BBC\u2019s China editor, citing gendered pay discrimination. She is passionate about why we need to get more comfortable with talking about money. \u201cHowever difficult that first conversation might seem, you\u2019ve got to have it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s like gym work, isn\u2019t it? You build muscle and you get stronger.\u201d Gracie recently published a book on the subject, Equal: A Story Of Women, Men And Money. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019ve written it is to say to women: \u2018You really have to be vigilant.\u2019 It is imperative for women to talk about this because, if they\u2019re not careful, over their working life they could lose out on hundreds of thousands of pounds.\u201d So how do you start a conversation about equal pay at work? \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very important to start off in a friendly manner,\u201d says Gracie, who ultimately won an apology and a payout from the BBC. \u201cYou need to be professional, businesslike, and show that you\u2019re serious and take yourself seriously, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be angry or emotional.\u201d And if your emotions or nerves get the better of you? \u201cIf you emerge thinking, \u2018Ugh, I wish I\u2019d handled that better\u2019, then don\u2019t worry about it: you should be proud of yourself and know that you\u2019ll get it better next time. It\u2019s a learning journey.\u201d Talking and sharing in this way has helped people fight other money injustices. Now that 15% of the UK workforce are self\u2011employed, more people than ever are finding themselves without the protection of HR departments or trade unions; instead, they are self-organising on social media. Campaigners Seyi Akiwowo and Gabby Edlin recently set up a Facebook group titled Fuck You Pay M\u00a3 where women and non-binary people could discuss rates and give each other money advice. \u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of being asked to work for free,\u201d wrote Edlin. \u201cTo do panels for free, run a workshop \u2018on love\u2019, or create art for companies with only the offer of \u2018exposure\u2019.\u201d Anna Codrea-Rado started her campaign, #FairPayforFreelancers, in February this year. It began with an open letter demanding an end to unfair and slow payment practices, which was signed by 800 journalists. \u201cThe closure of the Pool [an online women\u2019s magazine that entered administration in January, leaving many unpaid] was the final straw,\u201d she says. \u201cI realised that no one was protecting us.\u201d When the columnist Laura Craik went public about the \u00a37,250 that she says The Pool owed her, she wrote that the magazine only seemed to stop commissioning new writers \u201conce they [were] outed first on Facebook and then on Twitter by a mounting number of freelancers who [hadn\u2019t] been paid\u201d. In August 2019, Ben O\u2019Brien, an illustrator with more than 15 years\u2019 experience of making art for clients including the BBC, tweeted to his 25,000 followers: \u201cLame start to the week when I find out the job I was in line for (16 illustrations for one of the biggest smartphone brands with a major ad agency) was to be paid for with\u2026 a new phone worth \u00a31k. No thanks mate.\u201d The first time O\u2019Brien had asked about the budget, his question was ignored. \u201cI had no reason to be suspicious,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge agency, so I presumed they were finalising details.\u201d But a week away from starting the job, which O\u2019Brien estimated would take a month working full-time to complete, he asked again. They replied: \u201cNo, the phone we sent you, that is the payment.\u201d Frustrated, O\u2019Brien aired his grievances on Twitter. \u201cAlthough I have great clients, illustrators are often underpaid and undervalued,\u201d he says. \u201cBy calling it out, I hope people will realise that it\u2019s not OK to presume someone will work for no actual pay.\u201d Another illustrator, Niki Groom, aka Miss Magpie, has founded a collective of illustrators who are open with each other about pay, allowing them to enter negotiations with clients knowing the market rate. She also took the step of posting her illustration earnings over the past 10 years online. Through beautifully rendered pie charts, she reveals that she went from earning just \u00a3160 from illustrating in 2012 to \u00a359,548 in 2018. \u201cIf people think I\u2019m showing off, then they have misunderstood,\u201d says Groom. \u201cI wanted people to know that it takes time to build earnings, but that it\u2019s possible to make a living. It\u2019s amazing how helpful a data point of one or two people can be to knowing your own worth. The most surprising thing is that even those who I\u2019d have considered my competitors have been positive and thankful.\u201d *** Pay is not the only hot topic in the new, more open money conversation. Last year the UK\u2019s unsecured debt \u2013 which includes store cards, credit cards, overdrafts, payday and personal loans \u2013 reached its highest ever level compared with income. Kirsty Good, head of campaigns and forums at MoneySavingExpert.com, says it is vital we learn to talk about debt, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s why financial education is needed. If people could feel more knowledgeable about their finances, they might feel more comfortable openly talking about how they\u2019ve managed to, say, shift their debt on to a 0% credit card, or how they\u2019re planning to pay for a big event, like a wedding.\u201d Once again, though, a shift does seem to be under way. On MoneySavingExpert\u2019s Debt Free Wannabe forums, members display an almost cultish devotion to openly discussing money. Each contributor signs off their posts with the amount of debt they owe and their predicted debt-free date. While no substitute for formal, one-on-one advice, the platform is an opportunity to speak to someone who knows how it feels to be \u00a315k in debt while earning the minimum wage. \u201cThe threads are non-judgmental places for people to swap their experiences, celebrate even the smallest of wins and, in some cases, save lives,\u201d says Good. I speak to a woman called Anna (not her real name), who in March this year posted a list of her debts on Instagram. From a Next credit account to an American Express card, they totalled \u00a325,438.11. She named the account @myfrugalyear and publicly announced her intention to be debt-free by March 2021. \u201cIt was a pretty rough moment, actually,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like the protagonist of a 1990s debt consolidation advert, sitting head in hands at my kitchen table. I\u2019d just had a really difficult conversation with the bank, as we were in an unarranged overdraft. They were asking when I would be out of it, and I had to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. We were just paid last week and there is no money left.\u2019 I realised in that moment: enough is enough. I knew I needed to sit down and add up all my debt.\u201d The bank offered Anna an adviser, but she turned the offer down: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be patronised or belittled in a meeting about my finances.\u201d But if she couldn\u2019t talk about it in a private room, why post it to Instagram? \u201cI had always been influenced to spend by Instagram, and it felt like poetic justice to use it as a vehicle out of the situation,\u201d she says. Anna is not the only one looking to social media for a way out: the hashtag #debtfreejourney has now been used half a million times on Instagram. For Anna, it\u2019s working: in six months she\u2019s paid off nearly \u00a35,000 and has 20,000 new social media followers to hold her accountable. She\u2019s also found that her relationship with Instagram has changed. \u201cThe illusion has been shattered,\u201d she says. \u201cI look at the interiors accounts I used to follow and think: what was so seductive about them? I look at my old feed and see it\u2019s just pictures of stuff. Going public has forced me to be honest with myself.\u201d The popularity of money diaries, where people document their outgoings, is another sign of the new openness about spending. The Guardian\u2019s regular How I Spend It column, in which readers discuss their finances, has been running since January 2018 and has proved hugely popular with people who are curious about how others save or spend. For many would-be contributors, though, the sticking point is the need to declare their earnings. \u201cThose willing to share their income details usually come from the public sector or are self-employed or on benefits,\u201d says Patrick Collinson, editor of Guardian Money. \u201cIf you are a nurse or teacher, then your salary details are already in a sense publicly available, as there are agreed scales.\u201d On the website Refinery29, anonymous female social workers, accountants and paediatricians have broken down their spending in minute detail; one writer included everything from their rent, to their New Year\u2019s Eve cocaine bill, to paying their flatmate back \u00a31 for a packet of crisps. Last month the BBC launched its own version, in which a 27-year-old wrote of her guilt over spending \u00a31.50 on a can of tuna. The story went viral, with readers debating whether her frugality was commendable or depressing, and the woman, who wasn\u2019t anonymous, found her spending trending on Twitter. \u201cMoney is a window into our society, so people enjoying the voyeurism of the series isn\u2019t a surprise,\u201d explains Gillian Orr, head of content at Refinery29. \u201cMillennials came of age during the financial crash, so they have a different perspective on money to other generations. Whereas their parents kept conversations about finance behind closed doors, young people today are much more relaxed discussing this previously \u2018sensitive\u2019 issue with friends, partners and even strangers online.\u201d For the 25 million UK customers now managing their banking though phone apps, keeping your own digital money diary has never been easier. With banks like Monzo and Starling displaying spending by category and retailer, it\u2019s impossible to ignore what is draining our bank accounts, whether it\u2019s Starbucks or Asos; and that in turn is prompting conversations between friends about spending habits. But while apps are making us more accountable, there is a downside. \u201cThe positives of being able to see your bank balance and have your spending itemised is being outweighed by the detrimental effect contactless payments and one-click checkouts have on our spending,\u201d says Jason Butler, an FT columnist and host of the Real Money Stories podcast. A 2014 report by the Journal of Economic Sciences found that contactless payments have led to an 8-10% increase in spending at the point of sale. \u201cThere\u2019s still a way to go on the money conversation. Right now we\u2019re at the awareness stage: yes, more people are sharing, and we\u2019ve started to realise the positives that can come from talking about money. But it doesn\u2019t mean everyone is ready.\u201d A year after that Instagram post, I ask Sara Tasker if there have been any negative consequences of revealing her salary. \u201cIt\u2019s been really positive \u2013 my friendships are definitely more honest,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess it\u2019s slightly strange when I go out for dinner with my family, and my mum and dad will pay for my siblings and not me, but that\u2019s also totally OK.\u201d I ask Anna of @myfrugalyear how her friends reacted to her honesty. \u201cThey were surprised,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d put on a good act over the years, and no one realised quite how much debt we were in. Afterwards some friends revealed that they are in the same situation, and having that chat was such a relief \u2013 a bonding experience.\u201d She adds that not every conversation has been that easy. \u201cOne friend who is sorted financially said, \u2018Well, now I don\u2019t feel I can talk to you about the house I\u2019m buying.\u2019 And in truth it does make me feel jealous. But at least we can work through those conversations together now, with a bit more empathy.\u201d Honesty box: how to be straight about cash 1 You might not be ready to chat openly, but don\u2019t deceive yourself. Look at your bank account and be mindful when spending. No one should get to the end of the month saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know where all my money went.\u201d 2 Don\u2019t just accept that you\u2019re \u201crubbish with money\u201d. As MoneySavingExpert.com\u2019s Kirsty Good says, \u201cIt\u2019s crucial a consumer can do the maths on a discount, or know how to split the bill with a friend \u2013 it stops them being ripped off.\u201d 3 Try to have casual chats about money with friends, colleagues and your partner \u2013 that way, when you have to talk about it in a high-stakes situation, you\u2019ll have the vocabulary to advocate for yourself. 4 Money is a topic for everyone, not just for rich people. There is no one who wouldn\u2019t benefit from a conversation about it. 5 Talk about how you\u2019re paying for things, not just how much things cost. It\u2019s a chance to educate each other about good and bad sources of credit. \u2022 Alex Holder is the author of Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life (Serpent\u2019s Tail) If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

It is a relationship that has been characterised by mistrust and acrimony. The early success of Australian rugby following the advent of the professional era in the mid-1990s camouflaged the divisions within the game. In one brief, shining era the Wallabies held the Bledisloe Cup for five years in a row, won the 1999 World Cup and defeated the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2001, while the Brumbies lifted the Super Rugby title in 2001 and 2004.

Despite facing a more fancied Samoa side full of NRL experience, Kikau showed them up with a performance that will have Penrith fans salivating.</p> <p>The Panthers star bagged two tries and set up a third for a 24-point halftime lead that Samoa wouldn\u2019t get close to challenging on Saturday. Fiji coach Brandon Costin hailed Kikau\u2019s humility during camp.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an out-and-out athlete. He\u2019s one of the best NRL players in the game but when he goes into that camp, he\u2019s a locally born and bred Fijian,\u201d Costin said. \u201cThe whole environment within our camp just drops down and there\u2019s a massive sense of humility across these boys that are playing at the top of their game. They don\u2019t have to be so humble. It\u2019s just in their upbringing, they come from a Fijian village and it\u2019s just amazing to be around these humans.\u201d</p> <p>The victory leaves the Bati in the box seat to top group B of the Oceania Cup and earn promotion into group A next year to face New Zealand and Great Britain. </p> <p>Kikau was well-supported by hooker Joe Lovodua, who scored the opening try and assisted on two others. Samoa entered the contest overwhelming favourites on the back of a line-up boasting stars Martin Taupau, Junior Paulo and Joseph Leilua. In contrast, Fiji only had seven players of NRL experience and were missing the likes of Apisai Koroisau, Maika Sivo and Jayson Bukuya.</p> <p>However Samoa were left stunned by a four-try point-a-minute opening ambush orchestrated by Kikau and halfback Brandon Wakeham. They momentarily stemmed the tide with a Tim Lafai try in the 27th minute but Kikau ended any thought of a comeback with a solo effort on halftime. Samoa did get the first of the second half through Taufua but it was all Fiji from there with tries to Isaac Lumelume, Brayden Wiliame and Kevin Naiqama. Taufua and Ronaldo Mulitalo claimed late consolation four-pointers.</p> <p>The lopsided defeat is certain to pile pressure on Samoa coach Matt Parish, whose side now rely on Papua New Guinea heavily upsetting Fiji to top the pool. Samoa has won just one of their past nine games under Parish, who was disappointed in his team\u2019s lack of resiliency.</p> <p>\u201c(Fiji) played with a lot of energy on the back of our mistakes and we had no answers,\u201d Parish said. \u201cI thought we should\u2019ve been a bit more resilient at times, but that\u2019s football.\u201d</p> <p>Fiji also trounced Lebanon 58-14 in an exhibition match earlier this year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbd0baf8f08cb84c60a346e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-02T04:54:28.487Z\">4.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rugby league:</strong> Some news out of Auckland, with Kiwi Kieran Foran injured in the first half of the game.</p> <p><strong>From AAP:</strong></p> <p>Kieran Foran has suffered a suspected shoulder injury early in New Zealand\u2019s rugby league Test against Great Britain in Auckland.

      "bodyText": "Another belting day of Sportwatch. South Africa are the Rugby World Champions for a third time, led by the inspirational Siya Kolisi. In rugby league there was a stunning upset as Tonga downed the reigning world champions Australia at the Oceania Cup in Auckland. 16-12 the final score, as the Pasifika hung on in front of a vocal, home-like crowd. Some belting games from the WBBL, Liz Lee showing her brilliance with bat in hand as the Stars won their first of the season, while Adelaide Strikers and Sydney Sixers also got Ws. A remarkable first ever Victory-Western United Melbourne derby in the A-League, as it took five goals to separate the two after a pulsating four-goal first half. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! That late batting collapse proves costly for the Heat, giving up five balls as much as anything as they failed to bat out their 20 overs. The Strikers doing it comfortably in the end - with eight wickets to spare - as Patterson and Bates both knock unbeaten 50s to get them there, and to send Adelaide back to the top of the table. In fairness it was closer than perhaps many would have imagined after that blitzkrieg opening knock from Lizelle Lee. They looked okay with Meg Lanning and Natalie Sciver knocking the ones and twos, but when the Southern Stars skipper fell they couldn\u2019t quite fashion any partnerships, the Scorchers. Kristen Beams and Erin Osborne turning the screws with some economical bowling - and Stars, at a fifth time of asking have their first WBBL win of the season! Full-time: Rugby World Cup final - England 12-32 South Africa My, oh golly my. What a result this is, and by all accounts - a performance to match. Congratulations to South Africa - they join New Zealand as three time winners of the famous Webb-Ellis cup! It was won in the forwards, it was closed by the backs. A full team performance, and deserving winners. Here\u2019s Lee Calvert: We\u2019re going to the wire in both the WBBL fixtures currently underway. Adelaide appear in a better position, they\u2019ve at 2-101 off 14 overs with the required runs 39 off 33 balls. Suzie Bates and Bridget Patterson with a handy partership, picking the ones and twos and getting the scoreboard ticking over. For Perth, it may just be slipping away, losing the wicket of Meg Lanning a key turning point in their run chase. It\u2019s not over - but 43 of 18 might require something special. Watch this space. A truly remarkable game of A-League football - and a key statement made by Western United. Could this be a fillip for the new club to really mark it\u2019s presence in the Melbourne football landscape? They did lose their first Melbourne derby last weekend against City, but you just sensed for Rudan and his players this was the big one. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that this.. is finished\u201d. Terrific from Besart Berisha post-match. \u201cAll week I have had this emotion. Coming back against this fantastic club. The reason I came to Western United was to win games and help the team - and we showed great mentality to win tonight.\u201d \u201cIn ten minutes they get two goals - you think, what is happening here. But if you play like this after two-nil at their stadium, I think then this is good team.\u201d That\u2019s all she wrote! It\u2019s a courageous win for the new kids on the block in the first ever Victory-United Melbourne derby. The hosts have NEVER lost from 2-0 up in the history of the A-League. They have now. What a game - what drama - and what a result for Rudad\u2019s Army! 90 + 4 min: The seconds are ticking over, it\u2019s glacial stuff for the Western bench - they can\u2019t wait for this to end. Toivonen looks to feed Athiu - Durante gets there first but is he fouled? Referee says no - corner to Victory, and up comes Lawrence Thomas the \u2018keeper! 90 + 2 min: There\u2019s five minutes added on. Victory look to lump it long and continue to probe the aerial threat of Athiu. Rudan brings Calver on for Diamanti. Another defensive change - they\u2019re really looking to shut up shot, Western United. Poulsen appeals for handball, but referee Faghani doesn\u2019t give it. 88 min: They\u2019re huffing and puffling, Victory, but they\u2019re not exactly finding a cutting edge in the final third. Berisha makes way for the youngster Dylan Pierias, a defensive change for Western United. Before Gulum stoops to head clear, and cops an Athiu high boot. Connor Pain tries to get in the big striker\u2019s face. Lol. It\u2019s like when Gary Neville thought he could stare down Peter Schmeichel. Jog on, son. 85 min: It\u2019s getting very hot on the touchline - I guess as you\u2019d expect in a derby. Durante goes down with an \u201cinjury\u201d and the hugely-experienced Iranian referee Alireza Faghani gives him a pretty curt \u201cget up, ya mug\u201d and play goes on. Donachie with a strong intervention, sparks a counter for Kenny Athiu, but Kurto intercepts well. 82 min: Cripes! Filip Kurto has come 35m out of his goal to contest a header after Victory fire a long ball forward for Kamsoba. It\u2019s a fine intervention in the end, but my. That was dangerous. He almost found himself in no-man\u2019s land! And it\u2019s Donachie who heads a ball goalwards - that was awfully close for the Victory, but was Toivonen held by Gulum in the lead up to that set piece? VAR doesn\u2019t choose to get involved. 79 min: And the Berisha \u201cequaliser\u201d has been officially recorded as a Donachie own goal, which frankly is just a sucker punch for headline writers. It was the Kosovan\u2019s presence that made the goal, though, even if the Victory defender perhaps got the final telling touch. McDonald jogs off as Max Burgess comes on. A fine showing from the former Socceroo. How relieved will he be to have notched his first goal. 74 min: Terrific work from Scott McDonald who continues to bustle and strive for his side. What a competitor, and what a character - no wonder he wanted the 36-year-old back in his side, Rudan. Fellow veteran Andrew Durante lopes forward out of defence, but the move peters out and Josh Risdon takes a yellow card to stifle the Victory counter attack. 68 min: So Dobras gives way for Kenny Athiu, but Toivonen returns to the pitch after some heavy strapping on that troubled ankle. Rudan urges his side on from the touchline - they need to lift, Western United, it\u2019s been all defence since their third goal. 63 min: It\u2019s Victory coming more and more into this game, as Western United begin to think about protecting their lead. Dobras tries to fashion a chance, but it\u2019s clipped over the bar. Concern for home fans though as Toivonen goes down with an ankle injury, and now Dobras is also down receiving treatment. My, oh my. Both Victory\u2019s goalscorers - and chief attacking threats - appear to be in the wars. Rugby World Cup final - England 6-12 South Africa, half-time: And an update from the big dance in Yokohama. It\u2019s the underdogs with their noses in front at the break. England have had the lion\u2019s share of territory and possession, but it\u2019s the Proteas who have looked brighter ball in hand. Two defences very much on top and working hard, as only the goal kickers have found any joy. Follow Lee Calvert for the latest: 56 min: So, we\u2019re coming up to hour mark, and after that early melee following Broxham\u2019s rash challenge, it\u2019s fair to say the intensity has in no way tailed off in this one. A close up of Marco Kurz on the touchline, and he\u2019s as \u201cengaged\u201d as you\u2019d expect him to be. What a night for the fourth official - stuck between him and Mark Rudan. And they almost draw level, Victory. Basha with a well-flighted freekick into the box, but Tommy Deng sends it wide - via the shoulder! WBBL - Brisbane Heat all out for 139 off 19.1 It\u2019s a late fightback from the Strikers who looked on the ropes at 5 for 120 after just 15 overs. But they\u2019ve fought back well to wrap up the Heat tail, Mooney the only key scorer with 73 off 49. It\u2019s still an imposing total - but have they bought themselves a lifeline, Adelaide? The wickets shared between five bowlers - hard to choose the pick of them, with the figures all pretty economic. Now over to the bats(wo)men. Goal! Melbourne Victory 2-3 Western United (McDonald) There it is for Scott McDonald! A first ever goal on Australian soil for the Socceroo who infamously could never score. It\u2019s a terrific pivot inside the box from the former Celtic sharp-shooter, and it bustles home courtesy a deflection, but it\u2019s more than fitting for his first-half work. Kone found the former Socceroo, and he turned sharply to fire goalwards. What more does this game have in store?! 48 min: Oh wow. Leigh Broxham has gone sliding into a tackle with Kone with two feet - he\u2019d already been booked, the Victory stalwart, and the Western United players are apoplectic as he just receives a talking to. We all applaud refereeing that keeps the game going, but wow. He\u2019s incredibly lucky to still be on the pitch, the Victory midfielder. A-League - second half! Right! We\u2019re back - any chance we can hope for another belting 45 minutes? Imagine if it finished 4-4. The message no doubt has been for both sides to tighten up. We\u2019ll soon see if that\u2019s filtered through these two sets of fierce competitors. WBBL - Lizelle Lee fires century as Stars blast 3-155 in first innings And what a knock in the WBBL. We foreshadowed the prodigious ability of the South African wicket keeper pre-match, but wow. 103* off 65 balls. She\u2019s single-handedly taken apart this Scorchers attack. Three early sixes and then thirteen fours. It was a more controlled innings as it went on, and they\u2019re in a commanding position now, Melbourne Stars, to win what would be, remarkably, their first of the season after five rounds. What can the Scorchers hit back with? A-League - Victory 2-2 Western United, half-time: A cracking half, that. It\u2019s almost like all the frustration from the earlier Wanderers-Roar fixture that finished 0-0, was released in an orgy of footballing excitement just then. What a wild first 45 minutes. A penny for both Mark Rudan and Marco Kurz\u2019s thoughts at half-time. Two of the more passionate coaches in the A-League, and they\u2019ll be delighted and concerned by that showing in equal measure. Perfect viewing for a neutral. A-League - Victory 2-2 Western United, 40\u2019: Post! It\u2019s Scott McDonald - and the man who has scored buckets for Celtic, has goals in the Champions League, has come agonisingly close to putting United ahead! Thomas had no chance, what a strike. And at the other end, it\u2019s the youngster Brandon Lauton, handed a start in Andrew Nabbout and Robbie Kruse\u2019s absence - who almost conjures a sublime effort! He clips a looping effort first time, and it only just flies over Filip Kurto\u2019s crossbar. End to end stuff. And a Melbourne derby in the NBL that\u2019s just concluded as well - here\u2019s the write up from Australian Associated Press: Melbourne United have scored their first win over new cross-town rivals South East Melbourne Phoenix with a 110-98 victory on Saturday night. Languishing near the bottom of the NBL ladder with a 1-4 record, United led from start to finish at Melbourne Arena to extract some revenge for the Phoenix\u2019s three-point win in their maiden derby clash in round one. United\u2019s import centre Shawn Long was the dominant figure in the contest as he collected 31 points and 11 rebounds, Chris Goulding (24 points) providing valuable support. Long stamped his authority on the game with 16 in the first quarter to propel United to a 13-point halftime lead before the Phoenix came charging back in the third quarter. But after seeing their lead cut to five, United steadied the ship before taking control of the match in the final stanza. Goal! Melbourne Victory 2-2 Western United (Berisha) Oh come on. What is going on in Melbourne?? It was written in the stars - but on his first return to Victory territory, Besart Berisha - the A-League\u2019s all-time greatest goalscorer has found the equaliser, against the club where he won so much silverware. It was terrific vision from Scott McDonald to pick out Josh Risdon, whose sharp cross picked out Bes. And did he miss? Did he $%^&amp;. What a game we have now - less than 30 minutes played! A-League - Victory 2-1 Western United, 26 min: So, you\u2019d have to say, a comparative lull after that frenetic start to this one. Mark Rudan will be chewing wasps on the sideline, both the Victory goals came from defensive errors, with centre backs Andrew Durante and Connor Chapman both turning over cheap balll with passes out from the back that failed to find their target. As we try to catch our breath, a quick update from the two WBBL games. We\u2019ve seen her go BANG before, but Lizelle Lee looks in imperious form once again for the Stars. They\u2019re 2-109 off 14, but it\u2019s the South African who\u2019s whacked three sixes and 11 fours, helping herself to 79* off 47 balls. They\u2019ve tried seven different bowlers already, the Scorchers, but they\u2019ve all received the same treatment. Whack. Meanwhile, after 10 overs in Mackay, it\u2019s the Beth Mooney show as the home side move to 2-79. 49 of those scored by the Southern Stars blaster, who eyes her half-century. Goal! Melbourne Victory 2-1 Western United (Diamanti) 15 min: Oh my! What a start to this match. It\u2019s a half-clearance that drops kindly to the Western United marquee on the edge of the box, and it\u2019s a brilliant improvised finish. Something from the highest draw of the futsal skillsets, and he arrows that home into Lawrence Thomas\u2019 bottom corner! What a moment of brilliance. Game on! Oh my. A lot happening at once, and I was thinking we\u2019d missed a few minutes of the inaugural Victory-Western derby, but golly gee. We\u2019ve just hit the 10 minute mark, and there\u2019s already been two goals! Marquee man and skipper Ola Toivonen the X-factor - it was the big Swede who opened the scoring on just six minutes, before a minute later turning provider for new visa signing Kristian Dobras! Melbourne Victory 2, Western United 0. Now - I mentioned elsewhere that minor matter of the Rugby Union World Cup final. That\u2019s not too far away from getting going, so join our eyes on the prize Lee Calvert for every moment of that one: Better him than me - I\u2019m probably still not over being the only Australian in a pub full of Englishmen in 2003, and that Johnny Wilkinson kicking show. Have to say it - the English: the worst winners in the world. (Outside Australians, probably.) I\u2019ll be honest, we\u2019ve had a few warnings over the past year or two (most notably at the Rugby League World Cup) that Pasifika nations like Tonga and Samoa are a real rising presence in Rugby League, but now they\u2019ve completed the clean sweep against the three top nations - England done, New Zealand done, and now the Kangaroos. Amazing stuff, and hopefully that\u2019s a fillip for Tongan rugby league to sort out it\u2019s administrative issues. 80 min: James Tedesco scurries from dummy half, and he\u2019s pulled down 1m short of the line. The Kangaroos besiege the Tongan line. They swing it on the last tackle - it\u2019s frenetic stuff, they go left, they go right. Latrell Mitchell almost gets caught, but he recycles. And suddenly, Australia have numbers right - it\u2019s catch and pass stuff surely - but Tedesco misses his winger! It\u2019s a ropey old pass, and with a match-levelling try begging, it\u2019s ball into touch - and they\u2019re home, Tonga! What a result - what an upset - what a night in Tongan rugby league! Rugby league - Oceania Cup, 78\u2019: Ooh! Australia get within five metres of the try line, and they\u2019ve butchered it! Ball to ground, and it\u2019s Tonga\u2019s to hold on. I have to say, the sound from this crowd is unbelievable. We\u2019re in Auckland, and it\u2019s fair to suppose there\u2019s a strong Tongan contingent in. They\u2019ve burst into a spontaneous hymn - and it\u2019s like a choir of angels. You don\u2019t associate that with rugby league every day, but there you go. Gorgeous stuff. Rugby league - Oceania Cup, 74\u2019: Tonga have earned a penalty, and they\u2019ll take their time lining up a shot at the sticks (even though the clock is off). Kotoni Staggs with a chance to put the World Number 4 ranked team ahead by six. But he\u2019s hooked it right! It remains 16-12. A note of the world rankings: it should read 1. Australia, 2. New Zealand, 3. England 4. Daylight - such is the gulf in world rugby, in resources, in history, in playing personnel. But could this be the night that marks the rise of nations like Tonga and Samoa? But forget all that - we\u2019ve got a possible boilover happening in the Oceania Cup clash between Australia and Tonga, where we\u2019ve just under 10 minutes to play - and the tiny Pasifika nation have just got their noses in front 16-12. Have they ever beaten the Kangaroos, Tonga? I don\u2019t believe so. This could be history in the making. Before then, a quick round the grounds. Two fixtures just underway in the WBBL, where it\u2019s the Stars batting first against the Scorchers. Elyse Villani and the South African power-hitter Lizelle Lee are 0-32 off six overs, so a steady start, although that said Lee\u2019s just cleared the rope with a thumping stroke, so could be warming up nicely. In Mackay it\u2019s the Heat hosting the strikers, and we\u2019re only one over in there with no loss - the home side batting first. We are about to head to a bumper clash in the A-League - a first ever Melbourne derby between new club Western United and the competition\u2019s historic benchmark club, Melbourne Victory, which for added spice also features the league return of former Victory star Besart Berisha for the new kids. Tasty business. It\u2019s finished nil-all in Parramatta as the high-flying Wanderers pass up the opportunity to go four straight wins to open the season. In truth it was a cagey old game - maybe the heat a factor, especially early on, as both sides failed to really grasp the nettle, put the pedal to the metal, play in fine fettle (and other such malapropisms/general language murderings). Despite their stunning derby win last weekend, they\u2019re still somewhat of a surprise table leader, the Wanderers who haven\u2019t quite clicked. Very little offered in attack, but new signings Dylan McGowan and Matt Jurman combining very well in front of new signing Daniel Lopar in goal, at the back to keep them resolute. A better showing from Robbie Fowler\u2019s Brisbane - they\u2019ll take the point, but will still be itching for their first regular season win. Hello! Terevist! M\u0101l\u014d e lelei! To you and yours wherever you\u2019re following our coverage today. Plenty still cracking on (and that\u2019s before we even mention that minor matter of the Rugby World Cup final), so we\u2019ll jump right into that. As always - we\u2019d love to hear your take on things, don\u2019t hesitate to fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation. Not sure what to write? Try high-grade comedy like this: Yes, it\u2019s never too niche for Sportswatch, where we are here solely to help boost your social media metrics. Well, that\u2019s me done for tonight, but I will leave you with the ever-reliable Richard Parkin who will take you through to the end of the evening. There are two more WBBL games about to begin, with the Scorchers coming up against the Stars at the Waca and the Heat battling it out with the Strikers, which should be a cracker of a game. The start of a Victorian derby between Melbourne Victory and Western United in the A-League isn\u2019t too far away either. See you next time! Rugby league: Only six minutes after the half-time break and Tonga have hit back, scoring in the corner to get within two points, but the conversion proved too much and Australia remain in the lead 12-10. Rugby World Cup: The countdown is on to the start of the final - will it be the hot-and-cold Springboks who triumph or the clinical (and possibly slightly evil) England who come out on top? Only time will tell. Lee Calvert is going through all the permutations right now, so please duck over and check those out, but then come back here because we\u2019ve got lots more to discuss here too. A-League: Checking back in on the game at Bankwest now and still no one has been able to break the deadlock, the score remains 0-0. Both keepers have been good this evening, impenetrable walls at either end of the field. It\u2019s an intriguing clash for 2v9 and we\u2019ll keep an eye on how it progresses. Rugby league: Australia 12-6 Tonga at half-time Six minutes after Tonga crossed the line, Australia replied through Jack Wighton, with Paul Vaughan following soon after in the 30th minute. Latrell Mitchell had no trouble with the conversions and the Kangaroos are looking comfortable so far. While Australia have only had 45% of the possession, their stronger conversion rate (88% to Tonga\u2019s 65%) is setting them up well for a strong second half. Not a game for the history books, but a solid win from the Sixers to give them their second victory on the trot and get them back towards their goal of taking out this year\u2019s competition. They made it look harder than it needed to, failing to accelerate enough to lock the game up before the final over, but they got the total in the end, winning by four wickets with one ball to spare. Disappointing for the Renegades, who looked capable of taking more wickets, but appeared to be playing to limit the total rather than a riskier attacking strategy. Maitlan Brown looked the most dangerous with the ball, finishing with 2-18 from her four overs. Dane van Niekerk was awarded player of the match for her 30 from 27 with the bat and 2-15 with the ball. \u201cIt was a tight chase, that 120 mark just got us a little there,\u201d she said after the match. \u201cI enjoyed my bowling, but it was just good to contribute with the bat after being off for a while. It was nice to hit the ball cleanly.\u201d Rugby league: Heading back over to Auckland and it\u2019s Tonga who have drawn first blood against the Kangaroos in the final match of the triple header. Will Hopoate was the try scorer, with Kotoni Staggs nailing the conversion to take the Invitational side to a 6-0 lead with 16 minutes remaining in the first half against their more fancied opponents. WBBL: Perry is still taking it fairly easy, but the lack of pace is going OK for her as she holds down an end while van Niekerk accelerates. It\u2019s an unfamiliar role for the skipper, who is usually the star of the show, but she\u2019s performing it admirably, demonstrating her capability to adjust to the circumstances of a game as needed. The Sixers 87-3 after 15 overs and need 34 runs from 30 balls for victory. The Renegades have done a good job keeping the run rate from exploding, but need to focus on taking wickets now if they want this win. A-League: Wanderers 0-0 Roar at half-time Still all locked up at Bankwest Stadium, with neither team able to score in the first half. This interesting stat might be a good omen for Brisbane in the second half however? Rugby union: This article from Bret Harris struck a chord with readers this week as he reflected on the changes that need to happen at the top to ensure progress and success for the future in rugby. Australian rugby will never achieve sustainable, long-term success until it fixes the key problem that is holding the game back in this country \u2013 the dysfunctional relationship between RA and the Super Rugby franchises. It is a relationship that has been characterised by mistrust and acrimony. The early success of Australian rugby following the advent of the professional era in the mid-1990s camouflaged the divisions within the game. In one brief, shining era the Wallabies held the Bledisloe Cup for five years in a row, won the 1999 World Cup and defeated the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2001, while the Brumbies lifted the Super Rugby title in 2001 and 2004. All of this was accomplished despite a lack of unity of purpose between RA and the Super Rugby franchises. Football: A big win for the Joeys, Australia\u2019s 17 and Under men\u2019s football side, who have progressed to the knockout stages of the World Cup. From AAP: Australia\u2019s under-17 men\u2019s football team have progressed to the knockout phase of World Cup after securing a 2-1 victory over Group B winners Nigeria at the Estadio Bezerrao in Brasilia. A brace from TSG 1899 Hoffenheim attacker Noah Botic - the former National Premier League striker\u2019s third and fourth goals of the tournament - ensured Australia defeated the five-time 17 and Under World Cup winning nation to seal progression as one of the competition\u2019s four best third-placed sides. Nigeria are regular powerhouses at youth international level, and the victory for Trevor Morgan\u2019s side marked Australia\u2019s first win over the African nation at the 17 and Under World Cup in seven attempts. Australia will now face either the winner of Group C (France, Chile or Korea Republic) or Group D (Senegal or Japan) in the last 16 of the tournament next week. \u201cWe came here to win games and, although Nigeria were fantastic, we got the result,\u201d Morgan said post-match. \u201cIt\u2019s a plus for the boys, for their commitment and belief to come here and play a top team and win. We played an excellent team with great quality and great physical capacity (but) the boys were able to keep concentrating, keep working, and in the end the result was fantastic for us.\u201d WBBL: The game is still in the balance after 10 overs with the Sixers at 59-3 and needing a run a ball to win, but the Renegades looking capable of taking regular wickets. While Perry remains at the crease, the Sixers will always be dangerous, but the Renegades have not allowed her to dominate the game as yet - she is currently 19 from 29 balls. Carly Leeson picked up her first wicket for her new club against her old club, tempting Erin Burns with a full toss that was caught on the boundary by Molly Strano. Leeson comes into the match day squad after picking up 4/4 in the Sydney Women\u2019s Premier Cricket league last weekend and will take confidence from her first wicket in red. Dane van Niekerk meanwhile was in no mood to muck around, smashing her first ball for four and nearly repeating the effort with the second ball. A-League: Checking in on the A-League now and it\u2019s 0-0 between the Western Sydney Wanderers and Brisbane Roar after 20 minutes. The Wanderers have lost Pirmin Schwegler to an injury, replaced on the field by Tass Mourdoukoutas. WBBL: It hasn\u2019t been the ideal start to the innings from the Sixers, who lost both Alyssa Healy and Ash Gardner early. But as the old adage about the Sixers WBBL team goes, \u201cAshes to ashes, dust to dust, if Healy don\u2019t get you, Perry must.\u201d The Sixers\u2019 captain is still in the middle, though hampered by a slow scoring rate at the moment with only 13 from 23 balls. However Perry knows how to accelerate and will be looking to put her pedal to the metal once the partnership with Erin Burns is established. Pink Sydney are 28-2 after six overs. England managed to cross that elusive tryline in the end, Daryl Clark managing the feat, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Desperate New Zealand defence held the Brits out and kept them scoreless for the final 12 minutes to take the match. Despite having 53% possession, more run metres and a far superior completion rate, Great Britain couldn\u2019t put the points on the board and it was the Kiwis who emerged victorious. Cricket: Catches win matches, as any Under 10s player worth their salt can tell you and this is one hell of a catch from India\u2019s Harmanpreet Kaur to dismiss West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor. Just... how? Sensational. Rugby World Cup: Some interesting thoughts here from Justin McCurry on whether Japan\u2019s newfound love of rugby will be the RWC\u2019s enduring legacy or if it was just a flash in the pan. \u201cJapanese rugby was built on a narrow base made up mainly of university and company teams,\u201d says Yuichi Kurosaki, the founder of the Minato Rugby School in Tokyo. \u201cBut Japan\u2019s performance at this World Cup could change that. We have kids coming to training for the first time saying they want to emulate the Japanese team\u2019s players.\u201d WBBL: Melbourne Renegades 120-8 after 20 overs It was a decent finish to the innings for Red Melbourne after Ash Gardner took two wickets in two balls to see off Josie Dooley and Maitlan Brown. Former Sixer Carly Leeson put up a good fight alongside Jess Duffin for a little while, scoring seven from five balls before pushing for a run that wasn\u2019t there and being run out by her Universities teammate Maddy Darke. A good spread of wickets for the Sixers, with van Niekerk, Kapp and Gardner each taking two, with two run outs to boot. With the Renegades pushing their run rate up to 6 an over in the end they\u2019ve come up with a defendable total, but there is a lot of strike power in that Pink Sydney batting line and they will be feeling pretty confident about running this total down. Netball: The season is finally over for the Diamonds who have been at it since January, with the Quad Series leading into the Super Netball, the break for the World Cup, back to the Super Netball and finishing with the Constellation Cup. It\u2019s been a gruelling year for many of them, but what have we learnt from it? Erin Delahunty with the questions on everyone\u2019s mind in this article from earlier in the week. Rugby league: Back to the second game of the triple header in Auckland and New Zealand have managed to find the try line! It was Jamayne Isaako who did it, rugby league\u2019s answer to Sir Edmund Hillary. Since he was the one who\u2019d kicked their penalty goal earlier, everyone assumed he\u2019d be best placed to figure out where the scoring happened and by gum they were right. Emboldened by this approach, the Kiwis managed to score again, this time through Corey Harawira-Naera, up 12-2 in the 57th minute. WBBL: The pairing of Beaumont and Webb did get a bit of a wriggle on for a while there (I can only assume someone passed on my message to them) before Webb did take my suggestion and got herself run out for 25. Then Dane van Nierkerk, not wanting to be shown up by her wife, stepped in to take two wickets from the next two balls to leave the Renegades languishing at 71-5 after 15 overs. They\u2019ve increased the run rate to 4.95 but it\u2019s going to be tough to defend unless they have a huge finish to their innings. A-League: We\u2019ve got some A-League coming up later on and just the person to talk you through it jumping into Sportwatch. Our resident football guru Richard Parkin knows more about the A-League than you can poke a stick at and here he was proving it this week with a great article about Australia\u2019s search for world class players. \u201cAcross the nation, post-second world war migrants from Italy, Greece and Croatia banded together to form football clubs, not just for leisure, but for community, identity and a retreat from alienation \u2013 a sense of purpose that came to mean everything. Clubs like Sydney Croatia, South Melbourne Hellas or Marconi became a well-spring not just for talent from within their communities but many from without \u2013 attracted to the game through the culture and passion surrounding it.\u201d Rugby league: And a quick wrap of the Fiji v Samoa game from AAP as well. Fiji upset star-studded Samoa at Eden Park Viliame Kikau has demonstrated why he\u2019s rated one of rugby league\u2019s most destructive running forwards by spearheading Fiji to a 44-18 upset of Samoa. Despite facing a more fancied Samoa side full of NRL experience, Kikau showed them up with a performance that will have Penrith fans salivating. The Panthers star bagged two tries and set up a third for a 24-point halftime lead that Samoa wouldn\u2019t get close to challenging on Saturday. Fiji coach Brandon Costin hailed Kikau\u2019s humility during camp. \u201cHe\u2019s an out-and-out athlete. He\u2019s one of the best NRL players in the game but when he goes into that camp, he\u2019s a locally born and bred Fijian,\u201d Costin said. \u201cThe whole environment within our camp just drops down and there\u2019s a massive sense of humility across these boys that are playing at the top of their game. They don\u2019t have to be so humble. It\u2019s just in their upbringing, they come from a Fijian village and it\u2019s just amazing to be around these humans.\u201d The victory leaves the Bati in the box seat to top group B of the Oceania Cup and earn promotion into group A next year to face New Zealand and Great Britain. Kikau was well-supported by hooker Joe Lovodua, who scored the opening try and assisted on two others. Samoa entered the contest overwhelming favourites on the back of a line-up boasting stars Martin Taupau, Junior Paulo and Joseph Leilua. In contrast, Fiji only had seven players of NRL experience and were missing the likes of Apisai Koroisau, Maika Sivo and Jayson Bukuya. However Samoa were left stunned by a four-try point-a-minute opening ambush orchestrated by Kikau and halfback Brandon Wakeham. They momentarily stemmed the tide with a Tim Lafai try in the 27th minute but Kikau ended any thought of a comeback with a solo effort on halftime. Samoa did get the first of the second half through Taufua but it was all Fiji from there with tries to Isaac Lumelume, Brayden Wiliame and Kevin Naiqama. Taufua and Ronaldo Mulitalo claimed late consolation four-pointers. The lopsided defeat is certain to pile pressure on Samoa coach Matt Parish, whose side now rely on Papua New Guinea heavily upsetting Fiji to top the pool. Samoa has won just one of their past nine games under Parish, who was disappointed in his team\u2019s lack of resiliency. \u201c(Fiji) played with a lot of energy on the back of our mistakes and we had no answers,\u201d Parish said. \u201cI thought we should\u2019ve been a bit more resilient at times, but that\u2019s football.\u201d Fiji also trounced Lebanon 58-14 in an exhibition match earlier this year. Rugby league: Some news out of Auckland, with Kiwi Kieran Foran injured in the first half of the game. From AAP: Kieran Foran has suffered a suspected shoulder injury early in New Zealand\u2019s rugby league Test against Great Britain in Auckland. Foran came reeling out of an attempted tackle on James Graham in the sixth minute on Saturday before heading immediately up the tunnel at Eden Park. The Canterbury star was making his first appearance for the Kiwis in two years after a horror run with injuries. Earlier on Saturday, hooker Brandon Smith was stood down just hours before their contest against the Lions for breaking team protocol. Kiwis officials confirmed Kodi Nikorima would start at hooker. The decision came after coach Michael Maguire dropped star halfback Shaun Johnson following last week\u2019s loss to Australia. WBBL: No further wickets for the Sixers, but they\u2019re keeping it very tight, the Renegades only managing 32-2 at a run rate of 3.2 from the first 10 overs. Tammy Beaumont (14 off 31) and Courtney Webb (4 off 15) are at the crease and quite frankly they should probably try to run each other out, because wickets in hand will mean nothing if they don\u2019t pick up this run rate. They\u2019re both being cramped by the bowling attack and can\u2019t penetrate the field - time to give someone else a shot. Young Stella Campbell has been a highlight of the Sixers\u2019 attack, conceding just one run from her first over and getting some good pace. She has been dominating for Universities in Sydney Women\u2019s Premier Cricket over the past few weeks, so good to see her get a shot here. Rugby league: It\u2019s been a hell of a grind over in Auckland the scores locked at 2-2, with both New Zealand and Great Britain unable to find the try line after the first half. I mean that in the most literal sense, everyone knows rugby league players have the most terrible sense of direction. It\u2019s why we see so many trainers on the field in the NRL, they\u2019re constantly having to round players up, sheep dog style, to get them to find the try line. This is what a game would look like without trainers on the park. Cricket: While we\u2019re on the subject (and let me be clear, now that netball season is over I\u2019m always on the subject of cricket) this was a wonderful read from Sam Perry during the week. Perhaps better known as one-third of The Grade Cricketer twitter account, Perry swaps champing and lamenting about terrible blokes for fascinating analysis in this piece. This paragraph struck me as being applicable to the wider Australian sporting landscape and particularly pertinent to the other big Commonwealth sports - netball and rugby. \u201cAustralia\u2019s fortunes have often suffered at the hands of its own rigid cricketing ideology. We are self-appointed custodians of technique, and how a player is meant to \u201clook\u201d. It means the clever player can be overlooked for the thoroughbred, and there\u2019s an uneasy relationship with the sort of lateral thinking T20 strategy demands. \u201cJust go out and whack \u2018em,\u201d was how we used to do it, pre-Langer.\u201d WBBL: Because too much cricket is never enough, let\u2019s get back to the WBBL where the Sixers have had a fantastic start to the match, keeping the Renegades to 15-2 from their first five overs. Marizanne Kapp has both wickets with figures of 2-9 from her first two overs - down the other end Ellyse Perry has looked a little shaky, with some uncharacteristic wides and no balls, but she is still bowling fairly tightly, only letting six runs through. Sheffield Shield: Victoria have struck early after setting a low total for Tasmania on day three in Hobart. Peter Siddle and Chris Tremain removed both openers cheaply, Beau Webster gone for a duck and Alex Doolan for 16. Tasmania require 107 to win with Matthew Wade and Charlie Wakim to resume after tea. It\u2019s day two in the match between South Australia and NSW at Adelaide Oval. NSW were all out for 289 in their first innings, with debutant Daniel Solway the story of day one, finishing with 133 not out after coming in at number three. In reply, SA are 68-3 with Trent Copeland (best known for being netballer Kim Green\u2019s husband) getting the two openers. Meanwhile up at the Gabba, it\u2019s day one in the match between Queensland and Western Australia. After both Cameron Bancroft and Sam Whiteman were dismissed for ducks, Shaun Marsh and Marcus Stonis have dug in with a big partnership and the wild westerners are 111-2. Rugby league: It was a big win for Fiji over Samoa in the first game of the triple header over in Auckland, taking out the game 44-18. Fiji had six try-scorers for their eight tries, with only Viliame Kikau crossing for a double. The match between New Zealand and England has just got underway, the Kiwis up 2-0 after 10 minutes of play. WBBL: Well, we should have had a game up and running already, but the Hobart weather had other ideas. The match between the Hurricanes and Thunder (I mean, when you think about it, that combination is just asking to be rained out) has been abandoned without a ball bowled. Disappointing for both teams, who are currently sitting in first (Thunder) and third (Hurricanes) spots on the ladder and would have loved to push for a win and continued their early momentum. Play is about to get underway at the WACA, with the Renegades looking to bounce back from their rainsoaked disappointment against the Scorchers last night. They take on the Sixers, who won\u2019t be happy about their current ladder position of sixth, so the game should be a cracker. The Sixers have opted to bowl first in that game, but Ellyse Perry is very sensibly staying well clear of the bat flip after she was nearly donked on the head by one a couple of weeks ago. Good afternoon Sportwatchers and welcome to another huge day of sport. Of course we have the Rugby World Cup final tonight - we\u2019ve got you covered for that with a liveblog of the game from Lee Calvert. Will the Springboks get over the line, or will it be England lifting the Webb Ellis Cup? Actually, we have exclusive live pictures available from the England team\u2019s preparations for you right now: Elsewhere we have some WBBL for you, as well as the rugby league international triple header in Auckland, round 4 of the A-League and a bit of Sheffield Shield. Plenty to get through, so let\u2019s get started.",

At the bill\u2019s heart was a radical proposition: that the \u201cLake Erie ecosystem\u201d should be granted legal personhood, and accorded the consequent rights in law \u2013 including the right \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve\u201d.</p> <p>The Erie Bill of Rights is a brief, passionate, urgent text; reminiscent to me of a scene from a Greek tragedy or an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ibsen\" title=\"\">Ibsen</a> play. \u201cWe, the people of the City of Toledo \u2026 \u201d runs the italicised choral refrain; a \u201crecital\u201d, in legalese. The bill\u2019s phrasing rings with love and rage. It dreams beautifully of an equitable land ethic. \u201cIt has become necessary,\u201d the bill declares, \u201cthat we \u2026 extend legal rights to our natural environment to ensure that the natural world [is] no longer subordinated to the accumulation of surplus wealth and unaccountable political power.\u201d</p> <p>In 1970, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jgballard\" title=\"\">JG Ballard</a> coined the phrase \u201cinvisible literature\u201d to mean \u201cthe vast majority of published documents \u2013 from market research reports, pharmaceutical company house magazines [to] US government reports and medical textbooks\u201d. I take the Erie Bill of Rights to be exemplary of the \u201cinvisible literature\u201d of our Anthropocene moment. At once hopeful and desperate, it is a late-hour attempt to prevent a slow-motion ecocide.</p> <p>Embedded in the bill is a bold ontological claim \u2013 that Lake Erie is a living being, not a bundle of ecosystem services. The bill is, really, a work of what might be called \u201cnew animism\u201d (the word comes from the Latin <em>anima</em>, meaning spirit, breath, life). By reassigning both liveliness and vulnerability to the lake, it displaces Erie from its instrumentalised roles as sump and source. As such, the bill forms part of a broader set of comparable recent legal moves in jurisdictions around the world \u2013 all seeking to recognise interdependence and animacy in the living world, and often advanced by indigenous groups \u2013 which have together come to be known as the \u201cnatural rights\u201d or \u201crights of nature\u201d movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22d870cded37dd13e3d190d73ebfbf42337b09d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22d870cded37dd13e3d190d73ebfbf42337b09d5/0_311_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boat crosses the algae bloom on Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boat crosses the algae bloom on Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aurora Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/28/toledo-lake-erie-personhood-status-bill-of-rights-algae-bloom\">Lake Erie Ecosystem Bill of Rights</a> came before Toledo citizens in a referendum on 26 February; 61% voted for it, and Lake Erie became \u2013 symbolically, temporarily \u2013 a \u201clegal person\u201d. It joined other more-than-human entities accorded various versions of legal personhood, including the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India (though this decision was later overturned by India\u2019s supreme court), the Whanganui River in New Zealand (designated by parliamentary declaration \u201can indivisible and living whole\u201d), the Colombian Amazon, and all nature in Ecuador, which in 2008 famously enshrined the rights of \u201cPachamama\u201d (\u201cMother Nature\u201d) in its constitution (though the subsequent benefit of this enshrining for both indigenous Ecuadorians and nature is highly debatable).</p> <p>At first sight, the rights of nature movement appears potentially forceful as well as intellectually fascinating. To many lawyers and philosophers, however, the assigning of legal personhood to a more than human entity is a profound category error, which can create more problems than it solves. Critics observe that corporations also have standing as legal persons; is it desirable that the Niger Delta might exist in legal affinity with Shell? The plaintiff power of personhood also becomes a liability risk. If a river may bring an action against a factory for polluting it, may a developer in turn sue that river when flood water damages the housing stock? Legal recourses \u2013 in tort, criminal and public law \u2013 already exist to protect nature, and may be thought more robust than rights-based moves, which are often subject to swift challenge or reversal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Campaigners want kinship across species divides to be recognised, and\u00a0ecocide made\u00a0a crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is also the problem of defining \u201cbeing\u201d. Where does a forest begin and end? Is a mountain made of the rain it draws down from the clouds as well as the bedrock that gives it altitude? More political criticisms find the idea of a lake as rights bearer objectionable, given the scant rights extended to many subjugated human groups, or note that when cramming indigenous worldviews into western rights-law frameworks, a colonial distortion is inevitable, however well intentioned the undertaking. Anthropomorphism is also awkwardly central to the natural rights movement. Lakes and forests must undergo transformation into \u201clegal persons\u201d, rather than being recognised as \u201clegal lakes\u201d or \u201clegal forests\u201d. Because a river is unable to stand up in court, a human proxy must inevitably bring an action, determine optimal outcome, and do the river\u2019s talking for it.</p> <p>\u201cWe risk only having respect for things insofar as they resemble human experience and characteristics,\u201d writes Anna Grear, among the best analysts of this movement. \u201cThe law [instead] needs to develop a new framework in which the human is entangled and thrown in the midst of a lively materiality \u2013 rather than assumed to be the masterful, knowing centre.\u201d Or as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/27/thomas-berry-obituary\" title=\"\">Thomas Berry</a> puts it in <em>The Great Work</em>, \u201cTrees have tree rights, insects have insect rights, rivers have river rights, and mountains have mountain rights\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fd8f9183327c9870d883e82ee7575e73f4f8eda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fd8f9183327c9870d883e82ee7575e73f4f8eda/0_259_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pastaza Valley in the Andes.

Nevertheless, there is value to be salvaged from \u2013 and encouraged in \u2013 the natural rights movement. Its messy idealism is a function of desperation; a grapple with David Abrams\u2019s stricken question: \u201cHow can a culture as educated as ours be so oblivious, so reckless, in its relations to the animate earth?\u201d I am sympathetic with the movement\u2019s wish to recognise the more-than-human world as animistically, entanglingly alive, rather than as an inert \u201cstanding reserve\u201d. Like Grear, I find that at its best this young legal movement presses vital questions concerning \u201cjustice to the nonhuman\u201d and requires us to \u201cre-imagine our own state of being in a richer and more open way\u201d. It is one aspect of what she memorably calls the \u201cradical re-storying\u201d of human-nonhuman relations that is now needed to shape \u201ca future worth living\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> <p>Such \u201cradical re-storying\u201d is presently under way across culture, theory, politics and literature, as well as law. It is visible, for example, in the creative protests of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>; in the \u201cnew animist\u201d scholarship of Isabelle Stengers, Abram and Eduardo Kohn; in Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2019s long-term project \u2013 drawing on her dual identity as plant scientist and member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation \u2013 of recovering a \u201cgrammar of animacy\u201d by means of which kinship across species divides can be honoured in language; in forest ecology\u2019s recent revelations concerning the underground mycorrhizal networks that connect individual trees into intercommunicating forests; and in campaigner and barrister Polly Higgins\u2019s work, before her cruelly early death, to realise ecocide as a crime within international law. All these efforts, as Amitav Ghosh puts it, \u201cseek to recognise something we had turned away from: that is to say, the presence and proximity of nonhuman interlocutors\u201d.</p> <p>A turning back towards \u201cnonhuman interlocutors\u201d has also occurred in recent fiction where \u201cland\u201d is encountered as sensate, memorious and even intentful, rather than a static stage set for human actions. From Australia there is the towering body of work \u2013 both novels and essays \u2013 by the lands-rights activist and indigenous writer Alexis Wright, which explore \u201cspecial acts\u201d of rights-giving to nature in both modern law and \u201cancestral stories\u201d. In Britain, I think of Daisy Johnson\u2019s dazzling <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/18/fen-by-daisy-johnson-review-impressive-first-collection-short-stories\" title=\"\">Fen</a> </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/17/everything-under-daisy-johnson-review\" title=\"\">Everything Under</a></em>, Max Porter\u2019s <em>Lanny</em>, Fiona Mozley\u2019s <em>Elmet</em>, Zoe Gilbert\u2019s <em>Folk</em>, Richard Skelton\u2019s <em>Beyond the Fell Wall</em>, and Laura Beatty\u2019s quietly brilliant <em>Pollard</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/07/darkling-women-brilliana-harley-laura-beatty-novel-review\" title=\"\">Darkling</a></em>, in which trees grow through human lives in shaping ways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In recent fiction\u00a0\u2018land\u2019 is encoun\u00adtered as memorious even intentful, rather than a static stage set for human actions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Place, in these works, is not a regressive repository for nativist truths or buried treasures; it is volatile and commotion causing. Land \u2013 to borrow Nan Shepherd\u2019s wonderful verb \u2013 \u201cbristles\u201d; it morphs and causes metamorphosis. \u201cThe soil was alive with ruptured stories that cascaded and rotted,\u201d Mozley writes in <em>Elmet</em>, \u201cthen found form once more and pushed up through the undergrowth and back into our lives.\u201d Johnson\u2019s <em>Fen</em> is a book of jinking prose, in which no sentence or story ends as one might expect from its beginning, and place is the source of shift and transition. Porter\u2019s landscapes remember, utter, worm into and through human bodies. These writers dispute what Stengers, in her essay \u201cRethinking Animism\u201d, calls \u201cthe acceptance [of the] hard truth that we are alone in a mute, blind, yet knowable world \u2013 one that is our task to appropriate\u201d.</p> <p>A new-old animism is also advanced in Richard Powers\u2019s magnificent novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/23/the-overstory-by-richard-powers-review\" title=\"\">The Overstory</a></em>. The US environmentalist and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/18/climate-crisis-oil-war-iraq-saudi-attack-green-energy\" title=\"\">Bill McKibben</a> said that he could not put <em>The Overstory</em> down because it was \u201ca novel that took protest seriously\u201d; it is also a novel that takes trees seriously. It is, really, a vast forest of a novel, with animism its sap. Powers has said that he was \u201ctrying to resurrect a very old form of tree-consciousness, a religion of attention and accommodation \u2026 that credits other forms of life \u2013 indeed, the life-process as a whole \u2013 with wanting something\u201d. Some of the book\u2019s finest scenes occur \u201ctwo hundred feet above the surface of the planet\u201d, in the crown of a California giant redwood nicknamed \u201cMimas\u201d. Living up in the canopy for weeks, the protesters trying to prevent Mimas\u2019s logging come to know the tree as a living community, a sky city. Animism is the driving force of their activism; a belief in the rights of more-than-human beings \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dcd3a48782b20a2bd79c9a7f0eed84c4b6fb2c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcd3a48782b20a2bd79c9a7f0eed84c4b6fb2c9/0_463_3929_2358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Candlelit vigil at Vernon Oak \u2026 a protest against tree felling in Sheffield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candlelit vigil at Vernon Oak \u2026 a protest against tree felling in Sheffield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Holmes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reading Powers\u2019s masterpiece, I was reminded of the Sheffield tree protests, ongoing since 2013, when communities mobilised to prevent their city\u2019s deforestation when it emerged that up to 17,000 street trees might be felled under the blind logic of a Private Finance Initiative contract. The city\u2019s trees were defended legally but also imaginatively. They gained names \u2013 \u201cVernon Oak\u201d, \u201cDuchess Lime\u201d \u2013 and were studied, storied and sung to, becoming newly apprised as neighbours and co-citizens with human inhabitants of the city.</p> <p>The Sheffield tree protesters and Powers are reacting in different ways to what Ghosh in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/amitav-ghosh-where-is-the-fiction-about-climate-change-\" title=\"\">The Great Derangement</a> </em>identifies as the doubled unsettlement of the Anthropocene; an epoch in which Earth is revealing itself as both acutely vulnerable and restlessly lively. \u201cThe uncanny and improbable events that are beating at our doors,\u201d Ghosh writes, \u201cseem to have stirred a sense of recognition \u2026 that humans were never alone, that we have always been surrounded by beings who share elements of that which we thought most distinctively our own: the capacities of will, thought and consciousness.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> <p>The most restlessly lively place I know is Orford Ness, a 10-mile-long shingle spit that curves south along the Suffolk coast like a bracket. The Ness is an offshore desert, an untrue island. Shaped by storm, tide and longshore drift, it is startlingly dynamic. Between 1812 and 1821 alone its length shifted by nearly two miles. If you could view the Ness as an aerial stop-motion film shot over several centuries, you would see its long stone tail whipping around in the North Sea. Because of its isolation, for 70 years (1913\u201383) the Ness was used by the Ministry of Defence for secret weapons testing; from air-gunnery and bombing during the first world war, to the environmental testing of British nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 60s. It is, therefore, a landscape produced by a collision of the human death drive and natural life. Now it is a conservation site like no other, unnerving in its juxtapositions, where decaying ferroconcrete test laboratories are recolonised by moss, bracken and elder to become \u201cgreen chapels\u201d, black-backed gulls build their nests in broken control panels, brown hares big as deer lope across shingle expanses cratered by explosions, and the wind sings in the wires of abandoned perimeter fences.</p> <p>I have returned to Orford Ness dozens of times since my first visit some 15 years ago. There is no English landscape that has haunted me more deeply, or drawn me back more often. And for three years I wrote about it, making \u2013 with the artist Stanley Donwood \u2013 a 96\u2011page book called <em>Ness</em>. I don\u2019t know quite how to describe it: a novella-length prose-poem written to be spoken aloud, perhaps \u2013 or a futile attempt to retell <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em> for the Anthropocene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"495a72cc86d53ae38cc0772241dddcf76ecc3862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495a72cc86d53ae38cc0772241dddcf76ecc3862/0_183_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A former military building in Orford Ness, Suffolk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A former military building in Orford Ness, Suffolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geography Photos/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Ness</em> takes place on an unnamed shingle island, inside a dilapidating concrete structure known as The Green Chapel, where a brutal male figure called The Armourer is leading a nuclear ritual with catastrophic intent. Converging on The Green Chapel are five more-than-human beings, traversing land, sea and time to prevent the ritual\u2019s fulfilment: \u201cShe nears Ness. Her skin is lichen &amp; her flesh is moss &amp; her bones are fungi &amp; she breathes spores. She is wired into the world. There are miles of her in each pinch of soil \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>The figure of The Armourer inevitably echoes certain male autocrats currently occupying seats of power, and <em>Ness</em> is surfacing into a contemporary moment of protest against the living world\u2019s systemic annihilation. But its form was influenced by ancient precedents, including medieval mystery play cycles and the early Irish bardic poem \u201cBuile Suibhne\u201d (translated as \u201cSweeney Astray\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/seamusheaney\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney</a>). It also has origins in my surprise, rereading <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/08/beowulf-old-english-poem-work-one-author-research-suggests\" title=\"\">Beowulf</a></em> and the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, at how central natural destruction is to both these founding texts of literature. Gilgamesh travels to the Cedar Forest where he sets about felling the great trees. Beowulf leaves the mead hall to wage war on the \u201cwilde\u00f3r\u201d (wild creatures) of marsh and moor. In <em>Ness</em>, this order is reversed. It wonders instead what happens when land itself comes alive and seeks to thwart human rapacity. Ness is eerie in the sense Skelton uses that word; \u201cengaging with \u2018the eerie\u2019 is fundamentally an acknowledgement of life beyond our own species \u2026 about probing that complex, troubling relationship between humans and others.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/01/bad-ancestors-climate-crisis-democracy\">Bad ancestors: does the climate crisis violate the rights of those yet to be born?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A recurring object in <em>Ness</em> is the \u201chagstone\u201d; a pebble with a hole worn naturally through it. Many hagstones are cast up on the foreshore of Orford Ness. In folklore across Europe, to look through such a stone is to see into the future, the past or the afterlife. In <em>Ness</em>, the hagstone is an optic through which one can see nature come alive in its own right, with its own powers.</p> <p>The biologist EO Wilson has warned that, as the extinction rate climbs, humans are entering \u201cThe Eremocene\u201d \u2013 the Age of Loneliness. The most recent State of Nature report, published last month, found one in seven UK species to be at risk of disappearance. Research released in September showed North America to have lost 3 billion birds \u2013 29% of total population \u2013 in 50 years. The dryads and naiads of classical myth, those lively spirits of trees and streams, have long since been driven out. Now birds, mammals, plants and insects are vanishing too, leaving humans increasingly alone in the world. The new animism, if we can call it that, of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights, of <em>The Overstory</em>, of <em>Ness</em>, of <em>Fen</em>, of Sheffield, may be heard as a cry into \u2013 and against \u2013 such desolating solitude.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly said that Toledo city councillors drew up the Lake Erie Bill of Rights.

      "bodyText": "On 26 February 2019, a lake became human. For years, Lake Erie \u2013 the southernmost of the Great Lakes \u2013 has been in ecological crisis. Invasive species are rampant. Biodiversity is crashing. Each summer, blue-green algae blooms in volumes visible from space, creating toxic \u201cdead zones\u201d; the algae is nourished by fertiliser and slurry pollution from surrounding farms. In August 2014, phosphorus run-off so fouled Erie that the city of Toledo, at the lake\u2019s western tip in Ohio, lost drinking water for three days in the hottest part of the year. Appalled by the lake\u2019s degradation, and exhausted by state and federal failures to improve Erie\u2019s health, in December 2018 Toledo residents drew up an extraordinary document: an emergency \u201cbill of rights\u201d for Lake Erie. At the bill\u2019s heart was a radical proposition: that the \u201cLake Erie ecosystem\u201d should be granted legal personhood, and accorded the consequent rights in law \u2013 including the right \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve\u201d. The Erie Bill of Rights is a brief, passionate, urgent text; reminiscent to me of a scene from a Greek tragedy or an Ibsen play. \u201cWe, the people of the City of Toledo \u2026 \u201d runs the italicised choral refrain; a \u201crecital\u201d, in legalese.

I take the Erie Bill of Rights to be exemplary of the \u201cinvisible literature\u201d of our Anthropocene moment. At once hopeful and desperate, it is a late-hour attempt to prevent a slow-motion ecocide. Embedded in the bill is a bold ontological claim \u2013 that Lake Erie is a living being, not a bundle of ecosystem services. The bill is, really, a work of what might be called \u201cnew animism\u201d (the word comes from the Latin anima, meaning spirit, breath, life). By reassigning both liveliness and vulnerability to the lake, it displaces Erie from its instrumentalised roles as sump and source. As such, the bill forms part of a broader set of comparable recent legal moves in jurisdictions around the world \u2013 all seeking to recognise interdependence and animacy in the living world, and often advanced by indigenous groups \u2013 which have together come to be known as the \u201cnatural rights\u201d or \u201crights of nature\u201d movement. The Lake Erie Ecosystem Bill of Rights came before Toledo citizens in a referendum on 26 February; 61% voted for it, and Lake Erie became \u2013 symbolically, temporarily \u2013 a \u201clegal person\u201d.

To many lawyers and philosophers, however, the assigning of legal personhood to a more than human entity is a profound category error, which can create more problems than it solves. Critics observe that corporations also have standing as legal persons; is it desirable that the Niger Delta might exist in legal affinity with Shell? The plaintiff power of personhood also becomes a liability risk. If a river may bring an action against a factory for polluting it, may a developer in turn sue that river when flood water damages the housing stock? Legal recourses \u2013 in tort, criminal and public law \u2013 already exist to protect nature, and may be thought more robust than rights-based moves, which are often subject to swift challenge or reversal. There is also the problem of defining \u201cbeing\u201d. Where does a forest begin and end? Is a mountain made of the rain it draws down from the clouds as well as the bedrock that gives it altitude? More political criticisms find the idea of a lake as rights bearer objectionable, given the scant rights extended to many subjugated human groups, or note that when cramming indigenous worldviews into western rights-law frameworks, a colonial distortion is inevitable, however well intentioned the undertaking. Anthropomorphism is also awkwardly central to the natural rights movement. Lakes and forests must undergo transformation into \u201clegal persons\u201d, rather than being recognised as \u201clegal lakes\u201d or \u201clegal forests\u201d. Because a river is unable to stand up in court, a human proxy must inevitably bring an action, determine optimal outcome, and do the river\u2019s talking for it. \u201cWe risk only having respect for things insofar as they resemble human experience and characteristics,\u201d writes Anna Grear, among the best analysts of this movement. \u201cThe law [instead] needs to develop a new framework in which the human is entangled and thrown in the midst of a lively materiality \u2013 rather than assumed to be the masterful, knowing centre.\u201d Or as Thomas Berry puts it in The Great Work, \u201cTrees have tree rights, insects have insect rights, rivers have river rights, and mountains have mountain rights\u201d. These are all good criticisms. Nevertheless, there is value to be salvaged from \u2013 and encouraged in \u2013 the natural rights movement. Its messy idealism is a function of desperation; a grapple with David Abrams\u2019s stricken question: \u201cHow can a culture as educated as ours be so oblivious, so reckless, in its relations to the animate earth?\u201d I am sympathetic with the movement\u2019s wish to recognise the more-than-human world as animistically, entanglingly alive, rather than as an inert \u201cstanding reserve\u201d. Like Grear, I find that at its best this young legal movement presses vital questions concerning \u201cjustice to the nonhuman\u201d and requires us to \u201cre-imagine our own state of being in a richer and more open way\u201d. It is one aspect of what she memorably calls the \u201cradical re-storying\u201d of human-nonhuman relations that is now needed to shape \u201ca future worth living\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Such \u201cradical re-storying\u201d is presently under way across culture, theory, politics and literature, as well as law. It is visible, for example, in the creative protests of Extinction Rebellion; in the \u201cnew animist\u201d scholarship of Isabelle Stengers, Abram and Eduardo Kohn; in Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2019s long-term project \u2013 drawing on her dual identity as plant scientist and member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation \u2013 of recovering a \u201cgrammar of animacy\u201d by means of which kinship across species divides can be honoured in language; in forest ecology\u2019s recent revelations concerning the underground mycorrhizal networks that connect individual trees into intercommunicating forests; and in campaigner and barrister Polly Higgins\u2019s work, before her cruelly early death, to realise ecocide as a crime within international law. All these efforts, as Amitav Ghosh puts it, \u201cseek to recognise something we had turned away from: that is to say, the presence and proximity of nonhuman interlocutors\u201d. A turning back towards \u201cnonhuman interlocutors\u201d has also occurred in recent fiction where \u201cland\u201d is encountered as sensate, memorious and even intentful, rather than a static stage set for human actions. From Australia there is the towering body of work \u2013 both novels and essays \u2013 by the lands-rights activist and indigenous writer Alexis Wright, which explore \u201cspecial acts\u201d of rights-giving to nature in both modern law and \u201cancestral stories\u201d. In Britain, I think of Daisy Johnson\u2019s dazzling Fen and Everything Under, Max Porter\u2019s Lanny, Fiona Mozley\u2019s Elmet, Zoe Gilbert\u2019s Folk, Richard Skelton\u2019s Beyond the Fell Wall, and Laura Beatty\u2019s quietly brilliant Pollard and Darkling, in which trees grow through human lives in shaping ways. Place, in these works, is not a regressive repository for nativist truths or buried treasures; it is volatile and commotion causing. Land \u2013 to borrow Nan Shepherd\u2019s wonderful verb \u2013 \u201cbristles\u201d; it morphs and causes metamorphosis. \u201cThe soil was alive with ruptured stories that cascaded and rotted,\u201d Mozley writes in Elmet, \u201cthen found form once more and pushed up through the undergrowth and back into our lives.\u201d Johnson\u2019s Fen is a book of jinking prose, in which no sentence or story ends as one might expect from its beginning, and place is the source of shift and transition. Porter\u2019s landscapes remember, utter, worm into and through human bodies. These writers dispute what Stengers, in her essay \u201cRethinking Animism\u201d, calls \u201cthe acceptance [of the] hard truth that we are alone in a mute, blind, yet knowable world \u2013 one that is our task to appropriate\u201d. A new-old animism is also advanced in Richard Powers\u2019s magnificent novel The Overstory. The US environmentalist and author Bill McKibben said that he could not put The Overstory down because it was \u201ca novel that took protest seriously\u201d; it is also a novel that takes trees seriously. It is, really, a vast forest of a novel, with animism its sap. Powers has said that he was \u201ctrying to resurrect a very old form of tree-consciousness, a religion of attention and accommodation \u2026 that credits other forms of life \u2013 indeed, the life-process as a whole \u2013 with wanting something\u201d. Some of the book\u2019s finest scenes occur \u201ctwo hundred feet above the surface of the planet\u201d, in the crown of a California giant redwood nicknamed \u201cMimas\u201d. Living up in the canopy for weeks, the protesters trying to prevent Mimas\u2019s logging come to know the tree as a living community, a sky city. Animism is the driving force of their activism; a belief in the rights of more-than-human beings \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve\u201d. Reading Powers\u2019s masterpiece, I was reminded of the Sheffield tree protests, ongoing since 2013, when communities mobilised to prevent their city\u2019s deforestation when it emerged that up to 17,000 street trees might be felled under the blind logic of a Private Finance Initiative contract. The city\u2019s trees were defended legally but also imaginatively. They gained names \u2013 \u201cVernon Oak\u201d, \u201cDuchess Lime\u201d \u2013 and were studied, storied and sung to, becoming newly apprised as neighbours and co-citizens with human inhabitants of the city. The Sheffield tree protesters and Powers are reacting in different ways to what Ghosh in The Great Derangement identifies as the doubled unsettlement of the Anthropocene; an epoch in which Earth is revealing itself as both acutely vulnerable and restlessly lively. \u201cThe uncanny and improbable events that are beating at our doors,\u201d Ghosh writes, \u201cseem to have stirred a sense of recognition \u2026 that humans were never alone, that we have always been surrounded by beings who share elements of that which we thought most distinctively our own: the capacities of will, thought and consciousness.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The most restlessly lively place I know is Orford Ness, a 10-mile-long shingle spit that curves south along the Suffolk coast like a bracket. The Ness is an offshore desert, an untrue island. Shaped by storm, tide and longshore drift, it is startlingly dynamic. Between 1812 and 1821 alone its length shifted by nearly two miles. If you could view the Ness as an aerial stop-motion film shot over several centuries, you would see its long stone tail whipping around in the North Sea. Because of its isolation, for 70 years (1913\u201383) the Ness was used by the Ministry of Defence for secret weapons testing; from air-gunnery and bombing during the first world war, to the environmental testing of British nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 60s. It is, therefore, a landscape produced by a collision of the human death drive and natural life. Now it is a conservation site like no other, unnerving in its juxtapositions, where decaying ferroconcrete test laboratories are recolonised by moss, bracken and elder to become \u201cgreen chapels\u201d, black-backed gulls build their nests in broken control panels, brown hares big as deer lope across shingle expanses cratered by explosions, and the wind sings in the wires of abandoned perimeter fences. I have returned to Orford Ness dozens of times since my first visit some 15 years ago. There is no English landscape that has haunted me more deeply, or drawn me back more often. And for three years I wrote about it, making \u2013 with the artist Stanley Donwood \u2013 a 96\u2011page book called Ness. I don\u2019t know quite how to describe it: a novella-length prose-poem written to be spoken aloud, perhaps \u2013 or a futile attempt to retell Sir Gawain and the Green Knight for the Anthropocene. Ness takes place on an unnamed shingle island, inside a dilapidating concrete structure known as The Green Chapel, where a brutal male figure called The Armourer is leading a nuclear ritual with catastrophic intent. Converging on The Green Chapel are five more-than-human beings, traversing land, sea and time to prevent the ritual\u2019s fulfilment: \u201cShe nears Ness. Her skin is lichen &amp; her flesh is moss &amp; her bones are fungi &amp; she breathes spores. She is wired into the world. There are miles of her in each pinch of soil \u2026 \u201d The figure of The Armourer inevitably echoes certain male autocrats currently occupying seats of power, and Ness is surfacing into a contemporary moment of protest against the living world\u2019s systemic annihilation. But its form was influenced by ancient precedents, including medieval mystery play cycles and the early Irish bardic poem \u201cBuile Suibhne\u201d (translated as \u201cSweeney Astray\u201d by Seamus Heaney). It also has origins in my surprise, rereading Beowulf and the Epic of Gilgamesh, at how central natural destruction is to both these founding texts of literature. Gilgamesh travels to the Cedar Forest where he sets about felling the great trees. Beowulf leaves the mead hall to wage war on the \u201cwilde\u00f3r\u201d (wild creatures) of marsh and moor. In Ness, this order is reversed. It wonders instead what happens when land itself comes alive and seeks to thwart human rapacity. Ness is eerie in the sense Skelton uses that word; \u201cengaging with \u2018the eerie\u2019 is fundamentally an acknowledgement of life beyond our own species \u2026 about probing that complex, troubling relationship between humans and others.\u201d A recurring object in Ness is the \u201chagstone\u201d; a pebble with a hole worn naturally through it. Many hagstones are cast up on the foreshore of Orford Ness. In folklore across Europe, to look through such a stone is to see into the future, the past or the afterlife. In Ness, the hagstone is an optic through which one can see nature come alive in its own right, with its own powers. The biologist EO Wilson has warned that, as the extinction rate climbs, humans are entering \u201cThe Eremocene\u201d \u2013 the Age of Loneliness. The most recent State of Nature report, published last month, found one in seven UK species to be at risk of disappearance. Research released in September showed North America to have lost 3 billion birds \u2013 29% of total population \u2013 in 50 years. The dryads and naiads of classical myth, those lively spirits of trees and streams, have long since been driven out. Now birds, mammals, plants and insects are vanishing too, leaving humans increasingly alone in the world. The new animism, if we can call it that, of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights, of The Overstory, of Ness, of Fen, of Sheffield, may be heard as a cry into \u2013 and against \u2013 such desolating solitude. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly said that Toledo city councillors drew up the Lake Erie Bill of Rights. That document was drawn up by residents of Toledo. \u2022 Ness by Robert Macfarlane and Stanley Donwood is published by Hamish Hamilton. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

      "body": "<h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>I studied engineering at Cambridge: it\u2019s fascinating to test the technical innovations first-hand\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Oliver Turvey, 32, Formula </strong><strong>One test driver, Penrith</strong></p> <p>I started racing karts when I was eight at my local track in Cumbria. I won my first national championship when I was 12, and my second, in a different class, when I was 15. The following year I progressed to racing single-seater cars. It was a struggle. Motor sport is really expensive and my family didn\u2019t have the money, but we managed to find some sponsorship.</p> <p>I had some successful years in the Formula BMW UK Championship and got nominated for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year award at the age of 19, which I went on to win. That was quite a turning point. The prize included a test drive in a McLaren F1 car. That first test went really well and I signed for the team as a test driver at the end of the year.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, test drivers did a lot of track testing. Nowadays, that\u2019s quite limited. Access to the cars is difficult and the race drivers themselves want to track-test as much as possible. But, most years, I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to drive the car for a couple of days at least. Most of my time at McLaren is spent driving the simulator in the team\u2019s factory in Woking. In the short term, it\u2019s about working on the car\u2019s set-up for the next race. In the medium term, it\u2019s working on developing the car through the season. And then there\u2019s the long term, adapting the design of next year\u2019s car within any new regulations that are coming in.</p> <p>I studied engineering at Cambridge, and have always been interested in the technical side. You get to see the developments and innovations first-hand \u2013 they all come through the simulator before the car is manufactured. Other test drivers are maybe less interested in this aspect. Perhaps my fascination for it is why I\u2019ve been a test driver for 10 years; I\u2019m one of the longest-standing in Formula One.</p> <p>It\u2019s important for a race driver to have someone they believe in. Every time a new driver comes in, they want to understand your role and to trust that you\u2019re improving the car for them. And you need to understand what they want from the car. At each post-race debrief, we listen back to the drivers on their radios to hear their feedback.</p> <p>As a kid, racing in Formula One was obviously the dream. Being a test driver can be a route to one of the racing spots in a team \u2013 you always hope you have the chance to step up one day. But there are few opportunities. There are only 20 seats in a season \u2013 it\u2019s a very tough environment. It won\u2019t happen for me now.</p> <p>At the same time as testing for McLaren, though, I have been able to develop my career as a race driver. I\u2019ve raced across many formulas, including Formula Three and GP2. I\u2019ve also won the Le Mans 24-Hour race in the LMP2 class. I currently race in Formula E, the class that solely uses electric-powered cars, so I still carry a dream of becoming a world champion. McLaren have been very flexible in working around my racing schedule: they think it\u2019s good for me to be race-sharp.</p> <p>I feel very proud to have made a career out of motor sport. Many of the guys I used to race didn\u2019t even progress from karting. Even if I didn\u2019t quite reach the pinnacle of Formula One, being a test driver for one of the top teams has been the next best thing.</p> <h2>\u2018People study for degrees in their dressing room.

But the bigger the productions that I\u2019ve worked on since, the more understudying work I\u2019ve done. I was the understudy for the role of Hermione Granger, played by Noma Dumezweni, in <a href=\"https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/\" title=\"\">Harry Potter </a><a href=\"https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/\" title=\"\">And </a><a href=\"https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/\" title=\"\">The Cursed Child</a> for three and a half years. Over that time, I was Hermione on just eight occasions.</p> <p>I\u2019ve just finished a run in a production of The Color Purple. I had a featured role as Darlene, but was also an understudy for the part of Shug Avery. I had an understudy for my featured role and so, if I needed to become Shug Avery, my understudy would step up. Having both a featured role and being an understudy in the same production is really common; most understudies have responsibility elsewhere.</p> <p>Nobody becomes an actor to be an understudy. We\u2019re all ambitious, but you have to be patient. A standard West End production will have eight shows a week, spread over either five or six days. We are required to be at the theatre for every performance \u2013 even if we\u2019re just sitting in our dressing rooms. There are always ways to keep yourself busy and engaged off stage. During my time at Harry Potter, when not on stage in my ensemble role, I would regularly work on the script and the character of the role. I\u2019d also watch the show from the wings to stay as connected as possible. If you need to go on, you need to be there.</p> <p>You might not have the same level of contact with your director as the principal actor, so you\u2019ve got to be really on the ball. You always have to be at the point of emotional and physical preparedness, in order to go on at the drop of a hat. Your adrenaline levels are always high. You\u2019ve got to keep sharp and stimulated, too \u2013 boredom can have a huge impact on you psychologically. I know people who study for degrees in their dressing room. In fact, I did my master\u2019s in music while understudying.</p> <p>Do understudies get on with lead actors? Everyone is different; sometimes personalities knit nicely together, other times they don\u2019t. But generally speaking, a company of actors will endeavour to work well together for the good of the production. I\u2019ve always been fortunate enough to work in that way.</p> <p>I\u2019ll look back fondly on my understudy days, without a shadow of a doubt. Being an actor is not just about the role itself \u2013 it\u2019s about the company, the project, the content. Understudying has taught me about self\u2011belief. You need to have a heck of a lot of it \u2013 and those lessons filter into the rest of your life.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You\u2019re not part of the evening, you\u2019re a footnote\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mark Olver, 44, TV warm-up </strong><strong>act, </strong><strong>Bristol</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f4e099dd9820c03d8805e560e8601db9b7bc6a74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4e099dd9820c03d8805e560e8601db9b7bc6a74/2493_1629_4085_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Olver, warm-up comedian, on the set of 8 out of 10 Cats do Countdown at Media City in Manchester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Olver: \u2018The job is a combination of standup, cabin crew and holiday camp redcoat.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started doing standup in the late 90s, in exactly the same way that every other comedian does \u2013 clubs, open spots, gigging all over the place. </p> <p>But I worked out early on that compering was something I could do, too. In 2004, there was a Channel 4 show, Kings Of Comedy, where standup comedians lived together in a Big Brother-style house. Every week they\u2019d do a gig and the least good person would be evicted. Beforehand, the production team wanted to see how a comedy club worked and, because it was being made in Bristol, they came to see one of the nights I compered. When they started doing the live eviction show, hosted by Russell Brand, they asked me to do the warm-up.</p> <p>I did a few more warm-ups the following year, and then Deal Or No Deal started, which I did for more than 10 years. I now do a lot of shows. I\u2019m the warm-up on Have I Got News For You, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0btc4d3\" title=\"\">Vic &amp; Bob\u2019s Big Night Out</a>, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-last-leg\" title=\"\">The Last Leg</a>, and loads more.</p> <p>The core task of warm-up is the same as standup: it\u2019s communicating with people \u2013 making them comfortable, making them laugh. The job is a combination of standup, cabin crew and holiday camp redcoat. A lot of it is housekeeping, so I try to find the funniest way to do it. I have jokes about every element of the studio experience: health and safety, fire exits, mobile phones. I joke about getting a young person to turn off your mobile phone for you, about drug dealers and doctors having a night off, about teenagers struggling to go two hours without Instagram. There\u2019s lots of admin. There\u2019s getting the right shots for the director, and there\u2019s making sure the audience aren\u2019t worn out before the show begins. I sometimes need to slow them down, because I want them to still have energy in four-and-a-half hours\u2019 time.</p> <p>With standup, the crowd has come to see you, or at least a night you are part of. With warm-up, you\u2019re not an expected part of the evening \u2013 you\u2019re an appendix or footnote. It\u2019s not the place to experiment with quirky material \u2013 the warm-up has to fit with the tone of the show.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a break in the recording, you have to plug the gap; one skill I have is that I can just talk for ever. I\u2019m happy discussing the perfect burger or the best biscuit or my favourite service station ad nauseam \u2013 I think I\u2019m a naturally funny person. Once, on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, I was told I only needed to do five minutes, because everyone was ready, but the floor manager came up to me and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. Someone\u2019s refusing to sign a contract.\u201d And I was on for an hour.</p> <p>Lots of other people who do warm-up aren\u2019t comics; they may have come from cruise ships or holiday camps. There are a few standups on the circuit who do warm-up, but not many enjoy it, as the ego has to be left at the door.</p> <p>If I met someone at a party, I\u2019d still describe myself as a standup. I\u2019ve got a gig in Halifax later this week, sandwiched between doing Pointless today, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-great-british-bake-off-an-extra-slice\" title=\"\">The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice</a> on Sunday and 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown on Monday. It\u2019s a varied life and I\u2019ve done warm-ups around the world: in Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Rio. It\u2019s lovely to be a full-time comedian and I\u2019m really well-paid. </p> <p>I\u2019ve got standup friends who are now superstars \u2013 I used to live with both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/russell-howard\" title=\"\">Russell Howard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/jon-richardson\" title=\"\">Jon Richardson</a>. But I\u2019m very happy where I am. Whatever level you\u2019re at in comedy, there\u2019s always someone above you, so you have to find a place where you\u2019re at ease. And I am considered one of the best at what I do, even though it\u2019s quite niche. When Richard Osman introduces me to people, he says, \u201cThis is Mark Olver. He\u2019s the best warm-up in the world.\u201d I would never say that myself, but I\u2019m glad that he does.</p> <h2>\u2018I nearly lost both legs a couple of years ago. Just sitting on the bench is an achievement\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Eartha Cumings, 20, </strong><strong>second-choice goalkeeper</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Bristol City</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ef04a4e9e1ff0bc6ec7bcda4cbca1e26775f111\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ef04a4e9e1ff0bc6ec7bcda4cbca1e26775f111/0_125_6266_3900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eartha Cumings, goalkeeper for Bristol City Ladies FC, at the club's ground SGS College Campus in Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"622\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eartha Cumings at the Bristol City Ladies FC ground: \u2018It can be quite isolating.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been a goalkeeper since I started playing football at the age of five with the local boys\u2019 team in Edinburgh. I joined Bristol City in the summer of 2018, but only turned professional this summer. Last season I was combining football with studying ancient history at university. But that went a bit sideways as I was spreading myself too thin, so I decided to leave uni and focus on football.</p> <p>I made two appearances for the first team last season: one in the Continental Tyres League Cup and one in the FA Cup. The Conti Cup game against Aston Villa was played in torrential rain. We were winning 4-0, but I slipped in the mud and they scored. Not a dream debut. But we won the FA Cup game 3-0, so it was relatively easy.</p> <p>During the week, I do the same training and gym sessions as the first-choice goalkeeper, Sophie Baggaley. The only difference is that, at the weekend, I\u2019m on the bench and Sophie is on the pitch. I\u2019m sitting down and she\u2019s standing up.</p> <p>There\u2019s a danger that, knowing the chances of actually playing on Sunday are low, you just go through the motions. You\u2019ve got to motivate yourself. There could be an injury at any moment and you\u2019d be in at the deep end. It\u2019s hard to feel ready, and keep feeling ready, for something that\u2019s probably not going to happen. It can be quite isolating. Outfield players can at least come on for five or 10 minutes at the end of the game, but with goalkeepers it\u2019s all or nothing. It\u2019s tough: it can make you feel as if you\u2019re not part of the team.</p> <p>You can\u2019t wish ill on the first-choice keeper though. I respect that Sophie\u2019s better than me and we are great friends, despite us vying for the same spot. Maybe if you didn\u2019t get on with the first-choice keeper, you\u2019d go to the coach and shout about it: \u201cWhy am I not playing?\u201d</p> <p>Because they don\u2019t get game time, understudy goalkeepers have to show the best of themselves in training. That\u2019s their audition. I don\u2019t have to dislodge Sophie this year. At the end of my 12-month contract, it won\u2019t be \u201cEartha\u2019s not number one, so she\u2019s out\u201d; it\u2019s more that I have to be pushing myself and pushing Sophie \u2013 blurring the line between the number one and number two. The club want the best goalkeeper, regardless of who that is. It can be hard to maintain concentration and motivation to prove myself every day when, more than likely, at the end of the week I won\u2019t be the one who\u2019s playing. But if I decide to stop trying, I will be damaging Sophie\u2019s chances of improving, too.</p> <p>This year will hopefully be the year I can really kick on. I have international ambitions, too. I\u2019ve played for Scotland under-19s, and I want to play in the World Cup for the full side. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, I nearly lost both my legs. I got <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/compartment-syndrome/\" title=\"\">compartment syndrome</a>. During a fairly routine operation for a health condition, there was a problem with oxygen flow getting to the muscles and they began to swell up and up. If not operated on in time, compartment syndrome results in the breakdown and death of your muscles. I had to sign a form giving the surgeons permission to amputate if the operation went wrong. I was a footballer and my life was in my legs. I had to have numerous surgeries to repair the injury and spent a good bit of time on crutches. Nearly losing the opportunity to play football changed my outlook. Even if I\u2019m just sitting on the bench, I still think that\u2019s a huge achievement.</p> <h2>\u2018If I took Richard Hawley\u2019s place, people would ask for their money back\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Gordon White, 56, </strong><strong>guitar roadie</strong><strong>, Leeds</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1ff7008a36faa40da02974f022827fcc689bb2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1ff7008a36faa40da02974f022827fcc689bb2d/349_154_6246_4153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gordon White, guitar maintenance and tech man, at his workshop at Blueberry Hill Studios in Leeds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon White at Blueberry Hill Studios in Leeds: \u2018If you\u2019ve ever been in a band, you always regret packing it in.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I went to art college. Everyone there pretends to be a painter or a sculptor, but it\u2019s just a way of getting into bands. We described our band as punk-skiffle, a description we made up, because it fitted what we did: you played whatever instrument you were given or had found in a skip. We made a godawful racket. We were technically appalling, but we had the enthusiasm of youth.</p> <p>We were doing gigs around Leeds, but I had some friends who were in a band called Cud and they were doing a fair bit better; they were gigging beyond Leeds and getting <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/c/cud\" title=\"\">John Peel sessions</a>. One day they had a gig in Preston and they were looking for someone to drive them. \u201cCan you drive?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCan you hire a van and drive us to Preston?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll give you \u00a310 for it.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d</p> <p>So a driving licence was the most important qualification I ever got. Then it became, \u201cCan you set the amps up? Can you tune the guitars?\u201d Cud started playing bigger gigs in bigger venues and you\u2019d bump into other bands on the road. They\u2019d say, \u201cOh, we need someone, too.\u201d Before I knew it, it was a job.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-hawley\" title=\"\"> Richard Hawley</a> for about 12 years. Anywhere he has to plug in a guitar \u2013 including in-store shows or TV and radio appearances \u2013 I\u2019ll be there. I can do a couple of weeks touring with him and then come back and get on with things in my workshop. We\u2019re all of a certain age and we\u2019ve all got kids and families. None of us are remotely interested in the one\u2011and-a-half-years-away-from-home thing.</p> <p>On tour, a big chunk of the day will be spent setting everything up on stage: amps, pedals and the like. Richard uses four amps and about 30 pedals. They surround him in a semi-circle \u2013 an arc of guitar noise. He also uses about 12 guitars per gig; it\u2019s virtually a guitar change with every song. Once the PA is set up, I tend to do a soundcheck by having a go on a couple of the guitars, making a bit of a racket and making sure all the pedals do what they should be doing. I need to make it sound the same as it did the night before \u2013 what I heard when I stood in the middle of that arc of noise 24 hours earlier.</p> <p>Through working with Richard, I ended up working with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/28/duane-eddy-review\" title=\"\">Duane Eddy</a>, as his guitar tech when he comes to the UK. I\u2019ve also worked with the Cure, Joe Strummer, Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/21/tindersticks-the-waiting-room-review-life-to-the-loucheness\" title=\"\">Tindersticks</a> and Embrace.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve been in a band, you always regret packing it in. Life gets in the way and you have a mortgage to pay. But I couldn\u2019t contemplate being able to do what Richard does: his skill as a songwriter, singer and guitarist is at such a level. </p> <p>Richard needs me, and I need him, but I don\u2019t think he could do my job, and I certainly couldn\u2019t do his. If something terrible happened and Richard couldn\u2019t do a gig one night, but they decided to go ahead with me in his place, I think there\u2019d be a lot of people asking for their money back.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I studied engineering at Cambridge: it\u2019s fascinating to test the technical innovations first-hand\u2019 Oliver Turvey, 32, Formula One test driver, Penrith I started racing karts when I was eight at my local track in Cumbria. I won my first national championship when I was 12, and my second, in a different class, when I was 15. The following year I progressed to racing single-seater cars. It was a struggle. Motor sport is really expensive and my family didn\u2019t have the money, but we managed to find some sponsorship. I had some successful years in the Formula BMW UK Championship and got nominated for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year award at the age of 19, which I went on to win. That was quite a turning point. The prize included a test drive in a McLaren F1 car. That first test went really well and I signed for the team as a test driver at the end of the year. In the early 2000s, test drivers did a lot of track testing. Nowadays, that\u2019s quite limited. Access to the cars is difficult and the race drivers themselves want to track-test as much as possible. But, most years, I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to drive the car for a couple of days at least. Most of my time at McLaren is spent driving the simulator in the team\u2019s factory in Woking. In the short term, it\u2019s about working on the car\u2019s set-up for the next race. In the medium term, it\u2019s working on developing the car through the season. And then there\u2019s the long term, adapting the design of next year\u2019s car within any new regulations that are coming in. I studied engineering at Cambridge, and have always been interested in the technical side. You get to see the developments and innovations first-hand \u2013 they all come through the simulator before the car is manufactured. Other test drivers are maybe less interested in this aspect. Perhaps my fascination for it is why I\u2019ve been a test driver for 10 years; I\u2019m one of the longest-standing in Formula One. It\u2019s important for a race driver to have someone they believe in. Every time a new driver comes in, they want to understand your role and to trust that you\u2019re improving the car for them. And you need to understand what they want from the car. At each post-race debrief, we listen back to the drivers on their radios to hear their feedback. As a kid, racing in Formula One was obviously the dream. Being a test driver can be a route to one of the racing spots in a team \u2013 you always hope you have the chance to step up one day. But there are few opportunities. There are only 20 seats in a season \u2013 it\u2019s a very tough environment. It won\u2019t happen for me now. At the same time as testing for McLaren, though, I have been able to develop my career as a race driver. I\u2019ve raced across many formulas, including Formula Three and GP2. I\u2019ve also won the Le Mans 24-Hour race in the LMP2 class. I currently race in Formula E, the class that solely uses electric-powered cars, so I still carry a dream of becoming a world champion. McLaren have been very flexible in working around my racing schedule: they think it\u2019s good for me to be race-sharp. I feel very proud to have made a career out of motor sport. Many of the guys I used to race didn\u2019t even progress from karting. Even if I didn\u2019t quite reach the pinnacle of Formula One, being a test driver for one of the top teams has been the next best thing. \u2018People study for degrees in their dressing room.

But the bigger the productions that I\u2019ve worked on since, the more understudying work I\u2019ve done.

I\u2019d also watch the show from the wings to stay as connected as possible. If you need to go on, you need to be there. You might not have the same level of contact with your director as the principal actor, so you\u2019ve got to be really on the ball. You always have to be at the point of emotional and physical preparedness, in order to go on at the drop of a hat. Your adrenaline levels are always high. You\u2019ve got to keep sharp and stimulated, too \u2013 boredom can have a huge impact on you psychologically. I know people who study for degrees in their dressing room. In fact, I did my master\u2019s in music while understudying. Do understudies get on with lead actors? Everyone is different; sometimes personalities knit nicely together, other times they don\u2019t.

You need to have a heck of a lot of it \u2013 and those lessons filter into the rest of your life. \u2018You\u2019re not part of the evening, you\u2019re a footnote\u2019 Mark Olver, 44, TV warm-up act, Bristol I started doing standup in the late 90s, in exactly the same way that every other comedian does \u2013 clubs, open spots, gigging all over the place. But I worked out early on that compering was something I could do, too. In 2004, there was a Channel 4 show, Kings Of Comedy, where standup comedians lived together in a Big Brother-style house. Every week they\u2019d do a gig and the least good person would be evicted. Beforehand, the production team wanted to see how a comedy club worked and, because it was being made in Bristol, they came to see one of the nights I compered. When they started doing the live eviction show, hosted by Russell Brand, they asked me to do the warm-up. I did a few more warm-ups the following year, and then Deal Or No Deal started, which I did for more than 10 years. I now do a lot of shows. I\u2019m the warm-up on Have I Got News For You, Vic &amp; Bob\u2019s Big Night Out, The Last Leg, and loads more. The core task of warm-up is the same as standup: it\u2019s communicating with people \u2013 making them comfortable, making them laugh. The job is a combination of standup, cabin crew and holiday camp redcoat. A lot of it is housekeeping, so I try to find the funniest way to do it. I have jokes about every element of the studio experience: health and safety, fire exits, mobile phones. I joke about getting a young person to turn off your mobile phone for you, about drug dealers and doctors having a night off, about teenagers struggling to go two hours without Instagram. There\u2019s lots of admin. There\u2019s getting the right shots for the director, and there\u2019s making sure the audience aren\u2019t worn out before the show begins. I sometimes need to slow them down, because I want them to still have energy in four-and-a-half hours\u2019 time. With standup, the crowd has come to see you, or at least a night you are part of. With warm-up, you\u2019re not an expected part of the evening \u2013 you\u2019re an appendix or footnote. It\u2019s not the place to experiment with quirky material \u2013 the warm-up has to fit with the tone of the show. If there\u2019s a break in the recording, you have to plug the gap; one skill I have is that I can just talk for ever. I\u2019m happy discussing the perfect burger or the best biscuit or my favourite service station ad nauseam \u2013 I think I\u2019m a naturally funny person. Once, on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, I was told I only needed to do five minutes, because everyone was ready, but the floor manager came up to me and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. Someone\u2019s refusing to sign a contract.\u201d And I was on for an hour. Lots of other people who do warm-up aren\u2019t comics; they may have come from cruise ships or holiday camps. There are a few standups on the circuit who do warm-up, but not many enjoy it, as the ego has to be left at the door. If I met someone at a party, I\u2019d still describe myself as a standup. I\u2019ve got a gig in Halifax later this week, sandwiched between doing Pointless today, The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice on Sunday and 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown on Monday. It\u2019s a varied life and I\u2019ve done warm-ups around the world: in Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Rio. It\u2019s lovely to be a full-time comedian and I\u2019m really well-paid. I\u2019ve got standup friends who are now superstars \u2013 I used to live with both Russell Howard and Jon Richardson. But I\u2019m very happy where I am. Whatever level you\u2019re at in comedy, there\u2019s always someone above you, so you have to find a place where you\u2019re at ease. And I am considered one of the best at what I do, even though it\u2019s quite niche. When Richard Osman introduces me to people, he says, \u201cThis is Mark Olver. He\u2019s the best warm-up in the world.\u201d I would never say that myself, but I\u2019m glad that he does. \u2018I nearly lost both legs a couple of years ago. Just sitting on the bench is an achievement\u2019 Eartha Cumings, 20, second-choice goalkeeper, Bristol City I\u2019ve been a goalkeeper since I started playing football at the age of five with the local boys\u2019 team in Edinburgh. I joined Bristol City in the summer of 2018, but only turned professional this summer. Last season I was combining football with studying ancient history at university. But that went a bit sideways as I was spreading myself too thin, so I decided to leave uni and focus on football. I made two appearances for the first team last season: one in the Continental Tyres League Cup and one in the FA Cup. The Conti Cup game against Aston Villa was played in torrential rain. We were winning 4-0, but I slipped in the mud and they scored. Not a dream debut. But we won the FA Cup game 3-0, so it was relatively easy. During the week, I do the same training and gym sessions as the first-choice goalkeeper, Sophie Baggaley. The only difference is that, at the weekend, I\u2019m on the bench and Sophie is on the pitch. I\u2019m sitting down and she\u2019s standing up. There\u2019s a danger that, knowing the chances of actually playing on Sunday are low, you just go through the motions. You\u2019ve got to motivate yourself. There could be an injury at any moment and you\u2019d be in at the deep end. It\u2019s hard to feel ready, and keep feeling ready, for something that\u2019s probably not going to happen. It can be quite isolating. Outfield players can at least come on for five or 10 minutes at the end of the game, but with goalkeepers it\u2019s all or nothing. It\u2019s tough: it can make you feel as if you\u2019re not part of the team. You can\u2019t wish ill on the first-choice keeper though. I respect that Sophie\u2019s better than me and we are great friends, despite us vying for the same spot. Maybe if you didn\u2019t get on with the first-choice keeper, you\u2019d go to the coach and shout about it: \u201cWhy am I not playing?\u201d Because they don\u2019t get game time, understudy goalkeepers have to show the best of themselves in training. That\u2019s their audition. I don\u2019t have to dislodge Sophie this year. At the end of my 12-month contract, it won\u2019t be \u201cEartha\u2019s not number one, so she\u2019s out\u201d; it\u2019s more that I have to be pushing myself and pushing Sophie \u2013 blurring the line between the number one and number two. The club want the best goalkeeper, regardless of who that is. It can be hard to maintain concentration and motivation to prove myself every day when, more than likely, at the end of the week I won\u2019t be the one who\u2019s playing. But if I decide to stop trying, I will be damaging Sophie\u2019s chances of improving, too. This year will hopefully be the year I can really kick on. I have international ambitions, too. I\u2019ve played for Scotland under-19s, and I want to play in the World Cup for the full side. A couple of years ago, I nearly lost both my legs. I got compartment syndrome. During a fairly routine operation for a health condition, there was a problem with oxygen flow getting to the muscles and they began to swell up and up. If not operated on in time, compartment syndrome results in the breakdown and death of your muscles. I had to sign a form giving the surgeons permission to amputate if the operation went wrong. I was a footballer and my life was in my legs. I had to have numerous surgeries to repair the injury and spent a good bit of time on crutches. Nearly losing the opportunity to play football changed my outlook. Even if I\u2019m just sitting on the bench, I still think that\u2019s a huge achievement. \u2018If I took Richard Hawley\u2019s place, people would ask for their money back\u2019 Gordon White, 56, guitar roadie, Leeds I went to art college. Everyone there pretends to be a painter or a sculptor, but it\u2019s just a way of getting into bands. We described our band as punk-skiffle, a description we made up, because it fitted what we did: you played whatever instrument you were given or had found in a skip. We made a godawful racket. We were technically appalling, but we had the enthusiasm of youth. We were doing gigs around Leeds, but I had some friends who were in a band called Cud and they were doing a fair bit better; they were gigging beyond Leeds and getting John Peel sessions. One day they had a gig in Preston and they were looking for someone to drive them. \u201cCan you drive?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCan you hire a van and drive us to Preston?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll give you \u00a310 for it.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d So a driving licence was the most important qualification I ever got. Then it became, \u201cCan you set the amps up? Can you tune the guitars?\u201d Cud started playing bigger gigs in bigger venues and you\u2019d bump into other bands on the road. They\u2019d say, \u201cOh, we need someone, too.\u201d Before I knew it, it was a job. I\u2019ve been working with Richard Hawley for about 12 years. Anywhere he has to plug in a guitar \u2013 including in-store shows or TV and radio appearances \u2013 I\u2019ll be there. I can do a couple of weeks touring with him and then come back and get on with things in my workshop. We\u2019re all of a certain age and we\u2019ve all got kids and families. None of us are remotely interested in the one\u2011and-a-half-years-away-from-home thing. On tour, a big chunk of the day will be spent setting everything up on stage: amps, pedals and the like. Richard uses four amps and about 30 pedals. They surround him in a semi-circle \u2013 an arc of guitar noise. He also uses about 12 guitars per gig; it\u2019s virtually a guitar change with every song. Once the PA is set up, I tend to do a soundcheck by having a go on a couple of the guitars, making a bit of a racket and making sure all the pedals do what they should be doing. I need to make it sound the same as it did the night before \u2013 what I heard when I stood in the middle of that arc of noise 24 hours earlier. Through working with Richard, I ended up working with Duane Eddy, as his guitar tech when he comes to the UK. I\u2019ve also worked with the Cure, Joe Strummer, Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds, Tindersticks and Embrace. If you\u2019ve been in a band, you always regret packing it in. Life gets in the way and you have a mortgage to pay. But I couldn\u2019t contemplate being able to do what Richard does: his skill as a songwriter, singer and guitarist is at such a level. Richard needs me, and I need him, but I don\u2019t think he could do my job, and I certainly couldn\u2019t do his. If something terrible happened and Richard couldn\u2019t do a gig one night, but they decided to go ahead with me in his place, I think there\u2019d be a lot of people asking for their money back. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

There\u2019s all these great directors that have come before me and yet the Academy has yet to recognize an African American director. That\u2019s a shame. Now, being on the board of the Academy and representing the documentary branch, it\u2019s a great honor and responsibility and I don\u2019t take that lightly. I\u2019m the head of the diversity committee for the documentary branch and I am working hard to find opportunities for women, people of color \u2013 people who don\u2019t normally have a seat at the table. Was it hard to find archival material related to the Apollo\u2019s history? The struggles around archiving black history are well noted. Typically, there are holes and gaps in our history. Oh, the challenge was massive. Lisa Cortez, who was a producer on this film and a Harlem resident, she would search through boxes in people\u2019s basements. She would find moldy tapes and photos. It was really a treasure hunt. Especially because the Apollo had previously fallen into bankruptcy and disrepair and its basement in the 70s was filled with sewage. We don\u2019t document black history as well as we should. That\u2019s why I\u2019m glad this film serves as its own document. What do you think the future of the Apollo is? I would hope it continues to be a place that finds and nurtures talent in the black community. I don\u2019t think the Apollo wants to become a museum. They want to keep charting the way towards the future.",

A solid career was taking shape before him.

Those last two things, it should be made clear right now, were not related.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/01/air-traffic-cape-verde-football\">The former air traffic controller behind Cape Verde's football fairytale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where to start? How about with when Lopes was a teenager, because back then an international football career did not seem so improbable: he had, after all, played alongside John Egan, now of Sheffield United, in central defence for the Republic of Ireland Under-19s. Lopes was playing for Bohemians, a top-flight League of Ireland club without the resources to give players professional deals. Five years later Lopes was still playing for them while advancing in the bank.</p> <p>Then Shamrock Rovers \u2013 Bohemians\u2019 better-heeled arch-rivals \u2013 offered him a two-year deal to leave his boyhood club and his day job. It was a risk, as even Rovers could not offer the sort of money that would make quitting a secure job prudent. \u201cI just thought: \u2018Worry later about what happens next; at least I\u2019ll be happy for a few years,\u2019\u201d says Lopes. \u201cAnd then it took off. It\u2019s been a dream.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly. There was a scare a few months later when he woke one morning with a pain in a testicle. He rolled over and hoped it would go away. It got worse. \u201cI called the doctor and he told me come in. It took me 15 minutes to get there and by that time the pain had multiplied by 10. He said: \u2018Yeah, you\u2019ve twisted your testicle\u2019 and started explaining the possibilities. I said: \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t care, take them both off if you want, just make the pain stop!\u2019 So he wrote me a reference for the hospital. I had to go straight there because apparently there\u2019s a six- to eight-hour window in which your testicle can be saved. I had to drive to me ma\u2019s to get her to take me to hospital. I was driving with my leg out the window at one stage just trying to get some pain relief.\u201d</p> <p>He made it to the hospital, was treated quickly and two weeks later, once the stitches had healed, he was back in action for Rovers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87be67471f24fa178bfecd35a74618ab49b86e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87be67471f24fa178bfecd35a74618ab49b86e4f/0_138_4940_2964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Lopes, third left, celebrates with teammates after Shamrock reach the FAI Cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Lopes, third left, celebrates with teammates after Shamrock reach the FAI Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lopes has helped Rovers do well domestically and qualify for Europe every season. On Sunday they will contest the FAI Cup final against Dundalk. \u201cBut still, even at the start of this season I\u2019d never have said I\u2019d become an international footballer,\u201d he says. That was despite the fact that Cape Verde\u2019s manager, Rui \u00c1guas, had been in touch. Lopes had blanked him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a member of LinkedIn since college and one day I was just doing up my profile and I remember connecting with Rui \u00c1guas after his name popped up. Then a while later I received a message from him. It was in Portuguese and I just thought it was spam so took no notice. That was in October 2018. Then in September of this year I got another message saying: Did you think about it?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Oh, what\u2019s this?\u2019 So I translated the [original] message. They were looking at players who might be interested in declaring.\u201d</p> <p>Lopes cannot help laughing as he continues the story. \u201cI was straight back in there apologising with my tail between my legs saying: \u2018Sorry, I don\u2019t speak Portuguese but I\u2019d love to be involved if it\u2019s not too late.\u2019 Lucky enough, he said: \u2018That\u2019s great, give me your mobile.\u201d</p> <p>And lo, Lopes made his international debut in a friendly against Togo in France last month, then played in a behind-closed doors match against Marseille. He feels he did well but does not know whether he will be included in the squad for this month\u2019s qualifier in Cameroon. He has no doubt, though, that he has been enriched.</p> <p>\u201cCape Verde has always been part of my identity but mainly because there are not many Roberto Lopeses floating around Crumlin so when people would hear your name they\u2019d always ask: \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 and I\u2019d explain that my da\u2019s from Cape Verde and then have to explain where that is,\u201d says Lopes, adding that he has met only one other Cape Verdean person in Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s only really now that I\u2019m delving deeper into the culture and the heritage. It makes you proud. Even my girlfriend Leah, who\u2019s a history teacher, has been looking into the history of the country. It\u2019s really interesting. Being involved with the team just opened my mind and made me realise how much I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"709d9e2e1b77dba2eca4a416270963beabc70d7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/709d9e2e1b77dba2eca4a416270963beabc70d7e/0_140_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Lopes in action for Shamrock Rovers against St Patrick\u2019s Athletic in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Lopes in action for Shamrock Rovers against St Patrick\u2019s Athletic in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The realisation started with his initiation, when he had to sing in front of the squad. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d do something handy, maybe Drake, but they said: \u2018No, no, it has to be a Creole song.\u2019 So after lunch I went up to my room and on to Spotify and found a song called Dan\u00e7a Mami Creola. I went down and as soon as I sang the first line, everybody joined in. I probably got it wrong but everybody was so supportive that it turned out to be a bit of craic and a great way to help me settle in.</p> <p>\u201cIt was such a positive environment. And it was really inspiring to be part of when you see how much playing for the country means to them, how dedicated they are to it even in a friendly with no fans.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd my dad, when I came back from the trip, he was just beaming,\u201d says Lopes of his father, Carlos, who left his homeland at 16 and spent years travelling as a ship\u2019s chef before opening a cafe in Belgium, going on a holiday to Ireland and, in the words of Roberto, \u201cfinding me ma!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are more Cape Verdians living abroad than in the islands themselves,\u201d says Lopes. \u201cAnd they\u2019re very active on social media. All the family across the world have been in touch to congratulate my dad; uncles were sharing posts from various Cape Verdian pages; and I\u2019ve heard from cousins I never knew I had. It\u2019s just a real buzz around the family. It makes you proud.</p> <p>\u201cAnd to think I nearly missed out on all that because I didn\u2019t reply to a LinkedIn message. I reply to everyone now!\u201d</p>",

It got worse. \u201cI called the doctor and he told me come in. It took me 15 minutes to get there and by that time the pain had multiplied by 10. He said: \u2018Yeah, you\u2019ve twisted your testicle\u2019 and started explaining the possibilities. I said: \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t care, take them both off if you want, just make the pain stop!\u2019 So he wrote me a reference for the hospital. I had to go straight there because apparently there\u2019s a six- to eight-hour window in which your testicle can be saved. I had to drive to me ma\u2019s to get her to take me to hospital. I was driving with my leg out the window at one stage just trying to get some pain relief.\u201d He made it to the hospital, was treated quickly and two weeks later, once the stitches had healed, he was back in action for Rovers. Lopes has helped Rovers do well domestically and qualify for Europe every season. On Sunday they will contest the FAI Cup final against Dundalk. \u201cBut still, even at the start of this season I\u2019d never have said I\u2019d become an international footballer,\u201d he says. That was despite the fact that Cape Verde\u2019s manager, Rui \u00c1guas, had been in touch. Lopes had blanked him. \u201cI\u2019ve been a member of LinkedIn since college and one day I was just doing up my profile and I remember connecting with Rui \u00c1guas after his name popped up. Then a while later I received a message from him. It was in Portuguese and I just thought it was spam so took no notice. That was in October 2018. Then in September of this year I got another message saying: Did you think about it?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Oh, what\u2019s this?\u2019 So I translated the [original] message. They were looking at players who might be interested in declaring.\u201d Lopes cannot help laughing as he continues the story. \u201cI was straight back in there apologising with my tail between my legs saying: \u2018Sorry, I don\u2019t speak Portuguese but I\u2019d love to be involved if it\u2019s not too late.\u2019 Lucky enough, he said: \u2018That\u2019s great, give me your mobile.\u201d And lo, Lopes made his international debut in a friendly against Togo in France last month, then played in a behind-closed doors match against Marseille. He feels he did well but does not know whether he will be included in the squad for this month\u2019s qualifier in Cameroon. He has no doubt, though, that he has been enriched. \u201cCape Verde has always been part of my identity but mainly because there are not many Roberto Lopeses floating around Crumlin so when people would hear your name they\u2019d always ask: \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 and I\u2019d explain that my da\u2019s from Cape Verde and then have to explain where that is,\u201d says Lopes, adding that he has met only one other Cape Verdean person in Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s only really now that I\u2019m delving deeper into the culture and the heritage. It makes you proud. Even my girlfriend Leah, who\u2019s a history teacher, has been looking into the history of the country. It\u2019s really interesting. Being involved with the team just opened my mind and made me realise how much I didn\u2019t know.\u201d The realisation started with his initiation, when he had to sing in front of the squad. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d do something handy, maybe Drake, but they said: \u2018No, no, it has to be a Creole song.\u2019 So after lunch I went up to my room and on to Spotify and found a song called Dan\u00e7a Mami Creola. I went down and as soon as I sang the first line, everybody joined in. I probably got it wrong but everybody was so supportive that it turned out to be a bit of craic and a great way to help me settle in. \u201cIt was such a positive environment. And it was really inspiring to be part of when you see how much playing for the country means to them, how dedicated they are to it even in a friendly with no fans.\u201d \u201cAnd my dad, when I came back from the trip, he was just beaming,\u201d says Lopes of his father, Carlos, who left his homeland at 16 and spent years travelling as a ship\u2019s chef before opening a cafe in Belgium, going on a holiday to Ireland and, in the words of Roberto, \u201cfinding me ma!\u201d \u201cThere are more Cape Verdians living abroad than in the islands themselves,\u201d says Lopes. \u201cAnd they\u2019re very active on social media. All the family across the world have been in touch to congratulate my dad; uncles were sharing posts from various Cape Verdian pages; and I\u2019ve heard from cousins I never knew I had. It\u2019s just a real buzz around the family. It makes you proud. \u201cAnd to think I nearly missed out on all that because I didn\u2019t reply to a LinkedIn message. I reply to everyone now!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Fathers are happier, less stressed and less tired than mothers, finds a study from the American Time Use Survey. Not unrelated, surely, is the regular report that mothers do more housework and childcare than fathers, even when both parents work full time. When the primary breadwinner is the mother versus the father, she also shoulders the mental load of family management, being three times more likely to handle and schedule their activities, appointments, holidays and gatherings, organise the family finances and take care of home maintenance, according to Slate, the US website. (Men, incidentally, are twice as likely as women to think household chores are divided equally.) In spite of their outsized contributions, full-time working mothers also feel more guilt than full-time working fathers about the negative impact on their children of working. One argument that is often used to explain the anxiety that working mothers experience is that it \u2013 and many other social ills \u2013 is the result of men and women not living \u201cas nature intended\u201d. This school of thought suggests that men are naturally the dominant ones, whereas women are naturally homemakers.</p> <p>But the patriarchy is not the \u201cnatural\u201d human state. It is, though, very real, often a question of life or death. At least 126 million women and girls around the world are \u201cmissing\u201d due to sex-selective abortions, infanticide or neglect, according to United Nations Population Fund figures. Women in some countries have so little power they are essentially infantilised, unable to travel, drive, even show their faces, without male permission. In Britain, with its equality legislation, two women are killed each week by a male partner, and the violence begins in girlhood: it was reported last month that one in 16 US girls was forced into their first experience of sex. The best-paid jobs are mainly held by men; the unpaid labour mainly falls to women. Globally, 82% of ministerial positions are held by men. Whole fields of expertise are predominantly male, such as physical sciences (and women garner less recognition for their contributions \u2013 they have received just 2.77% of the Nobel prizes for sciences).</p> <p>According to a variety of high-profile figures (mainly male, mainly psychologists), bolstered by professorships and no shortage of disciples, there are important biological reasons for why men and women have different roles and status in our society. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/14/women-men-differences-science-stereotypes\" title=\"\">Steven Pinker</a>, for instance, has argued that men prefer to work with \u201cthings\u201d, whereas women prefer to work with \u201cpeople\u201d. This, he said, explains why more women work in the (low-paid) charity and healthcare sector, rather than getting PhDs in science. According to Pinker, \u201cThe occupation that fits best with the \u2018people\u2019 end of the continuum is director of a community services organisation. The occupations that fit best with the \u2018things\u2019 end are physicist, chemist, mathematician, computer programmer, and biologist.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whether someone has skills for maths, leadership or any gendered attribute can not be predicted from\u00a0knowing their sex</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Others deny societal sexism even exists, insisting that the gender roles we see are based on cognitive differences \u2013 spoiler: men are more intelligent. \u201cThe people who hold that our culture is an oppressive patriarchy, they don\u2019t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/aug/14/why-jordan-peterson-is-filling-the-void-modern-masculinity-episode-1\" title=\"\">Jordan Peterson</a> has said, for instance. His reasoning suggests that women would be happier not railing against it but instead observing their traditional gender roles. Such theories have been demolished by a range of scholars, including neuroscientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/05/the-gendered-brain-gina-rippon-review\" title=\"\">Gina Rippon</a> and psychologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/18/testosterone-rex-review-cordelia-fine\" title=\"\">Cordelia Fine</a>.</p> <p>There are certainly biological differences between men and women, from their sexual anatomy to hormones. Yet even this isn\u2019t as clear cut as it seems. For instance, around one in 50 people may be \u201cintersex\u201d with some sort of atypical chromosomal or hormonal feature \u2013 that\u2019s about the same as the proportion of redheads. Men\u2019s brains are on the whole slightly larger than women\u2019s, and scans reveal some differences in the size and connectedness of specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, in large samples of men and women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe832d484ed7a223dc58de51f364ce88e9ac6a90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe832d484ed7a223dc58de51f364ce88e9ac6a90/0_0_2197_3142/699.jpg\" alt=\"For Saturday Review 2 Nov 2019\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>And yet, only a tiny percent (between 0 and 8%) of individual men and women turn out to have a typically \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d brain. Most people are somewhere in the middle, and whether someone has skills for maths, spatial awareness, leadership or any other gendered attribute can not be predicted from knowing their sex, as multiple studies have shown. Anatomically and cognitively, there are more differences within the two sexes than between them.</p> <p>There is no evidence that women are any less capable of the jobs and social positions that men predominantly hold. When women are given the opportunity to hold \u201cmale\u201d roles, they show themselves to be equally proficient. Researchers recently calculated that it was bias against women, not under-representation, that accounts for the gender distribution seen in the Nobel prizes, for instance. Women are not less intelligent, less logical or less able than men. The roots of patriarchy, in other words, cannot be found in our biology.</p> <p>\u00b6</p> <p>Male supremacy, for all its ubiquity, is surprisingly recent. There\u2019s compelling evidence that patriarchal societies date back less than 10,000 years. Humans probably evolved as an egalitarian species and remained that way for hundreds of thousands of years. One clue is in the similar size of human males and females, which show the least disparity of all the apes, indicating that male dominance is not the driving force in our species. In fact, equality between the sexes in our early ancestry would have been evolutionarily beneficial. Parents who were invested in both girls and boys (and the grandchildren from both) gave our ancestors a survival advantage, because this fostered the critical wider-ranging social networks they depended on to exchange resources, genes and cultural knowledge. </p> <p>Today, hunter-gatherer societies remain remarkable for their gender equality, which is not to say women and men necessarily have the same roles, but there is not the gender-based power imbalance that is almost universal in other societies. In contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2018/oct/22/hadza-the-last-hunter-gatherer-tribe-in-tanzania-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Hadza people of Tanzania</a>, men and women contribute a similar number of calories, and both care for children. They also tend to have equal influence on where their group lives and who they live with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0acc015a2f08c9168e5666beded72a697fd38c9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0acc015a2f08c9168e5666beded72a697fd38c9f/0_234_4287_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Bribri community, in Costa Rica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Bribri community, in Costa Rica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxime Bessieres/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Matriarchal societies may also have been more common in our ancestral communities. Strong female relationships would have helped to glue a larger community together, and being able to rely on friends to babysit would have given our ancestors the time and energy to support the group through food provision and other activities. Indeed, there are several societies where matriarchy is the norm \u2013 I\u2019ve visited some of them, including the cocoa farming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/feb/16/costa-rica-family-holiday-caribbean\" title=\"\">Bribri people of Costa Rica</a>, and the rice farming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/may/09/national-geographic-traveler-photo-contest-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Minangkabau of Sumatra</a>, Indonesia. These are communities in which women are the landowners and decision makers.</p> <p>In other words, humans are not genetically programmed for male dominance. It is no more \u201cnatural\u201d for us to live in a patriarchy than in a matriarchy or, indeed an egalitarian society. In the same way, it is just as natural for humans to eat a \u201cpaleo\u201d diet as it is to eat bubblegum-flavoured candyfloss; to have sex as a man and a woman or as three men; to live in a straw hut or in a glass bubble beneath the ocean. This is because, unlike other animals, we are cultural beings \u2013 for our species, culture is our nature, and key to understanding our behaviours and motivations.</p> <p>Social, technological and behavioural invention are part of our nature \u2013 part of what it means to be human. We are driven by culture more than instinct. And our culture influences our environment and our genes. Our extraordinarily flexible, cumulative culture allows us to make ourselves even as we attribute our successes and failings to our genes.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that just because a cultural trait has emerged it is necessarily \u201cgood\u201d. Patriarchal norms, for instance, are damaging to our health and our societies, increasing death and suffering, and limiting humanity\u2019s creative potential. We are, though, neither slaves to our biology nor our social norms \u2013 even if it can feel that way.</p> <p>Human cultural conditioning begins at birth, indeed, social norms even have an impact before birth: one study found that when pregnant women were informed of the sex of the baby they were carrying, they described its movements differently. Women who learned they were carrying a girl typically described the movements as \u201cquiet\u201d, \u201cvery gentle, more rolling than kicking\u201d; whereas those who knew they were carrying a boy described \u201cvery vigorous movements\u201d, \u201ckicks and punches\u201d, \u201ca saga of earthquakes\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca8f17b7b01e6985fd4573f9cfdad718b0f8b941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca8f17b7b01e6985fd4573f9cfdad718b0f8b941/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional cow racing, celebrating the end of the harvest by the Minangkabau people.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional cow racing, celebrating the end of the harvest by the Minangkabau people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robertus Pudyanto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the ideas we consider universally held are simply the social norms in our own culture. <em>Libert\u00e9</em>, <em>\u00e9galit\u00e9</em>, <em>fraternit\u00e9</em> may be values worth dying for in France, for instance, but personal freedom is not considered important or desirable for other societies, which prioritise values such as purity instead. Consider the idea of responsibility. In my culture, if you deliberately hurt a person or their property this is considered a much worse crime than if you did it by accident, but in other cultures, children and adults are punished according to the outcome of their actions \u2013 intentionality is considered impossible to grasp and therefore largely irrelevant.</p> <p>The biological differences between males and females, or indeed between ethnic groups, tell us nothing about how intelligent, empathetic or successful a person is. Modern humans are 99.9% genetically identical. Although we have expanded far beyond our tropical evolutionary niche over tens of thousands of years, we have not speciated \u2013 we have not even diversified into different subspecies. Our ancestors have not needed to make dramatic biological adaptations to the very different environments we live in, because, instead, we culturally evolved and diversified into a complexity of differently adapted cultures, each with their own social norms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Children who speak Hebrew, a strongly gendered language, know their gender a year earlier than speakers of\u00a0non-gendered Finnish</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is our cultural developing bath, not our genes, that profoundly changes the way we think, behave and perceive the world. Studies comparing the neural processing of populations of westerners and East Asians, for example, show that culture shapes how people look at faces (westerners triangulate their gaze over eyes and mouth, whereas East Asians centralise their focus). Language reveals our norms and shapes the way we think. Children who speak Hebrew, a strongly gendered language, know their own gender a year earlier than speakers of non-gendered Finnish. English speakers are better than Japanese speakers at remembering who or what caused an accident, such as breaking a vase. That\u2019s because in English we say \u201cJimmy broke the vase\u201d, whereas in Japanese, the agent of causality is rarely used; they will say: \u201cThe vase broke.\u201d The structures that exist in our language profoundly shape how we construct reality \u2013 and it turns out that reality, and our human nature, differ dramatically depending on the language we speak. Our brains change and our cognition is rewired according to the cultural input we receive and respond to.</p> <p>Many of our social norms evolved because they improve survival, through group cohesion, for instance. But social norms can also be harmful. There is no scientific basis for the belief that a person\u2019s skin colour or sex has any bearing on their character or intelligence. However, social norms can affect a person\u2019s behaviour and their biology. Social norms that classify particular groups to the bottom of a social hierarchy encourage society to collude with that positioning and those people do worse in outcomes from wealth to health, strengthening the norm. A major study, by researchers at Berkeley, of 30,000 American shift workers found that black, Hispanic and other minority workers \u2013 particularly women \u2013 are much more likely to be assigned irregular schedules, and the harmful repercussions of this were felt not just by them but also by their children, who fared worse.</p> <p>The danger of ascribing genetic and biological bases for our actions is that individuals and groups are not given equal opportunities in life, and they suffer. It is, after all, very convenient to believe that the poor are feckless and undeserving, morally weak or stupid, rather than casualties of a deeply unfair systemic bias. Equally, it\u2019s much more appealing to think of one\u2019s own successes as down to some sort of innate personal brilliance rather than luck and social position.</p> <p>If we persist in the idea that there is a natural \u2013 a best \u2013 way to be a human, then we blind ourselves to the great diversity of potential ways of being, thinking and feeling, and impose social limitations on those whose life choices are no less legitimate than ours. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that many norms that were once believed to be set in biological stone or ordained by gods have been changed by societies \u2013 sometimes remarkably quickly. If we invented it, we can alter it. An accepted \u201cnatural\u201d state that has existed for millennia can be changed in mere months.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Transcendence: How Humans Evolved Through Fire, Language, Beauty, and Time by Gaia Vince is published by Allen Lane</em><em>.

Men\u2019s brains are on the whole slightly larger than women\u2019s, and scans reveal some differences in the size and connectedness of specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, in large samples of men and women. And yet, only a tiny percent (between 0 and 8%) of individual men and women turn out to have a typically \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d brain. Most people are somewhere in the middle, and whether someone has skills for maths, spatial awareness, leadership or any other gendered attribute can not be predicted from knowing their sex, as multiple studies have shown. Anatomically and cognitively, there are more differences within the two sexes than between them. There is no evidence that women are any less capable of the jobs and social positions that men predominantly hold. When women are given the opportunity to hold \u201cmale\u201d roles, they show themselves to be equally proficient. Researchers recently calculated that it was bias against women, not under-representation, that accounts for the gender distribution seen in the Nobel prizes, for instance. Women are not less intelligent, less logical or less able than men. The roots of patriarchy, in other words, cannot be found in our biology. \u00b6 Male supremacy, for all its ubiquity, is surprisingly recent. There\u2019s compelling evidence that patriarchal societies date back less than 10,000 years. Humans probably evolved as an egalitarian species and remained that way for hundreds of thousands of years. One clue is in the similar size of human males and females, which show the least disparity of all the apes, indicating that male dominance is not the driving force in our species. In fact, equality between the sexes in our early ancestry would have been evolutionarily beneficial. Parents who were invested in both girls and boys (and the grandchildren from both) gave our ancestors a survival advantage, because this fostered the critical wider-ranging social networks they depended on to exchange resources, genes and cultural knowledge. Today, hunter-gatherer societies remain remarkable for their gender equality, which is not to say women and men necessarily have the same roles, but there is not the gender-based power imbalance that is almost universal in other societies. In contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, such as the Hadza people of Tanzania, men and women contribute a similar number of calories, and both care for children. They also tend to have equal influence on where their group lives and who they live with. Matriarchal societies may also have been more common in our ancestral communities. Strong female relationships would have helped to glue a larger community together, and being able to rely on friends to babysit would have given our ancestors the time and energy to support the group through food provision and other activities. Indeed, there are several societies where matriarchy is the norm \u2013 I\u2019ve visited some of them, including the cocoa farming Bribri people of Costa Rica, and the rice farming Minangkabau of Sumatra, Indonesia. These are communities in which women are the landowners and decision makers. In other words, humans are not genetically programmed for male dominance. It is no more \u201cnatural\u201d for us to live in a patriarchy than in a matriarchy or, indeed an egalitarian society. In the same way, it is just as natural for humans to eat a \u201cpaleo\u201d diet as it is to eat bubblegum-flavoured candyfloss; to have sex as a man and a woman or as three men; to live in a straw hut or in a glass bubble beneath the ocean. This is because, unlike other animals, we are cultural beings \u2013 for our species, culture is our nature, and key to understanding our behaviours and motivations. Social, technological and behavioural invention are part of our nature \u2013 part of what it means to be human. We are driven by culture more than instinct. And our culture influences our environment and our genes. Our extraordinarily flexible, cumulative culture allows us to make ourselves even as we attribute our successes and failings to our genes. That\u2019s not to say that just because a cultural trait has emerged it is necessarily \u201cgood\u201d. Patriarchal norms, for instance, are damaging to our health and our societies, increasing death and suffering, and limiting humanity\u2019s creative potential. We are, though, neither slaves to our biology nor our social norms \u2013 even if it can feel that way. Human cultural conditioning begins at birth, indeed, social norms even have an impact before birth: one study found that when pregnant women were informed of the sex of the baby they were carrying, they described its movements differently. Women who learned they were carrying a girl typically described the movements as \u201cquiet\u201d, \u201cvery gentle, more rolling than kicking\u201d; whereas those who knew they were carrying a boy described \u201cvery vigorous movements\u201d, \u201ckicks and punches\u201d, \u201ca saga of earthquakes\u201d. Many of the ideas we consider universally held are simply the social norms in our own culture. Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9 may be values worth dying for in France, for instance, but personal freedom is not considered important or desirable for other societies, which prioritise values such as purity instead. Consider the idea of responsibility. In my culture, if you deliberately hurt a person or their property this is considered a much worse crime than if you did it by accident, but in other cultures, children and adults are punished according to the outcome of their actions \u2013 intentionality is considered impossible to grasp and therefore largely irrelevant. The biological differences between males and females, or indeed between ethnic groups, tell us nothing about how intelligent, empathetic or successful a person is. Modern humans are 99.9% genetically identical. Although we have expanded far beyond our tropical evolutionary niche over tens of thousands of years, we have not speciated \u2013 we have not even diversified into different subspecies. Our ancestors have not needed to make dramatic biological adaptations to the very different environments we live in, because, instead, we culturally evolved and diversified into a complexity of differently adapted cultures, each with their own social norms. It is our cultural developing bath, not our genes, that profoundly changes the way we think, behave and perceive the world. Studies comparing the neural processing of populations of westerners and East Asians, for example, show that culture shapes how people look at faces (westerners triangulate their gaze over eyes and mouth, whereas East Asians centralise their focus). Language reveals our norms and shapes the way we think. Children who speak Hebrew, a strongly gendered language, know their own gender a year earlier than speakers of non-gendered Finnish. English speakers are better than Japanese speakers at remembering who or what caused an accident, such as breaking a vase. That\u2019s because in English we say \u201cJimmy broke the vase\u201d, whereas in Japanese, the agent of causality is rarely used; they will say: \u201cThe vase broke.\u201d The structures that exist in our language profoundly shape how we construct reality \u2013 and it turns out that reality, and our human nature, differ dramatically depending on the language we speak. Our brains change and our cognition is rewired according to the cultural input we receive and respond to. Many of our social norms evolved because they improve survival, through group cohesion, for instance. But social norms can also be harmful. There is no scientific basis for the belief that a person\u2019s skin colour or sex has any bearing on their character or intelligence. However, social norms can affect a person\u2019s behaviour and their biology. Social norms that classify particular groups to the bottom of a social hierarchy encourage society to collude with that positioning and those people do worse in outcomes from wealth to health, strengthening the norm. A major study, by researchers at Berkeley, of 30,000 American shift workers found that black, Hispanic and other minority workers \u2013 particularly women \u2013 are much more likely to be assigned irregular schedules, and the harmful repercussions of this were felt not just by them but also by their children, who fared worse. The danger of ascribing genetic and biological bases for our actions is that individuals and groups are not given equal opportunities in life, and they suffer. It is, after all, very convenient to believe that the poor are feckless and undeserving, morally weak or stupid, rather than casualties of a deeply unfair systemic bias. Equally, it\u2019s much more appealing to think of one\u2019s own successes as down to some sort of innate personal brilliance rather than luck and social position. If we persist in the idea that there is a natural \u2013 a best \u2013 way to be a human, then we blind ourselves to the great diversity of potential ways of being, thinking and feeling, and impose social limitations on those whose life choices are no less legitimate than ours. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that many norms that were once believed to be set in biological stone or ordained by gods have been changed by societies \u2013 sometimes remarkably quickly. If we invented it, we can alter it. An accepted \u201cnatural\u201d state that has existed for millennia can be changed in mere months. \u2022 Transcendence: How Humans Evolved Through Fire, Language, Beauty, and Time by Gaia Vince is published by Allen Lane.

St Duthac\u2019s Way, eastern Scotland A lesser-known route to St Andrews, the 91-mile St Duthac\u2019s Way starts at Aberdeen. Not a great deal is known about the 11th-century Scottish saint, but centuries after his death his body was found incorrupt (avoiding the normal process of decomposition). If your own body is similarly robust and you fancy a tougher challenge, you could start off at Tain \u2013 135 miles north-west of Aberdeen \u2013 where the shrine to St Duthac was itself once a pilgrimage site.

Further information augustinecamino.co.uk, guidebook \u00a35.99 plus \u00a32 p&amp;p Getting there Both Rochester (from 30min) and Ramsgate (from 1hr 12min) have direct rail services to London. Where to stay Ramsgate\u2019s 18th-century Albion House is dripping in history and was once graced by Princess Victoria (doubles from \u00a385 room-only, albionhouseramsgate.co.uk). Walsingham, Norfolk Once one of Europe\u2019s busiest pilgrimage sites, this shrine was created in 1061 after Saint Mary appeared to one Richeldis de Faverches and asked her to build a replica of the house where the Annunciation took place. The statue was destroyed in the Reformation but trekking to \u201cEngland\u2019s Nazareth\u201d was revived in the early 20th century. The 125-mile route from London takes in Waltham Abbey, Newmarket, Brandon, Swaffham and Castle Acre priory. Further information walsinghamvillage.org Getting there Starting points with transport links include London\u2019s Westminster Abbey (125 miles), Lincoln (90 miles) and Norwich (28 miles). From Walsingham, take the 36 Coastliner bus to Kings Lynn . Where to stay Accommodation includes a 100-bed guesthouse, a retreat centre, a cottage and (from 1 May to 1 Oct) refurbished 1930s shepherds\u2019 huts (huts \u00a323, others from \u00a335pp, walsingham.org.uk). St Finbarr\u2019s Way, Ireland Follow in the footsteps of St Finbarr from the Top of the Rock in Drimoleague, County Cork, where the sixth-century monk gave an impassioned sermon, to the sumptuous lake at Gougane Barra, where he built an island monastery. It may be a journey of just 23 miles but it crosses three mountain ranges as it doglegs through west Cork. An added challenge is the distinct lack of accommodation along the way. So prepare yourself for a very long day, or make a diversion to Ballylickey on the coast. Further information pilgrimpath.ie Getting there From Cork, take the 236 bus to Drimoleague. Walk 4 miles from the end to Ballingeary for the 233 bus back to Cork. Where to stay Eagle Point Camping in Ballylickey (\u20ac12pp, eaglepointcamping.com). The Gougane Barra Hotel is very close to the end of the trail (from \u20ac125 B&amp;B, gouganebarrahotel.com) Ajvatovica, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina Over 500 years ago, the village of Prusac was saved from drought after devout Muslim Ajvaz Dedo prayed for 40 days until a rock on a nearby mountain split open, revealing a spring. Ever since, Muslims have gathered in Prusac on 30 June to give thanks in Europe\u2019s largest Islamic pilgrimage. Traditionally, the faithful ride on horseback in folk costume, though that\u2019s not obligatory. From Sarajevo, the 120km route heads north-west across a hilly forested region, through Bugojno, with its 17th-century Sultan Ahmed mosque. Further information visitmycountry.net Getting there Sarajevo is served by railway and international buses. From Prusac, it\u2019s a three-mile walk to Donji Vakuf from where there\u2019s a direct bus to Ne\u0111ari\u0107i in Sarajevo. Where to stay Accommodation is scarce but the Motel Orhideja in Donji Vakuf is clean and welcoming (doubles from \u00a335, on Facebook). Route of Gyergy\u00f3sz\u00e9k, Romania Part of the Via Mariae network in central and eastern Europe, this route runs for 62 mountainous miles from the salt-mining town of Praid (pictured) in the Carpathian basin to the Marian shrine at \u0218umuleu Ciuc, via numerous villages and churches. It celebrates a medieval priest called Istv\u00e1n, who went out to meet the army of King J\u00e1nos Zsigmond and persuaded him to turn back rather than invade. In gratitude to Mary for this boon, he led a pilgrimage every Pentecost. Further information 100km.mariaut.ro Getting there From Bucharest, take a train to Miercurea Ciuc, then a bus to Praid. At the end, \u0218umuleu Ciuc is two miles from Miercurea Ciuc. Where to stay Zoltan &amp; Erika Pension in Praid (doubles from \u20ac25, cazare-praid.info). Dalsland Pilgrim Path, Sweden This is a section of a much longer trekonce popular with medieval pilgrims travelling from V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland in western Sweden to Nidaros (now Trondheim) in Norway to pay homage at the tomb of St Olaf. The pilgrimage flourished for 500 years until 1527, when the Reformation-minded King Gustav I made the practice illegal. There are plans to reopen the entire route, but for now a 60-mile southern portion from V\u00e4nersborg to Edsleskog, through a land of forests and lakes, has been waymarked. Further information vastsverige.com Getting there Both V\u00e4nersborg and Mellerud are served by train. From Edsleskog, take the frequent 775 bus to \u00c5m\u00e5l station. Where to stay There are free-to-use sleeping shelters along the way. At the end, the Edsleskogs W\u00e4rdshus guesthouse overlooks picturesque Lake Edslan (doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B, edsleskogswardshus.se) Via Coloniensis, Germany A 152-mile route through North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, the Via Coloniensis heads more or less north-south from Cologne to Trier. Though sometimes incorporated into walks from northern Europe to Santiago de Compostela, it works as a discrete pilgrimage. Passing the spa town of Bad M\u00fcnstereifel and the former Benedictine abbey at Pr\u00fcm, it ends at Trier\u2019s St Peter\u2019s Cathedral. This happens to be the oldest church in Germany, commissioned by Emperor Constantine in the fourth century (though since destroyed and rebuilt). Getting there Cologne\u2019s central station is opposite the cathedral and only 4-5 hours from London by train. Trier also has a station. Where to stay Treat yourself to a night at the modern but stylish Boutique Hotel Marielle in Bad M\u00fcnstereifel (doubles from \u20ac90 roon-only, hotel-marielle.de). St Henry\u2019s Way, Finland It\u2019s a little-known fact that the first incident in Finnish history that was written down occurred on 20 January 1156, when Bishop Henry was murdered by a yeoman named Lalli on the ice of Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi. The tiny wooded island of Kirkkokari, near the scene of the crime, has attracted pilgrims ever since. Join Finnish Catholics as they walk or cycle 87 miles from the port of Turku to K\u00f6yli\u00f6, on the waymarked St Henry\u2019s Way, to take a boat across the lake for a memorial mass on the Sunday before the summer solstice. Getting there Turku is accessible by ferry and train. It\u2019s a six-mile walk from lakeside Polsu to S\u00e4kyl\u00e4, from where the F21 Flex bus runs to Turku. Where to stay Villa Haapsaari in S\u00e4kyl\u00e4 overlooks Lake Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi (doubles \u00a386, huvilahaapsaari.fi). Romedius Pilgrimage Trail, Austria and Italy A lung-busting 111-mile adventure up and down mountains, this trek begins at the Romedikirchl in the village of Thaur and slips over the border to the church of San Romedio in Italy\u2019s Val di Non. Passing through the North Tirol, pilgrims follow in the footsteps of St Romedius, a young man who gave up his well-to-do life to meditate in a cave. He is said to have made the journey astride a bear, which for some reason became tame after killing his horse. Further information tyrol.com Getting there Take the frequent 501 or 503 bus from Innsbruck railway station to Thaur. From the end, catch the 313 bus to Colle Isarco station. Where to stay Travel between June and October and you can stay in comfortable mountain refuges along the route. Banneux, Belgium Having the Virgin Mary appear to you once would be something, but in 1933 a girl called Mariette Beco claimed to have had eight encounters. She said the Virgin had shown her a spring with curative powers. By 1949, so many reports of healings had been made that the site received the imprimatur of the Catholic church. Pilgrims have been going there ever since for physical and spiritual restoration. The route starts at Beauraing on the French border and heads 60 miles north-east across the forests and hills of the northern Ardennes. Further information pilgrim-info.com/banneux Getting there Beauraing has a station. A Eurostar ticket to \u201cany Belgian station\u201d includes onward travel from Brussels to any Belgian station within 24 hours of arrival for an extra \u00a310. The 64 bus makes the 30-minute trip from Li\u00e8ge to Banneux . Where to stay Close to Banneux, Chaityfontaine is a simple pilgrim hotel with its own chapel (\u20ac36pp B&amp;B or \u20ac62 for two nights, dinner \u20ac15, chaityfontaine.eu). Via Francigena, Switzerland and Italy Although the full Via Francigena stretches all the way from Canterbury to Rome, most pilgrims start their journey to the Eternal City from an easily accessible Swiss city such as Lausanne, or from the Great St Bernard Pass near the Italian border. For over 1,000 years pilgrims have trodden this path, which was once the main route from northern to southern Europe. With the Pilgrims\u2019 Passport (\u20ac5), their modern counterparts have access to a huge number of cheap-and-cheerful lodgings along the way. Further information viefrancigene.org Getting there Lausanne, Vevey, St Maurice and other popular starting points all have railway stations. Where to stay La Casa del Movimento Lento (the Slow Movement House) in Roppolo, north of Turin, is a B&amp;B/hostel with a library of travel books and maps (bed in three-bed dorm \u20ac16, doubles \u20ac46, linen extra, casa.movimentolento.it). \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2019. St Andrews, at the end of St Duthac\u2019s Way, does not have a railway station, as was originally stated. The nearest station to St Andrews is Leuchars, a bus ride away. It was also amended to clarify Eurostar\u2019s train ticket policy for Belgian stations. Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

      "bodyText": "Britain may be on the verge of an electric car revolution but Welsh drivers wanting to change to greener personal transport may struggle: the eight counties in the UK with the lowest number of chargers per person in Britain are all in Wales, government data has revealed. Rhondda Cynon Taf has only three public car chargers for every 100,000 residents, putting it bottom of a league table of English counties, Scottish council areas and Welsh principal areas published on Saturday from the Department for Transport and private sector data provider Zap-map. Wales\u2019s Caerphilly and the Vale of Glamorgan only have four and five chargers per 100,000 people respectively. Essex has only nine public chargers for every 100,000 people, making it the worst county outside Wales. London had the highest concentration of car charge points in the UK, with 49 for every 100,000 people. The Isles of Scilly and Barrow-in-Furness were the worst local authority areas within counties for drivers looking for charge points: the data shows there are zero public charging points in either location. More than 100 local authorities had fewer than 10 public chargers per 100,000 population. The lack of charge points across the country is thought to be one of the most important factors holding back the consumer take-up of electric vehicles, with drivers wary of being stranded on longer journeys \u2013 even though the vast majority of car journeys taken by British people are well within the range of new electric cars. Consultancy Capital Economics last month estimated that the UK will need 25.3m charge points in 2050 to hit the legislated target of net zero carbon emissions. The majority of these will be privately owned but 2.6m will be required in public places. There are currently only 15,000 in public places and only 2,500 of those are fast chargers. The estimated cost of installing chargers across the UK is \u00a345.9bn. There is a broad political consensus in favour of rapidly increasing the number of electric car charging points in the UK, but some experts are concerned that a market-led approach to charger rollout could lead to poorer areas being left behind. Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, which commissioned the Capital Economics report, said the government should give local communities more power to manage the transition to lower-carbon technology. \u201cIn a few years, our roads will look very different, with electric cars and buses dominating,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we heat our homes will change as well, as gas is phased out in favour of heat pumps.

      "body": "<p>Around three decades ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgesoros\" title=\"\">George Soros</a> was introduced to a brash property magnate over dinner at a country house in the Catskills, upstate New York. Donald Trump was about to launch a New York office block, and he asked Soros to be his lead tenant. Soros was already a spectacularly successful financier, but told Trump he simply couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cAnd that was just because I didn\u2019t like him,\u201d he tells me, smiling.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see why Soros took such an instant dislike. Worldly, bookish, curious and somewhat shy, he tends to find other businessmen boring. He is unimpressed by celebrity, preferring the company of intellectuals, journalists and anyone he feels knows more about a given subject than he does. As a hedge fund manager, he was more likely to spend his free time reading and writing philosophy texts than hanging out on the golf course. If you had to conjure up a personality that is the polar opposite of the current president of the United States, it would look a lot like Soros.</p> <p>We meet on a sunny October morning in the office of his New York residence, with views over the Central Park reservoir. It could easily be the consulting room of an upmarket psychotherapist rather than the headquarters of one of the world\u2019s richest people \u2013 and, as both his critics and supporters would argue, one of the most influential. A few pieces of understated art decorate the cream-coloured walls; there are bookshelves lined with nonfiction and an air purifier hums quietly in the background. Unlike Trump Tower, just a couple of miles away down Fifth Avenue, there are no gold elevators here.</p> <p>These days, the distance between Trump and Soros is about much more than personality and aesthetics. The president has become the most powerful among a global chorus of rightwing critics focused on Soros\u2019s philanthropic efforts, which fund a broad range of causes they dislike, from minority rights and protecting refugees to liberalising drug policy and combating hate speech. Soros has long had enemies \u2013 largely, authoritarian leaders who were wary of his efforts to promote and protect democracy; more recently, this has been amplified by the antisemitic conspiracy theories that ooze from the darker corners of the internet.</p> <p>It is now rare for a week to go by without a populist politician painting Soros as a ruthless Bond villain with nefarious plans to reshape the planet. Last year, Trump suggested that Soros might be paying illegal migrants to come to the US; in Turkey, President Erdo\u011fan has called him \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/26/george-soross-open-society-foundation-to-pull-out-of-turkey\" title=\"\">a man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them</a>\u201d; in Italy, Matteo Salvini has claimed Soros wants the country \u201cto become a giant refugee camp because he likes slaves\u201d. Last month, Soros\u2019s financial support for the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group led Jacob Rees-Mogg to call him the \u201cRemoaner-in-chief\u201d in parliament.<strong> </strong>Nigel Farage has called him \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/12/farage-criticised-for-using-antisemitic-themes-to-criticise-soros\" title=\"\">the biggest danger to the entire western world</a>\u201d.</p> <p>As a reporter based in eastern Europe, I have had a ringside seat to the political hostility Soros has faced over the years. I spent a decade in Russia, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/annexing-crimea-putin-make-russia-great-again\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin blamed him for organising revolutions in neighbouring countries</a>; in 2015, his philanthropic foundations were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-soros-idUSL1N13P22Y20151130\" title=\"\">banned from the country as a \u201cthreat to state security</a>\u201d. Last year I moved to Budapest, the city of Soros\u2019s birth, where the far-right Hungarian prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-orban\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>, had taken Soros-baiting to a new level, erecting thousands of billboards featuring a cackling Soros, warning Hungarians not to let him \u201chave the last laugh\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I look at the list of people, movements or countries attacking me, it makes me feel I must be doing something right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now I sit opposite a somewhat frail, elderly man wearing a maroon cardigan, and it feels like a Wizard Of Oz moment. Is this really the power-broker feared by the world\u2019s nationalists? Soros turns 90 next year, and his face is creased with age, a distinctive banana-shaped fold of skin under each eye. He has lost much of his hearing, and visitors are given a microphone that connects directly to his hearing aid. He speaks hesitantly, often needing a few seconds to find the right word, and there is a hint of annoyance in his eyes during the pauses \u2013 as if the brain is irritated at the mouth for not articulating its thoughts fast enough. But appearances can be deceptive: Soros still maintains a busy work and travel schedule, splitting his weeks between Manhattan and upstate New York with his third wife Tamiko, and spending several months a year on the road.</p> <p>What sustains him, I ask, particularly given the recent intensity of the attacks he has faced? \u201cIt challenges me and therefore it energises me,\u201d he says with a smile, in his still-strong Hungarian accent. \u201cWhen I look at the list of people, or movements, or countries who are attacking me, it makes me feel I must be doing something right. I\u2019m proud of the enemies I have.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly his enemies make an impressive list of the world\u2019s least progressive politicians. But when Budapest, the city in which Soros lived during the Holocaust, is plastered with posters of him that seem to reprise 1930s tropes of the all-powerful, laughing Jew\u2026 doesn\u2019t that cross a line? Orb\u00e1n has been explicit in his opposition to Soros. \u201cI don\u2019t take it personally, and I certainly don\u2019t let it become a personal conflict,\u201d he says, matter-of-factly. \u201cThe difference between us is not personal but ideological, and we stand for opposite views of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, Soros\u2019s spending has had an impact that most private citizens could only dream of. Back in the 70s and 80s, he made money for his hedge fund faster than anyone else in the game, and soon began giving it away at the same speed. He is still worth around $8bn, even after a recent transfer of around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/george-soros-gives-18-billion-dollars-open-society-foundation\" title=\"\">$18bn from his personal funds to his foundations</a> (together these currently spend an estimated $1bn a year around the globe). \u201cSpending my money on collecting paintings, it just wouldn\u2019t satisfy me,\u201d he says. But his philanthropy is not born of altruism, he admits. \u201cI have a big ego, and trying to make the world a better place is how I satisfy that ego.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a94a900ca7a107eef505470865c3db74b881114\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a94a900ca7a107eef505470865c3db74b881114/16_164_2958_1775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Soros on the phone in his office in 1986, two years after his first pro-democracy foundation was set up, in Hungary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At work in 1986, two years after his first pro-democracy foundation was set up, in Hungary.

The first Soros foundation was launched in Hungary in 1984; a symbolic early project involved importing photocopiers to help dissident groups spread their message. It was a basic premise that was updated years later in Russia, where Soros spent nearly $100m during the 90s connecting regional universities to the internet. Since then, he has funded a range of causes around the world, from cultural programmes to transformative end-of-life medical care; the one unifying theme is that they must contribute to Soros\u2019s overall goal of promoting the \u201copen society\u201d. In a collection of essays and speeches published last month, called <a href=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2019/09/23/in-defense-of-open-society/\" title=\"\">In Defen</a><a href=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2019/09/23/in-defense-of-open-society/\" title=\"\">se </a><a href=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2019/09/23/in-defense-of-open-society/\" title=\"\">Of Open Society</a>, Soros claims we are now living through a \u201crevolutionary moment\u201d. He remembers two previous such moments: the second world war and the collapse of communism, which marked the start of his philanthropy. Back in the 80s and 90s, as he pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into central and eastern Europe, he felt he was swimming with the tide. Repressive regimes fell, and the momentum seemed to be with the people and politicians who wanted more open and tolerant societies. And then, as Soros says, \u201cThe tide turned against me.\u201d</p> <p>Soros spends a minute trying to recall a name. He finds it, eventually \u2013 Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 and sombrely repeats his line that \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but bends towards justice\u201d. Then he subverts it, with a glint in his eye. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. I think you need to bend the arc.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Born into a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930, Soros spent the second world war in hiding. His father had procured documents that gave him a false gentile identity, protecting him while German occupation forces and their Hungarian allies rounded up Jews and sent them to their deaths. In 1947, he left newly communist Hungary for Britain, where he worked in a series of menial jobs, including swimming pool lifeguard, train station porter and mannequin factory worker. In 1949, he gained admission to the London School of Economics, where he studied under the Austrian-born philosopher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper\" title=\"\">Karl Popper</a>, whose concept of the open society made a lifelong impression. Popper\u2019s key distinction was between closed societies that claim to possess one, ultimate truth to which the population must submit; and open societies, which allow and even demand that citizens make their own choices.</p> <p>Having lived through both fascist and communist regimes, Soros became infatuated with this idea; he spent years reading and writing on the topic during his free time, and it continues to inform his philanthropic efforts. In his book, he explains that it is a principle that has to be defended again and again. \u201cOpen society will always have its enemies, and each generation has to reaffirm its commitment for it to survive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c203063e82df707623659c9a102cfc0528acf84e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c203063e82df707623659c9a102cfc0528acf84e/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors in Skopje, Macedonia, hold an antisemitic banner of Soros in 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors in Skopje, Macedonia, hold an antisemitic banner of Soros in 2017. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Atanasovski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soros moved to the US in 1956. His plan was to get a job on Wall Street, make $500,000 on the stock market, then return to London to study philosophy. He got a series of trading jobs before managing one of the first hedge funds \u2013 using investments to take both long and short positions in the market. He turned out to be too good at making money to give it up, moving in and out of different markets quickly; he has said that a key part of his success lay in acknowledging and reversing his mistakes.</p> <p>In 1992, Soros became famous as \u201cthe man who broke the bank of England\u201d, as his bets against sterling contributed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday\" title=\"\">Black Wednesday</a>. The British government had to withdraw the pound from the exchange rate mechanism, and Soros pocketed around $1bn, for which he was vilified by the tabloids. He has expressed no remorse for making a fortune out of currency speculation, shrugging that others would do the same if he didn\u2019t. He also claims that his personal role in Black Wednesday was exaggerated, but also that the timing suited him: he was looking for a bigger audience. \u201cI deliberately allowed it to happen in order to establish a platform from which I could speak out on other issues,\u201d he writes in the new book. \u201cAnd it worked. Suddenly I had a voice that could be heard.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Soros significantly increased his philanthropic spending. Unlike most other big bureaucratic trusts, where decisions are taken by boards, he is personally involved in the discussions about where the money goes. Talking to him, you get the sense he is driven by structural injustices far more than by individual suffering.</p> <p>On occasion, Soros has provided purely humanitarian aid: $50m to help the besieged citizens of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war; grants for more than 30,000 Russian scientists in the early 90s to keep their research alive. But he is most passionate when talking about long-term institutional reform than life-saving emergency assistance. When I ask what he is most proud of among all his projects, he talks about the incomplete but promising political progress made in Ukraine, where his foundation has supported a broad range of civil society programmes over decades. \u201cI always wanted successes in the near term, and with experience I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that real successes need 25 years,\u201d he says. \u201cTake a country like Ukraine: it had a number of revolutions, and they each failed, and now you had a free and fair election,\u201d he says, referring to the vote earlier this year for president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\" title=\"\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is a brilliant confidence trickster who's succeeded beyond his own expectations, fulfilling a narcissist's dream</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the 2004 Ukrainian election, exit polls conducted by a Soros foundation showed a very different result to the official count, and Viktor Yanukovych, who had \u201cwon\u201d the first vote, was forced to concede. He came back to power in 2010, before being toppled amid violent clashes in 2014.</p> <p>These revolutions, Soros says, were inevitable but not sufficient. \u201cDictators, if they are successful, always go too far, because there are no checks and balances to stop them\u2026 The point comes where people who have been cowed into obedience rebel, and there\u2019s a revolution. Revolutions generally don\u2019t succeed. You need to develop institutions, which is what open societies are all about.\u201d In the past, Putin has blamed Soros for sparking unrest \u2013 something he denies, but in a qualified manner that would hardly reassure the Russian president. \u201cIt was the people of the country who rebelled,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I enabled them to do it by various steps that the foundations took, like reliable exit polls.\u201d It is this approach that has so exercised his critics: few authoritarians would feel threatened by the distribution of mosquito nets or emergency food supplies; but the funding of critical media, legal aid NGOs and minority rights advocacy groups is a different matter.</p> <p>More recently, Orb\u00e1n has emerged from a competitive international field to become Soros\u2019s most ferocious critic. As a young anti-communist firebrand in the late 80s, Orb\u00e1n and his fellow young democrats received funding from Soros through his new Hungarian foundation. Orb\u00e1n even won a Soros-funded scholarship to study for a year at Oxford University in 1989. Three decades on, the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s media outlets refer to a \u201cSoros plan\u201d to ship millions of refugees to Europe and destroy the continent; last year, his parliament passed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/hungary-passes-anti-immigrant-stop-soros-laws\" title=\"\">\u201cStop Soros\u201d bill</a> that, among other things, imposes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/hungary-anti-immigration-plans-ngo-tax-orban-bill-criminalise-aid\" title=\"\">25% tax on any organisation providing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/hungary-anti-immigration-plans-ngo-tax-orban-bill-criminalise-aid\" title=\"\">assistance to migrants</a>.

Last spring, I watched the prime minister give a speech outside the ornately beautiful parliament building, on the same square where Soros lived as a child. \u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told a flag-waving crowd. \u201cNot open, but hiding. Not straightforward, but crafty. Not honest, but base. Not national, but international. It does not believe in working but speculates with money; it does not have its own homeland, but feels it owns the whole world.\u201d This succinct summation of antisemitic tropes was delivered just a few hundred metres from a monument marking the place where hundreds of Jews were executed by fascists during the second world war.</p> <p>I asked Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, about the speech at the time and he denied it was antisemitic \u2013 even insinuating that my question was, because it implied that only Jews could be speculators. The Hungarian government\u2019s problem with Soros, he said, was that he uses NGOs for political purposes, despite having no \u201cmandate\u201d to do so. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that if you say the word NGO, it goes without saying that it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>Many people \u2013 and not just rightwingers \u2013 might wonder if Kov\u00e1cs has a point. If you remove the antisemitism and political opportunism from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s attacks, is a leader like him right to fear the work of the Soros foundations? Soros shrugs, and sidesteps the question. \u201cWe are on opposite sides of our concept of a good society. I supported Orb\u00e1n because at the time he was a very active supporter of open society. But he became an exploiter and the creator of a mafia state.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexit hurts Britain more on a pro rata basis and Europe more in absolute terms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soros\u2019s supporters would argue that what rightwing leaders consider \u201cpolitical interference\u201d is merely backing for freer and more tolerant societies. Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, who was elected president of Slovakia in June, told me earlier this year that it is misguided for governments in the region to accuse Soros of political interference. A former civil society activist, \u010caputov\u00e1 has received Soros foundation grants in the past, and strikes a very different tone. \u201cThanks to the money from this organisation, a lot of good and valuable work has been done in Slovakia,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/zuzana-caputova-slovakia-president-spiritual-liberal-progressive-values\" title=\"\">told me in April</a>, shortly after winning the vote. \u201cMost of the grants were broadly in support of democracy, rather than trying to dictate on specific issues.\u201d</p> <p>But in taking a side in the Brexit debate, for example, isn\u2019t Soros straying into political ground? Yes and no, he says. \u201cIt falls into the category of what I call political philanthropy. Brexit is a process of disintegration that hurts both sides. It hurts Britain more on a pro rata basis and Europe more in absolute terms. Most importantly, European values can be better defended if the two of them are united. My contributions were not used for partisan or electoral purposes. They were used to educate the British public.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>An hour into our interview, Soros asks if we can take a break; the batteries have run out in his hearing aid. His wife Tamiko appears and they leave the room together for a couple of minutes to change them. When he returns, we get back to the subject of the man from farther down Fifth Avenue. Soros doesn\u2019t like getting personal: he is careful, even when it comes to Orb\u00e1n, to say that theirs is a battle between competing ideologies; he won\u2019t be drawn into the mudslinging. But Trump, for whom his disdain is explicit, is the exception. \u201cI think he\u2019s a brilliant confidence trickster, who has succeeded beyond his own expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the fulfilment of the dream of a narcissist, and that\u2019s what carries him forward.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Soros thinks this combination of self-regard and insecurity has led the president to make terrible decisions. \u201cIn a way, we are lucky to have him because of the internal contradiction in him \u2013 he is his own worst enemy. He\u2019s digging his own grave, because of his addiction to narcissism.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c12febac842a68ecdd59f411c47cc15a2f26d8de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c12febac842a68ecdd59f411c47cc15a2f26d8de/292_185_4708_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Soros with his wife, Tamiko Bolton, at the opening of the European Roma Institute for Arts and Culture in 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife, Tamiko Bolton, at the opening of the European Roma Institute for Arts and Culture in 2017. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years, Soros has become one of the biggest donors to Democrat causes and candidates. Of the current crop of contenders, he insists he does not want to endorse any candidate publicly: \u201cThis is not something that a major donor ought to be deciding \u2013 it should be decided by the electorate.\u201d Nonetheless, he speaks of Elizabeth Warren in glowing terms. \u201cShe has the experience and energy for the job. She understands the flaws of the prevailing system and has many innovative ideas about how to fix them. She would make mincemeat out of Trump in debates.\u201d</p> <p>He also likes Warren\u2019s plans for increased taxes on the rich. Despite his handsome profits, Soros considers himself a long-standing critic of the current financial system. \u201cThe disparity in wealth in the United States certainly contributed to the rise of Trump,\u201d he says. As far back as 1997, he wrote that laissez-faire capitalism, with its certainty in the supremacy of the market, was a new threat to any open society. He tells me he would levy a wealth tax on the super-rich \u2013 including himself \u2013 because it is the best way to fund the necessary spending on the climate crisis, an area where he feels Trump\u2019s presidency is a particular disaster. \u201cThere is a connection between the problems of open society and the problems of climate change... You\u2019ve got somebody like Trump who actually denies it, and that really makes it very hard to take the steps which are necessary to bring it under control,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the temperature of anti-Soros rhetoric has risen, his staff have been taking his safety more seriously. Last year, an explosive device was mailed to Soros\u2019s upstate New York residence. It was quickly detected and nobody was injured, but it showed that the threats to his life were not hypothetical. Has it restricted his movements? \u201cI am willing to risk my life for my ideas and beliefs when necessary, but I don\u2019t expose myself to unnecessary danger,\u201d he says. It is unlikely that he will return to Hungary while Orb\u00e1n is in power, he says, fearful that the relentless propaganda could inspire a physical attack. \u201cIt\u2019s quite dangerous because he has got some blind followers, just like Trump, and they may try to get me.\u201d</p> <p>A few days after we meet, Soros attends a board meeting of his US foundation, where the discussion focuses on how its work can be adapted to address the altered political landscape. Already Soros has made a $10m donation to a programme aimed at tackling the upsurge in hate crime in America. The 2020 budget for his US foundation has been set at $185m, nearly double the 2016 figure. \u201cFor the moment it\u2019s the still-unresolved crisis of the developed world that needs most of our attention,\u201d he tells me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d01cb28c898f598106839d655082b78016954fe6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d01cb28c898f598106839d655082b78016954fe6/0_88_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Alex Soros, son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Soros, expected to be his father\u2019s successor in running the Soros foundations. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jared Siskin/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Time is not on Soros\u2019s side, but it is widely expected that his 34-year-old son, Alex, will be his successor when it comes to running the foundations. I ask Soros if he is scared of dying. \u201cIt\u2019s the loss of consciousness that is so frightening for a person like me, who is so involved in thinking and understanding the world. But dying is a natural consequence of having been born and so it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of,\u201d he says. Is it something he thinks about a lot? \u201cOriginally, I wanted to spend my money while I am alive, but then I realised that would be very selfish. There are a lot of other people who have devoted their lives to working for the foundation and I owe it to them to allow the foundation to continue beyond my life.\u201d As is the case many times in the interview, he has answered a slightly different question to the one I asked. I leave unsure whether this is the confusion of old age or, more likely, a canny tactic to divulge information on his own terms.</p> <p>In his new book, Soros describes 2016 as the \u201cnadir\u201d in terms of the move away from open societies \u2013 with the vote for Brexit and the election of Trump. He tells me he now sees some signs that \u201cthe tide is turning again\u201d: there is the increasing momentum around the Trump impeachment discussion, and then there was the European parliament election earlier this year, in which nationalists did not do as well as many had feared. As someone who experienced the horrors of Nazi-occupied Europe, does he think those who draw comparisons to that era are wide of the mark \u2013 or could the world be heading to a truly dark place? </p> <p>\u201cWe certainly can\u2019t exclude it,\u201d he says. But that depends on all of us, he thinks. \u201cWe can\u2019t passively wait for things to go right. We have to act on our principles, even when the situation appears hopeless.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Around three decades ago, George Soros was introduced to a brash property magnate over dinner at a country house in the Catskills, upstate New York. Donald Trump was about to launch a New York office block, and he asked Soros to be his lead tenant. Soros was already a spectacularly successful financier, but told Trump he simply couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cAnd that was just because I didn\u2019t like him,\u201d he tells me, smiling. It\u2019s not hard to see why Soros took such an instant dislike. Worldly, bookish, curious and somewhat shy, he tends to find other businessmen boring. He is unimpressed by celebrity, preferring the company of intellectuals, journalists and anyone he feels knows more about a given subject than he does. As a hedge fund manager, he was more likely to spend his free time reading and writing philosophy texts than hanging out on the golf course. If you had to conjure up a personality that is the polar opposite of the current president of the United States, it would look a lot like Soros. We meet on a sunny October morning in the office of his New York residence, with views over the Central Park reservoir. It could easily be the consulting room of an upmarket psychotherapist rather than the headquarters of one of the world\u2019s richest people \u2013 and, as both his critics and supporters would argue, one of the most influential. A few pieces of understated art decorate the cream-coloured walls; there are bookshelves lined with nonfiction and an air purifier hums quietly in the background. Unlike Trump Tower, just a couple of miles away down Fifth Avenue, there are no gold elevators here. These days, the distance between Trump and Soros is about much more than personality and aesthetics. The president has become the most powerful among a global chorus of rightwing critics focused on Soros\u2019s philanthropic efforts, which fund a broad range of causes they dislike, from minority rights and protecting refugees to liberalising drug policy and combating hate speech. Soros has long had enemies \u2013 largely, authoritarian leaders who were wary of his efforts to promote and protect democracy; more recently, this has been amplified by the antisemitic conspiracy theories that ooze from the darker corners of the internet. It is now rare for a week to go by without a populist politician painting Soros as a ruthless Bond villain with nefarious plans to reshape the planet. Last year, Trump suggested that Soros might be paying illegal migrants to come to the US; in Turkey, President Erdo\u011fan has called him \u201ca man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them\u201d; in Italy, Matteo Salvini has claimed Soros wants the country \u201cto become a giant refugee camp because he likes slaves\u201d. Last month, Soros\u2019s financial support for the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group led Jacob Rees-Mogg to call him the \u201cRemoaner-in-chief\u201d in parliament. Nigel Farage has called him \u201cthe biggest danger to the entire western world\u201d. As a reporter based in eastern Europe, I have had a ringside seat to the political hostility Soros has faced over the years. I spent a decade in Russia, where Vladimir Putin blamed him for organising revolutions in neighbouring countries; in 2015, his philanthropic foundations were banned from the country as a \u201cthreat to state security\u201d. Last year I moved to Budapest, the city of Soros\u2019s birth, where the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, had taken Soros-baiting to a new level, erecting thousands of billboards featuring a cackling Soros, warning Hungarians not to let him \u201chave the last laugh\u201d. Now I sit opposite a somewhat frail, elderly man wearing a maroon cardigan, and it feels like a Wizard Of Oz moment. Is this really the power-broker feared by the world\u2019s nationalists? Soros turns 90 next year, and his face is creased with age, a distinctive banana-shaped fold of skin under each eye. He has lost much of his hearing, and visitors are given a microphone that connects directly to his hearing aid. He speaks hesitantly, often needing a few seconds to find the right word, and there is a hint of annoyance in his eyes during the pauses \u2013 as if the brain is irritated at the mouth for not articulating its thoughts fast enough. But appearances can be deceptive: Soros still maintains a busy work and travel schedule, splitting his weeks between Manhattan and upstate New York with his third wife Tamiko, and spending several months a year on the road. What sustains him, I ask, particularly given the recent intensity of the attacks he has faced? \u201cIt challenges me and therefore it energises me,\u201d he says with a smile, in his still-strong Hungarian accent. \u201cWhen I look at the list of people, or movements, or countries who are attacking me, it makes me feel I must be doing something right. I\u2019m proud of the enemies I have.\u201d Certainly his enemies make an impressive list of the world\u2019s least progressive politicians. But when Budapest, the city in which Soros lived during the Holocaust, is plastered with posters of him that seem to reprise 1930s tropes of the all-powerful, laughing Jew\u2026 doesn\u2019t that cross a line? Orb\u00e1n has been explicit in his opposition to Soros. \u201cI don\u2019t take it personally, and I certainly don\u2019t let it become a personal conflict,\u201d he says, matter-of-factly. \u201cThe difference between us is not personal but ideological, and we stand for opposite views of the world.\u201d Over the years, Soros\u2019s spending has had an impact that most private citizens could only dream of. Back in the 70s and 80s, he made money for his hedge fund faster than anyone else in the game, and soon began giving it away at the same speed. He is still worth around $8bn, even after a recent transfer of around $18bn from his personal funds to his foundations (together these currently spend an estimated $1bn a year around the globe). \u201cSpending my money on collecting paintings, it just wouldn\u2019t satisfy me,\u201d he says. But his philanthropy is not born of altruism, he admits. \u201cI have a big ego, and trying to make the world a better place is how I satisfy that ego.\u201d He began by providing money and organisational support for pro-democracy movements across the communist bloc. The first Soros foundation was launched in Hungary in 1984; a symbolic early project involved importing photocopiers to help dissident groups spread their message. It was a basic premise that was updated years later in Russia, where Soros spent nearly $100m during the 90s connecting regional universities to the internet. Since then, he has funded a range of causes around the world, from cultural programmes to transformative end-of-life medical care; the one unifying theme is that they must contribute to Soros\u2019s overall goal of promoting the \u201copen society\u201d. In a collection of essays and speeches published last month, called In Defense Of Open Society, Soros claims we are now living through a \u201crevolutionary moment\u201d. He remembers two previous such moments: the second world war and the collapse of communism, which marked the start of his philanthropy. Back in the 80s and 90s, as he pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into central and eastern Europe, he felt he was swimming with the tide. Repressive regimes fell, and the momentum seemed to be with the people and politicians who wanted more open and tolerant societies. And then, as Soros says, \u201cThe tide turned against me.\u201d Soros spends a minute trying to recall a name. He finds it, eventually \u2013 Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 and sombrely repeats his line that \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but bends towards justice\u201d. Then he subverts it, with a glint in his eye. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. I think you need to bend the arc.\u201d *** Born into a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930, Soros spent the second world war in hiding. His father had procured documents that gave him a false gentile identity, protecting him while German occupation forces and their Hungarian allies rounded up Jews and sent them to their deaths. In 1947, he left newly communist Hungary for Britain, where he worked in a series of menial jobs, including swimming pool lifeguard, train station porter and mannequin factory worker. In 1949, he gained admission to the London School of Economics, where he studied under the Austrian-born philosopher Karl Popper, whose concept of the open society made a lifelong impression. Popper\u2019s key distinction was between closed societies that claim to possess one, ultimate truth to which the population must submit; and open societies, which allow and even demand that citizens make their own choices. Having lived through both fascist and communist regimes, Soros became infatuated with this idea; he spent years reading and writing on the topic during his free time, and it continues to inform his philanthropic efforts. In his book, he explains that it is a principle that has to be defended again and again. \u201cOpen society will always have its enemies, and each generation has to reaffirm its commitment for it to survive.\u201d Soros moved to the US in 1956. His plan was to get a job on Wall Street, make $500,000 on the stock market, then return to London to study philosophy. He got a series of trading jobs before managing one of the first hedge funds \u2013 using investments to take both long and short positions in the market. He turned out to be too good at making money to give it up, moving in and out of different markets quickly; he has said that a key part of his success lay in acknowledging and reversing his mistakes. In 1992, Soros became famous as \u201cthe man who broke the bank of England\u201d, as his bets against sterling contributed to Black Wednesday. The British government had to withdraw the pound from the exchange rate mechanism, and Soros pocketed around $1bn, for which he was vilified by the tabloids. He has expressed no remorse for making a fortune out of currency speculation, shrugging that others would do the same if he didn\u2019t. He also claims that his personal role in Black Wednesday was exaggerated, but also that the timing suited him: he was looking for a bigger audience. \u201cI deliberately allowed it to happen in order to establish a platform from which I could speak out on other issues,\u201d he writes in the new book. \u201cAnd it worked. Suddenly I had a voice that could be heard.\u201d At the same time, Soros significantly increased his philanthropic spending. Unlike most other big bureaucratic trusts, where decisions are taken by boards, he is personally involved in the discussions about where the money goes. Talking to him, you get the sense he is driven by structural injustices far more than by individual suffering. On occasion, Soros has provided purely humanitarian aid: $50m to help the besieged citizens of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war; grants for more than 30,000 Russian scientists in the early 90s to keep their research alive. But he is most passionate when talking about long-term institutional reform than life-saving emergency assistance. When I ask what he is most proud of among all his projects, he talks about the incomplete but promising political progress made in Ukraine, where his foundation has supported a broad range of civil society programmes over decades. \u201cI always wanted successes in the near term, and with experience I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that real successes need 25 years,\u201d he says. \u201cTake a country like Ukraine: it had a number of revolutions, and they each failed, and now you had a free and fair election,\u201d he says, referring to the vote earlier this year for president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In the 2004 Ukrainian election, exit polls conducted by a Soros foundation showed a very different result to the official count, and Viktor Yanukovych, who had \u201cwon\u201d the first vote, was forced to concede. He came back to power in 2010, before being toppled amid violent clashes in 2014. These revolutions, Soros says, were inevitable but not sufficient. \u201cDictators, if they are successful, always go too far, because there are no checks and balances to stop them\u2026 The point comes where people who have been cowed into obedience rebel, and there\u2019s a revolution. Revolutions generally don\u2019t succeed. You need to develop institutions, which is what open societies are all about.\u201d In the past, Putin has blamed Soros for sparking unrest \u2013 something he denies, but in a qualified manner that would hardly reassure the Russian president. \u201cIt was the people of the country who rebelled,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I enabled them to do it by various steps that the foundations took, like reliable exit polls.\u201d It is this approach that has so exercised his critics: few authoritarians would feel threatened by the distribution of mosquito nets or emergency food supplies; but the funding of critical media, legal aid NGOs and minority rights advocacy groups is a different matter. More recently, Orb\u00e1n has emerged from a competitive international field to become Soros\u2019s most ferocious critic. As a young anti-communist firebrand in the late 80s, Orb\u00e1n and his fellow young democrats received funding from Soros through his new Hungarian foundation. Orb\u00e1n even won a Soros-funded scholarship to study for a year at Oxford University in 1989. Three decades on, the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s media outlets refer to a \u201cSoros plan\u201d to ship millions of refugees to Europe and destroy the continent; last year, his parliament passed a \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill that, among other things, imposes a 25% tax on any organisation providing assistance to migrants. The Soros-founded Central European University has been forced to move much of its operations from Budapest to Vienna. Like many of Soros\u2019s rightwing critics, Orb\u00e1n often employs barely concealed antisemitism in his attacks. Last spring, I watched the prime minister give a speech outside the ornately beautiful parliament building, on the same square where Soros lived as a child. \u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told a flag-waving crowd. \u201cNot open, but hiding. Not straightforward, but crafty. Not honest, but base. Not national, but international. It does not believe in working but speculates with money; it does not have its own homeland, but feels it owns the whole world.\u201d This succinct summation of antisemitic tropes was delivered just a few hundred metres from a monument marking the place where hundreds of Jews were executed by fascists during the second world war. I asked Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, about the speech at the time and he denied it was antisemitic \u2013 even insinuating that my question was, because it implied that only Jews could be speculators. The Hungarian government\u2019s problem with Soros, he said, was that he uses NGOs for political purposes, despite having no \u201cmandate\u201d to do so. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that if you say the word NGO, it goes without saying that it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true.\u201d Many people \u2013 and not just rightwingers \u2013 might wonder if Kov\u00e1cs has a point. If you remove the antisemitism and political opportunism from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s attacks, is a leader like him right to fear the work of the Soros foundations? Soros shrugs, and sidesteps the question. \u201cWe are on opposite sides of our concept of a good society. I supported Orb\u00e1n because at the time he was a very active supporter of open society. But he became an exploiter and the creator of a mafia state.\u201d Soros\u2019s supporters would argue that what rightwing leaders consider \u201cpolitical interference\u201d is merely backing for freer and more tolerant societies. Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, who was elected president of Slovakia in June, told me earlier this year that it is misguided for governments in the region to accuse Soros of political interference. A former civil society activist, \u010caputov\u00e1 has received Soros foundation grants in the past, and strikes a very different tone. \u201cThanks to the money from this organisation, a lot of good and valuable work has been done in Slovakia,\u201d she told me in April, shortly after winning the vote. \u201cMost of the grants were broadly in support of democracy, rather than trying to dictate on specific issues.\u201d But in taking a side in the Brexit debate, for example, isn\u2019t Soros straying into political ground? Yes and no, he says. \u201cIt falls into the category of what I call political philanthropy. Brexit is a process of disintegration that hurts both sides. It hurts Britain more on a pro rata basis and Europe more in absolute terms. Most importantly, European values can be better defended if the two of them are united. My contributions were not used for partisan or electoral purposes. They were used to educate the British public.\u201d *** An hour into our interview, Soros asks if we can take a break; the batteries have run out in his hearing aid. His wife Tamiko appears and they leave the room together for a couple of minutes to change them. When he returns, we get back to the subject of the man from farther down Fifth Avenue. Soros doesn\u2019t like getting personal: he is careful, even when it comes to Orb\u00e1n, to say that theirs is a battle between competing ideologies; he won\u2019t be drawn into the mudslinging. But Trump, for whom his disdain is explicit, is the exception. \u201cI think he\u2019s a brilliant confidence trickster, who has succeeded beyond his own expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the fulfilment of the dream of a narcissist, and that\u2019s what carries him forward.\u201d Nevertheless, Soros thinks this combination of self-regard and insecurity has led the president to make terrible decisions. \u201cIn a way, we are lucky to have him because of the internal contradiction in him \u2013 he is his own worst enemy. He\u2019s digging his own grave, because of his addiction to narcissism.\u201d In recent years, Soros has become one of the biggest donors to Democrat causes and candidates. Of the current crop of contenders, he insists he does not want to endorse any candidate publicly: \u201cThis is not something that a major donor ought to be deciding \u2013 it should be decided by the electorate.\u201d Nonetheless, he speaks of Elizabeth Warren in glowing terms. \u201cShe has the experience and energy for the job. She understands the flaws of the prevailing system and has many innovative ideas about how to fix them. She would make mincemeat out of Trump in debates.\u201d He also likes Warren\u2019s plans for increased taxes on the rich. Despite his handsome profits, Soros considers himself a long-standing critic of the current financial system. \u201cThe disparity in wealth in the United States certainly contributed to the rise of Trump,\u201d he says. As far back as 1997, he wrote that laissez-faire capitalism, with its certainty in the supremacy of the market, was a new threat to any open society. He tells me he would levy a wealth tax on the super-rich \u2013 including himself \u2013 because it is the best way to fund the necessary spending on the climate crisis, an area where he feels Trump\u2019s presidency is a particular disaster. \u201cThere is a connection between the problems of open society and the problems of climate change... You\u2019ve got somebody like Trump who actually denies it, and that really makes it very hard to take the steps which are necessary to bring it under control,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, as the temperature of anti-Soros rhetoric has risen, his staff have been taking his safety more seriously. Last year, an explosive device was mailed to Soros\u2019s upstate New York residence. It was quickly detected and nobody was injured, but it showed that the threats to his life were not hypothetical. Has it restricted his movements? \u201cI am willing to risk my life for my ideas and beliefs when necessary, but I don\u2019t expose myself to unnecessary danger,\u201d he says. It is unlikely that he will return to Hungary while Orb\u00e1n is in power, he says, fearful that the relentless propaganda could inspire a physical attack. \u201cIt\u2019s quite dangerous because he has got some blind followers, just like Trump, and they may try to get me.\u201d A few days after we meet, Soros attends a board meeting of his US foundation, where the discussion focuses on how its work can be adapted to address the altered political landscape. Already Soros has made a $10m donation to a programme aimed at tackling the upsurge in hate crime in America. The 2020 budget for his US foundation has been set at $185m, nearly double the 2016 figure. \u201cFor the moment it\u2019s the still-unresolved crisis of the developed world that needs most of our attention,\u201d he tells me. Time is not on Soros\u2019s side, but it is widely expected that his 34-year-old son, Alex, will be his successor when it comes to running the foundations. I ask Soros if he is scared of dying. \u201cIt\u2019s the loss of consciousness that is so frightening for a person like me, who is so involved in thinking and understanding the world. But dying is a natural consequence of having been born and so it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of,\u201d he says. Is it something he thinks about a lot? \u201cOriginally, I wanted to spend my money while I am alive, but then I realised that would be very selfish. There are a lot of other people who have devoted their lives to working for the foundation and I owe it to them to allow the foundation to continue beyond my life.\u201d As is the case many times in the interview, he has answered a slightly different question to the one I asked. I leave unsure whether this is the confusion of old age or, more likely, a canny tactic to divulge information on his own terms. In his new book, Soros describes 2016 as the \u201cnadir\u201d in terms of the move away from open societies \u2013 with the vote for Brexit and the election of Trump. He tells me he now sees some signs that \u201cthe tide is turning again\u201d: there is the increasing momentum around the Trump impeachment discussion, and then there was the European parliament election earlier this year, in which nationalists did not do as well as many had feared. As someone who experienced the horrors of Nazi-occupied Europe, does he think those who draw comparisons to that era are wide of the mark \u2013 or could the world be heading to a truly dark place? \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t exclude it,\u201d he says. But that depends on all of us, he thinks. \u201cWe can\u2019t passively wait for things to go right. We have to act on our principles, even when the situation appears hopeless.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

It runs the gamut from familiar canon titles (including a range of Criterion Collection titles such as Black Orpheus and Antonioni\u2019s L\u2019Avventura) to rare curiosities: the short, sparky, Josephine Baker-starring 1945 farce The French Way was a particularly delicious find. Parents should also note the separate Kanopy Kids area, which promises to broaden young library users\u2019 horizons beyond Peppa Pig with diverse programming such as the Nigerian education cartoon Bino and Fino and classic shorts like the original 1973 animated version of Where the Wild Things Are. It\u2019s all unimprovably good value for us, though how libraries take to the economics involved is the one question mark hanging over Kanopy\u2019s expansion. The company runs on a \u201cpatron-driven acquisition\u201d model that charges the participating library a licence fee for each individual user\u2019s viewing of a film. Kanopy\u2019s growing popularity comes at a literal cost: a few major New York libraries recently discontinued the service after finding their budget stretched. It\u2019s early days yet for Kanopy in the UK: right now, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have access, get in while the going\u2019s free. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week The Souvenir (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) Joanna Hogg\u2019s semi-autobiographical portrait of the artist as a young film student is one of the year\u2019s great films: a thing of wistful, opalescent, self-effacing beauty. Apollo 11 (Dogwoof, E) You may not think you need to see another film about the 1969 moon landing, but this immersively sensory documentary, constructed from previously unseen 65mm footage, proves otherwise. Varda by Agn\u00e8s (BFI, 15) Premiered shortly before her death in March, the final film by puckish French auteur Agn\u00e8s Varda is exactly the farewell her devotees could have hoped for: a gently whimsical, meandering overview of her storied career. Yesterday (Universal, 12) Imagine there\u2019s no Beatles, I wonder if you can. The British sensibilities of Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis blend like oil and water in this terminally silly, overdirected puffball. The Fall (iPlayer) The new five-minute short film from genius film-maker Jonathan Glazer (Under the Skin) was sprung unannounced on BBC Two viewers last week. Now you can catch up with his vivid, nightmarish allegory for modern mob justice.",

If they were serious about tackling the climate emergency, they wouldn\u2019t leave it to backbench MPs.\u201d Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said: \u201cTackling the climate emergency is not an issue just for politicians. It needs to include everyone or we will not succeed in building a sustainable, just and fair society. Citizens\u2019 assemblies are the ideal vehicle to do this and I warmly welcome this initial step.\u201d Separately, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has announced a review of the economics of reaching the net-zero target, including ways to use government policy to generate green growth and prevent the UK from exporting the emissions from manufacturing goods to other countries. \u201cThe UK is leading the way on tackling climate change as the first major economy to legislate for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must all play a part in protecting the planet for future generations. This review is a vital next step in delivering that commitment, ensuring that we can end our contribution to global warming, while supporting growth and balancing costs, to avoid placing unfair burdens on families or businesses.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A record \u00a36.8bn festive advertising spree gets under way this weekend with Argos, Asda, Iceland and Walkers calling on the star power of Mariah Carey and the cast of Frozen to help shift everything from crisps to turkey crowns and musical instruments.</p> <p>Argos and Iceland\u2019s ads are launching during ITV\u2019s Coronation Street on Friday, while commercials from Asda and Walkers \u2013 which will feature Carey \u2013 both debut during Celebrity X Factor on Saturday. The singer was reportedly paid \u00a39m to promote a range of Christmassy-flavoured crisps.</p> <p>Boots and Marks &amp; Spencer are expected to launch their campaigns next week while Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and John Lewis \u2013 whose ad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/15/elton-john-brings-star-quality-john-lewis-christmas-advert\">last year featured Elton John</a> \u2013 are set to reveal their Christmas extravaganzas after Remembrance Day on 11 November.</p> <p>The brands\u2019 festive commercials herald the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is known as the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d when stores make the vast majority of their profits. Shoppers are expected to spend \u00a380bn in the final six weeks of the season alone, according to a report by <a href=\"https://www.vouchercodes.co.uk/press/reports/vouchercodes-crr-shopping-for-christmas-2019\">the Centre for Retail Research report for Vouchercodes.co.uk.</a></p> <p>But the barrage of high-end ads masks an expected 1% fall in spending on TV commercials year on year to \u00a31.4bn as brands switch to online, radio and cinema according to research by WARC for the Advertising Association. It will be the first Christmas period that spending online will outweigh that on TV, in a total spend of \u00a36.8bn in the final quarter of 2019 \u2013 up nearly 5% on last year.</p> <p>Online display ad spending will hit \u00a31.75bn, in a double-digit rise, while national newspapers will post a decline of 2.6% with a spend of \u00a3265.7m.</p> <p>\u201cTV is the best for building brand stories and mass audience emotional connections and Christmas is a particularly strong time for big multi-media brand campaigns,\u201d said Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association.</p> <p>Argos\u2019s campaign, for example, is led by a TV ad calculated to pull on the heart strings. A kitchen turns into a stage complete with dancing fans after a dad spots that his daughter has circled a drum kit in the traditional catalogue. In a dream sequence he plays along in his slippers to Simple Minds hit Don\u2019t You (Forget About Me). The daughter joins in, with impressive drumming skills, as the freezer becomes a dry ice machine and the cooker morphs into stage lights.</p> <p>The TV clip links to a digital campaign in which the company has made more than 40 years of vintage catalogues available online while celebrities and members of the public reminisce about leafing through their \u201cbook of dreams\u201d.</p> <p>Asda\u2019s TV ad also stars a young girl, in a whimsical sequence in which she spreads the magic of Christmas caught from the northern lights across her village. It is tied into a digital storybook, Santa\u2019s Leftover Magic, part of the proceeds of which will go to the retailer\u2019s Fight Hunger Create Change initiative which works with food banks<em>.</em></p> <p>Mariah Carey\u2019s Walkers ad, which features her singing All I want for Christmas is You, while tussling with an elf over a bag of crisps, was already being teased on digital channels on Friday.</p> <p>Iceland won huge traffic on social media last year for a commercial featuring a Greenpeace-made animation about destruction of Orangutans\u2019 rainforest habitat. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/09/iceland-christmas-tv-ad-banned-political-greenpeace-orangutan\">pulled from TV</a> because it breached political advertising rules. But this year it has opted for a more traditional tie-up with Disney film Frozen 2, including a family playing charades with characters from the film.</p> <p>Woodford said digital advertising continued to grow strongly because brands and retailers were following audiences and looking for channels where they could target particular audiences efficiently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added: \u201cSmall and medium-sized businesses are also driving huge growth online. Twenty years ago small businesses had limited choices but now a one-person business can advertise using digital channels to 100 people if they choose to. It has also opened up routes for a small business to reach global markets.\u201d</p> <p>The expected fall in TV spending comes after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/07/traditional-retailers-roll-back-christmas-advertising-campaigns\">ITV\u2019s shares were hit last year </a>by a warning of a difficult Christmas caused by the switch to online and cutbacks by retailers who are trying to trim budgets in a difficult market.</p> <p>Paul Bainsfair, director general of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, said TV spend had held up partly because of a belief that about 60% of spending should go towards brand-building emotional ads rather than more direct calls to buy.</p> <p>But he said recent budget pressure had encourage brands to use digital channels which they saw as providing a quicker return on investment because it more directly prompts spending.</p> <p>\u201cIn the times we are living in people are driven by short term,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to include the name of the commissioner of the report by the Centre for Retail Research.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A record \u00a36.8bn festive advertising spree gets under way this weekend with Argos, Asda, Iceland and Walkers calling on the star power of Mariah Carey and the cast of Frozen to help shift everything from crisps to turkey crowns and musical instruments. Argos and Iceland\u2019s ads are launching during ITV\u2019s Coronation Street on Friday, while commercials from Asda and Walkers \u2013 which will feature Carey \u2013 both debut during Celebrity X Factor on Saturday. The singer was reportedly paid \u00a39m to promote a range of Christmassy-flavoured crisps. Boots and Marks &amp; Spencer are expected to launch their campaigns next week while Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and John Lewis \u2013 whose ad last year featured Elton John \u2013 are set to reveal their Christmas extravaganzas after Remembrance Day on 11 November. The brands\u2019 festive commercials herald the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is known as the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d when stores make the vast majority of their profits. Shoppers are expected to spend \u00a380bn in the final six weeks of the season alone, according to a report by the Centre for Retail Research report for Vouchercodes.co.uk. But the barrage of high-end ads masks an expected 1% fall in spending on TV commercials year on year to \u00a31.4bn as brands switch to online, radio and cinema according to research by WARC for the Advertising Association. It will be the first Christmas period that spending online will outweigh that on TV, in a total spend of \u00a36.8bn in the final quarter of 2019 \u2013 up nearly 5% on last year. Online display ad spending will hit \u00a31.75bn, in a double-digit rise, while national newspapers will post a decline of 2.6% with a spend of \u00a3265.7m. \u201cTV is the best for building brand stories and mass audience emotional connections and Christmas is a particularly strong time for big multi-media brand campaigns,\u201d said Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association. Argos\u2019s campaign, for example, is led by a TV ad calculated to pull on the heart strings. A kitchen turns into a stage complete with dancing fans after a dad spots that his daughter has circled a drum kit in the traditional catalogue. In a dream sequence he plays along in his slippers to Simple Minds hit Don\u2019t You (Forget About Me). The daughter joins in, with impressive drumming skills, as the freezer becomes a dry ice machine and the cooker morphs into stage lights. The TV clip links to a digital campaign in which the company has made more than 40 years of vintage catalogues available online while celebrities and members of the public reminisce about leafing through their \u201cbook of dreams\u201d. Asda\u2019s TV ad also stars a young girl, in a whimsical sequence in which she spreads the magic of Christmas caught from the northern lights across her village. It is tied into a digital storybook, Santa\u2019s Leftover Magic, part of the proceeds of which will go to the retailer\u2019s Fight Hunger Create Change initiative which works with food banks. Mariah Carey\u2019s Walkers ad, which features her singing All I want for Christmas is You, while tussling with an elf over a bag of crisps, was already being teased on digital channels on Friday. Iceland won huge traffic on social media last year for a commercial featuring a Greenpeace-made animation about destruction of Orangutans\u2019 rainforest habitat. It was pulled from TV because it breached political advertising rules. But this year it has opted for a more traditional tie-up with Disney film Frozen 2, including a family playing charades with characters from the film. Woodford said digital advertising continued to grow strongly because brands and retailers were following audiences and looking for channels where they could target particular audiences efficiently. He added: \u201cSmall and medium-sized businesses are also driving huge growth online. Twenty years ago small businesses had limited choices but now a one-person business can advertise using digital channels to 100 people if they choose to. It has also opened up routes for a small business to reach global markets.\u201d The expected fall in TV spending comes after ITV\u2019s shares were hit last year by a warning of a difficult Christmas caused by the switch to online and cutbacks by retailers who are trying to trim budgets in a difficult market. Paul Bainsfair, director general of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, said TV spend had held up partly because of a belief that about 60% of spending should go towards brand-building emotional ads rather than more direct calls to buy. But he said recent budget pressure had encourage brands to use digital channels which they saw as providing a quicker return on investment because it more directly prompts spending. \u201cIn the times we are living in people are driven by short term,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to include the name of the commissioner of the report by the Centre for Retail Research.",

Before KSI and Paul fought last year, Hearn said the bout was embarrassing and that, as a boxing enthusiast, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could stand up there and sell, and be a part of that.\u201d However, money talks. The protagonists each have about 20 million YouTube subscribers and more than 9bn views between them. Announcing the rematch, Hearn said witnessing the first fight he saw \u201ca phenomenon, a sold-out arena, more than 1m pay-per-view buys but more importantly an energy of a new audience to the sport of boxing\u201d. He has suggested the worldwide audience could be more than 50 million \u2013 although promoters are prone to exaggeration \u2013 so retaining the interest of a fraction would boost the sport. But despite seeing the positives, Collins was clear why Sky and Hearn were involved: \u201cAs soon as they see a pound note, they\u2019re going to go after it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the newly independent nation of Uzbekistan has earned a reputation as one of the world\u2019s most repressive countries.

Its political process is tinged with sinister black comedy: when I interviewed a former presidential candidate in 2001, he was at great pains to make clear that he had cast his own vote for the incumbent president. \u201cIf it had come down to one vote, I couldn\u2019t have lived with myself if he had lost,\u201d he said. He needn\u2019t have worried: the president \u201cwon\u201d more than 95% of the vote.</p> <p>But beyond the sham democracy, human rights violations and authoritarianism of present day Uzbekistan lies a rich cultural tradition that fuses Persian and Turkic influences and has built the ancient cities of Samarkand and Bukhara. Uzbekistan also claims as a native son possibly the greatest Islamic philosopher who ever lived: the polymath Abu Ali al-Husayn ibn Sina, known to the west as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/07/surprise-as-unknown-irish-translation-of-ibn-sina-discovered-in-spine-of-book\" title=\"\">Avicenna</a>.</p> <p>History records that Avicenna was born near Bukhara in the 10th century AD, spent his itinerant life writing treatises on philosophy and medicine, and died in exile in Persia, aged about 55.

May it be cursed. Once you have become a stranger, a stranger you shall remain; you may endeavour to make friends, but the task is a difficult one, full end to end with uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s this preoccupation with the agony of exile that links the different strands and gives this triply picaresque book its unity. Ismailov himself has had to live outside Uzbekistan since 1992, thanks to what the Uzbek government called \u201cunacceptable democratic tendencies\u201d. In an occult way, the book suggests, each of the three characters are incarnations of Avicenna himself, the wandering philosopher. Sheikhov\u2019s name recalls one of Avicenna\u2019s titles: Sheikh-ar-Rais \u2013 the Supreme Teacher.</p> <p>Ismailov\u2019s translator, Shelley Fairweather-Vega, has done a nice job rendering the switches in register between the various threads of the tale. One of the great achievements of the book is to upend western readers\u2019 assumptions. Dates are given according to the Islamic calendar and Sheikhov\u2019s natural frames of reference are all Uzbek ones. This unfamiliar normal, centred on Islamic civilisation and the literature of Central Asia, exoticises the west in ways that are both telling and funny. For Sheikhov, the mean streets of a provincial town in Brandenburg feel as threatening and strange as the Cairo bazaar does for Indiana Jones. Similarly, when he meets Abdujapparov, he gropes for an appropriate metaphor to convey to the reader a sense of what it means to be a gifted sprint cyclist. \u201cI would compare him with a rider in a traditional Central Asian buzkashi match - the game some people call goat polo - who would steal the goat carcass away from his opponent at the last second, and burst free of the crowd of other riders to victory.\u201d</p> <p>Learned, strange and charming, <em>Of Strangers and Bees</em> enriched my understanding of history. It\u2019s also gently ecumenical, fusing Christian and Islamic themes, and reminding the reader of the mythic tradition of bees - from a Breton legend about their origin in the tears of Christ, to the Islamic verse which Ismailov quotes approvingly: \u201cThere emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colours, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for people who give thought.\u201d</p> <p>One quibble is that the magic realist sections, which veer occasionally into bombast, lack the emotional punch of Sheikhov\u2019s episodes. The Stranger is an immortal with no human ties, whereas Sheikhov is vulnerable, impoverished and separated from his young daughter. It\u2019s the pathos and comedy of Sheikhov\u2019s misadventures that give the book its power. Meanwhile, the strangely poignant little bee Sina is there to remind us that there are forms of ceaseless wandering that can be enriching and productive.

That means these owners can\u2019t sell up or switch to a cheaper mortgage.</p> <p>Stevenson owns a two-bedroom flat in an 18-floor private housing block in Barking, east London, and had wanted to sell to buy a three-bedroom property. An interesting quirk in her case is that Barclays was one of the banks that turned her down for a remortgage because of \u201cissues with cladding and fire safety\u201d \u2013 yet there is a Barclays branch on the ground floor of her building.</p> <p>Some might say that if the bank thinks the building is safe enough to let its employees work there, why won\u2019t it touch her with a bargepole? However, that might be a little unfair on Barclays, as this is clearly an industry-wide issue.</p> <p>Stevenson, who has a 17-month-old son, bought her flat 10 years ago, and told Guardian Money: \u201cI\u2019m trapped in terms of the future. I can\u2019t sell unless it\u2019s to a cash buyer.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, wanting a better mortgage deal, she approached several lenders. But she found many had changed their rules just in the last few months \u2013 for example, Santander updated its lending policy relating to buildings with cladding in May, while Barclays\u2019 revised policy took effect in June.</p> <p>In each case, the valuation came back as \u201czero\u201d until a specialist report was issued confirming the property meets the requirements of the current guidance from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. All the banks said this report had to be commissioned by her building manager and done by a suitably-qualified expert who is a member of one of an approved list of bodies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55067e6be09ff49f3f50a463b2d5beb2d7a43377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55067e6be09ff49f3f50a463b2d5beb2d7a43377/0_0_5208_7804/667.jpg\" alt=\"The 18-floor block in Barking in which Lucy Stevenson lives\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 18-floor block in Barking in which Lucy Stevenson lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe problem is, my building manager is reluctant to do such a report, and I cannot compel him to do so,\u201d says Stevenson.</p> <p>But the situation is actually a lot more serious than that. <a href=\"http://www.principleestate.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LEASEHOLDER_MHCLG-Advice-on-Building-Fire-Safety.pdf\" title=\"\">In a briefing document</a>, Arma, the leading trade body for residential leasehold management, said that \u201ccurrent demand for the services of suitably qualified experts is excessively high,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are being advised this potentially means a wait of six to 12 months or more. It is deeply regrettable that this means, in some instances, owners may struggle to remortgage or sell their properties until this report is available.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Morrey, product technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol, says this is \u201ca huge problem\u201d and is creating thousands of \u201cmortgage prisoners\u201d who have very limited options.</p> <p>While her building\u2019s outer skin is made of real solid brick, there are some small isolated single sheet aluminium panels, though this is not the aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding that helped spread the fire that claimed 72 lives at Grenfell. There is also some possibly combustible (but not flammable) insulation between the outer brick construction and the concrete inner frame.</p> <p>Valuers and lenders toughened up their criteria on high-rise blocks after the government issued what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/765761/Expert_Panel_advice_note_on_non-ACM.pdf\" title=\"\">advice note 14</a>\u201d relating to cladding in December 2018. However, low-rise apartment buildings were also dragged into all of this following a fire at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/samuel-garside-residents-move-back-despite-fire-safety-fears\" title=\"\">block</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/samuel-garside-residents-move-back-despite-fire-safety-fears\" title=\"\"> in Barking in June</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/09/worcester-park-fire-four-storey-block-of-flats-alight-in-south-west-london\" title=\"\">another in Worcester Park in Sutton</a>, south-west London, in September.</p> <p>In June the government issued an advice note on the risks relating to balconies, which resulted in things being tightened up even more.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the advice for those affected?</p> <p>If remortgaging to another lender looks tricky, talk to your existing bank or building society and ask for a full list of products you can move to, says Morrey.</p> <p>Barclays confirmed the need for a written report in cases where a valuer identifies that a building\u2019s external facade may contain potentially combustible materials. In a letter to Stevenson, it said that \u201cwe are not saying the building is unsafe or a fire risk as we are not qualified to make that assessment\u201d.</p> <p>One bit of good news is that Fiona Haggett, head of valuations at Barclays Mortgages, has been working on a solution regarding buildings with cladding that has been put forward to chartered surveyor body Rics to implement as an industry-wide initiative. Rics has agreed to adopt Haggett\u2019s certificate idea, which should make it much easier to identify buildings that are not impacted by all of this, and will hopefully open up the market for some flats, she says.</p> <p>Stevenson\u2019s building manager, Block Management UK Ltd, told us: \u201cHaving facilitated many safety tests at sites we manage, we are sympathetic to all affected by lender requirements. We, and hundreds of agents, are relying on the professional bodies and government to confirm a testing specification that will satisfy lender requirements, further ensure people\u2019s safety and protect their investments.\u201d</p>",

All of this is feeding through to thousands living in \u201chigh-rise\u201d (defined as more than 18 metres) apartment blocks, as well as many living in smaller blocks, because property valuers are taking the view that unless they have all the facts at their fingertips \u2013 for example, is there any chance the cost might fall on the leaseholder? \u2013 they can\u2019t put a valuation on the property. That means these owners can\u2019t sell up or switch to a cheaper mortgage. Stevenson owns a two-bedroom flat in an 18-floor private housing block in Barking, east London, and had wanted to sell to buy a three-bedroom property. An interesting quirk in her case is that Barclays was one of the banks that turned her down for a remortgage because of \u201cissues with cladding and fire safety\u201d \u2013 yet there is a Barclays branch on the ground floor of her building. Some might say that if the bank thinks the building is safe enough to let its employees work there, why won\u2019t it touch her with a bargepole? However, that might be a little unfair on Barclays, as this is clearly an industry-wide issue. Stevenson, who has a 17-month-old son, bought her flat 10 years ago, and told Guardian Money: \u201cI\u2019m trapped in terms of the future. I can\u2019t sell unless it\u2019s to a cash buyer.\u201d Earlier this year, wanting a better mortgage deal, she approached several lenders. But she found many had changed their rules just in the last few months \u2013 for example, Santander updated its lending policy relating to buildings with cladding in May, while Barclays\u2019 revised policy took effect in June. In each case, the valuation came back as \u201czero\u201d until a specialist report was issued confirming the property meets the requirements of the current guidance from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. All the banks said this report had to be commissioned by her building manager and done by a suitably-qualified expert who is a member of one of an approved list of bodies. \u201cThe problem is, my building manager is reluctant to do such a report, and I cannot compel him to do so,\u201d says Stevenson. But the situation is actually a lot more serious than that. In a briefing document, Arma, the leading trade body for residential leasehold management, said that \u201ccurrent demand for the services of suitably qualified experts is excessively high,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are being advised this potentially means a wait of six to 12 months or more. It is deeply regrettable that this means, in some instances, owners may struggle to remortgage or sell their properties until this report is available.\u201d Nick Morrey, product technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol, says this is \u201ca huge problem\u201d and is creating thousands of \u201cmortgage prisoners\u201d who have very limited options. While her building\u2019s outer skin is made of real solid brick, there are some small isolated single sheet aluminium panels, though this is not the aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding that helped spread the fire that claimed 72 lives at Grenfell. There is also some possibly combustible (but not flammable) insulation between the outer brick construction and the concrete inner frame. Valuers and lenders toughened up their criteria on high-rise blocks after the government issued what\u2019s known as \u201cadvice note 14\u201d relating to cladding in December 2018. However, low-rise apartment buildings were also dragged into all of this following a fire at a block in Barking in June, and another in Worcester Park in Sutton, south-west London, in September. In June the government issued an advice note on the risks relating to balconies, which resulted in things being tightened up even more. So what\u2019s the advice for those affected? If remortgaging to another lender looks tricky, talk to your existing bank or building society and ask for a full list of products you can move to, says Morrey. Barclays confirmed the need for a written report in cases where a valuer identifies that a building\u2019s external facade may contain potentially combustible materials. In a letter to Stevenson, it said that \u201cwe are not saying the building is unsafe or a fire risk as we are not qualified to make that assessment\u201d. One bit of good news is that Fiona Haggett, head of valuations at Barclays Mortgages, has been working on a solution regarding buildings with cladding that has been put forward to chartered surveyor body Rics to implement as an industry-wide initiative. Rics has agreed to adopt Haggett\u2019s certificate idea, which should make it much easier to identify buildings that are not impacted by all of this, and will hopefully open up the market for some flats, she says. Stevenson\u2019s building manager, Block Management UK Ltd, told us: \u201cHaving facilitated many safety tests at sites we manage, we are sympathetic to all affected by lender requirements. We, and hundreds of agents, are relying on the professional bodies and government to confirm a testing specification that will satisfy lender requirements, further ensure people\u2019s safety and protect their investments.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Loft insulation</strong></h2> <p><em>Cost: \u00a3350 or less<br>Potential saving: \u00a315-\u00a3135 a year, depending on existing insulation level</em></p> <p>Most householders are aware that they need it, and in most cases they will have some. But when did you last pop up into the loft to check your insulation?</p> <p>James Higgins, a spokesman for the National Insulation Association, says you should have a depth of 27cm for glass wool \u2013 the most common form of loft insulation. Anything less than that and it\u2019s time for an upgrade. A professional installation typically costs \u00a3350, although you can do it yourself for less. Don\u2019t be tempted to tamp it down, as this impedes its effectiveness.</p> <p>For hard-to-get-to loft spaces, consider spray-in insulation, and if you are converting a loft, insulate it to the max, Higgins says.</p> <h2><strong>Underfloor insulation</strong></h2> <p><em>Cost: \u00a3700-\u00a31,000<br>Potential saving: \u00a370 a year</em></p> <p>Older homes, typically those built from the 1930s to the 1950s, are most likely to have suspended timber floors: if you have air bricks or ventilation bricks on your outside walls, you probably have these. Such floors can be insulated by lifting the boards and laying wool insulation supported by netting between the joists. Higgins says he is about to get this done in his home. It typically costs \u00a3700-\u00a31,000 and will save you \u00a340 to \u00a370 a year in the resulting lower heating bills.</p> <p>A cheaper alternative is just to fill any gaps between floorboards that let cold air in. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/16/1\" title=\"\">tests conducted by the Guardian</a>, StopGap sealant was found to be the best overall product. It costs \u00a325 for 40 metres and will seal cracks 1mm to 8mm wide. You\u2019ll notice a significant difference in temperature.</p> <h2><strong>Draught exclusion</strong></h2> <p><em>Cost: \u00a3200 or DIY<br>Potential</em><em> saving: \u00a340 a year</em></p> <p>Trying to cut out all cold drafts around an older house can become an obsession. It\u2019s better to focus on the big wins.</p> <p>Unused open fireplaces need a blocking balloon or a \u00a320 <a href=\"https://www.chimneysheep.co.uk/product-category/chimney-draught-excluders/\" title=\"\">Chimney </a><a href=\"https://www.chimneysheep.co.uk/product-category/chimney-draught-excluders/\" title=\"\">Sheep</a>. Catflaps, old extractor fans and letter boxes leak cold air and need to be sealed. A thermal lining on curtains will really make a difference; minimalists could consider thermal blinds instead. Cheap sticky-back foam door seals can work well.</p> <p>The Energy Saving Trust says a professional will charge \u00a3200 or so to draught-proof your home. If you have an internal door to the garage that keeps getting left open, how about an automatic closer?</p> <p>Generally, double glazing rarely makes financial sense as the installation costs dwarf the typical \u00a370 a year saving through lower energy bills. The house will feel much more comfortable, though.</p> <h2><strong>LED light bulbs</strong></h2> <p><em>Cost: \u00a32-\u00a380<br>Potential saving </em><em>\u00a3200 a year</em></p> <p>No, this isn\u2019t going to improve your heating, but is an essential change all households should make. If you are still using old-style 100-watt bulbs \u2013 or even worse, energy-guzzling halogens \u2013 you could easily be throwing away over \u00a3200 a year on unnecessarily high electricity bills.</p> <p>The latest LED bulbs typically operate at 4-9 watts, a tiny fraction of the bulbs they replace. Once \u00a320 each, they have collapsed in price in the last few years, making this a no-brainer. Screwfix offers some of the<a href=\"https://www.screwfix.com/c/electrical-lighting/light-bulbs/cat8350001?calclightbulbtechnology=led\" title=\"\">cheapest LED</a>s and they now cost \u00a32 to \u00a33 each, depending on the fitting. Fit them across your home and you will slash your electricity use. Someone using 40 LED bulbs for an average of 2.7 hours a day \u2013 the Energy Saving Trust\u2019s typical use figure \u2013 will spend around \u00a323 annually \u2013 compared with \u00a3287 for halogens. Just take out the old bulbs and put in the new one; anyone can do it. This is one of the cheapest, easiest green measures you can introduce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f6e76562aad110827edcaa181d4543114982434\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f6e76562aad110827edcaa181d4543114982434/1_0_3635_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Nest thermostat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Nest thermostat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Smart heating controller</strong></h2> <p><em>Cost: \u00a3200<br>Potential</em><em> saving: \u00a370-\u00a3100 a year</em></p> <p>Another measure that really delivers lower energy usage \u2013 with a quick payback time. <a href=\"https://www.britishgas.co.uk/smart-home/hive-heating.html#product\" title=\"\">British Gas\u2019s Hive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/03/google-nest-learning-thermostat-third-generation-home-gadget-smart-heating\" title=\"\">Google\u2019s Nest</a> are the big two.

      "bodyText": "Loft insulation Cost: \u00a3350 or less Potential saving: \u00a315-\u00a3135 a year, depending on existing insulation level Most householders are aware that they need it, and in most cases they will have some. But when did you last pop up into the loft to check your insulation? James Higgins, a spokesman for the National Insulation Association, says you should have a depth of 27cm for glass wool \u2013 the most common form of loft insulation. Anything less than that and it\u2019s time for an upgrade. A professional installation typically costs \u00a3350, although you can do it yourself for less. Don\u2019t be tempted to tamp it down, as this impedes its effectiveness. For hard-to-get-to loft spaces, consider spray-in insulation, and if you are converting a loft, insulate it to the max, Higgins says. Underfloor insulation Cost: \u00a3700-\u00a31,000 Potential saving: \u00a370 a year Older homes, typically those built from the 1930s to the 1950s, are most likely to have suspended timber floors: if you have air bricks or ventilation bricks on your outside walls, you probably have these. Such floors can be insulated by lifting the boards and laying wool insulation supported by netting between the joists. Higgins says he is about to get this done in his home. It typically costs \u00a3700-\u00a31,000 and will save you \u00a340 to \u00a370 a year in the resulting lower heating bills. A cheaper alternative is just to fill any gaps between floorboards that let cold air in. In tests conducted by the Guardian, StopGap sealant was found to be the best overall product. It costs \u00a325 for 40 metres and will seal cracks 1mm to 8mm wide. You\u2019ll notice a significant difference in temperature. Draught exclusion Cost: \u00a3200 or DIY Potential saving: \u00a340 a year Trying to cut out all cold drafts around an older house can become an obsession. It\u2019s better to focus on the big wins. Unused open fireplaces need a blocking balloon or a \u00a320 Chimney Sheep. Catflaps, old extractor fans and letter boxes leak cold air and need to be sealed. A thermal lining on curtains will really make a difference; minimalists could consider thermal blinds instead. Cheap sticky-back foam door seals can work well. The Energy Saving Trust says a professional will charge \u00a3200 or so to draught-proof your home. If you have an internal door to the garage that keeps getting left open, how about an automatic closer? Generally, double glazing rarely makes financial sense as the installation costs dwarf the typical \u00a370 a year saving through lower energy bills. The house will feel much more comfortable, though. LED light bulbs Cost: \u00a32-\u00a380 Potential saving \u00a3200 a year No, this isn\u2019t going to improve your heating, but is an essential change all households should make. If you are still using old-style 100-watt bulbs \u2013 or even worse, energy-guzzling halogens \u2013 you could easily be throwing away over \u00a3200 a year on unnecessarily high electricity bills. The latest LED bulbs typically operate at 4-9 watts, a tiny fraction of the bulbs they replace. Once \u00a320 each, they have collapsed in price in the last few years, making this a no-brainer. Screwfix offers some of thecheapest LEDs and they now cost \u00a32 to \u00a33 each, depending on the fitting. Fit them across your home and you will slash your electricity use. Someone using 40 LED bulbs for an average of 2.7 hours a day \u2013 the Energy Saving Trust\u2019s typical use figure \u2013 will spend around \u00a323 annually \u2013 compared with \u00a3287 for halogens. Just take out the old bulbs and put in the new one; anyone can do it. This is one of the cheapest, easiest green measures you can introduce. Smart heating controller Cost: \u00a3200 Potential saving: \u00a370-\u00a3100 a year Another measure that really delivers lower energy usage \u2013 with a quick payback time. British Gas\u2019s Hive and Google\u2019s Nest are the big two. In effect they turn your smartphone into your heating controller. Working late or on an unplanned trip to the cinema? Your heating can be turned down or off, remotely. You can set it to come on when you are in the home. \u201cIt allows you to stop heating your home when you are not there \u2013 wasting energy and money,\u201d says Higgins, who has a Hive system. Hive starts at \u00a3125 for British Gas reward members, or \u00a3200 for its energy customers. You get a free Amazon Echo Dot, which can be used to change your thermostat. Most people will require an engineer visit to install these systems. If you fancy your DIY skills, the \u00a3159 Google Nest Thermostat E is a self-install project. Many people who have these smart systems love them and say they would never go back. New fridge-freezer Cost: \u00a3200 Potential saving: \u00a3100 a year If you are still running a 20 or 30-year-old fridge or freezer, be aware that it uses more electricity in 5 to 10 weeks than one of the latest A++ models will use all year. You might think you are doing the environmentally right thing by not buying a new one but, arguably, this is the one item worth changing whether you need a new one or not. A 30-year-old fridge-freezer consumes more than 23kWh per week compared with 4.3kWh per week if you use a new energy-efficient model. This means you could save \u00a3100 to \u00a3140 a year in reduced electricity usage \u2013 just by plugging in a new fridge. New A++ rated, family-sized fridges start at around \u00a3200. After two years you will have saved a load of carbon, and it will have paid for itself. New boiler Cost: \u00a32,500 Potential saving: \u00a390-\u00a3160 a year Unless your old boiler is unreliable or broken, there\u2019s a strong case not to replace it with a more efficient model.

      "body": "<p>The X Factor: Battle of the Stars, Simon Cowell\u2019s 2006 attempt at a celebrity singing competition, was less of a reality format, more a spine-chilling fever dream hosted by Kate Thornton. It featured tabloid perennials James Hewitt and Rebecca Loos doing a very entrapmenty rendition of Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside and scatological dietician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/12/advertising.food\">Gillian McKeith</a> singing I Just Want to Make Love to You.</p> <p>Shortly after it aired, Cowell admitted it had been a huge mistake. \u201cWe are never going to do it again,\u201d he told the Sun. \u201cThe show was pointless. The ratings were good, but what we\u2019re supposed to be looking for is a new artist. The only validity for doing these shows is that I\u2019m doing my day job on TV, which is finding artists for the label. So when I\u2019m judging celebs, I\u2019m not actually doing my job, I\u2019m just being on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Cowell made the right call. The original non-celeb X Factor did become more than a TV show, creating huge acts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/08/little-mixs-jesy-nelson-on-surviving-the-trolls-people-were-saying-horrific-things\">Little Mix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/one-direction\">One Direction</a> and serving as a light-entertainment bulwark against the coming tides of streaming and social media: grannies would phone up to vote for the pretty crooners (pouring their pension funds into ITV\u2019s coffers in the process) while millennials would ensure its zeitgeist status by posting ironic bon mots about Wagner\u2019s hairline. By 2010, the viewing figures for these shows were unprecedented. Established acts from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/whitney-houston\">Whitney Houston</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/24/rihanna-mobbed-by-french-fans-dennis-leupold-best-photograph\">Rihanna</a> began lining up to perform in between the hopefuls, making them both talent competitions and a kind of Top of the Pops on steroids.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJGHQ8QfzOQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bJGHQ8QfzOQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It wasn\u2019t just a British success story, either: for much of the 21st century, singing competitions have ruled the world. From Lebanon\u2019s Star Academy to Myanmar Idol, they have tended to be among the most popular shows in whichever country they are shown. Formats such as ... Got Talent, which made an unlikely star of Susan Boyle, managed similar ratings successes by slightly tweaking the same formula.</p> <p>But the past five years has seen a rapid decline in the TV talent show. Ratings in the UK have fallen off a cliff (X Factor is now regularly beaten in the ratings not just by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing\">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, but also Countryfile and Antiques Roadshow), and the shows are impotent in their ability to make stars. Things have gotten so bad that, 13 years after his first attempt, Cowell has put The X Factor on hiatus and launched a new star-packed version in its place. If anything, X Factor: Celebrity is even shoddier than Battle of the Stars. At least that had household names: this time we are treated to David Hasselhoff\u2019s daughter and the woman who played the non-speaking role of the little girl in the school concert in Love Actually. Cowell has had to admit defeat, give up being a pop svengali and return to \u201cjust being on TV\u201d. How did it come to this?</p> <p>Pop Idol, the progenitor to X Factor, arrived seven years after Britain\u2019s first Saturday night National Lottery draw, but both inventions promised to fundamentally change the life of one extremely ordinary person. We never got to follow the journey of lottery winners, but as talent shows developed, they managed to perfect the telling of a rags-to-riches story. To watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/16/alexandra-burke-and-the-trouble-with-reality-tv-and-race-strictly\">Alexandra Burke</a> go from singing unremarkably in a carpeted conference room to wearing a ridiculous frock and weeping into Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bosom, as she did when the pair duetted in the series five final, was to see Charlie win the golden ticket. As Burke said to Beyonc\u00e9 that night, through bubbles of tears and snot: \u201cYou made my dreams come true.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"640f11d53693ae0be93de122c19afe230d7fa5e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/640f11d53693ae0be93de122c19afe230d7fa5e9/305_295_1710_1025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Cowell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Cowell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Syco/Thames TV/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burke\u2019s triumph was the endpoint of a journey in which Brits saw television not only as something to watch, but to take part in and triumph over. \u201cIn the 70s and 80s you see the decline of authority figures and the rise of the everyman,\u201d says Dominic Sandbrook, historian and author of The Great British Dream Factory, an analysis of how pop culture has evolved in the UK. \u201cAt precisely the moment the political culture was challenging social-democratic paternalistic politics, there was a huge surge of TV quiz shows that made the audience the star. There\u2019s a definite link between that sort of telly and the talent shows that Simon Cowell does, which is all about celebrating a kind of ordinariness.\u201d</p> <p>However, in 2019, neither part of the rags-to-riches journey still exists on TV. Any performer with a modicum of talent is already a microcelebrity \u2013 potentially racking up millions of plays on YouTube or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/01/why-are-teenagers-on-tiktok-obsessed-with-an-eerie-1950s-song\">TikTok</a>, the music-based social media site, which is basically a never-ending edition of Britain\u2019s Got Talent. Normal people can self-start their career, rather than waiting for gatekeepers to give them the green light. \u201cTo be sort of humdrum is now disgraceful; instead of ordinariness we celebrate extraordinariness, it\u2019s much more about projecting an image of glamour,\u201d says Sandbrook. \u201cWhereas, in the 80s, the people who were on Bullseye, it would not have occurred to them not to be humdrum.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, these shows are no longer able to offer genuine stardom, mostly because the family-friendly pop acts that talent shows are searching for no longer dominate the music industry. 2017 X Factor winners Rak-Su could only manage a chart position of 39 for their first proper single after leaving the show, 2016\u2019s Matt Terry only reached 51. The Voice UK has never launched a successful pop act and the BBC\u2019s most recent attempt at a singing competition, the since-cancelled All Together Now hosted by Rob Beckett and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/geri-halliwell\">Geri Halliwell</a>, could only have been enjoyed by the demons from The Bad Place.</p> <p>Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, who loved those One Direction-era X Factor series, describes the format in its pomp as the \u201cmost uniting TV experience of our lives ... It got friends and family together like a weekly national holiday\u201d. He was such a fan that he became a judge on the 12th series, but feels that the talent show will struggle to whip up that level of excitement again.</p> <p>\u201cI think the main issue is that people can discover their own pop star whenever they want on social media,\u201d Grimshaw says. \u201cFinding someone in their own environment is much more charming. You\u2019re up close and personal with them, it\u2019s their song choice, their aesthetic and their voice. That vital teen demographic who worshipped X Factor a decade ago have changed so much. They\u2019re tech-savvy now and don\u2019t want to be told what is or isn\u2019t for them.\u201d</p> <p>Grimshaw says there is an ever-widening gap between the singers being produced on TV and those he plays on his radio show. \u201cTake two of the break out stars of last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-the-pop-icon-who-defines-21st-century-teenage-angst\">Billie Eilish</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/10/lewis-capaldi-theyre-screaming-americas-sweetheart-at-me-its-wild\">Lewis Capaldi</a>. They\u2019re talented songwriters, but they offer their fans more. Billie does her own artwork, directs her own videos and both engage in social [media] on such a human level you actually think you\u2019re friends with them. That\u2019s something seemingly impossible to capture on a primetime talent show. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09f4ff63beb58cebfef2f91b1a2bc6781050d636\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f4ff63beb58cebfef2f91b1a2bc6781050d636/0_95_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Voice with Ricky Wilson, Paloma Faith, Boy George and Will.i.am\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Voice with Ricky Wilson, Paloma Faith, Boy George and Will.i.am.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not only can these shows no longer make contestants stars, but increasingly they are being seen as ruining their lives. The X Factor has been widely criticised for placing vulnerable people in the spotlight during its audition process. Little Mix\u2019s Jesy Nelson, one of the show\u2019s great success stories, says that she would rather have never have auditioned after the horrifying levels of trolling she received (although that hasn\u2019t stopped Nelson, along with her bandmates, launching a new BBC talent show to find a boy or girl band).</p> <p>In response to these concerns, there has been a flurry of \u201ccredible\u201d talent shows, seeking to find authentic talent in an inherently inauthentic way: a reality show audition process. They try to square that circle by relying on the credibility of an established star to anchor them. As well as Little Mix\u2019s show, there is Rhythm + Flow, Netflix\u2019s first major talent competition, which stars Cardi B and Chance the Rapper as judges; Timbaland\u2019s show for budding teens called The Pop Game on Lifetime; Eurythmics\u2019 Dave Stewart\u2019s US format Songland, where budding songwriters compete each week to have a musical guest record their song (a version is coming to Channel 4 later this year); and ITV\u2019s upcoming The Masked Singer, an enormous hit already in the US, which takes the emphasis away from who gives the best performance, and instead focuses audience attention on guessing which celebrities are performing from inside elaborate costumes.</p> <p>Rappers Krept and Konan, along with 1Xtra\u2019s DJ Target, have moved away from the glitz of Saturday nights with BBC Three show The Rap Game UK, which makes a pitch for credible MCs. Ricky Cooper, who commissioned the series, says its success will not be defined by record sales or viewing figures, but whether it is respected by the UK rap community. To do this it has tried to avoid the gloss and truth-massaging normally present in talent shows. \u201cWe had one objective: to make a series that the diehard fans of British rap music would get behind. If they felt the show wasn\u2019t credible, or felt filtered, they\u2019d never buy into it.\u201d</p> <p>But as much as these new efforts promise in their promotional blurbs to reinvent the talent show, they often return to the televisual language created by Simon Fuller on Pop Idol almost 20 years ago. They have not managed to launch a successful music act yet, either. We are witnessing the death of a narrative that has had a stranglehold on Britain for almost two decades: that Simon Cowell can change your life. We are still waiting for a talent show that embraces the more complex world we live in. Watching Martin Bashir belt out Nat King Cole\u2019s LOVE in front of a bemused Louis Walsh doesn\u2019t capture the cultural zeitgeist of 2019, but it <em>is</em> a clear sign that Cowell should find a new job.</p> <p><em>The X Factor: Celebrity airs Saturdays, 8.30pm, ITV</em></p>",

Shortly after it aired, Cowell admitted it had been a huge mistake. \u201cWe are never going to do it again,\u201d he told the Sun. \u201cThe show was pointless. The ratings were good, but what we\u2019re supposed to be looking for is a new artist. The only validity for doing these shows is that I\u2019m doing my day job on TV, which is finding artists for the label. So when I\u2019m judging celebs, I\u2019m not actually doing my job, I\u2019m just being on TV.\u201d Cowell made the right call. The original non-celeb X Factor did become more than a TV show, creating huge acts such as Little Mix and One Direction and serving as a light-entertainment bulwark against the coming tides of streaming and social media: grannies would phone up to vote for the pretty crooners (pouring their pension funds into ITV\u2019s coffers in the process) while millennials would ensure its zeitgeist status by posting ironic bon mots about Wagner\u2019s hairline. By 2010, the viewing figures for these shows were unprecedented. Established acts from Whitney Houston to Rihanna began lining up to perform in between the hopefuls, making them both talent competitions and a kind of Top of the Pops on steroids. It wasn\u2019t just a British success story, either: for much of the 21st century, singing competitions have ruled the world. From Lebanon\u2019s Star Academy to Myanmar Idol, they have tended to be among the most popular shows in whichever country they are shown. Formats such as ... Got Talent, which made an unlikely star of Susan Boyle, managed similar ratings successes by slightly tweaking the same formula. But the past five years has seen a rapid decline in the TV talent show. Ratings in the UK have fallen off a cliff (X Factor is now regularly beaten in the ratings not just by Strictly Come Dancing, but also Countryfile and Antiques Roadshow), and the shows are impotent in their ability to make stars. Things have gotten so bad that, 13 years after his first attempt, Cowell has put The X Factor on hiatus and launched a new star-packed version in its place. If anything, X Factor: Celebrity is even shoddier than Battle of the Stars. At least that had household names: this time we are treated to David Hasselhoff\u2019s daughter and the woman who played the non-speaking role of the little girl in the school concert in Love Actually. Cowell has had to admit defeat, give up being a pop svengali and return to \u201cjust being on TV\u201d. How did it come to this? Pop Idol, the progenitor to X Factor, arrived seven years after Britain\u2019s first Saturday night National Lottery draw, but both inventions promised to fundamentally change the life of one extremely ordinary person. We never got to follow the journey of lottery winners, but as talent shows developed, they managed to perfect the telling of a rags-to-riches story. To watch Alexandra Burke go from singing unremarkably in a carpeted conference room to wearing a ridiculous frock and weeping into Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bosom, as she did when the pair duetted in the series five final, was to see Charlie win the golden ticket. As Burke said to Beyonc\u00e9 that night, through bubbles of tears and snot: \u201cYou made my dreams come true.\u201d Burke\u2019s triumph was the endpoint of a journey in which Brits saw television not only as something to watch, but to take part in and triumph over. \u201cIn the 70s and 80s you see the decline of authority figures and the rise of the everyman,\u201d says Dominic Sandbrook, historian and author of The Great British Dream Factory, an analysis of how pop culture has evolved in the UK. \u201cAt precisely the moment the political culture was challenging social-democratic paternalistic politics, there was a huge surge of TV quiz shows that made the audience the star. There\u2019s a definite link between that sort of telly and the talent shows that Simon Cowell does, which is all about celebrating a kind of ordinariness.\u201d However, in 2019, neither part of the rags-to-riches journey still exists on TV. Any performer with a modicum of talent is already a microcelebrity \u2013 potentially racking up millions of plays on YouTube or TikTok, the music-based social media site, which is basically a never-ending edition of Britain\u2019s Got Talent. Normal people can self-start their career, rather than waiting for gatekeepers to give them the green light. \u201cTo be sort of humdrum is now disgraceful; instead of ordinariness we celebrate extraordinariness, it\u2019s much more about projecting an image of glamour,\u201d says Sandbrook. \u201cWhereas, in the 80s, the people who were on Bullseye, it would not have occurred to them not to be humdrum.\u201d At the same time, these shows are no longer able to offer genuine stardom, mostly because the family-friendly pop acts that talent shows are searching for no longer dominate the music industry. 2017 X Factor winners Rak-Su could only manage a chart position of 39 for their first proper single after leaving the show, 2016\u2019s Matt Terry only reached 51. The Voice UK has never launched a successful pop act and the BBC\u2019s most recent attempt at a singing competition, the since-cancelled All Together Now hosted by Rob Beckett and Geri Halliwell, could only have been enjoyed by the demons from The Bad Place. Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, who loved those One Direction-era X Factor series, describes the format in its pomp as the \u201cmost uniting TV experience of our lives ... It got friends and family together like a weekly national holiday\u201d. He was such a fan that he became a judge on the 12th series, but feels that the talent show will struggle to whip up that level of excitement again. \u201cI think the main issue is that people can discover their own pop star whenever they want on social media,\u201d Grimshaw says. \u201cFinding someone in their own environment is much more charming. You\u2019re up close and personal with them, it\u2019s their song choice, their aesthetic and their voice. That vital teen demographic who worshipped X Factor a decade ago have changed so much. They\u2019re tech-savvy now and don\u2019t want to be told what is or isn\u2019t for them.\u201d Grimshaw says there is an ever-widening gap between the singers being produced on TV and those he plays on his radio show. \u201cTake two of the break out stars of last year, Billie Eilish or Lewis Capaldi. They\u2019re talented songwriters, but they offer their fans more. Billie does her own artwork, directs her own videos and both engage in social [media] on such a human level you actually think you\u2019re friends with them. That\u2019s something seemingly impossible to capture on a primetime talent show. \u201d Not only can these shows no longer make contestants stars, but increasingly they are being seen as ruining their lives. The X Factor has been widely criticised for placing vulnerable people in the spotlight during its audition process. Little Mix\u2019s Jesy Nelson, one of the show\u2019s great success stories, says that she would rather have never have auditioned after the horrifying levels of trolling she received (although that hasn\u2019t stopped Nelson, along with her bandmates, launching a new BBC talent show to find a boy or girl band). In response to these concerns, there has been a flurry of \u201ccredible\u201d talent shows, seeking to find authentic talent in an inherently inauthentic way: a reality show audition process. They try to square that circle by relying on the credibility of an established star to anchor them. As well as Little Mix\u2019s show, there is Rhythm + Flow, Netflix\u2019s first major talent competition, which stars Cardi B and Chance the Rapper as judges; Timbaland\u2019s show for budding teens called The Pop Game on Lifetime; Eurythmics\u2019 Dave Stewart\u2019s US format Songland, where budding songwriters compete each week to have a musical guest record their song (a version is coming to Channel 4 later this year); and ITV\u2019s upcoming The Masked Singer, an enormous hit already in the US, which takes the emphasis away from who gives the best performance, and instead focuses audience attention on guessing which celebrities are performing from inside elaborate costumes. Rappers Krept and Konan, along with 1Xtra\u2019s DJ Target, have moved away from the glitz of Saturday nights with BBC Three show The Rap Game UK, which makes a pitch for credible MCs. Ricky Cooper, who commissioned the series, says its success will not be defined by record sales or viewing figures, but whether it is respected by the UK rap community. To do this it has tried to avoid the gloss and truth-massaging normally present in talent shows. \u201cWe had one objective: to make a series that the diehard fans of British rap music would get behind. If they felt the show wasn\u2019t credible, or felt filtered, they\u2019d never buy into it.\u201d But as much as these new efforts promise in their promotional blurbs to reinvent the talent show, they often return to the televisual language created by Simon Fuller on Pop Idol almost 20 years ago. They have not managed to launch a successful music act yet, either. We are witnessing the death of a narrative that has had a stranglehold on Britain for almost two decades: that Simon Cowell can change your life. We are still waiting for a talent show that embraces the more complex world we live in. Watching Martin Bashir belt out Nat King Cole\u2019s LOVE in front of a bemused Louis Walsh doesn\u2019t capture the cultural zeitgeist of 2019, but it is a clear sign that Cowell should find a new job.

      "body": "<p>When researching my novels I often do what my characters do. While writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/30/features.shopping\" title=\"\">Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>, I took a painting class. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/29/remarkable-creatures-tracy-chevalier\" title=\"\">Remarkable Creatures</a><em>,</em> I hunted for fossils on the beach at Lyme Regis, just as Mary Anning did.

I also literally followed in Violet\u2019s footsteps as she walked cross-country between <a href=\"https://www.winchester-cathedral.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Winchester</a> and <a href=\"https://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9L_tBRBXEiwAOWVVCds1QU1F3Fs6hvfbJal6TrpS2YE1cTx2yoX65arIFs11vXhRs_2vwRoCXrgQAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">Salisbury</a> cathedrals in her summer holidays. Who could resist walking between two of the UK\u2019s finest cathedrals? It would be a modern-day pilgrimage across some of southern England\u2019s finest green and pleasant land, and there is even a well-marked path to follow called the Clarendon Way.</p> <p>In an ideal world I would do such a walk just as I am writing the scenes. In May 2018 my husband Jon and I set aside a weekend, but cancelled when I caught a cold. A few weekends later I thought I would try again, though Jon wasn\u2019t free. But I hesitated. For something happens during Violet\u2019s walk: a man begins following her in a cornfield and she runs. Almost 90 years later, much has changed for the better for women. We have more access to higher education. All kinds of career paths are open to us. And unlike in Violet\u2019s world, it is no longer assumed that we will marry and have children. But we still don\u2019t feel safe walking alone.</p> <p>I wrote the scenes anyway, finished the book and in October, while I was editing it, Jon and I at last found a free weekend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"391b014204ceb2ca111893874ec10c0b94990988\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/391b014204ceb2ca111893874ec10c0b94990988/0_345_3377_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The author at Winchester Cathedral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author at Winchester Cathedral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>October weather can be very different from May sunshine. We started in cold mist in Winchester, the cathedral rising romantically from the gloom. I wished I could stay inside it, admiring the longest nave in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.winchester-cathedral.org.uk/200th-anniversary-jane-austens-death/\" title=\"\">Jane Austen\u2019s grave</a>, and remarkable stone and wood carvings. But pilgrims don\u2019t linger. As we walked up the High Street and through the medieval West Gate, it began to spit with rain, which carried on as we crossed the railway line and passed the prison and hospital, just as Violet does on a hot August morning.</p> <p>It rained harder as we walked through the suburbs \u2013 houses Violet would not have seen. I know because I was carrying a 1930s Ordnance Survey map to consult alongside our modern one. I looked for an orchard that is marked on the old map, hoping to spy a gnarled old apple tree, but there were only 1960s bungalows.</p> <p>As we finally left the city and joined the Clarendon Way, it really began to pour. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is beautiful in the sunshine,\u201d I kept saying as the rain tested my raincoat\u2019s mettle. By then we\u2019d also donned the ultimate humiliation \u2013 waterproof trousers, which swished as we walked and made me feel about four years old.</p> <p>We\u2019d planned a break at <a href=\"https://www.hants.gov.uk/thingstodo/countryside/finder/farleymount\" title=\"\">Farley Mount</a>, an 18th-century folly erected by a local man in honour of his racehorse, which he had saddled with the bizarre name Beware Chalk Pit. Violet has the same idea. Oddly, in this instance, life mirrored art. In my scene, Violet is planning to eat her breakfast rolls at the monument while admiring the view. But a visiting family is there already: the wife gives her the side-eye for being a woman on her own, and Violet feels forced to move on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"485d729745ff435a76748ba2736e5fca5f3e8e90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485d729745ff435a76748ba2736e5fca5f3e8e90/0_24_1224_1530/800.jpg\" alt=\"The author at Farley Mount pyramid.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author at Farley Mount pyramid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were planning to sit inside the white pyramid to rest and dry off. But two dog walkers had the same idea and their frisky hounds enjoyed barking inside the echoey chamber so much we had to flee the noise.</p> <p>In rain or shine, the Clarendon Way is a heavenly walk, along straight Roman roads and up and down hills, offering views of green and brown fields broken up by hedgerows and clumps of woods.</p> <p>Finding the cornfield where Violet meets the lone man, I was now struck by how very different life and art can be. Where there had been corn there were just benign turnips. \u201cBut this is where the fear began!\u201d I thought. Maybe we would have better luck at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/JohnOGauntInn/posts/\" title=\"\">John O\u2019Gaunt Inn</a> in tiny Horsebridge, which Violet flees to. But here again, life did not imitate art: I popped in to look around, and the whole geography of the interior was completely unlike what I\u2019d imagined: the bar was in a different place, and it was bright and airy rather than dingy and smelling of chip fat. Plus the staff were friendly, whereas I made the 1930s publican nosy and sinister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9174a96a9771e8a7093280f94fa385bc41e5d60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9174a96a9771e8a7093280f94fa385bc41e5d60/0_63_3430_3428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy Chevalier outside the John O Gaunt Inn in Horsebridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The John O\u2019Gaunt Inn in Horsebridge offered a friendly welcome</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we trudged past the many tributaries of the chalky River Test, where modern dry fly fishing was born, anglers unbothered by the rain plied their lines. Then came Broughton, where later that night we had an excellent, unexpectedly creative meal at <a href=\"https://www.thetallyhobroughton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Tally Ho!</a> inn. From there we momentarily diverged from the Clarendon Way and strode across country to our B&amp;B in Nether Wallop where, after 15 miles in the rain, I hung my sopping clothes over the radiators and did what Violet does: \u201cShe kicked off her boots and was asleep in a minute.\u201d</p> <p>In the morning, sunshine transformed everything. Nether Wallop may have a joke name, but it is a lovely village, with thick thatch hanging over windows like eyebrows and actual roses around the doors. Used for filming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/09/tv-detectives-miss-marple\" title=\"\">Miss Marple</a> BBC TV series, it is also where Violet\u2019s love interest Arthur lives and rings bells.

Add 0.2 miles and you get \u2026 a marathon. Which is what we found running towards us along the narrow path \u2013 1,000 participants in the annual <a href=\"https://www.clarendon-marathon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Clarendon Way marathon</a>. Rather than swim against this wall of humanity, we cheated and went around, cutting seven miles off the distance. We finished the route in mellow autumn sunshine with the leaves just beginning to turn, walking through sleepy villages and past harvested fields.</p> <p>Just outside Salisbury we passed through Clarendon Park, an old hunting ground, and the ruins of <a href=\"https://salisburycityguides.co.uk/clarendon-palace/\" title=\"\">Clarendon Palace</a>, built by Henry II in the 12th century. Now it is all crumbling flint walls, surreally populated with grazing llamas.</p> <p>Poor Salisbury has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/russian-television-channel-rt-says-it-is-to-air-interview-with-skripal-salisbury-attack-suspects\" title=\"\">in the news</a> for all the wrong reasons, but it appeared to have bullishly recovered from Russian interference. Its cathedral is a corker, with its 123-metre spire dominating the skyline. It has beautiful stained glass, especially the gorgeous modern \u201cPrisoners of Conscience\u201d window in the eastern end. <a href=\"http://thechapterhouseuk.com/salisbury-cathedral-3/\" title=\"\">The Chapter House</a> famously houses a copy of the Magna Carta.

      "bodyText": "When researching my novels I often do what my characters do. While writing Girl with a Pearl Earring, I took a painting class. For Remarkable Creatures, I hunted for fossils on the beach at Lyme Regis, just as Mary Anning did. For my latest novel, A Single Thread, I learned needlepoint the way my heroine Violet Speedwell does \u2013 to make cushions and kneelers for Winchester cathedral in the 1930s. That wasn\u2019t the only on-the-job training I did. I also literally followed in Violet\u2019s footsteps as she walked cross-country between Winchester and Salisbury cathedrals in her summer holidays. Who could resist walking between two of the UK\u2019s finest cathedrals? It would be a modern-day pilgrimage across some of southern England\u2019s finest green and pleasant land, and there is even a well-marked path to follow called the Clarendon Way. In an ideal world I would do such a walk just as I am writing the scenes. In May 2018 my husband Jon and I set aside a weekend, but cancelled when I caught a cold. A few weekends later I thought I would try again, though Jon wasn\u2019t free. But I hesitated. For something happens during Violet\u2019s walk: a man begins following her in a cornfield and she runs. Almost 90 years later, much has changed for the better for women. We have more access to higher education. All kinds of career paths are open to us. And unlike in Violet\u2019s world, it is no longer assumed that we will marry and have children. But we still don\u2019t feel safe walking alone. I wrote the scenes anyway, finished the book and in October, while I was editing it, Jon and I at last found a free weekend. October weather can be very different from May sunshine. We started in cold mist in Winchester, the cathedral rising romantically from the gloom. I wished I could stay inside it, admiring the longest nave in Europe, Jane Austen\u2019s grave, and remarkable stone and wood carvings. But pilgrims don\u2019t linger. As we walked up the High Street and through the medieval West Gate, it began to spit with rain, which carried on as we crossed the railway line and passed the prison and hospital, just as Violet does on a hot August morning. It rained harder as we walked through the suburbs \u2013 houses Violet would not have seen. I know because I was carrying a 1930s Ordnance Survey map to consult alongside our modern one. I looked for an orchard that is marked on the old map, hoping to spy a gnarled old apple tree, but there were only 1960s bungalows. As we finally left the city and joined the Clarendon Way, it really began to pour. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is beautiful in the sunshine,\u201d I kept saying as the rain tested my raincoat\u2019s mettle. By then we\u2019d also donned the ultimate humiliation \u2013 waterproof trousers, which swished as we walked and made me feel about four years old. We\u2019d planned a break at Farley Mount, an 18th-century folly erected by a local man in honour of his racehorse, which he had saddled with the bizarre name Beware Chalk Pit. Violet has the same idea. Oddly, in this instance, life mirrored art. In my scene, Violet is planning to eat her breakfast rolls at the monument while admiring the view. But a visiting family is there already: the wife gives her the side-eye for being a woman on her own, and Violet feels forced to move on. We were planning to sit inside the white pyramid to rest and dry off. But two dog walkers had the same idea and their frisky hounds enjoyed barking inside the echoey chamber so much we had to flee the noise. In rain or shine, the Clarendon Way is a heavenly walk, along straight Roman roads and up and down hills, offering views of green and brown fields broken up by hedgerows and clumps of woods. Finding the cornfield where Violet meets the lone man, I was now struck by how very different life and art can be. Where there had been corn there were just benign turnips. \u201cBut this is where the fear began!\u201d I thought. Maybe we would have better luck at the John O\u2019Gaunt Inn in tiny Horsebridge, which Violet flees to. But here again, life did not imitate art: I popped in to look around, and the whole geography of the interior was completely unlike what I\u2019d imagined: the bar was in a different place, and it was bright and airy rather than dingy and smelling of chip fat. Plus the staff were friendly, whereas I made the 1930s publican nosy and sinister. As we trudged past the many tributaries of the chalky River Test, where modern dry fly fishing was born, anglers unbothered by the rain plied their lines. Then came Broughton, where later that night we had an excellent, unexpectedly creative meal at The Tally Ho! inn. From there we momentarily diverged from the Clarendon Way and strode across country to our B&amp;B in Nether Wallop where, after 15 miles in the rain, I hung my sopping clothes over the radiators and did what Violet does: \u201cShe kicked off her boots and was asleep in a minute.\u201d In the morning, sunshine transformed everything. Nether Wallop may have a joke name, but it is a lovely village, with thick thatch hanging over windows like eyebrows and actual roses around the doors. Used for filming the Miss Marple BBC TV series, it is also where Violet\u2019s love interest Arthur lives and rings bells. Here we met friends who were joining us for the second 13 miles of the route . Twenty-six miles has a certain ring to it. Add 0.2 miles and you get \u2026 a marathon. Which is what we found running towards us along the narrow path \u2013 1,000 participants in the annual Clarendon Way marathon. Rather than swim against this wall of humanity, we cheated and went around, cutting seven miles off the distance. We finished the route in mellow autumn sunshine with the leaves just beginning to turn, walking through sleepy villages and past harvested fields. Just outside Salisbury we passed through Clarendon Park, an old hunting ground, and the ruins of Clarendon Palace, built by Henry II in the 12th century. Now it is all crumbling flint walls, surreally populated with grazing llamas. Poor Salisbury has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, but it appeared to have bullishly recovered from Russian interference. Its cathedral is a corker, with its 123-metre spire dominating the skyline. It has beautiful stained glass, especially the gorgeous modern \u201cPrisoners of Conscience\u201d window in the eastern end. The Chapter House famously houses a copy of the Magna Carta. I touched the walls of the cathedral, bringing greetings from that other great cathedral I had just walked from, my pilgrimage complete. Despite the rain, I was glad I\u2019d done it, and would do it again \u2013 the whole thing next time.

      "bodyText": "Things in life that could be improved by being speeded up: work meetings, telephone banking, golf, the sandwich queue at my local deli. Films? Well, it\u2019s tempting. The new Martin Scorsese movie is three and a half hours long, and some of us like to be in bed before midnight. This week we learned that Netflix has been testing a new feature that allows users to speed up their viewing without sacrificing the dialogue (making it different from the fast-forward button), prompting outpourings of fury from filmmakers on social media. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with our timing,\u201d frothed Judd Apatow, the director of Trainwreck and Knocked Up. \u201cWe give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen.\u201d \u201cAnother spectacularly bad idea, and another cut to the already bleeding-out cinema experience,\u201d raged Brad Bird, he of The Incredibles and Ratatouille. You can see why they might feel aggrieved. It\u2019s bad enough that Netflix has provided a \u201cskip intro\u201d function, because, really, who gives a toss about who did all the work? Now the expertise and graft they put into creating a visually stunning, expertly paced masterpiece can be bypassed by some idiot pressing a button and turning it into a high-definition Benny Hill Show. While you could argue that there\u2019s no compulsion to use the function, actors and directors would say that that\u2019s not the point. Novelists don\u2019t write imagining that readers will skim their latest opus; musicians don\u2019t write songs expecting them to be played back at double speed. While filmmakers don\u2019t get to decide when we press pause before we go to make a cup of tea, they should surely be able to count on the fact that their work will be viewed at the pace that was intended. Defenders of this function have cited podcasts as a medium whose programmes can be sped up for time-poor listeners without adversely affecting the experience. While there\u2019s something to be said for being able to up the pace in order to finish a show before the end of your commute or morning run, it hardly enhances the work. Studies have shown that time-compressed speech leads to a drop in comprehension for the listener, although I\u2019m more concerned about what it does to the voices.

You are living with me, still enjoying Postman Pat and Disney. I wonder how you make sense of all the changes? I know your quiet acceptance masks a much deeper understanding of human nature than any of us could hope to achieve. Your dad and I enjoy a good relationship now and he continues to be a big part of your life. Your siblings are always popping in for an audience, and an essential hug from you. You say little, but your presence is immense. You are their counsellor and their mentor. For them, you reinforce the essential simplicities of life, things we often lose in the chaos and mundanity of everyday existence. The positive contribution you have brought to our lives is immeasurable, and that extra chromosome I so despised in the early days of your life is now revered, with gratitude, as an integral feature of the wonderful person to whom it belongs: you. You are the glue that binds our unique, amazing family together. I feel privileged to be your mum. \u25cf We will pay \u00a325 for every letter we publish. Email family@theguardian.com, including your address and phone number. We are able to reply only to those whose contributions we are going to use.",

A report commissioned by the Local Government Association (LGA) and County Councils Network has revealed that councils are spending more on home-to-school transport than they spend on children\u2019s centres, family support or youth services. In some areas where the costs of transport are disproportionately high, often because of long distances in rural settings, the LGA says the school transport budget is almost as large as the entire children\u2019s social care budget. According to the LGA, 550,000 young people currently receive free home-to-school transport each year, of which 145,000 are pupils with Send whose transport accounts for 69% of total expenditure. New analysis shows that annual costs have increased by \u00a366m in the last four years and could rise by a further \u00a3127m to reach \u00a31.2bn by 2024. One of the key drivers for the increase in costs is that children with Send are increasingly being sent further afield to specialist schools because of a shortage of suitable places closer to home. Campaigners have warned that cash-strapped councils are already making \u201cill-considered\u201d cuts to home-to-school transport, prompting safeguarding concerns.

There has been a 27% increase in pupils being placed in special schools since 2014 as mainstream schools \u2013 faced with funding and accountability pressures, plus curriculum changes \u2013 feel less able to offer places to children with Send. Judith Blake, chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board, said: \u201cFree school transport is a lifeline for many pupils and their families but it must be adequately funded if councils are to meet their legal duties to all children and young people. \u201cWhile a special school may be the right setting for a particular child, it is also vital that mainstream schools are incentivised and rewarded for offering a high quality and suitable education for children with special needs.\u201d Doherty said: \u201cWe agree that ideally children with Send should be able to attend schools within their community.

      "body": "<p>What is the secret to seducing a man? According to my 89-year-old Polish Catholic grandmother, offer him pickled cucumbers and ham. She told me this in hushed tones in my London kitchen three years ago, when I had just broken up with my boyfriend. Handing me a white ceramic plate divided into two sections, she explained that one part was for the ham and the other for the cucumbers. The fact that I\u2019m a vegetarian, she added, shouldn\u2019t stop me serving ham to a man. I\u2019m certain she believes that the magic plate secured for me the relationship I now have.</p> <p>My life is woven through with advice like this from Babcia (the Polish word for grandmother). Ever since I can remember, she has been squeezing my hand and whispering wisdom into my ear, winking as she reveals answers to the kinds of questions we all ask. Food I should eat in order to live a long time? Herring, beetroot and pierogi dumplings fried with butter, cream and lard on top. How to be happy? Always look for the best in everyone, have a pot of soup ready for unexpected guests and make sure you pray regularly. Recently, though, to my surprise and delight, I have found a little of my own \u201cwisdom\u201d seeping back in the other direction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each year since I was born, Babcia has left her tiny, flat in south-east Poland to stay with us in London for six weeks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Each year since I was born, Babcia has left her tiny, fourth-floor flat in provincial south-east Poland to stay with us in London for six weeks. Her daughter \u2013 my mother \u2013 moved to London more than 30 years ago after meeting my British-Jewish father on a visit to England to improve her language skills. Although Babcia and I have always lived in different countries, she has long been a stable presence in my life.</p> <p>When I was a toddler, she left my grandfather (who didn\u2019t even know how to boil an egg) in Poland and came to stay for two months to look after me, so that my mother could study for her law finals. She pushed my buggy up Muswell Hill, one of the steepest parts of the city, to playgroup, taught me Polish folk songs and wrapped me up so warmly that I was fit for a Siberian winter. Now that I\u2019m 30, she still tries to make me wear seven jumpers on a spring day but, more importantly, we also spend our time talking.</p> <p>Almost daily she will mention her plans for my impending Catholic wedding, which she insists will take place in her favourite church in the middle of the Polish countryside; never mind that I\u2019m not actually engaged and have never mentioned that I want a wedding. I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for two years, but since I was a teenager, I\u2019ve felt unsure that marriage was something I would ever want. In Babcia\u2019s eyes, however, the fact that he came with me to see her in Poland last summer means I may as well have a diamond ring on my finger and be spending my spare time browsing Vera Wang for veils.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9199033f116c0953aca53d1213b58d30db6b10db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9199033f116c0953aca53d1213b58d30db6b10db/34_447_2777_3471/800.jpg\" alt=\"Delgado and her grandmother in winter 2004.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delgado and her grandmother in winter 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Kasia Delgado</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Babcia has reassured me that she has her favourite priest lined up for the big day, and says it\u2019s best to marry when you have known your partner only a short time so you find out all the bad things about them afterwards, when it\u2019s too late.</p> <p>Her focus on my mythical wedding is rooted in her own experience of womanhood. She understands that women can have successful careers, and will certainly champion their right to that \u2013 but she can\u2019t shake off the feeling that men need to be fed and pampered by their wives. Babcia spent her life cooking and sewing for her children and late husband, and was always ready with a vat of soup and dish of roasted meat for when my professor grandfather turned up after work with a few colleagues in tow. For Babcia, that was the order of things.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we take Babcia out for coffee, she protests, because we have coffee at home. But she secretly loves these trips</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When she stays with us, though, the order of things is rather different. My high-flying mother gets back home after a long working day to be told by Babcia how wonderful my (retired) father is for emptying the dishwasher. When he irons a shirt, it\u2019s as if the second coming has happened. </p> <p>If we take Babcia out for morning coffee, she protests and declares it a sin because, after all, we have coffee at home. But she secretly loves these trips; it\u2019s a luxury she was never able to enjoy in Poland. She will joyfully sip cappuccino and tell the waiter in Polish that it\u2019s the best cafe she has ever been to. Whether he speaks the language is irrelevant, because she believes that everyone understands what she says.</p> <p>Babcia also urges me to tell everyone that my (male) flatmate is my neighbour, because \u201cpeople will talk\u201d. If anyone else told me, as she does regularly, that I should have been married years ago, and that I ought to have a baby asap, I would feel murderous. But Babcia gets away with it. She radiates such immense tenderness, even when she warns me my lack of baking skills will drive my boyfriend into the arms of another woman.</p> <p>This year she surprised me. For the first time she began to ask me about a wide range of subjects, from how I iron (I don\u2019t) to homosexuality, because until she met my friends, she had never known a gay person. She wondered whether my lesbian friend \u201cmisses going to the cinema with a nice boy\u201d and wanted to know why some people are gay and others aren\u2019t. Babcia\u2019s confusion came from lack of exposure to people of different sexual orientation and, over the course of her visit, I could see things become clearer to her.</p> <p>When a Polish national newspaper started handing out \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49037275\" title=\"\">LGBT-free zone</a>\u201d stickers (since banned by the courts), Babcia told me that gay people, on the whole, seem nicer than straight ones. Even if it was a tricky generalisation, that was good enough for me. She was so taken with my flatmate (who is gay) because of his kindness and impressive baking skills that when I ring her now she asks after him before wanting my news.</p> <p>One evening on that last visit, I showed Babcia an episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/rupaul\" title=\"\">Ru</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/rupaul\" title=\"\">Paul\u2019s Drag Race</a>. When I suggested it was time to go to bed at 11.30pm, she wanted to keep watching. \u201cThose amazing legs!\u201d she said, wide-eyed. Since she doesn\u2019t speak English, I translated the words of one drag queen\u2019s grandmother, who explained that, while she was deeply religious, she was extremely proud and accepting of her grandson. That clinched it for Babcia. At that moment, I felt immense pride in her, because it must have been a long journey from a life dominated by communism and Catholicism \u2013 both huge sources of homophobia in Soviet-dominated Poland \u2013 to cheering a drag queen called the Vixen twerking in sequined hot pants to Cher.</p> <p>Babcia\u2019s six-week visits expose her to a new kind of life and remind me not to make assumptions about an 89-year-old person\u2019s view of the world. Meanwhile, at home in Poland, she is still talking delightedly about RuPaul and his legs, in between ringing the priest to make plans for the Catholic wedding I didn\u2019t know I was having.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

The Bristol food scene, cooking, dentistry, his lawyering, how we are both sarcastic and the awkward situations it gets us into. There were a fair few pictures of his very cute niece, and many pictures of my brother\u2019s wedding. Any awkward moments? Maybe when he said he hadn\u2019t been to the dentist in three years. Good table manners? Pretty good, although a bit weak, because he didn\u2019t finish his pie. Best thing about Charlie? Similar levels of sarcasm, and our mutual love for Bristol street food chain Chilli Daddy. Would you introduce him to your friends? I would, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d have too much to talk about. Describe Charlie in three words? Sweet, sarcastic, quiet. What do you think he made of you? He probably thought I was a bit much. I talked a lot (word-vomited), but mainly because he wasn\u2019t really returning my questions. Did you go on somewhere? No, the night had reached a natural conclusion. And... did you kiss? A kiss was not on the cards. I\u2019m not sure there was attraction on either side.

He was really sweet, but it\u2019s going to have to be a no from me. Sorry, Charlie. Charlie on Allegra What were you hoping for? Specifically, not a 20-year-old student. First impressions? Great dungarees. What did you talk about? Dentistry, Bristol v London, the perennial dogs conversation, more dentistry, her food Instagram, her Instagram detailing the horrid things boys send on Tinder, and a bit more dentistry. Any awkward moments? I felt quite self-conscious about my metallic filling. Good table manners? Excellent. And she was quite sympathetic to me struggling to navigate the sourdough starter. Best thing about Allegra? She employed sarcasm well, and I was inspired to bring forward my next dental appointment. Would you introduce her to your friends? Of course. They might want to see their dental hygienist first, though. Describe Allegra in three words? Floss. Every. Morning. What do you think she made of you? Somewhat charming, somewhat aloof. Did you go on somewhere? Alas, no. And\u2026 did you kiss? I don\u2019t think we had that kind of connection. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? That we had got through more of the bar tab. Marks out of 10? 6. Would you meet again?

They were associated above all with one, immensely divisive policy \u2013 instead of Brexit, the war in Iraq \u2013 and they faced a resurgent Liberal Democratic party that was opposed to that policy. And like the Tories now, New Labour also faced an official opposition with an unpopular leader, Michael Howard, who was portrayed by the ruling party as an extremist, and was considered by many voters not to be a plausible prime minister.</p> \n<p>In the election the anti-government vote split, and New Labour scraped together 35% of the vote: enough to give the party a majority of 66. It was \u201ca minor miracle\u201d, Tony Blair wrote in his memoirs. But at the time the result was widely seen as a sign of New Labour\u2019s enduring hegemony, and of the Conservatives\u2019 continuing impotence. The day after the election, Howard announced he would step down as leader \u2013 just as many of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s enemies are eagerly assuming he will do if Labour loses next month.</p> \n<p>Yet in fact 2005 was the beginning of the end for New Labour. Ground down by growing public hostility, accumulating scandals and internal enemies, Blair lasted just two more years as premier: \u201cthe worst\u201d of his tenure, he wrote afterwards. Meanwhile the Conservatives chose a leader, David Cameron, who was younger and fresher than Howard and than Blair himself. At his first prime minister\u2019s questions, Cameron cockily but lethally told Blair: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/08/wrap.simonjeffery\" title=\"\">You were the future once</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Politics never precisely repeats itself, but it has cycles of decay and renewal. Johnson\u2019s sporadic efforts to present himself as a new sort of Conservative \u2013 less cosy with the business establishment, more interested in northern England \u2013 show some awareness of the risks facing any party after a decade in power. And unlike Blair in 2005, he hasn\u2019t been prime minister for long.</p> \n<p>But if he is still in the job next year, he will be a politician in his mid-50s who has been playing the naughty schoolboy of British public life for more than three decades. He will be faced with the very grown-up task of negotiating and then administering Brexit \u2013 a much more intractable problem than the much more able Blair ever faced. And it\u2019s likely Johnson will also be facing a new Labour leader with none of Corbyn\u2019s personal baggage but with similar, popular leftwing policies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/tories-accused-of-using-public-funds-for-ads-on-facebook-in-key-seats\">Tories accused of using public funds for Facebook ads in key seats</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The social, political and economic challenge of actually \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d should not be underestimated.

In the UK\u2019s already mean and sluggish economy, a shrinkage of 3.5% may make Johnson\u2019s airy promises about a post-Brexit, deregulated capitalism \u2013 in essence, a pretty tired and traditional Conservative worldview \u2013 impossible to sell to many voters.</p> \n<p>Then there is the Tories\u2019 lack of serious engagement with the climate crisis, with young voters, with multiculturalism and Britain\u2019s growing cities \u2013 and their preoccupation, instead, with Britain\u2019s shrinking proportion of elderly white voters, and with gaming the constitution and the electoral system.

In the UK\u2019s already mean and sluggish economy, a shrinkage of 3.5% may make Johnson\u2019s airy promises about a post-Brexit, deregulated capitalism \u2013 in essence, a pretty tired and traditional Conservative worldview \u2013 impossible to sell to many voters. Then there is the Tories\u2019 lack of serious engagement with the climate crisis, with young voters, with multiculturalism and Britain\u2019s growing cities \u2013 and their preoccupation, instead, with Britain\u2019s shrinking proportion of elderly white voters, and with gaming the constitution and the electoral system. All long-running governments become complacent and incurious in the end \u2013 even the most dynamic ones, as the recently published final volume of Charles Moore\u2019s Thatcher biography shows in unsparing detail. The drama of Brexit, and of all the Tory leadership battles and U-turns since 2010, has obscured how much this Conservative government has aged over the past nine years. It may not be tottering quite yet, but it will soon enough. \u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist",

We\u2019re great at this,\u2019 that gave us a little bit of overconfidence.</p> <p>\u201cThere were some huge, very thoughtful and intelligent efforts on the right in 2013 to address weaknesses, catch up, do smart things and build data trust and build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/breitbart\">Breitbart</a> and all these different projects. We have some really interesting, profoundly powerful organising groups that have cropped up post-2016 like Arena and Organizing Corps and Run for Something and Swing Left. They\u2019re very focused on organising; I\u2019m not saying that in a disparaging way. What they are not, though, is infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an overdue need for a reimagining and rethinking, a modernizing of the underlying infrastructure on the left that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d</p> <p>The centrality of tech to the president\u2019s re-election effort is spelled out by his choice of campaign manager: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Brad Parscale,</a> who was digital director in 2016 and \u2013 bearded, 6ft 8in tall \u2013 is now a familiar warm-up act at Trump\u2019s rallies. A year from the election, he is already spending millions of dollars more than Democrats to \u201cflood the zone\u201d of social media every day.</p> <p>The Trump 2020 campaign serves up targeted adverts with often misleading messages about immigration, impeachment and other issues that would be rejected by traditional TV networks.

      "bodyText": "A leader of Barack Obama\u2019s historic digital election campaigns has sounded the alarm over Democrats\u2019 failure to keep up with Donald Trump\u2019s social media behemoth. The US president outflanked and outspent rival Hillary Clinton on the web in 2016 and, after three years building a sophisticated digital operation with a formidable war chest, will enjoy a head start over next year\u2019s challenger. It is a marked reversal of fortunes from a decade ago when young liberals ruled the internet and Obama\u2019s revolutionary approach to online organizing helped him to victories over Clinton and the Republican nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney. Michael Slaby, the Obama campaign\u2019s chief technology officer in 2008 and chief integration and innovation officer in 2012, said: \u201cThe difficult truth about the pace of media and technology evolution is that it doesn\u2019t sit still so, if you\u2019re not continuously investing, you\u2019re falling behind, and I think there was a bit of a moment on the left of, \u2018Hey, we won, we figured this out. We\u2019re great at this,\u2019 that gave us a little bit of overconfidence. \u201cThere were some huge, very thoughtful and intelligent efforts on the right in 2013 to address weaknesses, catch up, do smart things and build data trust and build Breitbart and all these different projects. We have some really interesting, profoundly powerful organising groups that have cropped up post-2016 like Arena and Organizing Corps and Run for Something and Swing Left. They\u2019re very focused on organising; I\u2019m not saying that in a disparaging way. What they are not, though, is infrastructure. \u201cThere is an overdue need for a reimagining and rethinking, a modernizing of the underlying infrastructure on the left that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d The centrality of tech to the president\u2019s re-election effort is spelled out by his choice of campaign manager: Brad Parscale, who was digital director in 2016 and \u2013 bearded, 6ft 8in tall \u2013 is now a familiar warm-up act at Trump\u2019s rallies. A year from the election, he is already spending millions of dollars more than Democrats to \u201cflood the zone\u201d of social media every day. The Trump 2020 campaign serves up targeted adverts with often misleading messages about immigration, impeachment and other issues that would be rejected by traditional TV networks. It has mastered incendiary clickbait as a tool to pour oil on supporters\u2019 grievances, bank their donations, sell them merchandise and absorb their data. Washington norms are inverted online. The biggest political crisis of Trump\u2019s presidency is translated into an \u201cimpeachment defense task force\u201d to fire up supporters and tap their wallets. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s recent comment to reporters, \u201cGet over it\u201d, widely seen as a politically costly gaffe, quickly manifested itself as a slogan on a must-have T-shirt. Some Democrats worry their response so far is analogue and anaemic. Candidates\u2019 primary campaigns are seen as less innovative, less targeted and less ruthless about data collection and, for now at least, no match for Trump\u2019s firepower.

It\u2019s less a conversation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now comes a book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/American-Story-Conversations-Master-Historians/dp/1982120258\">The American Story</a>, which reprints 16 such discussions and aims to raise money for the library\u2019s literacy programmes. The subjects and experts range from Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln (Jack D Warren, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/20/donald-trump-jon-meacham-soul-of-america\">Jon Meacham</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/07/doris-kearns-goodwin-leadership-in-turbulent-times-trump\">Doris Kearns Goodwin</a>) to Lindbergh, King and Nixon (A Scott Berg, Taylor Branch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/14/bob-woodward-interview-fear-trump-russia\">Bob Woodward</a>).</p> <p>The title is appropriate: this is history with the emphasis on story, clubbable rather than scholarly but not overly so. The interviews are readable, revealing, even surprisingly funny. Turn one page and HW Brands is revealing to an audience at least part-Republican Ronald Reagan\u2019s lack of warmth to his children and failing memory while in the Oval Office. Turn another and Berg is detailing how Charles Lindbergh managed his solo Atlantic flight without recourse to a toilet.</p> <p>Turn another, and Rubenstein is asking Jay Winik about Hitler: \u201cWhat\u2019s with that moustache?\u201d As an interview technique, it\u2019s idiosyncratic and not particularly hard-hitting, but it\u2019s often productive.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I do when I do an interview,\u201d he says, \u201cis I always read the book or do a lot of research in advance. I write down the questions and then I kind of memorize the questions and I kind of have a logical way of doing it. And so if I have 35 questions, I\u2019ll probably remember 32 or 33 and nobody will know but me that I forgot one.</p> <p>\u201cBut also I think it helps with the eye contact. See, when you have a piece of paper, my theory is you look down. The second you look down, you\u2019ve lost the eye contact. It\u2019s less a conversation, more like an interview. That\u2019s why I do it that way, but everybody has their own style.

      "bodyText": "At the Economic Club of Washington DC, one day in July this year, David Rubenstein asked Mike Pompeo a question. When working with Donald Trump, the billionaire philanthropist-cum-interviewer asked the secretary of state, what is the process by which decisions are made? Pompeo said there was \u201ca very robust National Security Council process\u201d, and that when meeting the president, he always brought \u201ca one-page summary, at the very least, that says, \u2018Here\u2019s the outline of what it is that I think are the priorities now.\u2019\u201d And then he said something else: Trump is \u201cvery focused on where the money is, and how we use economic leverage to achieve our diplomatic ends\u201d. The interview took place on 29 July 2019. That was four days after Pompeo and other senior aides sat in on a call between Trump and Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, the new president of Ukraine. Whether Trump asked Zelenskiy to carry out investigations of his political rivals in return for the release of nearly $400m in military aid, and whether that would constitute a serious abuse of power, is now the key issue in the impeachment inquiry. On a rainy Halloween in New York City, in a 33rd-floor conference room at the Carlyle Group, the investment giant Rubenstein co-founded, the interviewer sits down to be interviewed. At the same time, in Washington, on Capitol Hill, House Democrats are passing a vote to formalise the impeachment process. I read him Pompeo\u2019s quote. \u201cI hadn\u2019t gone back and read that transcript since I did the interview,\u201d Rubenstein says, \u201cand you just pointed out something I hadn\u2019t focused on. \u201cI guess that\u2019s revealing in the way it\u2019s put.\u201d Rubenstein is not a journalist but he spends a great deal of time interviewing politicians and leaders. He is not a historian, but he spends a great deal of time interviewing historians. Which is why we\u2019re here. Rubenstein still chairs the Carlyle Group and according to Forbes is worth $3bn and change. But for some time he has been practising what he calls \u201cpatriotic philanthropy\u201d. Most visibly, that means buying historic documents (Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation) and restoring important sites (the Washington Monument, Monticello, the Lincoln Memorial). Two days before we meet, he announces $10m for the Jefferson Memorial in Washington. Less visibly, and in the vein of his interviews for the Economic Club and Bloomberg and PBS, Rubenstein hosts \u201ccongressional dialogues\u201d. At the Library of Congress, a bipartisan audience of representatives and senators mingles, dines and listens as Rubenstein interviews selected \u201cmaster historians\u201d. Now comes a book, The American Story, which reprints 16 such discussions and aims to raise money for the library\u2019s literacy programmes. The subjects and experts range from Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln (Jack D Warren, Jon Meacham, Doris Kearns Goodwin) to Lindbergh, King and Nixon (A Scott Berg, Taylor Branch, Bob Woodward). The title is appropriate: this is history with the emphasis on story, clubbable rather than scholarly but not overly so. The interviews are readable, revealing, even surprisingly funny. Turn one page and HW Brands is revealing to an audience at least part-Republican Ronald Reagan\u2019s lack of warmth to his children and failing memory while in the Oval Office. Turn another and Berg is detailing how Charles Lindbergh managed his solo Atlantic flight without recourse to a toilet. Turn another, and Rubenstein is asking Jay Winik about Hitler: \u201cWhat\u2019s with that moustache?\u201d As an interview technique, it\u2019s idiosyncratic and not particularly hard-hitting, but it\u2019s often productive. \u201cWhat I do when I do an interview,\u201d he says, \u201cis I always read the book or do a lot of research in advance. I write down the questions and then I kind of memorize the questions and I kind of have a logical way of doing it. And so if I have 35 questions, I\u2019ll probably remember 32 or 33 and nobody will know but me that I forgot one. \u201cBut also I think it helps with the eye contact. See, when you have a piece of paper, my theory is you look down. The second you look down, you\u2019ve lost the eye contact. It\u2019s less a conversation, more like an interview. That\u2019s why I do it that way, but everybody has their own style. That\u2019s just mine.\u201d True enough. My own research shows Rubenstein will devote the first part of any interview to interviewing his interviewer himself. Before I switch on the recorder he has established that I come from a city, Leeds, where he has ancestors thanks to an influx of Ukrainian Jews in the early 20th century. The questions keep coming. Being quizzed by a titan of business, it turns out, is an unusual experience indeed. Ask Bob Woodward. The great reporter sat down with Rubenstein to discuss Watergate, of course, but also what came after: Nixon\u2019s final days, George W Bush and 9/11, Barack Obama, Afghanistan and Iraq. They also talked about the time Woodward got a scoop on a memo written by a young aide in the Carter White House: Rubenstein. \u201cI remember it very clearly,\u201d he says. \u201cI would write a memo and I would put my boss\u2019s name on it typically, but I might have had my name on this one as well. And this is what the essence of it was \u2026 \u201cCarter went to Asia. He was going on the flight back to spend a day or two in Hawaii, recuperating. And the essence of it was [me] saying that, \u2018We got gas lines here, it\u2019s terrible. You shouldn\u2019t really spend time in Hawaii, it wouldn\u2019t look good. Just fly all the way back and you should know that the gas lines are a big problem and we need to blame the appropriate people, and let\u2019s blame Opec for it.\u2019\u201d He sent the memo to Carter, he says, \u201cand then somebody, I guess, didn\u2019t like the memo. And they leaked it to Bob Woodward. \u201cSo Woodward is going to write an article, and he asked me about it, but he was going to write the article saying, Rubenstein and Stuart Eizenstat, my boss, tell the president he should blame Opec for the problems, not blame yourself. It was embarrassing to have your memo leak, and it didn\u2019t make me popular. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d get fired or not. \u201cBut anyway, that was what it was. And then Bob, later I got to know him.\u201d In fact, in The American Story Woodward says the memo suggested \u201ca war on Opec\u201d \u2013 rather more than simple blame \u2013 and Rubenstein agrees. Either way, Rubenstein soon realised he didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer and went into finance instead. It worked out, and as he remained a voracious reader on \u201chistory, biography, politics and business\u201d \u2013 he aims to ingest 100 books a year \u2013 and because his extraordinary wealth gave him extraordinary proximity to power, he started interviewing anyone who was anyone in each of those fields. The American Story has attracted criticism for being a book full of white men, both its subjects and those discussing them. Kearns Goodwin on Lincoln and the late Cokie Roberts on the Founding Mothers stand out, as does Branch\u2019s great subject, Martin Luther King. But Rubenstein acknowledges the flaw. \u201cI have done another series of 18 or so dialogues,\u201d he says, \u201cand they have probably more women and more black authors. One of the authors I wanted to put in here was Annette Gordon-Reed, who wrote The Hemingses of Monticello, and it turned out the transcript didn\u2019t quite work \u2026 I have done another interview of her and I\u2019m going to put it in the next book or somewhere else.\u201d He has also interviewed Lonnie Bunch, formerly director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, now secretary of the Smithsonian, where Rubenstein is chair of the board. \u201cBut I would say, yeah, the authors do not reflect the diversity of our country today. On the other hand, they do reflect some of the leading American historians, but you can always say I could do a better job, and I\u2019d say, probably yes.\u201d Discussing such great and flawed white men, Rubenstein marvels at how one 18th-century generation produced \u201cGeorge Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton\u201d. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, \u201cwe have 330 million people and \u2026 where are the great people?\u201d His theory is \u201cthey\u2019re all in private equity\u201d. Mine is they\u2019re all in journalism. He says he regrets not taking a chance to buy the Washington Post before Jeff Bezos did, and we\u2019re back in the present day. In his introduction, Rubenstein quotes a line that springs to mind as we discuss Nixon. It\u2019s George Santayana: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d Every interview I\u2019ve done with a historian recently \u2013 Sarah Bakewell, Saul Friedl\u00e4nder, Sidney Blumenthal, David Blight \u2013 has turned to the present, and to what their books might tell readers about the conundrum of Trump. Rubenstein says he doesn\u2019t feel any pressure to pass judgment but \u201cfrom a historical point of view, most historians would say you can\u2019t tell how successful a president is or is not while he is in office. \u201cThink about this. When Harry Truman left the presidency, he was considered terrible, 15% approval ratings. When Jimmy Carter left, he was considered terrible. George Herbert Walker Bush, he lost re-election. In time, history has revived these people, just as John Adams has been revived. So it\u2019s hard to say. Most historians would say it takes at least 40 years after a person dies before you can read all the documents and really know. \u201cI have my views on President Trump. I do know him reasonably well and I\u2019ve spent a reasonable amount of time with him. I have my views on him, but I would say right now, it\u2019s too early to say how history will regard him and this is the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s suppose I tell you that we have an attack on the homeland tomorrow here, and he somehow does a very good job in defending the homeland. Or some other thing happens, the military does something great and the president, as commander-in-chief, gets credit for it, ie, killing a leader in the Middle East [a reference to the recent death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]. \u201cHe may get to be very popular, and despite some of the flaws that have become evident, you can\u2019t tell that he won\u2019t be popular or that he won\u2019t be successful. I think it\u2019s too early to say.\u201d Of course, Trump rarely feels such need for circumspection. He didn\u2019t when he spoke to Zelinskiy and he didn\u2019t, at least initially, when he sat down to talk to Rubenstein. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know him that well then,\u201d Rubenstein says. \u201cI wrote him a letter and asked him to come down [to the Economic Club in December 2014].

Rubenstein\u2019s Trump transcript does not contain anything quite so startling as that from Pompeo. But it does contain the following: MR RUBENSTEIN: \u201cIs there any downside to being Donald Trump? MR TRUMP: \u201cWell, I have to be very careful of that answer. That can get me into a lot of trouble.\u201d",

The majority [of addicts] would be invisible because they would be people in primary care, who are prescribed this and are overusing the prescription, refilling the prescription earlier or topping up in other ways,\u201d said Abbasi.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/15/drugs-doctors-gp-opioids-us-britain\">Dishing out more drugs won\u2019t stop the pain.

      "bodyText": "Just two free services specifically deal with opioid painkiller addiction in the UK, according to a report seen by the Guardian, prompting experts to warn that there could be a \u201chidden epidemic\u201d of sufferers. Clinicians worry that those experiencing an addiction to opioids prescribed by GPs feel uncomfortable at traditional drug misuse treatment centres, causing them to not seek help. The shortage was disclosed in a recent Public Health England report on prescription drug dependence, but has been unreported until now. Other experts consulted by the Guardian said they were unaware of any other such service. And with no dedicated NHS treatment centre and only one council-funded service, experts have warned that the problem will continue to grow. The Prescribed Medication Support Service in Mold, north Wales, and the Bridge Project in Bradford, are both run by a single counsellor and treat only a fraction of sufferers. It is known that half a million people in England who have been prescribed opiate medication have been taking them for more than three years, but some clinicians and academics think the number of people experiencing issues with the drugs could be much higher. Dr Yasir Abbasi, a former clinical director for addiction services at Mersey Care NHS Trust, said specific treatment services were needed to tackle the problem. \u201cI feel there\u2019s a hidden epidemic around this. The majority [of addicts] would be invisible because they would be people in primary care, who are prescribed this and are overusing the prescription, refilling the prescription earlier or topping up in other ways,\u201d said Abbasi. Abbasi, who is a consultant psychiatrist, said the number of people experiencing a problem was likely to run into the millions. Those experiencing an addiction to opioids prescribed by a GP who do not live near either service are often referred to services that cater largely to people with addictions to illicit drugs, such as heroin. The service in north Wales is run by the NHS and the one in Bradford is funded by the council. Harry Shapiro, the director of the online drug information service DrugWise, said it was likely people were not receiving help because of the stigma associated with these services. \u201cMost substance misuse services haven\u2019t got the funding to take on a load of new patients with a different sort of drug problem and people who turn up with a prescribed painkiller problem probably feel uncomfortable there. Unless you set the services running, you don\u2019t really get a sense of how big a problem you\u2019ve got,\u201d said Shapiro, who added that \u201con an anecdotal basis we probably already are at crisis point\u201d. In February, it was revealed that more than half of councils in England have cut their budgets for alcohol and drug treatment, even though admissions to hospital for problems related to addiction are soaring. Cathy Stannard, an NHS complex pain consultant who contributed to a recent Public Health England report on prescription drug dependency, said there was \u201calmost a reluctance\u201d among clinicians to address opioid painkiller addictions because of the lack of available treatment. She added that a locally delivered NHS treatment service was \u201cnot a difficult financial case to write\u201d, when the cost to treat an addict was likely to be much less than a year\u2019s prescription of opioids. There are no government statistics on the number of people who have experienced addiction to prescription drugs, but some private clinics have seen a surge in demand for treatment. Admissions to UK Addiction Treatment Centres (Ukat), the country\u2019s largest provider of private rehabs, for prescription drug addiction have risen by 28% in the past two years and 40% since 2015. Between 2015 and 2018, there were 488 admissions while in 2019 there have so far been 139. However, private treatment can be costly. A seven-day detox at a rehab facility can start at about \u00a32,000, while a 28-day residential admission can cost more than \u00a34,000. James Davies, a reader in mental health at the University of Roehampton who is secretariat to the all-party parliamentary group on prescription drug dependence, said the issue would not be resolved without the launch of dedicated services. \u201cWhat\u2019s at crisis point is the fact that we don\u2019t have the provision necessary to help people come off these drugs and we need that,\u201d he said. Opioid painkillers, such as fentanyl or morphine, are often highly effective in managing severe pain but can also be addictive. While many people experience dependency after prolonged use of the drugs, those who become addicts use the drugs for other purposes than they were prescribed for or take more than required. Abbasi pointed out that while in some cases, such as when a patient was terminally ill, it was necessary for these drugs to be taken for long periods, for other issues \u2013 such as chronic pain \u2013 this could be problematic. \u201cThe longer they use it, the more the chance they might become dependent on it,\u201d he said. Data from the Department for Health showed a 60% increase in opioid prescriptions over the past 10 years, with the number of medicines dispensed outside of hospital settings rising from more than 14m in 2008 to 23m in 2018. Though the annual number of prescriptions for opioid pain-relief medicines has slightly decreased since 2016, Stannard stressed: \u201cThe challenge lies in treating those who are already dependent with no clinical benefit.\u201d Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the lack of services specifically dedicated to treating addiction to prescription drugs was concerning. She added: \u201cPatients who need these services will often have unique health needs to address that differ from other forms of addiction \u2013 often the medical reason they started taking these drugs in the first place. The healthcare regulator Nice said it had been asked by the Department of Health and Social Care to develop a guideline on the safe prescribing of and withdrawal from drugs associated with dependence.",

Not only is that contemptible, and in many ways more contemptible than what Nixon did, but I think it\u2019s also true, and we\u2019ve heard a lot of testimony about this over the past couple of weeks, that what he was doing is endangering an American policy objective, the whole framework of containment of Russian expansionism, the bedrock of our policy in eastern Europe for the last 70 years. \u201cIt\u2019s far worse, in that regard, I think, than what Nixon did.\u201d Engel said the \u201cNixon case is very instructive\u201d in judging the integrity of Trump\u2019s defensive wall in the Republican members of Congress. \u201cThe Republicans by and large backed Nixon right up until the moment they didn\u2019t,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWhich is to say, when new information came out, in his case specifically the smoking gun tape, that nobody in good conscience could refute, his support eroded literally overnight. \u201cAnd I think we will see potentially a similar dynamic, at least that dynamic is set up, that there\u2019s no particular reason at this moment that Republicans feel a need to break with their party. \u201cBut history suggests that they may at some point open the newspaper and realize they have no choice but to switch sides.\u201d",

She too cited Greta as a role model. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of her speeches and rallies in my history class,\u201d she said, noting that she had since helped start an eco-club to pressure her school to do more to protect the environment. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to see someone that can go up there and talk, even though they\u2019re technically not an adult yet,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd they go up there and inspire people just like me.\u201d Casey Anell, 10, came from Huntington Park to attend the rally with her mother. She\u2019s been learning about climate change at school, and she too feels there is no more time for stalling. \u201cThere\u2019s a 50-50 chance the rainforest is going to be gone, and I\u2019m going to be sad,\u201d she said, and her classmates are frightened. \u201cThey\u2019re scared because they don\u2019t want any animals to go extinct,\u201d she explained. \u201cSome adults are doing something about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know about the government.\u201d Though undoubtedly a star, Thunberg kept a low profile at the march. When young people began marching through the streets of downtown, she was not on the frontlines, where all the cameras were; she was just another marcher, somewhere in the back, melting into the anonymity of the crowd, rumors of her presence whispered by many who came to hear her speak. The limelight was ceded to local activists and their campaign: not just to address the global effects of the climate crisis, but the fact that Los Angeles remains a major producer of the very thing fueling it. Up to 8,000 barrels of oil are produced each day from wells in the city of Los Angeles, according to a July 2019 report from City Hall, and an estimated 1.6bn more barrels remain in the ground below. Over half a million people live within 2,500ft of an active oil or gas well, a number activists want reduced to zero. Not only does this production fuel the climate crisis, which in turn intensifies the fires now threatening the city, but the air pollution this drilling creates has itself increased rates of asthma and the risk of cancer among those living immediately next door \u2013 a majority of whom are members of low-income, minority communities. Nalleli Cobo, 18, has been campaigning against such drilling since she was 9 and growing up across the street from an oil well operating on land in South LA leased to a private firm, AllenCo, by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. \u201cAllowing this oil well to spew toxic emissions is another way the archdiocese is abusing children,\u201d she reminded Angelenos. \u201cIt is time to switch to clean, renewable energy. There is no more time to waste.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a recap of today: Beto O\u2019Rourke dropped out of the 2020 primary race. The former Texas congressman was trailing in polls and lacked funding. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a $20.5tn plan to fund Medicare for all, without a middle-class tax hike. She figures the money can be raised through higher levies on capital gains and other investments and new taxes on the wealthiest 1% of Americans, among other things. Joe Biden criticized the plan, saying that Warren is \u201cmaking it up,\u201d Biden slipped to fourth in Iowa \u2014 the first caucus state \u2014 trailing Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. The Democratic candidates have all converged in Des Moines for a party fundraising dinner that has become known as a launching pad for winning candidates. Nancy Pelosi predicted public impeachment hearings would begin this month, but the House speaker emphasized that any case against Trump would have to be \u201cironclad\u201d. Donald Trump said that Chad Wolf was the new acting DHS secretary. A DHS spokesperson said Wolf is not the acting secretary. Confusion ensued. Trump is holding a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rally in Mississippi, after initially telling Louisiana \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d National security officer Lt Col Alexander Vindman, reportedly told impeachment investigators that he told by a White House lawyer to keep quiet about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. But the energy secretary may not show up to his deposition. According to CNN: Department of Energy spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said Perry will not participate in the closed-door deposition. \u201cThe secretary will not partake in a secret star chamber inquisition where agency counsel is forbidden to be present,\u201d Hynes said. \u201cIf the committee is interested in conducting a serious proceeding they are welcome to send for the secretary\u2019s consideration an invitation to participate in an open hearing where the Department\u2019s counsel can be present and the American people can witness.\u201d Rick Perry, the energy secretary, is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, according to reports. Perry resigned in October amid the Ukraine scandal. He has said that he urged Donald Trump to make the phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry to offer Ukraine \u201can alternative to Russian gas\u201d \u2013 saying the whole affair had nothing to do with Joe Biden or his son Hunter. Maybe Chad Wolf isn\u2019t DHS acting secretary after all... According to the White House Pool reporters, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson contradicted Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that Chad Wolf is \u201cright now acting\u201d secretary. Kevin McAleenan remains the acting secretary and Wolf is the acting undersecretary for policy, the spokesperson reportedly said. Stay tuned as we attempt to clarify. National Security official testified that he was asked to keep mum A White House lawyer instructed national security official Alexander Vindman not to discuss he concerns over Donald Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy with anyone outside the White House, the Washington Post reports: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified that he received this instruction from John Eisenberg, the top legal adviser for the National Security Council, after White House lawyers learned July 29 that a CIA employee had anonymously raised concerns about the Trump phone call, the sources said. The directive from Eisenberg adds to an expanding list of moves by senior White House officials to contain, if not conceal, possible evidence of Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to provide information that could be damaging to former vice president Joe Biden. 2020 candidates thank Beto O\u2019Rourke for his gun control advocacy After a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people, the former congressman redoubled his commitment to ending gun violence. During his campaign, O\u2019Rourke found himself at odds with some of his running mates. Fellow Texan Juli\u00e1n Castro criticized O\u2019Rouke\u2019s immigration policies, sparring with him during a June debate. \u201cI think you should do your homework on this issue,\u201d Castro told O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke has not endorsed any of the other candidates. \u201cI can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I\u2019m going to be proud to support whoever that nominee is,\u201d he said in a statement. Wolf will be the fifth person to lead the department since Donald Trump took office. Trump announced recently that acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan was leaving his post. This news was first reported by Politico, and confirmed by NPR. Trump confirmed that Wolf could take the position. According to White House pool reporters, the president said: \u201cWell he\u2019s right now acting and we\u2019ll see what happens. We have great people in there.\u201d Per NPR: Wolf would seem to be a less controversial choice than others, in that he has not publicly espoused the hard-line views on immigration that the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli has, for instance. Some advocates for immigration restrictions have raised concerns about Wolf\u2019s prior work as a lobbyist on H-1B and other employment visas - programs that Trump has opposed. Wolf would become the latest person in charge at DHS \u201cwho is not completely on board\u201d with Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, said RJ Hauman, head of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \u201cIf officially named, Wolf must recuse himself from work on all guest worker related issues, not just H-1B and L-1,\u201d Hauman said. Beto O\u2019Rourke was once a front runner in the Democratic primaries, who raised huge amounts of money from small donors across the country. When he ran for US senator, he earned an endorsement of Barack Obama and energized the democratic base before he narrowly lost to incumbent Ted Cruz in the Republican stronghold of Texas. But O\u2019Rourke is not expected to run for the Senate again. It\u2019s unclear what his political future holds. Following in the footsteps of Joan Didion, and Meghan Daum and Luc Sante \u2013 Donald Trump has penned his own version of the \u201cGoodbye New York\u201d essay after announcing yesterday that he had changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Mar-a-lago. \u201cI love New York, but New York can never be great again,\u201d he begins. Like so many bigly figures in the literary world, Trump has written about that bittersweet feeling of leaving the iconic city. For Trump, the decision to leave stems, he writes, from his disappointment with the \u201ccurrent leadership of Governor Andrew Cuomo (the brother of Fredo), or Mayor Bill DeBlasio\u201d. Moreover, Trump continued, \u201cUpstate is being allowed to die as other nearby states frack &amp; drill for Gold (oil) while reducing taxes &amp; creating jobs by the thousands.\u201d He lamented, \u201cNYC is getting dirty &amp; unsafe again.\u201d Echoing Didion, who described the city as \u201can infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself\u201d, Trump concluded that he wants this \u201cwonerful (sic) City and State to flourish and thrive.\u201d \u201cI Love New York!\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,\u201d he said in a statement. The former Texas congressman has suffered low polling numbers and his campaign has been under financial strain. \u201cThough it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. He had not met the thresholds for participating in the upcoming debates in November and December. That\u2019s it from me this week. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden attacked Elizabeth Warren following the release of her $20.5tn plan to fund Medicare for all, claiming the Massachusetts senator was \u201cmaking it up\u201d on the cost estimate of the proposal. A new poll showed Biden slipping to fourth in Iowa \u2013 narrowly trailing Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg in the first caucus state. Nancy Pelosi predicted public impeachment hearings would begin this month, but the House speaker emphasized that any case against Trump would have to be \u201cironclad\u201d. Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, reportedly told impeachment investigators that he was instructed by a White House lawyer not to discuss Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. Maanvi will have plenty more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Some of my Guardian colleagues will be anchoring the blog next week as I travel to Iowa to report on the Democratic presidential primary, so enjoy their coverage \u2013 and have a wonderful weekend! Joe Biden has now personally weighed in on the release of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s $20.5 trillion plan to fund her Medicare for all proposal, and his response boils down to: you\u2019re full of it. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d Biden told PBS NewsHour. \u201cNobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between $30 and $40 trillion.\u201d The former vice president once again offered Bernie Sanders the backhanded compliment of recognizing that Medicare for all would require tax increases on the middle class. \u201cLook, we don\u2019t have to go that route,\u201d Biden added. \u201cAll we have to do is go back, restore Obamacare, provide a public option.\u201d Biden noted that his plan could be implemented immediately if passed, while Warren and Sanders have proposed transitional periods to shift to a single-payer system. Elizabeth Warren defended her newly released plan to fund Medicare for all after Joe Biden\u2019s campaign released a statement accusing the Massachusetts senator of proposing a roundabout way to tax the middle class in order to pay for the sweeping policy. Warren emphasized that the cost and revenue projections outlined in the plan were authenticated by former senior Obama administration officials. She said: \u201cSo if Joe Biden doesn\u2019t like that, I\u2019m just not sure where he\u2019s going.\u201d Warren argued that her plan built on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and added: \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points.\u201d At least one of the Washington Nationals, relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, does not intend to visit the White House to celebrate the team\u2019s World Series championship. The White House announced earlier today that the Nationals would meet with the president on Monday afternoon to celebrate their victory, but some winning sports teams have opted out of the traditional visit since Trump took office. When the Boston Red Sox won the World Series last year, most of the team\u2019s minority players chose not to participate in the White House visit, while most of the team\u2019s white players met with Trump. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said that it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d the House would vote to impeach Trump. Speaking to reporters on the White House driveway, Conway went on to attack House Democrats for pursuing an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d investigation and argued the passage of the impeachment resolution did not alter the illegitimacy of the inquiry. Conway sarcastically asked: \u201cDo you think you can actually apply due process retroactively?\u201d She also applauded the two House Democrats who voted with every House Republican to oppose the impeachment resolution. Nancy Pelosi said on Capitol Hill yesterday that the procedures outlined in the resolution were \u201cfairer than anything that have gone before in terms of an impeachment proceeding.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s campaign raised $5.3 million last month as Trump repeated false corruption claims against the former vice president and his son, Hunter. The AP reports: The swell of cash was raised from 182,000 donors who made an average donation of about $28, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. It comes after his internet fundraising operation stumbled over the summer, leading critics to suggest he lacked grassroots support for his campaign. \u2018All of the Trump attacks have started to catalyze. More people understand what is at stake,\u2019 deputy campaign manager Pete Kavanaugh said in an interview. \u2018People out there are seeing Joe Biden getting attacked day after day. They understand he needs to fight back.\u2019 The fundraising boost comes amid growing anxiety over Biden\u2019s campaign from would-be allies in the Democratic establishment, who have fretted about his prospects following underwhelming debate performances, middling fundraising success and withering attacks from rivals in his own party and from Trump. Trump\u2019s baseless attacks may continue to provide momentum to Biden\u2019s campaign, especially given that the impeachment inquiry will soon advance to public hearings. If witnesses publicly confirm that Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, it could incentivize voters to offer the former vice president their support -- and maybe even some donations. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is reportedly closing her three field offices in New Hampshire as her campaign devotes the vast majority of its resources to Iowa. Harris\u2019 campaign said in an internal memo earlier this week that it was pursuing a massive overhaul in response to the candidate\u2019s dwindling fundraising and polling numbers. A number of employees in Harris\u2019 Baltimore headquarters are being laid off, and many campaign staffers have been redeployed to Iowa. However, the California senator is still struggling to gain traction in the first caucus state. A new poll out today showed Harris hitting only 3 percent in Iowa. Impeachment investigators have scheduled two more depositions next week. They intend to speak to Wells Griffith, the senior director for international energy and environment at the national security council, and Michael Duffey, the associate director for national security programs at the office of management and budget, on Tuesday. Duffey was previously asked to testify in the impeachment inquiry, but his boss at OMB, Russ Vought, tweeted that no one from the agency would be cooperating with the investigation. Given that it seems unlikely Griffith or Duffey will appear for the depositions, House Democrats appear to be running out of witnesses willing to cooperate with the investigation before it advances to public hearings. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, reportedly told impeachment investigators that he was told not to discuss Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. Politico reports: [Vindman] told lawmakers that he went to the [White House] lawyer, John Eisenberg, to register his concerns about the call, in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, according to a person in the room for Vindman\u2019s deposition on Tuesday. Eisenberg recorded Vindman\u2019s complaints in notes on a yellow legal pad, then conferred with his deputy Michael Ellis about how to handle the conversation because it was clearly \u2018sensitive,\u2019 Vindman testified. The lawyers then decided to move the record of the call into the NSC\u2019s top-secret codeword system\u2014a server normally used to store highly classified material that only a small group of officials can access. Vindman did not consider the move itself as evidence of a cover-up, according to a person familiar with his testimony. But he said he became disturbed when, a few days later, Eisenberg instructed him not to tell anyone about the call\u2014especially because it was Vindman\u2019s job to coordinate the interagency process with regard to Ukraine policy. Einsenberg\u2019s alleged instruction not to discuss the call will likely be cited by House Democrats as evidence of a cover-up by the Trump White House. Eisenberg will almost certainly be asked about this direction to Vindman if he shows up for his deposition with impeachment investigators on Monday -- although it remains unclear whether the White House lawyer will actually appear. Trump has announced that he intends to nominate Stephen Hahn as the next commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The Washington Post reports: But in a surprise move, acting FDA commissioner Norman \u2018Ned\u2019 Sharpless, will immediately return to his previous position as the director of the National Cancer Institute, and Brett Giroir, a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services, will oversee the FDA until Hahn is confirmed, according to individuals who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues. Sharpless has been acting commissioner since April, when the previous commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, stepped down. However, Sharpless\u2019 term as acting agency head expires Friday. His time at FDA could be extended only if the White House officially nominated a successor, which it cannot do because the Hahn paperwork isn\u2019t finished, according to people familiar with the situation. If confirmed, Hahn, the chief medical officer of Houston\u2019s MD Anderson Cancer Center, will help oversee the FDA\u2019s efforts to crack down on vaping. Trump announced back in September that his administration would ban most flavors of e-cigarettes, but the FDA has not yet issued its policy on the matter. Democratic presidential candidates have started arriving in Des Moines for tonight\u2019s Liberty and Justice Dinner, a major campaign event in the first caucus state. The dinner comes on the same day that a poll was released showing a tight race in Iowa \u2014 with Elizabeth Warren narrowly leading over Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden. Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro announced this morning that his campaign had met its goal to raise $800,000 in the last ten days of October. Maya Rupert, Castro\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement: \u201cWe set an extremely ambitious goal to keep Secretary Castro\u2019s voice in this race, and our supporters met the challenge and delivered one of the best months of the campaign to date. ... We will keep lifting up important issues others choose to ignore, and demonstrating by example why Secretary Castro is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump.\u201d Castro\u2019s team said last month that the former San Antonio mayor and cabinet secretary would have to drop out of the race unless the campaign saw a spike in fundraising. Fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker pulled the same gimmick a month earlier and also met his fundraising goal. In her Bloomberg interview, Nancy Pelosi downplayed the likelihood of a government shutdown as the impeachment inquiry advances to a more public stage. The House speaker said of the Trump administration: \u201cThey don\u2019t care about shutdowns because they don\u2019t believe in government. However I do think that they learned a lesson from the last shutdown, since it didn\u2019t do them very well.\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer suggested earlier this week that Trump might force a shutdown to distract from the impeachment investigation. The New York Democrat told reporters: \u201cHe always likes to create diversions.\u201d Paula White, the president\u2019s personal pastor who has just joined the administration, is promoting a book in which she details her long friendship with Trump. In a Washington Examiner interview about the book, White claimed that Trump once proposed building a glass cathedral for her ministry. \u201cHe wanted to build a house of God,\u201d White said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this, let\u2019s build this before we\u2019re too old.\u201d Trump\u2019s relationship with White has previously caused consternation among some of his evangelical supporters, and her new role in the White House will surely only escalate those tensions. The New York Times reported yesterday: Ms. White will work in the Office of Public Liaison, the official said, which is the division of the White House overseeing outreach to groups and coalitions organizing key parts of the president\u2019s base. Her role will be to advise the administration\u2019s Faith and Opportunity Initiative, which Mr. Trump established last year by executive order and which aims to give religious groups more of a voice in government programs devoted to issues like defending religious liberty and fighting poverty. As Mr. Trump campaigns for a second term, he cannot afford to lose support from the religious conservatives who voted for him in 2016 in significant numbers. Without their backing, his path to re-election would be significantly narrower. ... But Ms. White cannot be easily categorized as either a political asset or a liability. She has a large following among Christians who believe in the \u2018prosperity gospel,\u2019 which teaches that God blesses people he deems to be of strong faith with wealth, good health and other gifts. But many other Christians consider these beliefs to be heresy. And Ms. White\u2019s presence in the top tier of Mr. Trump\u2019s coterie of informal religious advisers has long been a source of contention with many evangelical Christians. For more on White, read Jessica Glenza\u2019s piece on her from earlier this year. In her Bloomberg News interview, Nancy Pelosi predicted that public hearings in the impeachment inquiry would begin this month. The House speaker said: \u201cI would assume there would be public hearings in November.\u201d Pelosi added that impeachment investigators would continue closed-door depositions as long as the interviews are \u201cproductive.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what the timetable will be -- the truth will set us free,\u201d the California Democrat said. \u201cWe have not made any decisions on if the president will be impeached.\u201d Pelosi noted that any case against Trump would have to be \u201cironclad.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, also told PBS NewsHour yesterday that transcripts from the closed-door depositions may be released as soon as early next week. Speaking to Bloomberg News, Nancy Pelosi questioned the wisdom of supporting Medicare for all, arguing that Obamacare was a better option. The House speaker said in an interview: \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of Medicare for all.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s comments come just hours after Elizabeth Warren released her plan to fund Medicare for all by raising taxes on the wealthy and redirecting spending on private insurance. In a statement criticizing Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan to fund Medicare for all, a senior adviser to Joe Biden accused the Massachusetts senator of proposing an indirect tax on the middle class to pay for the sweeping policy. Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director, argued that Warren\u2019s proposal to raise $8.8 trillion by redirecting most of employers\u2019 spending on healthcare to the federal government amounted to a tax on the middle class. Bedingfield said: \u201cFor months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does. Senator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Elizabeth Warren released her $20.5 trillion plan to pay for Medicare for all, insisting she could avoid tax hikes on the middle class by increasing taxes for the wealthiest Americans. Joe Biden has slipped to fourth in Iowa, according to a new poll of the first caucus state. Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are narrowly beating him as the race has become tighter than ever. Senior House Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, said they will \u201csoon\u201d initiate public hearings and transcript releases in the impeachment inquiry. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. The White House has just announced it will host the Washington Nationals, the 2019 World Series champions, on Monday. The announcement comes less than a week after Trump was booed at Nationals Park, as the team was facing the Houston Astros in Game 5 of the World Series. After booing the president, the crowd broke out in a chant of, \u201cLock him up!\u201d Washington is an overwhelmingly Democratic town, and there had been predictions that Trump would not be well received by the Nationals\u2019 fans, but the chant still caused much hand-wringing among certain political commentators. One Republican congressman, Don Young of Alaska, is pursuing a new strategy for responding to questions about the impeachment inquiry: headbutting the camera. The longtime lawmaker was being repeatedly asked by activists from the progressive group MoveOn.org whether it was acceptable for a president to pressure a foreign government to interfere in an election, as Trump is alleged to do. As one of Young\u2019s staffers tried to direct the activists to his press secretary, the congressman approached the camera and collided with it before saying, \u201cThere you go.\u201d This unusual evasion tactic is not likely to please the president, who has urged Republican lawmakers to attack the \u201csubstance\u201d of the impeachment inquiry. Headbutting cameras is probably not what Trump had in mind. Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top adviser on Russia, is back on Capitol Hill after testifying in the impeachment inquiry. Hill reportedly told impeachment investigators last month that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, oversaw a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine to benefit Trump. Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at some of his Democratic primary opponents hours after Elizabeth Warren announced her plan to fund \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The former vice president advertised the beginning of Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment, warning that \u201cmany Americans can\u2019t afford to wait for far off promises.\u201d Warren said she would soon release a plan on how the country can shift from its current healthcare system to a single-payer framework, and it\u2019s unclear whether the transitional period would be shorter or longer than the four years proposed by Bernie Sanders. Bennet not sold on Warren plan at all Colorado Senator and 2020 Democratic candidate Michael Bennet isn\u2019t impressed with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s mathematics on Medicare for all, the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Walters writes. \u201cVoters are sick and tired of politicians promising them things that they know they can\u2019t deliver,\u201d Bennet said in a statement just earlier today. \u201cWarren\u2019s new numbers are simply not believable and have been contradicted by experts. Regardless of whether it\u2019s $21 trillion or $31 trillion, this isn\u2019t going to happen, and the American people need health care,\u201d it continued. Bennet hasn\u2019t qualified for the more recent Democratic primary debates but is still out on the trail. Instead of Medicare for all, the progressive plan for universal US health insurance paid for by the government, Bennet favors a more moderate public option that would give Americans the option to buy a government plan or keep their private sector insurance. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, told Fox News that the White House feels no need to create an impeachment war room because of the president\u2019s own messaging against the inquiry. Grisham said of Trump: \u201cHe is the war room.\u201d Asked when she might hold her first press briefing, Grisham, who assumed her role about four months ago, replied: \u201cWhenever it\u2019s time.\u201d Trump celebrated the stock market gains following news that the US economy added 128,000 jobs last month, stronger than the 89,000 predicted by economists. (Follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog for more updates.) However, a former Republican congressman noted the president was complaining yesterday that the impeachment inquiry was allegedly dragging down US markets. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said that transcripts of the closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry could be released \u201cearly next week.\u201d Asked about the timing of the release, Schiff told PBS NewsHour: \u201cYou know, I think early next week is probably the realistic time. And we still need to go through some of the transcripts and excise any potentially classified information or personal information. But they will be released very soon.\u201d Nancy Pelosi also told late-night host Stephen Colbert yesterday that public hearings in the impeachment investigation would begin \u201csoon.\u201d The impeachment resolution passed by the House outlines next steps in the inquiry as it advances to a more public stage, but Democratic leadership was evasive yesterday when asked about the specific timing of hearings or transcript releases. The accelerated timeline could help the House wrap up hearings in time for an impeachment vote potentially by the end of this month. In releasing her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d funding plan, Elizabeth Warren also noted that she would soon release a proposal on how the US would transition from its current healthcare system to a single-payer framework. Bernie Sanders, who has centered his campaign around a Medicare-for-all proposal, has said the US would shift to his system over four years, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Warren proposes a shorter or longer transitional period. Progressive activists praised the release of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s funding plan for her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d proposal, complimenting the Massachusetts Senator for not abandoning the expansive policy. Some of the other Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, have attacked \u201cMedicare for all\u201d proposals for being too dramatic of an overhaul of the US healthcare system. Of course, candidates like Warren and Bernie Sanders have replied that a dramatic overhaul is exactly what the US healthcare system needs. Elizabeth Warren has released a plan to pay for her Medicare-for-all proposal after some of her fellow Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, criticized her not laying out how she would fund the idea. The New York Times reports: Ms. Warren would use a mix of sources to pay for the $20.5 trillion in new spending over a decade, including by requiring employers to pay trillions of dollars to the government, replacing much of what they currently spend to provide health coverage to workers. She would create a tax on financial transactions like stock trades, change how investment gains are taxed for the top 1 percent of households and ramp up her signature wealth tax proposal to be steeper on billionaires. She also wants to cut $800 billion in military spending. The plan crucially does not include tax hikes on the middle class, a question she has repeatedly faced on the debate stage. The release of the funding plan could also help Warren to address criticisms that her proposals are unrealistic. A new Iowa poll found that the Democratic presidential primary in the early voting state is a tight race as Joe Biden has lost his lead. According to the New York Times-Siena College poll, Elizabeth Warren leads the Iowa race, attracting the support of 22 percent of the state\u2019s Democratic voters. Bernie Sanders is a close second at 19 percent, and Pete Buttigieg is just behind him at 18 percent. Biden narrowly comes in fourth at 17 percent. No other candidate hits 5 percent, but a number of contenders are hoping to make a splash at tonight\u2019s Liberty and Justice Dinner in Des Moines, as Barack Obama did in the 2008 race. However, it\u2019s worth noting that a clear group of frontrunners has emerged just 100 days from the caucus, and any of the four top-polling candidates appears capable of winning at this point. Just a day after the House passed a resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry, a new poll has come out showing Americans are evenly divided on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. According to the Washington Post-ABC News poll, 49 percent of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 47 percent say he should not. However, that 49 percent backing impeachment overwhelmingly comes from Democrats, reflecting the nearly party-line vote in the House yesterday on the impeachment resolution. These numbers could shift once the House committees leading the inquiry advance to public hearings, as yesterday\u2019s resolution outlines, and Americans are able to hear directly from witnesses for the first time. Good morning, live blog readers! There are no depositions scheduled in the impeachment inquiry today, but investigators are already planning for three major interviews next week \u2014 assuming the witnesses show up, which is not guaranteed. The AP reports: Deepening their reach into the West Wing, impeachment investigators have summoned former national security adviser John Bolton to testify next week. But they also are seeking testimony of two other political appointees \u2014 John Eisenberg, the lead lawyer for the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a senior associate counsel to the president. ... The lawyers\u2019 role is critical because two witnesses have suggested the NSC legal counsel \u2014 when told that Trump asked a foreign leader for domestic political help \u2014 took the extraordinary step of shielding access to the transcript not because of its covert nature but rather its potential damage to the Republican president. News of Bolton\u2019s requested interview made headlines earlier this week, but the testimony of Eisenberg and Ellis could prove even more damaging for the president. As the lawyers who were notified of concerns about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president shortly after it took place, Eisenberg and Ellis could provide insight into the immediate aftermath of the conversation \u2014 and why they went to such great lengths to keep it from becoming public. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will hold a campaign rally in Mississippi at 7 p.m. C.T. Democratic presidential candidates are in Des Moines, Iowa, for the Liberty and Justice Dinner. Congress is on recess. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "The government has halted fracking in England with immediate effect in a watershed moment for environmentalists and community activists. Ministers also warned shale gas companies it would not support future fracking projects, in a crushing blow to companies that had been hoping to capitalise on one of the new frontiers of growth in the fossil fuel industry. The decision draws a line under years of bitter opposition to the controversial extraction process in a major victory for green groups and local communities. The decision was taken after a new scientific study warned it was not possible to rule out \u201cunacceptable\u201d consequences for those living near fracking sites. The report, undertaken by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), also warned it was not possible to predict the magnitude of earthquakes fracking might trigger. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. The government said it would not agree to any future fracking \u201cuntil compelling new evidence is provided\u201d that proves fracking could be safe. The UK\u2019s only active fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire was brought to an immediate halt this summer after fracking triggered multiple earth tremors that breached the government\u2019s earthquake limits. Andrea Leadsom, the business and energy secretary, said the government has always been clear that shale gas exploration in the UK must be carried out safely. \u201cAfter reviewing the OGA\u2019s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community. For this reason, I have concluded that we should put a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect,\u201d she said. The moratorium marks a major U-turn for the Conservative party and the prime minister Boris Johnson, who once referred to fracking as \u201cglorious news for humanity\u201d and urged the UK to \u201cleave no stone unturned, or unfracked\u201d in pursuit of shale gas. The government ended its support for the struggling industry less than a week after a damning report from Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog found its plans to establish fracking across the UK was dragging years behind schedule and had cost the taxpayer at least \u00a332m so far without producing any energy in return. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said it has \u201cbeen clear for some time that the government\u2019s big bet on fracking is bust\u201d. The decision has been welcomed as a \u201cvictory for common sense\u201d by green groups and campaigners who have fought for almost a decade against the controversial fossil fuel extraction process. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis moratorium is a tremendous victory for communities and the climate. For nearly a decade local people across the country have fought a David and Goliath battle against this powerful industry. We are proud to have been part of that fight.\u201d Tom Fyans, from CPRE, said the countryside charity would \u201ccelebrate alongside the local communities, campaigners and environmentalists who have been campaigning valiantly to stop fracking for many years\u201d. \u201cThis is a fantastic win for local democracy and everyone who cares about protecting the countryside from climate catastrophe and mass industrialisation,\u201d he said. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, the shadow business and energy secretary, said the moratorium was a victory for local people and the government owed them an apology. She said: \u201cWhen the Tory government overruled local democratic decisions to halt fracking, communities did not give up. When fracking protesters went to jail, communities did not give up. And now they have forced the government to U-turn. \u201cThe Tories owe the public an apology, and an explanation of how much public money they wasted while ignoring the science.\u201d Long-Bailey said the government could yet allow fracking to restart. \u201cThe next Labour government will ban fracking \u2013 whereas the Tories will only call a temporary halt to it. You can\u2019t trust a word the prime minister says.\u201d The government revealed its fracking moratium alongside plans for a major review of the UK\u2019s transition to a green economy. The Treasury said it will assess how the UK can make the most of the economic green shoots which are expected to emerge while moving towards a carbon neutral economy by 2050. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said the review was a vital next step\u201d in delivering the government\u2019s 2050 climate target while \u201csupporting growth and lancing costs\u201d to avoid \u201cplacing unfair burdens on families or businesses\u201d. \u201cWe must all play a part in protecting the planet for future generations,\u201d he added. The Treasury\u2019s support for a green economy comes after Downing Street shot down claims made by the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, that tackling the climate crisis would cost \u00a31tn and require spending cuts for schools, hospitals and the police force. In a swift rebuke, No 10 said plans to create a net zero-carbon economy would cost no more than the UK\u2019s existing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The interim report will be published in the spring, ahead of a final report in the autumn before the global UN climate talks, which will take place in Glasgow. Simon Clarke, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said it was \u201chumbling to launch this unprecedented review into how we end the UK\u2019s contribution to climate change\u201d. \u201cUntil recently people said that \u2018Net Zero\u2019 was impossible, but this work is a giant step towards making it happen, enabling us to set out a roadmap for an economy that is cleaner, more efficient, and works for everyone, while preserving our planet,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was corrected on 2 November 2019 to make clear that the government has halted, but not banned fracking as stated in an earlier version, and that the moratorium applies only to England as it is a devolved issue.

Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes seven and eight.</em></p> <h2><strong>Dirty laundry</strong></h2> <p>We probably should have guessed that last week\u2019s censure was never going to keep Gilou and Laure in line. They double down on their off-the-books activity this week, using the new Ken and Barbie case as cover to tap Oury Mazouz\u2019s phone, flounce off to Le Havre to chase down the shipping container and bum-rush the squash-changing-room lockers to pore over Lebrion\u2019s phone. It turns out getting kicked off the case was just the kick they needed.</p> <p>Commenters who insisted Lebrion was shady are emphatically vindicated. White notes written by the fraud squad boss were sent to parliamentarians including Aline Lecomte, loyal patron of the laundering network, who recognised Lebrion\u2019s barely disguised description of Wang as a reliable police informant. Lecomte informed the network that took out Wang and Herville. \u201cA cop\u2019s balls-up killed Herville,\u201d says Laure, visibly relieved that it wasn\u2019t one of hers. Spiral typically favours the cock-up version of history over the conspiracy, and here it seems more likely that Lebrion deleting the report was him covering up a terrible error rather than some deep complicity.</p> <h2><strong>Jos\u00e9phine</strong></h2> <p>We can only imagine how hectic Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s Google calendar is. Monday, 9am: beat attempted murder rap. Tuesday, noon: discover heartbreaking betrayal by Edelman. Wednesday, all day: screw over Roban. Thursday, lunch: double-cross Edelman while impressing Solignac enough to secure a new job and premises. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/spiral-recap-season-six-episodes-one-and-two-the-tale-of-the-torso\">last excursion</a> into corporate law didn\u2019t go too well, but Solignac is as insistent as he is sleazy. She takes Lola\u2019s file along with her, of course \u2013 there would be no justice in the world if you couldn\u2019t occasionally help out your extortionist ex-cellmate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ce238c07672695363055a1373ced75337101c18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ce238c07672695363055a1373ced75337101c18/0_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quelle surprise ...

She makes huge strides in the Herville case (every one of them out-of-bounds) as stuffed shirt Br\u00e9mont treads water, staying in his lane and sticking to the rules to the bitter end. Berthaud\u2019s free-style, on-the-hoof policing is not something you can teach. You play hunches, live off adrenaline and put yourself and your colleagues at risk, but you get the bad guy. And it works (until it doesn\u2019t). Her juggling of the Ken and Barbie case with the Herville investigation is chaotic but masterful. Like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN0CV0nIq-o\">drunken master</a>, she sways and lurches from setback to setback, finally landing the fatal blow with a flourish and a bow. It\u2019s engrossing to watch. She and Gilou do up K and B like a pair of kippers, manipulating them to turn on each other and reminding us once again what a formidable pair they are when they are riffing off one another.</p> <h2><strong>Gilou</strong></h2> <p>The other half of that particular double act has an equally eventful week. Say what you will about Escoffier, he retains a hypnotic appeal for the ladies. There was the beautiful Cindy, Laure, of course, and several below-the-line commenters who should have known better, all of whom fell for his grizzled charms. Soizic of the fraud squad becomes the latest to come under his spell, kissing him after hacking into Lebrion\u2019s phone for him. She has a head for figures and a taste for danger, but will she still be interested when she discovers all he really wants is a nice girl to settle down with?</p> <h2><strong>Roban</strong></h2> <p>One of the most fascinating things about Fran\u00e7ois is that \u2013 even as an absurd stickler for procedure and even with a mind calm as a millpond and precise as an atomic clock \u2013 he is so often ruled by his passions. He is intelligent enough to see through Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s ruse but that deep need for a clean and tidy end to his career proves his downfall. Fran\u00e7ois needs to take the loss on this one and hope that the damage to the investigation as a whole isn\u2019t fatal. That said, I could watch scenes of Roban and Machard fencing all day, and it\u2019s great to have Dominique Daguier back as that slippery old toad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762e41eebf4b6725c5a6071d1dff3d294397c31f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/762e41eebf4b6725c5a6071d1dff3d294397c31f/0_0_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ticket to ride ... all-round good guy Ali even pays for the Ken and Barbie victim\u2019s cab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ticket to ride ... all-round good guy Ali even pays for the Ken and Barbie victim\u2019s cab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroline Dubois/BBC/Son et Lumi\u00e8re/Canal+</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Thoughts and observations</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Ali giving the Ken and Barbie victim, Mrs Rodrigues, her taxi fare home was pretty adorable.

Ascot 2.10 Only a couple can be ruled out with confidence but The Last Day is on a handy mark on the balance of his form last season. Wetherby 2.30 Thebannerkingrebel has made a decent start to his hurdling career but must give 10lb to a different class of opponent on Saturday. Proschema was useful on the Flat \u2013 he raced off 104 at Goodwood in the summer \u2013 and made a very promising debut over timber at Chepstow last month. Ascot 2.45 Adjali was campaigned in Grade One events as a juvenile and could have more to offer this season than some of his rivals here, though it is clearly a competitive heat for a seasonal debut. Wetherby 3.05 The veteran Unowhatimeanharry would be a hugely popular winner but his best days are now more intermittent than they were in his pomp. Ballyandy is three years younger and has the added benefit of a run this season. Ascot 3.20 Black Corton and Bryony Frost will attract support after a decent return last time while Vinndication is a hot prospect and has had a wind op since last year. At the prices, though, a small interest in Black Corton\u2019s stable companion Adrien Du Pont could be rewarded at around 16-1. He has also had a wind operation, ran well on his handicap debut in this race last year and has gone well fresh in the past.",
