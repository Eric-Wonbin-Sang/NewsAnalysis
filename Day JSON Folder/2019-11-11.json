      "bodyText": "The British founder of the organisation that trained the Syrian rescue group known as the White Helmets has died in Istanbul. A spokesman for the White Helmets confirmed on Monday afternoon the death of James Le Mesurier and said further details were yet to be established. Le Mesurier, 48, was found dead near his apartment in central Istanbul\u2019s Beyo\u011flu neighbourhood at around 4.30am. Turkish media reports said he was found with fractures to his head and legs and appeared to have fallen from a balcony. The office of Istanbul\u2019s governor said it had commenced a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d investigation. The Reuters news agency said it had been told his death was being treated as suspected suicide. Friends said Le Mesurier had been operating for years under significant pressure from orchestrated attacks on his reputation and the stress of running a high-profile NGO. The former British army officer founded Mayday Rescue, a not-for-profit group that organised and trained the White Helmets, officially known as Syrian Civil Defence. The group, made up of more than 3,000 volunteers, operates inside opposition-held areas in Syria and has been credited with saving the lives of thousands of people affected by Russian and Syrian airstrikes and bombings. White Helmet workers rush to the scenes of bombings to try to rescue the wounded from the rubble. They have also helped to document alleged war crimes, including the use of chemical weapons. Le Mesurier told the BBC in 2014 that the White Helmets sprang out of volunteer groups established in neighbourhoods across Syria that were under regime bombardment. He said he admired their work and sought to assist with training, fundraising and advocacy. \u201cThese are ordinary individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cFormer bakers, former builders, former students who had choices for what they were going to do with their lives within the revolution. These individuals chose to stay, with very little equipment and at the beginning with no training whatsoever, to respond to bomb attacks, to respond to shellings and try to save their fellow Syrian civilians.\u201d The group continues to operate in Idlib, the last opposition-held territory in Syria. Three of its volunteers were injured in Russian shelling that killed three people last week, it said. The Guardian has previously documented how the organisation has been the target of a disinformation campaign, conducted with the support of the Russian government, that positions it as an al-Qaida-linked terrorist organisation. Le Mesurier had been subject to similar campaigns and was targeted by Russia\u2019s foreign ministry as recently as last week. The NGO\u2019s funders currently include the British and German governments. The Trump administration froze US funding, which made up about one-third of the total, without public explanation in early 2018, but resumed giving financial aid last month amid criticism of its decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria. Le Mesurier, whose father was a commandant in the Royal Marines, attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and served in the armed forces, including in the Balkans, until the late 1990s.

Mayday Rescue said in a statement that Le Mesurier had dedicated his life to helping civilians, especially in Syria. \u201cWe ask that James be remembered as what he was: a great leader, a visionary, and a dear colleague and friend,\u201d it said.

      "bodyText": "Logan Roy is today\u2019s King Lear in the HBO series Succession, turning his offspring against each other to pull up the drawbridge against threats to his reign. The Loudest Voice, Russell Crowe\u2019s gargantuan embodiment of alleged sexual harasser and Fox News head, Roger Ailes, confronted us with the perpetrator\u2019s point of view. Add Joker to the list, and the protagonists of 2019 are reprehensible and compelling to watch. The trend has made it to the stage too, with the recent global success of The Lehman Trilogy depicting the historic trading of moral values for towering stock worth. The bravest provocation about this wave of storytelling is that the moral heart of the drama is so ambiguous, if not entirely absent. The first time a lead character airs a moral qualm in Succession is episode two of the second season. Cousin Greg hesitates at working for the fictional equivalent of Fox News. He is laughed at for having principles. Even when the show elicits empathy for Kendall Roy as he takes on his father, his objective is no storybook compulsion for the greater good. His core goal is greed and self-advancement. The moral centre is no longer centre stage. It\u2019s still doing its warm up in the green room having missed its entrance. Packer &amp; Sons, my upcoming play for Belvoir theatre, dramatises the patriarchal cycles within Australia\u2019s famous media dynasty. Part comedy, part tragedy, its portrait of male entitlement is stark; the scenes take place in rooms where women are excluded. This might appear a counterintuitive undertaking, incautious in a world that is becoming more conscious and critical of its gender blindspots. The real Packer women have a central role in the narrative of this family, but these individuals would bring a moral counterpoint that Packer &amp; Sons resists. Deserving of the theatre as they are, this is not their play, nor is that a play for me to write. I write from a queer outrage at the excesses of Australian masculinity. As a gay man I have been both an insider and an outsider in all-male domains. I know how men perform their masculinity for each other. I attempt to provide that insight in this story of men inculcating other men to be less sensitive \u2013 to stomp out the feminine. Kerry Packer perfected the role of Australia\u2019s alpha male in chief. A Packer executive described to me how he was once made to watch for hours as Kerry verbally mauled a top lieutenant. Within the marathon, Kerry sent a secret wink to his audience of one. It was a performance, and Kerry was enjoying it. In his comedic 1991 appearance before a parliamentary committee, Kerry\u2019s bulky presence, quick wit and sizeable disdain for his government interrogators is still a great watch on YouTube bannered in green and gold typeface. His main gripe is, \u201cEvery time you pass a law you take away someone\u2019s privileges.\u201d Well, yes.

On Monday Turkey said it had begun deporting foreign members of Isis held in custody, in a policy that risks diplomatic fallout with its European allies. One US citizen had already been repatriated and seven German nationals were due to be flown home on 14 November, the interior ministry spokesperson \u0130smail \u00c7atakl\u0131 said on Monday. Preparations to deport two Irish, 11 French, and three Danish citizens were also under way, he said. The suspects were not immediately identified. The interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, said last week that Ankara would begin to send Isis militants back to their home countries from Monday even if they had been stripped of their citizenship, saying Turkey was not a \u201chotel\u201d for foreign jihadis. The broadcaster NTV quoted \u00c7atakl\u0131 as saying that \u201cthree more Islamic State militants at deportation centres will be sent back today\u201d. Turkey aimed to repatriate about 2,500 militants, the majority of whom would be sent to European Union nations, the state broadcaster TRT Haber said, adding that there were 813 jihadists at 12 deportation centres around the country. Ankara has repeatedly criticised European nations in particular for refusing to take back any of the foreign nationals held in Turkish prisons and for stripping them of their citizenship. A further 287 people, including women and children, had been captured by Turkey as a result of Ankara\u2019s invasion of Kurdish-held areas of Syria last month, Soylu said. Turkey has not given total numbers and nationalities of those it is planning to send home, or details on how such a policy will work. Many countries request passenger lists for both military and commercial flights before a plane is allowed to enter their airspace. Several European countries, including the UK, have stripped Isis fighters of their citizenship to prevent their return, leaving many legally stateless and creating a problem for Ankara. Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry directed requests for comment to the interior ministry. The interior ministry did not immediately respond. The French defence minister Florence Parly told French radio on Monday morning that she had no knowledge of any specific repatriation at this point, but she said France had a strict repatriation protocol in place with Turkey \u201cwhich allows us to repatriate French terrorists when the situation arises\u201d. In The Hague, a Dutch court said the government must use \u201call possible means\u201d, including a US offer of help with repatriation, to bring home 56 children whose mothers travelled to Syria to join Isis and other Islamic extremist groups. British diplomats said the policy did not appear to apply to UK nationals held by Turkey. Aine Davis, a member of the cell known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, who beheaded hostages in Syria, is serving seven and-a-half-years in a Turkish prison. The British woman Tooba Gondal is also believed to be in Turkish custody, having escaped a Kurdish-run detention centre during the recent fighting in north Syria. Since 2010, the UK has stripped more than 100 people of British citizenship over their alleged links to Isis, al-Qaida, al-Shabab and other terrorist groups. The policy has led to prolonged legal battles in some high-profile cases including those of the Isis member Shamima Begum and the alleged member Jack Letts, both of whom are held by Kurdish forces in Syria.

Indeed, Zverev has actually acquitted himself pretty well in their meetings, with both of their meetings on hard court going to a deciding set.

Earlier today, Stefanos Tsitsipas finally made his mark on his bitter rivalry with Daniil Medvedev, winning 7-6(5) 6-4 to score his first win in six tries.</p> <p>Now, we turn to the one question that dominated the build-up to this tournament: will Rafael Nadal be ready? After a small abdominal tear forced him out of the semi-finals in Paris a couple of weeks ago, Nadal didn\u2019t start serving again until late last week.

      "bodyText": "Despite how well Zverev played, how unimpeachable his serve was and how well he pummelled his his forehand, which is often one of his biggest weaknesses, this will be tough to swallow for Nadal. He was off the boil from very early on and played easily his worst match since his struggles in the clay season. He hit 3 forehand winners and 13 errors from that wing alone, which is unacceptable for him. Even if the abs held up, that preparation was not ideal and it seems to have cost him. The good news for the Spaniard is that he has two matches to correct things and we\u2019ll see if he can play himself into the event. Thanks for joining and goodbye. Zverev in his post-match interview: It\u2019s obviously great. Everybody probably knows how much I was struggling the whole season. This means so much, playing here again after winning my biggest title so far in my career here last year. This means everything to me and I was looking forward to this match. Thanks a lot for all the support, everybody who came out. This atmosphere is the reason why the goal at the beginning of the season to make London. Playing here, playing in front of you all guys, playing at the O2 is something we don\u2019t have the whole year. This is so special, thank you very much. [On why he was serving so big] Carrots, spinach, whatever was coming my way, whatever mum and everybody was giving me. That\u2019s what I was doing this week, listening to my parents, I guess. Obviously, just coming back here to practice Thursday, Friday and the rest of the days was amazing. Just being out here, being in the stadium was something that I wanted to do. This year again, it was a huge goal of mine, especially the way the season went. It was not always a lot of ups, so I hope I can play my best tennis this week and we\u2019ll see how it goes. Alexander Zverev completes an incredible performance with yet another dominant hold. Zverev served incredibly well, losing just 4 points on his first serve throughout the match. His forehand has been absolutely horrific at times this year, yet he blasted 12 startling forehand winners in that second set alone. What a performance. Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 4-5* Alexander Zverev: Another hold for Nadal, sealed with a great inside out angled forehand at 30-30 and then a big serve to hold. His level has certainly risen a little in set two and Zverev\u2019s serve was certainly shaky in the previous game, but surely not? Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 *3-5 Alexander Zverev: Well, Zverev\u2019s first serve did completely go off the boil and his second serve looked incredibly vulnerable. So, what did he do? At 30-30 he came up with a missile of an inside out forehand winner. At 40-30, he bettered it with an obscene running 105mph forehand at full stretch. Breathtaking. Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 3-4* Alexander Zverev: That must have felt good. Nadal pieces together a much better service game, replete with first serves and easy point. Zverev still made his presence felt, slamming a forehand return winner on Nadal\u2019s first game point, but he also gave Nadal a nice reprieve by stopping the point to incorrectly challenge Nadal\u2019s swinging wide serve at 40-30. Good work from Nadal, but will Zverev\u2019s incredible serving abate? Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 *2-4 Alexander Zverev: That was rude. After all of that effort from Nadal, Zverev slams down two big first serves and holds with a huge forehand crosscourt winner at 15. The pressure was off Nadal\u2019s shoulders for what felt like 3 seconds. Now he must hold again. Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 2-3* Alexander Zverev: Nadal survives, saving a break point, but it was neither easy or pretty. Nadal\u2019s forehand is still vacillating between landing laughably short and spraying errors, he seems slow and Zverev continues to crush forehands. But from break point down, Nadal found three big first serves in a row, sealing the hold with an ace. His game is falling apart but still he fights. Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 1-3* Alexander Zverev: Zverev has become a little more tentative in the rallies since he opened the set with two double faults, but he is still essentially unplayable on his serve. 8/8 first serve points won in the second set. He holds with a 141mph serve down the T. Easy. Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 1-2* Alexander Zverev: Finally, Nadal breaks Zverev\u2019s run of six games in a row with a good hold to 15. A big fistpump after a great combination of forehands at 15-15 and a loud \u201cvamos\u201d after an unreturned serve at 30-15. Nadal has been a shadow of himself today but he is still Rafael Nadal, which means he is still in this. Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 *0-2 Alexander Zverev: Zverev, who loves a double fault, opened with two double faults out of nowhere. But three first serves in a row bring three points in a row for the German and a game point. Zverev netted a backhand on the first game point, but he slammed down his seventh ace before sealing the hold with a really neat drop volley. Nadal is 0/3 so far at the net, Zverev is making solid volleys. It\u2019s hard to underline how absurd this all is. Second set: Rafael Nadal 2-6 0-1* Alexander Zverev: Nadal\u2019s day just went from bad to worse. He looked good at 30-15, but then he approached the net and ducked out the way of a Zverev forehand, which hawkeye says just clipped the line. Zverev brought up break point with a punishing backhand down the line which just clipped the net and forced a Nadal error. Zverev broke by pounding some forehands and slipping into the net to finish with a volley winner. Zverev is aboslutely crushing the ball here and Nadal has absolutely nothing so far. That sublime forehand down the line earlier. Nadal struggled badly and looked a shadow of himself in truth, but what a flawless set of tennis from Sascha Zverev, sealed with yet another incredible service game. He lost 4 points on serve throughout. You don\u2019t do that against Rafael Nadal. First set: Rafael Nadal 2-5* Alexander Zverev: Zverev breaks again with a game that included an incredible, whistling running forehand down the line winner and then a booming forehand crosscourt at deuce. But Nadal is also looking extremely off right now. After generating game point with a very good crosscourt forehand, he got into a muddle at the net and handed Zverev an easy passing shot. At break point down, Nadal sprayed a very bad forehand wide. First set: Rafael Nadal *2-4 Alexander Zverev: Zverev tears through another service game with more booming deliveries. He is in an incredible service rhythm right now, with 93% of first serves in and 86% of points behind it. That said, most of his first serves are coming in over 140mph and although he serves big, it\u2019s not usually that big. Nadal has rarely dipped under 120mph. I\u2019m guessing that speed gun is a bit cooked. First set: Rafael Nadal 2-3* Alexander Zverev: Zverev breaks Nadal\u2019s serve to love and what a return game it was! Zverev opened with a brilliant defensive low slice that tripped Nadal up, then forced a Nadal forehand error with a bruising backhand crosscourt. On the first break point, Nadal sent an easy forehand straight into the net. That was not at all good from the Spaniard, but Zverev has come to play. First set: Rafael Nadal *2-2 Alexander Zverev: While Nadal\u2019s service game has already contained some long exchanges, Zverev\u2019s two holds have just been a shower of aces and unreturned serves. Another couple of serves above 140mph. Absurd serving. First set: Rafael Nadal 2-1* Alexander Zverev: Nadal comes through his first test with aplomb. Some great long exchanges, with a Zverev backhand skidding off the line and forcing an error, then Nadal doing almost exactly the same on the following point. Nadal has made it clear that he is going to target the Zverev forehand and the German is looking to take on his weaker wing as much as possible. Zverev saved game point at 40-30 with a huge forehand, but then two wayward forehands hand Nadal another hold. First set: Rafael Nadal *1-1 Alexander Zverev: If that was impressive serving from Nadal, that was an absolutely outrageous hold from Zverev. He crushed one at 144mph and held with a 143mph ace down the T. One of his missed first serves registered at 147mph. Wow. First set: Rafael Nadal 1-0* Alexander Zverev: If there were any questions about Nadal\u2019s abdominal muscles, the 126mph first serve Nadal opened with should help to ease many minds. A solid hold by Nadal with some great serving. Zverev closed the game by dumping a forehand into the net. The players are out on court. Sascha Zverev won the toss and chose to receive. Let\u2019s see how this one goes. In case anyone forgot, here is the match point that sealed the biggest win of Zverev\u2019s career last year. Doubles done. So, who will win? The head-to-head suggests that Nadal enjoys this match-up greatly, and it is difficult to bet against Nadal considering how well he has played. He has now won 30 of his last 31 matches (the ATP doesn\u2019t count walkovers), including the French Open, US Open and two Masters 1000 events. However, despite the head to head, Zverev theoretically seems to match up very nicely against Nadal. His height and supreme backhand mitigate most of the effects of Nadal\u2019s heavy topspin and swinging lefty serve. Indeed, Zverev has actually acquitted himself pretty well in their meetings, with both of their meetings on hard court going to a deciding set. He really should have won their last meeting when he led by a break in the final set of last year\u2019s Rome final. Having the ability to defeat Nadal is only half of the battle. There will be no better opportunity to face Nadal than on these fast indoor hardcourts as he tentatively attempts to recover from injury. Then again, this is Rafael Nadal. Even at his worst, a battle with the 19 time grand slam champion is a horrible prospect for all. Hello! Welcome to day two of our coverage from the ATP finals at the O2 Arena in London. Earlier today, Stefanos Tsitsipas finally made his mark on his bitter rivalry with Daniil Medvedev, winning 7-6(5) 6-4 to score his first win in six tries. Now, we turn to the one question that dominated the build-up to this tournament: will Rafael Nadal be ready? After a small abdominal tear forced him out of the semi-finals in Paris a couple of weeks ago, Nadal didn\u2019t start serving again until late last week. He has improved with each passing day in practice this week and, by all accounts, he looked comfortable in his final session earlier today. If Nadal is healthy, he arrives in London as the player of the year so far, a fact confirmed by his return to the top of the rankings this week. He will certainly take strength from how well he has fared in previous battles against Zverev. He holds a 5-0 record against the German, including two wins on hard courts. This has been a tough, tough year for Zverev, but his legal dispute with his agent has finally been contained and he has played very well in the final months of this year. The fact that the 22 year-old has made it to London after such a turbulent year speaks volumes of his ability. The defending champion will not relinquish his title without a fight.",

      "bodyText": "Gareth Southgate has warned his young side they must \u201craise the bar\u201d set by previous generations of England teams if they are to end the long wait for success on the international stage. England face Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday in their 1,000th fixture knowing that a draw guarantees qualification for Euro 2020 with a game to spare. A host of former players and managers will be in attendance to mark the occasion, with England\u2019s current players set to wear their \u201clegacy\u201d number \u2013 a chronological record of their first cap similar to those used by England\u2019s Test cricket team\u2013 on their shirts as part of the celebrations. Several members of the 1966 World Cup-winning team will also be at Wembley and Southgate has admitted that the solitary success of Sir Alf Ramsey\u2019s side more than half a century ago should provide an incentive for future generations to attempt to emulate. \u201cI suppose at the moment the win in the World Cup is the outlier whereas, in actual fact, historically, we looked at it as the benchmark,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a small island and the fact that even in rugby and cricket we\u2019ve had a brilliant run. The rugby team \u2013 huge credit to them. And they\u2019ve only managed to win once and, with respect, there are fewer countries that are capable of winning. \u201cSo, it\u2019s hard to win and that\u2019s got to be our aim. We\u2019ve got to now raise the bar for the next decades to make sure they are more successful than the previous ones. But we can\u2019t have that arrogance that maybe we\u2019ve had over the years that we have a right to be in those latter stages \u2013 we have to earn it.

      "bodyText": "The number of lobbyists with unfettered access to the halls of Parliament House to see politicians, staffers and journalists under the sponsored passholder scheme has nearly doubled in the last seven years, Guardian Australia has learned. In addition to parliamentarians, their staffers, building employees and the press gallery, there is a separate category for sponsored passes where people, often working as lobbyists, can enter and exit the building through the private entrances, and not need an escort through the non-public parts of the building. The passes are sponsored by MPs and senators, and although the orange passes are not limited to lobbyists, a significant proportion of those issued would be to groups lobbying in parliament. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie described the passes as a \u201cwin for lobbyists\u201d. \u201cHaving that orange lanyard lets them roam free around Parliament House unescorted. It lets them \u2018bump\u2019 into ministers at Aussies cafe, or \u2018drop in\u2019 to visit MPs and senators in their office,\u201d she said. The number of these passes issued has boomed in the last few years. In 2012, the number of the much sought-after orange passes issued was 1,267. The president of the Senate, Scott Ryan, has confirmed there are now 2,380 people with sponsored passes able to roam the halls of power unabated. The figures came in response to a question in the Senate from the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick. Guardian Australia had previously asked the Department of Parliamentary Services for a list of who has been provided orange passes since the election, but the request was refused. The Department of Parliamentary Services is also exempt from Australia\u2019s freedom of information law. DPS argues there isn\u2019t a specific category when someone is signing up for a pass to identify them as lobbyists, and the orange pass is also provided to people from not-for-profits, banks, religious groups, universities, unions and people on diplomatic missions. When pushed in 2017 the department was able to break down the total orange pass figures of 1,710 that year, showing the majority \u2013 1,543 passes \u2013 were given to people with a \u201csignificant and regular\u201d business requirement for unescorted access. Lambie said \u201csignificant and regular business\u201d is what she would call lobbying. \u201cWhat else would they be doing?\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The freelance journalist William Summers attempted to get a list of the organisations that had employees that hold orange passes in 2018, but was similarly rejected by DPS. The secrecy surrounding which lobbyists have access to parliament puts Australia at odds with the United States and New Zealand, which publish lists of the lobbyists with access to parliament. In 2017, for New Zealand, the total number of registered lobbyists was just 93. In Australia, the Attorney-General\u2019s Department maintains a lobbyist register, but that doesn\u2019t reveal which lobbyists have access to parliament. Lambie said the rise in the number of passes being issued was \u201cshocking\u201d and said it was even worse because the government keeps secret who holds those passes. \u201cThere are fewer than 600 people on the government\u2019s lobbyist register \u2013 less than a quarter of the number of people who hold an orange pass,\u201d she said. \u201cThe details of people who hold orange passes should be published and the rules updated to include in-house lobbyists. \u201cMost importantly, we need an independent regulator that can crack down on lobbyists and politicians who do the wrong thing.\u201d A Grattan Institute report last year found the lobbyist register was too narrow in its definition of lobbyists, and recommended the register should be linked to people who have orange passes in parliament. \u201cLinking the register of lobbyists to sponsored (\u2018orange\u2019) passes would broaden the definition of lobbyist without making it unmanageable,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe burden to register as a lobbyist should be negligible. Orange passholders would simply need to declare who they are lobbying for and the portfolio areas they are lobbying in, as part of the existing application process.\u201d The Grattan report noted that while some people holding orange passes might object to the label of \u201clobbyist\u201d \u2013 such as academics \u2013 it would still show who is attempting to influence people within Parliament House. In 2017, the then Senate president Stephen Parry defended the decision not to disclose the list of people holding such passes, arguing it was a security threat because someone might try to steal a passholder\u2019s identity to access Parliament House. \u201cIf you get someone who wanted to identify themselves as a passholder, they could create a likeness to a passholder, steal the pass, do harm to the person of the pass they\u2019ve stolen and then enter this building,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a potential risk.\u201d",

In a speech in Hartlepool (full text <a href=\"https://brexitcentral.com/nigel-farage-reveals-the-brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-conservative-held-seats-full-text-of-his-speech/\">here)</a>, Farage claimed that his decision meant a \u201cleave alliance\u201d was now in operation. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have got no great love for the Conservative party at all. But I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance, by keeping him honest and holding him to account by getting people in, and by stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats who\u2019d sign us up to everything, wouldn\u2019t they, the United States of Europe, European army, you name it, I mean they even want to revoke the result of the referendum. No, I think our action, this announcement today prevents a second referendum from happening and that to me I think right now is the single most important thing in our country.</p> \n   <p>So in a sense, we now have a leave alliance. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve done it unilaterally. We\u2019ve decided ourselves that we absolutely have to put country before party and take the fight to Labour.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has claimed that he did not call Farage to agree a leave alliance deal with him.</strong> But in his speech Farage claimed that he changed his mind, and decided not to stand candidates in Tory-held seats even though<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/01/general-election-news-latest-brexit-farage-restates-call-for-brexit-party-pact-with-tories-live-news?page=with:block-5dbc19698f08c428d8934aef#block-5dbc19698f08c428d8934aef\"> only 10 days ago he said Johnson would have to abandon his whole Brexit plan for this to happen</a>, because of assurances made by Johnson<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1193562889484951552\"> in a video posted on Twitter yesterday afternoon.</a> Farage said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s been a difficult decision to make, but I have to say that last night, for the first time I saw something since that Brussels summit that actually was optimistic; because I saw Boris Johnson on a video saying: \u2018We will not extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020\u2019. And that, in many ways, a direct challenge to Mr Barnier [the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator] that would need a change to the political declaration before all of this gets ratified in parliament.</p> \n   <p>Now you may well say to me: isn\u2019t this the same Boris Johnson who said he\u2019d die in a ditch rather than extend from 31 October? And yes, the issue of trust, the issue of delivery is a very real one and I\u2019ll come back to that perhaps in a few moments\u2019 time. But at least it was a clear, unequivocal statement from him, that we\u2019re not going on beyond the end of 2020.</p> \n   <p>But much more significantly \u2013 and really quite unreported on so far today \u2013 he said something else that really did matter to me, hugely. He said we would negotiate a trade deal, a super-Canada-plus trade deal with no political alignment. Now, that is a huge change because ever since Mrs May\u2019s abject speech in Florence, we\u2019ve been aiming at a close and special partnership with the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s \u201csuper Canada plus\u201d comment has not been reported today because this sort of trade deal has always been his aim, and there was nothing new in what he was saying yesterday in the video. But it did look as though it had been distributed to give Farage cover for the climbdown he announced today.</p> \n  <p>At the moment Farage is still planning to run candidates in Labour-held seats, which could prevent the Tories from making gains in those constituencies. But given that Farage has now accepted that Johnson\u2019s deal is acceptable, and that a Johnson majority government would be preferable to a hung parliament, it is hard to see the logic of his stance. It remains to be seen if a further retreat is coming. Thursday is the deadline when candidates must decide whether they are or are not standing in constituencies.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The opposition parties have said that Farage\u2019s decision

class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Over the past few days, we have both visited those affected by the devastating floods across Yorkshire and the east Midlands.</p> \n   <p>You\u2019ll know that hundreds of homes have been flooded and over a thousand properties have now been evacuated. Our hearts go out to those affected, including the friends and family of Annie Hall.</p> \n   <p>With heavy rain expected in parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands, in areas that are already suffering from flooding, hundreds of further flood warnings are in place. Rightly, there will be hundreds of thousands of people across these regions who remain concerned about their families and livelihoods.</p> \n   <p>With this in mind, I am writing to urge you to hold a Cobra meeting and take personal charge of the government\u2019s response to the devastating flooding we have seen over the past few days. In addition, we need full assurance from the government that every resource is being utilised to aid those that need it and protect against future potential floods.</p> \n   <p>With dozens of flood warnings still in place, I have to disagree with your assessment from the weekend that this is not a \u2018national emergency\u2019. If this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the east Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared. Every year we don\u2019t act means higher flood waters, more homes ruined and more lives at risk due to climate change.</p> \n   <p>The government also must ensure that the insurance industry fulfils its responsibilities. In addition, going forward the industry must continue to provide insurance at an affordable level to householders.</p> \n   <p>I urge you again to hold a Cobra meeting to ensure all is being done to help the families affected. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T18:37:04.940Z\">at 6.37pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc99a908f08be4a102e72cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T17:32:01.764Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Patrick Maguire</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/11/what-nigel-farages-withdrawal-tory-seats-does-and-doesnt-mean\">in the New Statesman</a> argues that the Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory-held seats won\u2019t be welcomed by all Conservative candidates in those constituencies.

This is from its political research manager, Chris Curtis.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Farage\u2019s decision to stand aside in current Conservative-held seats and not in Labour-held seats that the Tories will be looking to gain will likely make very little difference. There are three caveats to this. Firstly, whilst there has been a swing towards the Tories in their battle against Labour, the increase in Lib Dem and SNP vote share means that there is likely to be a swing against them in seats where they are battling against those parties. However, there are not as many of these seats as there are Labour/Conservative marginals, and most of them will be the kind of places where the Brexit party wouldn\u2019t have won many votes anyway, such as in Scotland or more remain-leaning seats in the south.</p> \n   <p>Secondly, it does help mitigate against the effects of a surge in support for Labour during this campaign. If the Labour vote share does start to recover, in the same way it did in 2017, this will make it more difficult for the party to start gaining seats from the Tories. However, on current polling it will take quite a turnaround of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s fortunes in order to reach this point. Finally, whilst the practical effect might be quite small, we don\u2019t know what effect Farage\u2019s message might have on the broader perceptions of the parties. It could be that even in seats where the Brexit party are standing, voters that might otherwise have supported the party now feel more comfortable voting Conservative after Farage\u2019s comments.</p> \n   <p>However, given the Brexit party was already trending downwards in the polls, it looked like this was happening already. So, despite today\u2019s drama, this is unlikely to be a game-changing moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T14:27:34.789Z\">at 2.27pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc96b488f0867dcebfd2b84\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T14:10:55.827Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These are from my colleague <strong>Rajeev Syal,</strong> who has been in the high court this morning.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/syalrajeev/status/1193886169366482944\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Labour\u2019s biggest backer Unite the union has told the High Court that the party\u2019s parliamentary candidate Anna Turley is \u201cunfit to be an MP\u201d.

Perhaps they were being polite, or having decided against university it was less of an issue. But it could also be that as younger voters, the events of 2010 feel like ancient history. The Lib Dems will certainly hope so.</p> \n  <p>Gyimah has abandoned the East Surrey seat he represented since 2010 to try his luck in Kensington. Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad took this from the Conservatives in 2017, with the Lib Dems a distant third.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to me on the bus before the visit, Gyimah said he hoped to do well in a strongly pro-remain area, and to capitalise on Dent Coad\u2019s occasionally divisive reputation:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My pitch is that Kensington can do better than a hard Brexiteer or a class warrior ...</p> \n   <p>I knock on doors and I talk about views I passionately believe in, and there are a lot of voters who are welcoming of those view.

But, given the state of the opinion polls (which generally show the Tories ahead of Labour by around 10 points - a much larger margin than on election night in 2017), the Conservatives would currently expect to hold most of these anyway, Curtice said.</p> \n  <p>He said there were two exceptions to this.</p> \n  <p>In Scotland the Tories are at risk of losing seats to the SNP, he said. But he said the Brexit party was weak in Scotland, so \u201cthis is probably not going to help the Tories very much in that,\u201d Curtice said.</p> \n  <p>The main impact would be in seats where the Tories faced a strong Lib Dem challenge, Curtice said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is here perhaps that the decision of the Brexit party to stand down might at the margin help the Conservatives because some of these seats, though by no means all of them, are ones where there was quite a substantial leave vote last time - places like North Cornwall and North Devon ...</p> \n   <p>Put it like this; perhaps last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/07/general-election-sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-come-out-fighting-on-economy-live-news?page=with:block-5dc447b38f08c2d1f80db884#block-5dc447b38f08c2d1f80db884\">by their own alliance</a>, the remain alliance, the Liberal Democrats might have helped themselves to pick up another half dozen seats. Those seats may have gone as a result of today\u2019s decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Curtice said in Labour-held seats, where the Brexit party still intends to stand, the Farage decision would not make much difference. But he included this qualifier:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Unless, of course, that by standing down in so many seats the credibility of the Brexit party, which already seems to have seeped away quite considerably ... it may just simply mean that, even though the Brexit party stands, that the Brexit party loses some of its voters, and it helps the Tories that way.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Summing up the overall impact, Curtice said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We perhaps should not exaggerate how important this is. It is the Liberal Democrat/Conservative contests where the Tories might be helped out. But in the crucial Conservative/Labour ones, so far at least, Mr Farage is not offering the Conservatives any direct help. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc59891d667035cbe452717e451740b99142da87\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc59891d667035cbe452717e451740b99142da87/0_30_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Sir John Curtice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Sir John Curtice.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc961538f08c2d1f80ddabd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T13:35:28.728Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-tory-seats-nigel-farage-says\">Nigel Farage\u2019s announcement</a> has lifted sterling on the foreign exchange markets.</p> \n  <p>The pound has hit a six-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.168.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eb92bba4986c3aaa8f7b6b9dc025a0ed9e7ac53\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eb92bba4986c3aaa8f7b6b9dc025a0ed9e7ac53/0_0_1527_606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pound vs the euro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"397\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound vs the euro over the last year</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Sterling is also up a cent against the US dollar at $1.288.</p> \n  <p>City traders are calculating that a hung parliament is now less likely - although the Brexit party will still be competing in Conservative target seats.</p> \n  <p><strong>Neil Wilson</strong> of <strong>Markets.com </strong>says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a massive moment for the campaign and gives the Tories a clear run at Downing Street.

It doesn\u2019t mean that the result of the election is now a foregone conclusion, and it does not mean that a hung parliament is now impossible, as Nigel Farage claimed, but the result of an election in which the Brexit party is not standing in Tory seats will probably not be the same as an election in which it was splitting the Brexit vote in those constituencies.</p> \n  <p>Only 10 days ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/01/general-election-news-latest-brexit-farage-restates-call-for-brexit-party-pact-with-tories-live-news?page=with:block-5dbc19698f08c428d8934aef#block-5dbc19698f08c428d8934aef\">when Farage announced that he would be standing candidates in around 600 seats in Britain</a>, he was claiming that his tactic might harm Labour more than the Conservatives. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/01/general-election-news-latest-brexit-farage-restates-call-for-brexit-party-pact-with-tories-live-news?page=with:block-5dbc59488f08cb84c60a2fdc#block-5dbc59488f08cb84c60a2fdc\">At the time, election experts said he was wrong and that Tory seats were most at risk</a>. Today Farage has admitted they were right, and he was wrong.</p> \n  <p>But how much difference will this make in practice? It it hard to say, but two points are worth stressing. First, Farage is making this announcement because his poll ratings have been falling. He is capitulating from a position of weakness, not a position of strength. The polls have not shifted a great deal in the past week, but one constant feature is that the Brexit party vote has been heading south. Perhaps he was not as big a threat to the Tories as people thought. Here are the figures from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/31/uk-general-election-2019-poll-tracker\">the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker.</a></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7b7d6451f457be582865d3f98e54d04362790c1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7b7d6451f457be582865d3f98e54d04362790c1/0_0_1109_586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poll tracker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"528\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poll tracker</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Second, the Brexit party still seems to be intent on standing candidates in Tory target seats - particularly the leave-leaning Labour seats in the north of England, where for a long time Farage has been saying his party could do well. In theory the Brexit party could still split the Brexit vote in these place, preventing Boris Johnson from making the gains he needs to win a majority. But it wouldn\u2019t be in Farage\u2019s interests to do this if he wants Johnson to have a majority, and so it seems more likely that, in reality, the Tories and the Brexit party will operate unofficial non-aggression pacts in these places, allowing the best placed party to challenge Labour. That would be what you would expect from a \u201cleave alliance\u201d, which is what he now says exists.

Since then, Johnson has said nothing that amounts to any form of concession, and the points the PM has been making about wanting to break free of EU regulation are ones he has always been making. And, as Farage himself acknowledged, the promise not to extend the transition beyond the end of 2020 is effectively worthless in the light of what happened to Johnson\u2019s \u201cdie in the ditch\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by 31 October. The only face-saving offer from the PM was the fact that he posted a video last night making these points, effectively offering Farage a ladder down which he could climb. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/11/general-election-parties-vie-for-veterans-votes-as-keith-vaz-quits-politics-live?page=with:block-5dc94fd28f08c2d1f80dd9dd#block-5dc94fd28f08c2d1f80dd9dd\">12.13pm.)</a> There is already speculation that Farage came under pressure to concede from Johnson\u2019s ally, Donald Trump.

And all broadcasters have been covering the party on the assumption it is a GB-wide party, fighting all seats. In the light of today\u2019s news, we may see less of Farage on TV than before. That could further suppress his vote.</p> \n  <p>One final point. Until relatively recently it was assumed that if the Tories tried to fight an election without having delivered Brexit, they would get smashed by the Brexit party. Almost all media commentators thought this, but so did Johnson himself, and probably Farage too. But that was another piece of conventional political wisdom (like the idea that Jeremy Corbyn could never win a Labour leadership contest) that turned out to be nonsense. You could cite this as proof that the Westminster commentariat are all rubbish (perhaps we are?), but it is probably better seen as evidence that voter behaviour is inherently unpredictable.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a0c111d031bd8e2849feddb739061c5e93066a4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0c111d031bd8e2849feddb739061c5e93066a4/58_0_4903_2942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage speaking at a Brexit party news conference at the Best Western Grand Hotel in Hartlepool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage speaking at a Brexit party news conference at the Best Western Grand Hotel in Hartlepool.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T18:15:04.067Z\">at 6.15pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc951758f08be4a102e6ee6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T12:19:06.317Z\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Farage says he is taking this decision to prevent the risk of a second Brexit referendum.</p> \n  <p>He says that what he is announcing is, in practice, a leave alliance.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc950678f08be4a102e6edc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T12:15:41.483Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Farage says Brexit party will not fight Tories in 317 seats, in boost to Johnson's election chances</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Farage says he weighed up Johnson\u2019s promises against the threat that the Brexit party standing could let the Lib Dems in.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage says the Brexit party will not stand against the Tories in the 317 seats they won in 2017.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>But it will concentrate its efforts on seats held by the Labour party.</p> \n  <p>And it will also challenge other remainer parties.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T14:02:12.153Z\">at 2.02pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc94fd28f08c2d1f80dd9dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T12:13:15.576Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Farage says last night he saw something that was optimistic.</p> \n  <p>He says he saw a video of Boris Johnson saying he would not extend the Brexit transition.</p> \n  <p>He says people might say Johnson broke his promise not to delay Brexit beyond 31 October.</p> \n  <p>But at least this was an unequivocal statement.</p> \n  <p>But Farage says Johnson also said he would negotiate a super Canada-plus trade deal with no alignment.</p> \n  <p>Here is the video Farage is referring to.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1193562889484951552\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The great new deal we've done with our European friends takes us out of the EU in January.

I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby.</p> \n  <p>It was only a matter of time before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance on nuclear weapons became an election issue, and this morning it has happened. <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, gave a series of interviews this morning and, given that it is Armistice Day and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/conservatives-and-labour-unveil-plans-to-help-military-members\">both main parties have been announcing policies relating to the armed forces</a>, it was not surprising that Thornberry was asked about defence policy, and in particular nuclear weapons.</p> \n  <p>In interviews on Good Morning Britain and the Today programme, Thornberry was asked if Jeremy Corbyn would ever authorise the use of nuclear weapons. Soon after being elected Labour leader in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/30/corbyn-i-would-never-use-nuclear-weapons-if-i-was-pm\">Corbyn said categorically that he would never authorise the use of nuclear weapons</a>. But, as a party, Labour supports the nuclear deterrent, and the multi-billion pound spending programme to renew the Trident nuclear weapons programme, and during the 2017 election campaign <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/corbyn-nuclear-weapons-heckled-bbc-question-time-leaders-special-video-a7770446.html\">Corbyn struggled during a TV debate</a> when asked if he would be willing to use the missiles Labour would be spending so much money on.</p> \n  <p>Thornberry made three points in response to these questions.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She refused to say whether or not Corbyn would be willing to use nuclear weapons.</strong> She told Today:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Jeremy would do anything to protect our country and whether or not we use nuclear weapons is not something I think that we should be talking about in advance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And she told Good Morning Britain.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The use of a nuclear weapon is a decision on a level that no politician anywhere has to make. It is completely out on its own. And no one in the end knows how they would use it, whether they would use it, because it is, it has such extraordinary force and millions of people can be killed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She claimed that previous prime ministers had refused to say whether or not they would use nuclear weapons.</strong> She told Good Morning Britain:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No leader has said one way or the other until very recently whether they were prepared to use the nuclear weapon or not.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And she told the Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the reasons that Margaret Thatcher would not answer that question is because she said in order to protect ourselves we have to be clear that we will do whatever we can to protect ourselves and we are not prepared to say one way or the other in what circumstances we would use nuclear weapons.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On this point, Thornberry is wrong. Previous prime ministers have routinely said that, in extremis, they would be willing to use a nuclear weapon. The deterrent only has deterrent value if people think it might be used. What is true, though, is that previous prime ministers have not discussed the exact circumstances in which it would or would not be used.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Thornberry claimed any Labour decision over the use of nuclear weapons might not just be taken by Corbyn on his own. </strong>She told Good Morning Britain:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t necessarily believe that it will be a decision that will be made by one individual. I suspect that the way that Jeremy makes decisions is that he takes advice and that we work collectively. I am not prepared to go into whether we would use nuclear weapons or not, whether we would make a decision collectively to use nuclear weapons or not, in what circumstances. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is also questionable. Although prime ministers consult on almost all decisions, ultimately the final say with decisions about war rest with the PM.</p> \n  <p>In response to her interviews, the Conservatives are urging Labour to clarify its position. In a statement issued by CCHQ, the defence minister <strong>Johnny Mercer</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important that Labour urgently clarifies their position on whether or not they would actually be prepared to use our nuclear deterrent if needed. They should start by telling us who exactly will sit on this committee that would consider whether or not to authorise a nuclear strike or not in the face of a foreign threat?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although there is an inherent contradiction in Labour\u2019s policy \u2013 no one who knows anything about Corbyn believes for a moment he would ever authorise a nuclear strike, regardless of what the party\u2019s official position is \u2013 it is worth pointing out that there are good reasons to question whether any PM would, in extremis, authorise a nuclear attack. Three years ago the BBC filmed <a href=\"https://www.newcoldwar.org/making-sense-of-the-bbcs-documentary-film-world-war-three-inside-the-war-room/\">a simulated war gaming exercise</a>, which involved former top military figures and government officials deciding how to respond to a Russian invasion of Latvia. The exercise ended with Russia launching a nuclear attack against the west. To the apparent surprise of the film-makers, the committee decided not to retaliate with a nuclear attack against Russia, on the grounds that the consequences would be just too awful.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T10:28:18.664Z\">at 10.28am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc921208f0867dcebfd28f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T08:51:48.993Z\">8.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Later, on the Today programme, Thornberry said service personnel would be paid a \u201cproper wage\u201d through the lifting of the public sector pay cap under Labour\u2019s proposals.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We ask them to make the ultimate sacrifice and the least we can do is to give them some decent pay.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and welcome to the election live blog. </p> \n  <p>The fifth day of the campaign might be Armistice Day but there is no prospect of a ceasefire between the parties. The unusual instance of Remembrance Day falling in an election campaign has left the big players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/conservatives-and-labour-unveil-plans-to-help-military-members\">unable to resist promoting policies for veterans</a>. The Tories are planning to offer more childcare help for families in the military, a railcard for veterans and will also repeat previous pledges to prevent \u201cvexatious\u201d legal claims such as those faced by ex-soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Labour has said it will improve pay and conditions for service personnel by scrapping the public sector pay cap, better housing and improved access to schools for children of force members.</p> \n  <p>Another major focus will be immigration. Our political editor, Heather Stewart, reports that Labour activists are pushing Jeremy Corbyn to incorporate radical changes to migration policy in the party\u2019s manifesto. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/labour-activists-call-on-jeremy-corbyn-to-push-radical-stance-on-migration\">Senior leaders are meeting today to thrash out the party\u2019s definitive stance</a> with many calling for them to adopt the more open border policy backed by members at party conference in September. The Tories are hoping to portray Labour as soft on immigration and believe that a more liberal policy could cost Corbyn votes in northern and Midlands heartland seats.<br></p> \n  <p>One Midlands seat that will be a bit different this time is Leicester East, where Keith Vaz\u2019s name will not be on the ballot paper for the first time in 32 years. The former minister, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/labour-to-debate-whether-keith-vaz-will-stand-as-mp-at-election\">facing suspension from the Commons for</a> \u201cexpressing willingness\u201d to purchase cocaine for sex workers, announced last night that he is standing down. Vaz, who is 62, said it had been \u201can honour and a privilege to serve my constituency\u201d, while Corbyn said Vaz had led the way for black and Asian Labour MPs.</p> \n  <p>No campaign day would be complete without a spending row and this one will be no exception with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/labour-derides-12tn-tory-costing-claims-as-work-of-fiction-corbyn\">Labour hitting back at Tory claims that its policies would cost \u00a31.2tn</a>. Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s election coordinator, described the claims as \u201cabsolute work of fiction by the Conservatives\u201d. Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/sajid-javid-five-year-labour-spend-plan-near-12tn\">economic correspodent, Richard Partington, has interrogated the Tory claims</a> and concludes that they have added in the cost of Labour policies over a five-year period to inflate the headline number.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for joining us and enjoy day five. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-11T08:40:11.251Z\">at 8.40am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a rundown of the main events to have occurred since our last summary: The prime minister has decided to hold a Cobra meeting to discuss the flooding that his large parts of the Midlands and northern England. That came after Jeremy Corbyn urged him to take such action, suggesting the crisis would have been taken more seriously had it occurred in the south east. A former ally of Boris Johnson launched a stinging attack on the prime minister and the opposition leader. Nick Boles said the UK faced a \u201cappalling choice\u201d between the leaders of the two main parties at next month\u2019s election. For a comprehensive summary of the day\u2019s earlier news. See this excellent post from my colleague, Andrew Sparrow. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Kate Proctor, Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart have our main story: The Lib Dems have \u201cimmediately opened disciplinary investigations\u201d into tweets that appear to have been posted by Kevin McNamara, the party\u2019s candidate for Thurrock. A serious of screenshots purporting to show tweets from his account appeared on social media this evening. The account has now been locked and tweets are no longer visible to people not following it. Nigel Farage is facing calls from Brexit supporters to stand down further candidates to help Boris Johnson after he made a dramatic public U-turn by agreeing to withdraw his party from all Conservative-held seats, my colleagues Kate Proctor, Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart write. The Brexit party leader claimed he had changed his mind about fielding candidates in 317 seats held by the Tories after Johnson released a video pledging to take Britain out of the EU by 2020 and to pursue a Canada-style trade deal. The abrupt nature of Farage\u2019s reversal prompted claims from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP that he and Johnson had struck a secret pact in favour of a hard Brexit, which both sides denied. Farage admitted he had been offered a peerage by the Tories as recently as last Friday but claimed he had turned this down. Senior Tories are now pressing behind the scenes for Farage to make further concessions and stand back in Labour-held target seats, after Farage conceded that the presence of his party in those contests could lead to a hung parliament and a second referendum. Farage claimed he now had more \u201coptimism\u201d about Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal after the prime minister\u2019s clarifications, having previously condemned it as a \u201csellout\u201d and not a real Brexit. I have got no great love for the Conservative party at all, but I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance \u2026 and stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats \u2013 they even want to revoke the result of the referendum \u2013 I think our action, our announcement today, prevents a second referendum from happening. A former aide to Boris Johnson is facing calls to stand down as an election candidate after Labour accused him of \u201cdisgusting racism\u201d over some of his writings that blame immigrants for bringing germs and HIV to the UK and accuse Muslims of having divided loyalties. Labour called on the prime minister to personally intervene to stop Anthony Browne from contesting the seat of South Cambridgeshire, saying his writings from 2002 and 2003 were \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cdespicable\u201d. In an article for the Spectator, Browne wrote: It is not through letting in terrorists that the government\u2019s policy of mass migration \u2013 especially from the third world \u2013 will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs. After the Cobra meeting was announced, a Labour spokesman said If these floods had happened in Surrey, this would have happened five days ago. The prime minister will chair a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the government\u2019s response to recent flooding, Downing Street has said. The emergency meeting will be held five days after the flooding hit large parts of northern England and the Midlands. We reported earlier that the Labour leader was urging him to take such action and suggested that, had the flooding occurred in south-eastern England, it\u2019s likely it would have been declared a national emergency (see 6.37pm). The former Conservative MP, Nick Boles, has torn into both his own ex-colleagues and the Labour leadership this evening. Formerly a close ally of Boris Johnson, Boles reserves some of his harshest criticism for the prime minister. In an article for the Evening Standard, he writes: In years to come, it will be known as the Appalling Choice of 2019. It will be cited alongside classical mythology\u2019s Scylla and Charybdis \u2014 the one a six-headed monster and the other a whirlpool \u2014 spelling death and destruction for any passing ship. It will be recorded as the only election in modern times in which you wouldn\u2019t trust either of the prime ministerial candidates to mind your children for an hour, let alone run the country. In the blue corner, we have a compulsive liar who has betrayed every single person he has ever had any dealings with: every woman who has ever loved him, every member of his family, every friend, every colleague, every employee, every constituent. As a senior member of his cabinet once put it to me: \u2018You can always rely on Boris...to let you down\u2019. His bumbling braggadocio disguises an all-consuming ego utterly without conscience, empathy or restraint. In the red corner is a blinkered Pharisee, a man so convinced of his own rectitude that he sees no contradiction between his pious homilies about racism and equality and a lifetime of support for terrorists, murderers and racist thugs. Like all leaders of a totalitarian mindset, he is entirely uninterested in the lives of individual human beings. He cares only for classes and factions, and the struggle between abstract political forces. Boles adds that he would be voting Lib Dem at the upcoming election. Each weekday evening for the duration of the campaign, my colleague Andrew Sparrow will be putting together an election briefing. You can read today\u2019s here: Nigel Farage\u2019s unilateral announcement that he will engage in a one-way electoral pact with the Conservatives will be an undoubted relief to Boris Johnson, but the benefit may be more limited than it first appears. Headline polling data already indicated that the Brexit party was being successfully squeezed by the Tories\u2019 pro-Brexit strategy. Its polling average had slumped from 12% in the third week of October to its current 9%. A former Brexit party candidate is defying Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to step aside in Tory-held seats and will stand as an independent instead. Neil Greaves, from the Harlow constituency in Essex, criticised Farage\u2019s approach: Nigel has let Brexiteers down ... he should be standing up for the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit. I don\u2019t regard Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as Brexit. It\u2019s not even close. Farage has been totally outmanoeuvred and out-negotiated without Boris [Johnson] even having to say anything. He says Boris is going to come out on 20 December \u2013 really? You believe him? The constituency voted 68% to leave in the EU referendum but Robert Halfon, the Conservative candidate who won the seat with a majority of more than 7,000 in 2017, backed remain in the referendum. That led Greaves to claim that his pulling out of the race would mean there \u201cwon\u2019t be a leave option for Harlow\u201d. To do a blanket \u2018oh we\u2019re not going to stand in Tory seats\u2019 is silly, it\u2019s more nuanced than that. There\u2019s a big centre ground open and I thought we would take that but [Farage] has played a particularly bad hand since Boris became Tory leader \u2013 he allied himself too much to the Tories. His fellow former Brexit party candidate, Ruth Jolley, said she \u201crespected\u201d Farage\u2019s decision but was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the people of her South West Norfolk constituency would not be able to vote for a Brexit party candidate. For me, the Brexit party was about more than Brexit; it was a chance to change politics for good and shake up our institutions. The former civil servant, who now runs a pet care business, said she would continue to campaign for Brexit party candidates elsewhere but will not vote in the election. I couldn\u2019t vote for those who are standing in my constituency in all good conscience. I couldn\u2019t vote for Liz Truss (the local Conservative candidate and cabinet minister) because I do think the Tories have negotiated a terrible deal. Over at the Guardian\u2019s general election fact check desk, my colleague Hilary Osborne has had a look at Emily Thornberry\u2019s claim the UK\u2019s armed forces have \u201ceffectively had a pay cut over the last few years\u201d: The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has been seeking to portray the Tories as increasingly in thrall to Nigel Farage after the latter announced that his Brexit party will not stand candidates in Conservative-held seats. We reported earlier that Sturgeon had said that any form of Brexit that would be acceptable to Farage would be bad for Scotland (see 3.45pm). Here\u2019s a little more on those comments: The Brexit party\u2019s announcement today really does underline the fact that Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are joined at the hip and, frankly, any form of Brexit that is acceptable to Nigel Farage is going to be deeply damaging for Scotland. I suspect there are many traditional Tory party voters here in Scotland and elsewhere across the UK who will be appalled to learn that their party has effectively become the Brexit party. If you vote Tory, you get the Brexit party and its view of the world and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the vast majority of the people in Scotland want. We see a Tory party becoming ever more extreme and rightwing, and out of touch with the majority of people in Scotland. It really does underline the view that if you don\u2019t take Scotland\u2019s future into Scotland\u2019s hands at this election, then the danger is our future is imposed upon us by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit party, claimed today that he had killed off any prospect of a second referendum after he declared that his party would not stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in 2017. The exact impact of his decision is still a matter of debate, but it is almost certainly the most significant electoral boost the Tories have had in the campaign so far. In a speech in Hartlepool (full text here), Farage claimed that his decision meant a \u201cleave alliance\u201d was now in operation. He said: I have got no great love for the Conservative party at all. But I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance, by keeping him honest and holding him to account by getting people in, and by stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats who\u2019d sign us up to everything, wouldn\u2019t they, the United States of Europe, European army, you name it, I mean they even want to revoke the result of the referendum. No, I think our action, this announcement today prevents a second referendum from happening and that to me I think right now is the single most important thing in our country. So in a sense, we now have a leave alliance. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve done it unilaterally. We\u2019ve decided ourselves that we absolutely have to put country before party and take the fight to Labour. Boris Johnson has claimed that he did not call Farage to agree a leave alliance deal with him. But in his speech Farage claimed that he changed his mind, and decided not to stand candidates in Tory-held seats even though only 10 days ago he said Johnson would have to abandon his whole Brexit plan for this to happen, because of assurances made by Johnson in a video posted on Twitter yesterday afternoon. Farage said: It\u2019s been a difficult decision to make, but I have to say that last night, for the first time I saw something since that Brussels summit that actually was optimistic; because I saw Boris Johnson on a video saying: \u2018We will not extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020\u2019. And that, in many ways, a direct challenge to Mr Barnier [the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator] that would need a change to the political declaration before all of this gets ratified in parliament. Now you may well say to me: isn\u2019t this the same Boris Johnson who said he\u2019d die in a ditch rather than extend from 31 October? And yes, the issue of trust, the issue of delivery is a very real one and I\u2019ll come back to that perhaps in a few moments\u2019 time. But at least it was a clear, unequivocal statement from him, that we\u2019re not going on beyond the end of 2020. But much more significantly \u2013 and really quite unreported on so far today \u2013 he said something else that really did matter to me, hugely. He said we would negotiate a trade deal, a super-Canada-plus trade deal with no political alignment. Now, that is a huge change because ever since Mrs May\u2019s abject speech in Florence, we\u2019ve been aiming at a close and special partnership with the European Union. Johnson\u2019s \u201csuper Canada plus\u201d comment has not been reported today because this sort of trade deal has always been his aim, and there was nothing new in what he was saying yesterday in the video. But it did look as though it had been distributed to give Farage cover for the climbdown he announced today. At the moment Farage is still planning to run candidates in Labour-held seats, which could prevent the Tories from making gains in those constituencies. But given that Farage has now accepted that Johnson\u2019s deal is acceptable, and that a Johnson majority government would be preferable to a hung parliament, it is hard to see the logic of his stance. It remains to be seen if a further retreat is coming. Thursday is the deadline when candidates must decide whether they are or are not standing in constituencies. The opposition parties have said that Farage\u2019s decision confirms that the Conservative party is becoming the Brexit party. Labour (here), the SNP (here) and the Lib Dems (here) have all made this point. Jeremy Corbyn has urged Johnson to declare a national emergency and chair a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee, Cobra, in response to the flooding in South Yorkshire. Hillary Clinton has called Downing Street\u2019s suppression of a report into potential Russian infiltration of British politics \u201cdamaging, inexplicable and shaming\u201d. A Green party candidate has withdrawn in a second marginal seat targeted by Labour, prompting speculation that more Greens could step aside as part of an informal anti-Conservative alliance not sanctioned by the central party. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, has accused Corbyn of putting Marxist solidarity ahead of democracy after the Labour leader said Evo Morales had been forced to resign as Bolivia\u2019s president due to a military coup. A Labour government would introduce \u201cmanaged migration\u201d for EU nationals in the event Brexit happens, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has said as the party continues to debate what immigration policy to offer at the election. The Conservatives have challenged Labour to explain whether Corbyn would be willing to use nuclear weapons as a last resort after Thornberry refused to answer this question in an interview. Johnson\u2019s government appears to be preparing to nominate an EU commissioner, potentially breaching another Brexit promise after he failed to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline to leave on 31 October. Britain\u2019s economy avoided a recession in the third quarter after it expanded by 0.3% but the annual pace of growth was the slowest for nearly 10 years as Brexit uncertainty depressed business activity. Ireland has expressed concern over a Conservative party pledge to change the law to protect former soldiers in Northern Ireland from possible prosecution over deaths during the Troubles. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now writing the blog for the rest of the night. If the flooding that hit the Midlands and northern England at the end of last week had happened in the south-east, it\u2019s more likely it would have been declared a national emergency, the Labour leader has claimed. Jeremy Corbyn has urged the prime minister to hold a Cobra meeting and take personal charge of the government\u2019s response as he says his party\u2019s analysis suggests the Environment Agency has lost a fifth of its frontline staff under Tory-led governments. Here is the full text of his letter to Boris Johnson: Over the past few days, we have both visited those affected by the devastating floods across Yorkshire and the east Midlands. You\u2019ll know that hundreds of homes have been flooded and over a thousand properties have now been evacuated. Our hearts go out to those affected, including the friends and family of Annie Hall. With heavy rain expected in parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands, in areas that are already suffering from flooding, hundreds of further flood warnings are in place. Rightly, there will be hundreds of thousands of people across these regions who remain concerned about their families and livelihoods. With this in mind, I am writing to urge you to hold a Cobra meeting and take personal charge of the government\u2019s response to the devastating flooding we have seen over the past few days. In addition, we need full assurance from the government that every resource is being utilised to aid those that need it and protect against future potential floods. With dozens of flood warnings still in place, I have to disagree with your assessment from the weekend that this is not a \u2018national emergency\u2019. If this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the east Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared. Every year we don\u2019t act means higher flood waters, more homes ruined and more lives at risk due to climate change. The government also must ensure that the insurance industry fulfils its responsibilities. In addition, going forward the industry must continue to provide insurance at an affordable level to householders. I urge you again to hold a Cobra meeting to ensure all is being done to help the families affected. Patrick Maguire in the New Statesman argues that the Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory-held seats won\u2019t be welcomed by all Conservative candidates in those constituencies. Here is an extract. Although Farage believes his intervention will kneecap the Liberal Democrats, some of its candidates in the south are still cautiously optimistic. Max Wilkinson, the party\u2019s candidate in Cheltenham \u2013 a top target \u2013 offered a bullish response on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m disturbed to see that Cheltenham\u2019s Conservative candidate at the election, Alex Chalk, has won the backing of Nigel Farage this time round. Pretty shocking that a so-called \u2018moderate\u2019 could stand on a joint ticket with a rightwing extremist.\u201d Candidates like Wilkinson will now discover whether Farage or Johnson is a bigger electoral asset for the Liberal Democrats. \u201cThe Brexit party were taking votes from the Conservatives,\u201d says one Liberal Democrat attempting to dislodge a Tory incumbent. \u201cBut this alliance will alienate so many Tory moderates, as Johnson\u2019s leadership already has in large numbers. The big question is whether we\u2019ve reached the floor already, whether there are more teetering on the brink, or whether this stops the very small bleed away of voters who are moderate but will consider voting Tory to get it over with.\u201d From the Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has accused Sajid Javid, the chancellor, of trying to avoid a TV debate with him, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Here is one baby that Boris Johnson probably won\u2019t be getting his hands on. (See 4.53pm.) This is from Ellie Reeves, who is seeing re-election as Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge. The SNP has issued a statement about what it describes as the legal action being taken by \u201cone of the smaller parties\u201d (ie, the Lib Dems - see 4.49pm). It is from Kirsten Oswald, the SNP\u2019s business convenor and its candidate in East Renrewshire. It is utterly outrageous for any broadcaster to include a minor party like the Liberal Democrats and to exclude the SNP \u2013 who secured nearly three times as many seats at the last election, and whose current support suggests will continue to be the third-largest party in Westminster. We have made that clear to Sky, whose proposed debate is a democratic disgrace, and to ITV \u2013 and we are considering our next steps. In all of this, one thing that is clear, is the utter hypocrisy of the Lib Dems, who are happy to see a larger female-led party of remain excluded in their own self-interest as part of a typical Westminster stitch-up. A Green party candidate has withdrawn in a second marginal seat targeted by Labour, prompting speculation that more Greens could step aside as part of an informal anti-Conservative alliance not sanctioned by the central party, my colleague Peter Walker reports. My colleague Marina Hyde has written up the Nigel Farage press conference earlier. Here is an extract. \u201cSo in a sense,\u201d he concluded, gearing up for a vintage Farage reverse ferret, \u201cwe now HAVE a leave alliance. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve done it unilaterally.\u201d Funny sort of alliance. Maybe spend some of the two pound fifties on a dictionary. As for what had prompted this change of heart, was it a high-level personal meeting with Boris Johnson? Written undertakings? Formal assurances? None of these, actually. \u201cLast night I saw Boris Johnson on a video,\u201d conceded Farage, \u201csaying we won\u2019t extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020\u201d. Aha. The ultimate guarantee \u2013 a Boris Johnson tweet. If this was supposed to be a rally, you\u2019d have to call it Triumph of the Willy. Here was a guy who\u2019d spent 10 days bullishly making Johnson an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse. And yet, it seems the PM does not negotiate with Faragists. The Brexit party leader is one of those hapless movie villains who tells a millionaire he\u2019s kidnapped his wife, and the millionaire goes \u2013 great, you can keep her. And here is her article in full. It would not be a modern general election without a dispute about leaders\u2019 debates, and the current disagreement has moved to its next stage with the Liberal Democrats filing high court proceedings against the decision to exclude Jo Swinson from ITV\u2019s event. The application for judicial review over ITV\u2019s move to invite only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to take part in the debate on 19 November was filed to the high court on Monday afternoon. Speaking outside the court the Lib Dem president, Sal Brinton said: The TV debates offer the only chance for people to see how leaders compare to each other directly, in a neutral, equal and balanced format. For many people this is the moment they decide how they will vote. So it is vital for our democracy to have both sides of the Brexit debate represented at the top table of the leaders\u2019 debates. The party has been hugely critical of the decision to exclude Swinson. She will take part in a wider Sky News event on 28 November, though it is not yet clear which other leaders will participate. The BBC is also holding a Johnson-Corbyn debate, as well as other programmes with a wider cast list. Judicial review is a somewhat broad legal tactic, seeking a judge to examine whether a decision made by a public body was legal or not. Time could be against the Lib Dems, as the court needs to first decide if judicial review can take place, and then consider the specific issue. Both ITV and the BBC have defended their formats, saying Johnson and Corbyn lead the parties which took, between them, 82% of the votes in the 2017 election. This is from the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain. The BBC has apologised for mistakenly showing old footage of Boris Johnson laying a wreath on BBC Breakfast this morning, instead of footage from yesterday, when Johnson put his wreath down the wrong way round. The error has prompted claims on social media that this was evidence of pro-Tory bias. But the truth was more straightforward, according to Richard Frediani, executive editor of BBC Breakfast. Nigel Farage has claimed he was offered a peerage at the end of last week, the Mirror\u2019s Ben Glaze reports. Farage told the Mirror that he turned down the offer (he did not say who made it) and that he would not accept a knighthood or a peerage. Here is more from the politics academic Matthew Goodwin on the impact of the Brexit party standing aside in Tory-held seats. Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Tory seats is not as clear cut in Scotland as it may seem, since it could damage Tory campaigns to unseat the Scottish National party in at least one key target seat. A Brexit party spokesman has confirmed they will still stand candidates in SNP seats, and that could prove significant in Perth and North Perthshire, the Scottish Tories\u2019 top target seat. The Tories are fighting on two fronts: pledging to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d but also leveraging opposition to a second independence referendum. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart holds a wafer-thin, 21-vote (0.04%) majority over the Tories in Perth and North Perthshire. In the 2015 general election an arch-Brexiter standing for Ukip, John Miles, took 1,110 votes there. Wishart\u2019s chances of holding the seat were boosted when the pro-independence Scottish Green party decided at the weekend not to stand a candidate against him, decreasing direct competition for SNP votes. (See 1.57pm.) There is strong pro-Brexit sentiment in the area. The Brexit party came third in the council area of Perth &amp; Kinross in the 2019 European parliament elections, with 8,088 votes, and Ukip took another 770. Those pro-Brexit votes accounted for 17.5% of all those cast in the area. The Brexit party\u2019s candidate for Perth and North Perthshire, Stuart Powell, is campaigning with the pledge: \u201cWe are real people doing ordinary jobs and intend to serve rather than rule\u201d. While he was campaigning this morning, Boris Johnson was also asked if immigration would increase or decrease under Tory policies. He refused to say, replying: I do think immigration can place really unacceptable pressures on public services. Johnson said he was \u201cin favour of immigration as a whole\u201d as it allows \u201cpeople of talent\u201d to come to the UK. When pressed on whether his policies would result in a decrease in immigration numbers, Johnson replied: We will have a system that reflects the needs of the UK economy and a system that is finally subject to proper democratic control. On Saturday the Home Office minister Victoria Atkins was also unable to answer this question. Boris Johnson repeated his claim that he had given up alcohol \u201cuntil Brexit is done\u201d when he posed for a photograph at a pub in a Wolverhampton. He then added: \u201cI\u2019ll wet my whistle\u201d, before taking a sip from a pint. The SNP, like the Lib Dems, are also saying the Conservative party has now become the Brexit party. (See 3.11pm.) These are from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, claims Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Tory-won seats implies the government is planning a no-deal Brexit. In a statement, he said: That Nigel Farage is willing to endorse Boris Johnson is proof that they are planning to deliver a disastrous no deal. The fact that he assumes there will be no extension at the end of the next phase is evidence enough that a crash-out Brexit is an inevitability in the eyes of the Brexiteers. Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage don\u2019t care about Wales. They want to rip us out of the EU in a disastrous crash-out Brexit which would decimate our agriculture and manufacturing sectors and devastate our economy. From my colleague Martin Belam The Tories have got a candidate in Hartlepool, my colleague Josh Halliday reports, correcting an earlier claim they didn\u2019t have one. (See 2.34pm.) Ireland has expressed concern over a Conservative party pledge to change the law to protect former soldiers in Northern Ireland from possible prosecution over deaths during the Troubles. The Tories have promised to end what they describe as \u201cunfair trials\u201d of soldiers accused of unlawful killings in Northern Ireland by amending the Human Rights Act to exclude any cases dating from before the act came into force in 2000. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, posted a tweet this morning saying this was \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and prominent Brexiter, told the BBC\u2019s World at One that Nigel Farage\u2019s announcement was a \u201cgood thing\u201d. He said: I would hope that this is the start of the Brexit party recognising that even standing across the board in [Labour-held] seats will also end up helping those Labour incumbents who are sitting there worrying at the moment about the fact that they have a very, very large leave vote, and if that is split, then that means they might just sneak through, which could be the difference between us winning a majority and only becoming the majority party and of course winning a majority is critical if you want to deliver Brexit and Boris to stay. Jeremy Corbyn has described the Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory seats as a \u201cTrump alliance\u201d. He points out that this is exactly the sort of Boris Johnson/Nigel Farage pact that Donald Trump seemed to be proposing in his recent LBC interview with Farage. Last night Jeremy Corbyn posted this on Twitter in response to the news that Evo Morales has announced he will resign as president of Bolivia after the military called for him to step down and the police withdrew their support following weeks of unrest over disputed election results. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has accused Corbyn of putting \u201cMarxist solidarity\u201d ahead of his commitment to democracy. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said that Nigel Farage\u2019s decision not to stand Brexit party candidates in Tory seats means the Conservatives are now aligned with the Brexit party. (In truth, the Lib Dems have been making this sort of claim for some time.) And the Lib Dem candidate Sam Gyimah has put it like this on Twitter. This is a version of the Alex Salmond/Ed Miliband poster that the Conservatives used in the 2015 election campaign. It is a punchy image, although it misses the point Farage is the person today who has capitulated to Boris Johnson. Paul Sweeney, the Labour candidate in Glasgow North and a shadow Scotland Office minister, has said that no UK government could refuse another Scottish independence referendum if there is a pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament. But, speaking in George Square in Glasgow after a ceremony marking the Armistice in 1918, Sweeney said independence was not an issue for this election. He said: The reality is [independence] isn\u2019t an issue for this election. The reality is this is an issue for the Scottish parliament election in 2021. We\u2019ve been clear that if a mandate were to happen, then no government in the UK could stand against that, even the Tories have admitted that\u2019s the case. We\u2019re saying it\u2019s not an issue for this election. Let\u2019s focus on getting a Labour government into power that can invest in our public services. The key question for the Brexit party and the Conservatives is what is going to happen in the Labour-held leave-voting seats where they both fancy their chances. Will there be some sort of unofficial non-aggression pact, where they divide up targets between them? We don\u2019t know but my colleague Josh Halliday has just posted these about the contest in Hartlepool, the Labour-held seat where Richard Tice, the Brexit party chairman, is standing. UPDATE: Actually, there is a Tory candidate. Josh subsequently posted this. YouGov, the polling company, has sent out an analysis of the Nigel Farage decision saying it is unlikely to be a \u201cgame-changing moment\u201d for the election. This is from its political research manager, Chris Curtis. Farage\u2019s decision to stand aside in current Conservative-held seats and not in Labour-held seats that the Tories will be looking to gain will likely make very little difference. There are three caveats to this. Firstly, whilst there has been a swing towards the Tories in their battle against Labour, the increase in Lib Dem and SNP vote share means that there is likely to be a swing against them in seats where they are battling against those parties. However, there are not as many of these seats as there are Labour/Conservative marginals, and most of them will be the kind of places where the Brexit party wouldn\u2019t have won many votes anyway, such as in Scotland or more remain-leaning seats in the south. Secondly, it does help mitigate against the effects of a surge in support for Labour during this campaign. If the Labour vote share does start to recover, in the same way it did in 2017, this will make it more difficult for the party to start gaining seats from the Tories. However, on current polling it will take quite a turnaround of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s fortunes in order to reach this point. Finally, whilst the practical effect might be quite small, we don\u2019t know what effect Farage\u2019s message might have on the broader perceptions of the parties. It could be that even in seats where the Brexit party are standing, voters that might otherwise have supported the party now feel more comfortable voting Conservative after Farage\u2019s comments. However, given the Brexit party was already trending downwards in the polls, it looked like this was happening already. So, despite today\u2019s drama, this is unlikely to be a game-changing moment. These are from my colleague Rajeev Syal, who has been in the high court this morning. I\u2019ve been back on the Lib Dems\u2019 electric-powered battle bus, and for once the party was not talking about Brexit. Sam Gyimah, the recently-defected former Tory MP who now speaks on business matters for the Lib Dems, was taken all the way from Westminster to Marylebone Road \u2013 slightly over two miles \u2013 to talk about the slightly awkwardly-named \u201cskills wallet\u201d plan, a commitment to give all adults \u00a310,000 to spend on training over various points in their lives. He visited a company that provides tech-based apprenticeships, called WhiteHat. It was co-founded by none other than Euan Blair, eldest son of the former Labour PM, but he is currently on paternity leave and so missed any awkward questions about who he might vote for. Gyimah, a former universities minister, happily chatted to staff and apprentices about all sorts of subjects, not least tuition fees, something of a toxic subject for the Lib Dems after they broke their 2010 manifesto pledge to support higher fees in the coalition government. Gyimah would not say what Lib Dem policy would be ahead of the party\u2019s manifesto, but spoke strongly against ending fees, saying this ends up rationing access to higher education. This brought no murmurs of dissent from the apprentices. Perhaps they were being polite, or having decided against university it was less of an issue. But it could also be that as younger voters, the events of 2010 feel like ancient history. The Lib Dems will certainly hope so. Gyimah has abandoned the East Surrey seat he represented since 2010 to try his luck in Kensington. Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad took this from the Conservatives in 2017, with the Lib Dems a distant third. Speaking to me on the bus before the visit, Gyimah said he hoped to do well in a strongly pro-remain area, and to capitalise on Dent Coad\u2019s occasionally divisive reputation: My pitch is that Kensington can do better than a hard Brexiteer or a class warrior ... I knock on doors and I talk about views I passionately believe in, and there are a lot of voters who are welcoming of those view. To be honest, it would be more difficult the other way if I was holding my views as a Conservative, in a Conservative seat. Will he do it? Some polls have Gyimah currently second behind the Tories, but given the volatility of the election it is not impossible he could win. The Scottish Greens have decided not to stand candidates in two hyper-marginal seats being defended by the Scottish National party, boosting the SNP\u2019s hopes of holding them. The pro-independence Scottish Green party (SGP) said its local branches had opted not to contest North East Fife, won by the SNP by just two votes in 2017, and Perth &amp; North Perthshire, held by the SNP with a 21-vote margin in 2017, for \u201cvarious reasons\u201d. The SNP is under intense pressure in both seats, with the Liberal Democrats determined to regain North East Fife from Stephen Gethins, the SNP\u2019s international affairs spokesman, and the Scottish Tories investing heavily in defeating Pete Wishart in Perth and North Perthshire. The Tories have repeatedly tried to unseat Wishart, who was furious when he found the SGP had a candidate to stand against him. He accused them of helping the Tories by diluting the pro-independence vote, leading to angry attacks on Green politicians on social media. On Sunday, hours after the local SGP branch decided not to contest his seat, Wishart tweeted a recommendation by one tactical voting website, Progressive Alliance, to back him. The SGP fielded a candidate in the 2015 election, taking 1,146 votes, and there is little love lost between the two parties. The Scottish Greens are highly critical of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s defence of North Sea oil and say her record on the climate crisis is much weaker than her rhetoric. An SGP denied this was an organised deal to protect pro-independence seats: they are likely to attack Wishart\u2019s record of voting for the oil industry. A SGP spokesman said: Pete Wishart describing this as standing aside is a bit cute. They\u2019ve not stood aside for him. A large part of it is about concentrating our resources on 2021 [the Scottish parliament elections]; that\u2019s the main reason why most of our branches have opted not to stand [this time]. The Scottish Greens won 1,387 votes in North East Fife in 2015, when Gethins first took the seat from the Liberal Democrats when Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader retired after nearly 30 years as the local MP. Despite backing out in that seat, they are contesting another SNP marginal nearby, of Dunfermline and West Fife. They took 1,196 votes there in 2015; the SNP held the seat by 844 votes in 2017. In an interview on the World at One Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s lead elections expert and the person who oversees the national exit poll, said that although Nigel Farage\u2019s decision would not make a big difference, it would probably wipe out the advantage that the Lib Dems gained from the remain alliance pact announced last week. The Brexit party is standing down in seats the Tories held in 2017. But, given the state of the opinion polls (which generally show the Tories ahead of Labour by around 10 points - a much larger margin than on election night in 2017), the Conservatives would currently expect to hold most of these anyway, Curtice said. He said there were two exceptions to this. In Scotland the Tories are at risk of losing seats to the SNP, he said. But he said the Brexit party was weak in Scotland, so \u201cthis is probably not going to help the Tories very much in that,\u201d Curtice said. The main impact would be in seats where the Tories faced a strong Lib Dem challenge, Curtice said. It is here perhaps that the decision of the Brexit party to stand down might at the margin help the Conservatives because some of these seats, though by no means all of them, are ones where there was quite a substantial leave vote last time - places like North Cornwall and North Devon ... Put it like this; perhaps last week, by their own alliance, the remain alliance, the Liberal Democrats might have helped themselves to pick up another half dozen seats. Those seats may have gone as a result of today\u2019s decision. Curtice said in Labour-held seats, where the Brexit party still intends to stand, the Farage decision would not make much difference. But he included this qualifier: Unless, of course, that by standing down in so many seats the credibility of the Brexit party, which already seems to have seeped away quite considerably ... it may just simply mean that, even though the Brexit party stands, that the Brexit party loses some of its voters, and it helps the Tories that way. Summing up the overall impact, Curtice said: We perhaps should not exaggerate how important this is. It is the Liberal Democrat/Conservative contests where the Tories might be helped out. But in the crucial Conservative/Labour ones, so far at least, Mr Farage is not offering the Conservatives any direct help. Nigel Farage\u2019s announcement has lifted sterling on the foreign exchange markets. The pound has hit a six-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.168. Sterling is also up a cent against the US dollar at $1.288. City traders are calculating that a hung parliament is now less likely - although the Brexit party will still be competing in Conservative target seats. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: It\u2019s a massive moment for the campaign and gives the Tories a clear run at Downing Street. But it will not make it any easier to hoover up seats from opposition parties \u2013 the risk of the Brexit party sucking in leaver votes in areas being targeted by the Tories remains. For Labour and in particular the Lib Dems in the south of England, it\u2019s going to make life very hard to dislodge incumbent Tories. And here is an essay question from another politics professor, Chris Hanretty. This is from Will Tanner, the former No 10 aide who now runs the Conservative thinktank Onward. These are from Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor specialising in the rise of Brexit party-style national populist parties. Boris Johnson has welcomed the Brexit party\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory seats. Here is my colleague Kate Proctor\u2019s full story about Nigel Farage\u2019s decision. Here is some more comment on Nigel Farage\u2019s decision from journalists. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From my colleague Owen Jones From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker From my colleague Peter Walker From the Observer\u2019s Nick Cohen From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From Isabel Oakeshott From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From my colleague Dan Milmo From the Times\u2019 Daniel Finkelstein From Bloomberg This is undoubtedly the best news that Boris Johnson has had during the election campaign so far. It doesn\u2019t mean that the result of the election is now a foregone conclusion, and it does not mean that a hung parliament is now impossible, as Nigel Farage claimed, but the result of an election in which the Brexit party is not standing in Tory seats will probably not be the same as an election in which it was splitting the Brexit vote in those constituencies. Only 10 days ago, when Farage announced that he would be standing candidates in around 600 seats in Britain, he was claiming that his tactic might harm Labour more than the Conservatives. At the time, election experts said he was wrong and that Tory seats were most at risk. Today Farage has admitted they were right, and he was wrong. But how much difference will this make in practice? It it hard to say, but two points are worth stressing. First, Farage is making this announcement because his poll ratings have been falling. He is capitulating from a position of weakness, not a position of strength. The polls have not shifted a great deal in the past week, but one constant feature is that the Brexit party vote has been heading south. Perhaps he was not as big a threat to the Tories as people thought. Here are the figures from the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker. Second, the Brexit party still seems to be intent on standing candidates in Tory target seats - particularly the leave-leaning Labour seats in the north of England, where for a long time Farage has been saying his party could do well. In theory the Brexit party could still split the Brexit vote in these place, preventing Boris Johnson from making the gains he needs to win a majority. But it wouldn\u2019t be in Farage\u2019s interests to do this if he wants Johnson to have a majority, and so it seems more likely that, in reality, the Tories and the Brexit party will operate unofficial non-aggression pacts in these places, allowing the best placed party to challenge Labour. That would be what you would expect from a \u201cleave alliance\u201d, which is what he now says exists. (See 12.19pm.) Farage\u2019s climbdown is considerable. Only 10 days ago he was saying that Johnson would have to abandon his Brexit plan wholesale for the Brexit party to give up its plan to stand 600 candidates in Britain. Since then, Johnson has said nothing that amounts to any form of concession, and the points the PM has been making about wanting to break free of EU regulation are ones he has always been making. And, as Farage himself acknowledged, the promise not to extend the transition beyond the end of 2020 is effectively worthless in the light of what happened to Johnson\u2019s \u201cdie in the ditch\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by 31 October. The only face-saving offer from the PM was the fact that he posted a video last night making these points, effectively offering Farage a ladder down which he could climb. (See 12.13pm.) There is already speculation that Farage came under pressure to concede from Johnson\u2019s ally, Donald Trump. This is from the Labour MP David Lammy. Farage\u2019s announcement may also prompt the BBC and other broadcasters to reconsider how they cover the Brexit party during the campaign. The BBC had invited him to a seven-party debate, and to a Question Time special. And all broadcasters have been covering the party on the assumption it is a GB-wide party, fighting all seats. In the light of today\u2019s news, we may see less of Farage on TV than before. That could further suppress his vote. One final point. Until relatively recently it was assumed that if the Tories tried to fight an election without having delivered Brexit, they would get smashed by the Brexit party. Almost all media commentators thought this, but so did Johnson himself, and probably Farage too. But that was another piece of conventional political wisdom (like the idea that Jeremy Corbyn could never win a Labour leadership contest) that turned out to be nonsense. You could cite this as proof that the Westminster commentariat are all rubbish (perhaps we are?), but it is probably better seen as evidence that voter behaviour is inherently unpredictable. Farage says he is taking this decision to prevent the risk of a second Brexit referendum. He says that what he is announcing is, in practice, a leave alliance. Farage says he weighed up Johnson\u2019s promises against the threat that the Brexit party standing could let the Lib Dems in. Farage says the Brexit party will not stand against the Tories in the 317 seats they won in 2017. But it will concentrate its efforts on seats held by the Labour party. And it will also challenge other remainer parties. Farage says last night he saw something that was optimistic. He says he saw a video of Boris Johnson saying he would not extend the Brexit transition. He says people might say Johnson broke his promise not to delay Brexit beyond 31 October. But at least this was an unequivocal statement. But Farage says Johnson also said he would negotiate a super Canada-plus trade deal with no alignment. Here is the video Farage is referring to. Farage says he tried to build a leave alliance. He tried to put out the idea that putting country before party was the right thing to do. But that came to naught, he says. Farage says he has had to consider what the consequences of this would be. He says he does not accept fielding 600 candidates would allow Jeremy Corbyn to win. But, he says, he does think that would have led to there being a hung parliament. And it would have led to a large number of Lib Dem gains. If the remainer parties could get to 320 seats, there would be a second referendum, he says. He says the UK would be offered a false choice between remain, and a form of remain. He says it has not been easy to decide what to do. Farage says what he was worried about most was that the UK would align itself to EU rules under Boris Johnson\u2019s plan. He says he thought this was not real Brexit. That is why the Brexit party decided to stand candidates in 600 seats. Farage says he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d when he heard about Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Unlike many people who praised it, he read it, and drew the conclusion it was not Brexit, he says. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is speaking now. He says he will reveal his party\u2019s election strategy in a moment. From the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam My colleague Kate Proctor is in Hartlepool for the Brexit party news conference, which is due to start shortly. She has just posted this on Twitter. And the Labour party has today committed to having a qualified, on-site counsellor in every secondary school in England, as part of a \u201chealthy young minds\u201d plan worth \u00a3845m a year. The party is also committing to setting up a network of mental health hubs to allow children more access to mental health support and ensuring every primary school has access to a qualified counsellor. In a news release about the plan, Jeremy Corbyn said: Almost every day someone talks to me about the terrible stresses a child or young person they know are going through. Mental health workers do incredible work but our society is fuelling mental illness on a huge scale and our young people are not getting the support they need. As a country, we have to start treating mental health as seriously as physical health. If we don\u2019t help our young people, we are not only failing them, but storing up problems for the future for a whole generation. The SNP has this morning called for at least \u00a31bn of North Sea revenues to be set aside to help areas heavily dependent on oil and gas make the switch to a greener economy. With the Office for Budget Responsibility having forecast the UK\u2019s oil and gas sector will raise \u00a38.5bn in revenue over the next five years, the SNP is calling for that cash to be ring-fenced in its entirety, to fund efforts to tackle the climate crisis. As the Press Association reports, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is saying that at least \u00a31bn should be set aside to support a \u201cjust transition\u201d for areas like the north-east, Falkirk and Shetland where the oil and gas industry is a major employer. In a statement issued this morning Sturgeon said: The SNP will never argue for the oil and gas industry to be shut down overnight. We must do everything in our power to tackle the climate crisis and Scotland has set the most ambitious legal targets in the world. But we also have to ensure that areas like the north-east of Scotland, where the economy has been built on the oil and gas industry, are supported to make the transition to new low or no carbon industries. SNP ministers have already put through legislation committing Scotland to achieving net zero emissions by 2045 - five years ahead of the UK target. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is in Hartlepool today, and at 12pm he will be holding a press conference. Perhaps he will announce he has been appointed by Boris Johnson as the UK\u2019s new European commission? (See 11.23am.) Probably not. But Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall says Farage will announce whether the party remains committed to standing candidates in almost all seats in Britain. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. And this is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has just come back from the No 10 lobby briefing. (During the election campaign the civil service wing of Downing Street briefs journalists just once a week, on Mondays.) Labour continues to face criticism over its decision to select Kate Osborne as its candidate in Jarrow despite the fact that two years ago she posted a picture on social media showing a gun being held to Theresa May\u2019s head. According to a party source, 37 members of the Jarrow CLP (constituency Labour party) have written to Jennie Formby, the party\u2019s general secretary, saying that even though Osborne has apologised, she should not be a candidate. Her selection \u201csends a message that threats of violence against women in politics can sometimes be accepted\u201d, the letter claims. Here is Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, responding to comments by Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, in her Today interview this morning that she personally supported military intervention in Kosovo to protect Albanians from Serbia. Thornberry was replying to a question about how Jeremy Corbyn didn\u2019t back this campaign, or other recent occasions when the UK government decided to deploy the armed forces. Adam Wagner, the barrister and legal blogger, has posted a useful Twitter feed about the Tory plan to amend the Human Rights Act to say it does not apply to events before 2000, in an attempt to limit prosecutions of armed forces veterans over historical cases. (See 7.38am and 8.05am.) It starts here. And here are two of his main points. And here is the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire on the same plan. Britain has narrowly avoided going into recession, according to the official growth figures out this morning. My colleague Graeme Wearden has all the details on his business live blog. From Boris Johnson\u2019s point of view, as an election development that\u2019s probably an item of news to file under the category \u201cit could have been worse\u201d. The claim in the Daily Express splash (they were taking a punt before the growth figures were published) that the economy is \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d is laughable. As Graeme reports in his blog, annual growth is at the lowest level since 2010. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also said that Labour would introduce \u201cmanaged migration\u201d for EU nationals in the event Brexit happens. Peter\u2019s full story is here. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. It was only a matter of time before Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance on nuclear weapons became an election issue, and this morning it has happened. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, gave a series of interviews this morning and, given that it is Armistice Day and that both main parties have been announcing policies relating to the armed forces, it was not surprising that Thornberry was asked about defence policy, and in particular nuclear weapons. In interviews on Good Morning Britain and the Today programme, Thornberry was asked if Jeremy Corbyn would ever authorise the use of nuclear weapons. Soon after being elected Labour leader in 2015, Corbyn said categorically that he would never authorise the use of nuclear weapons. But, as a party, Labour supports the nuclear deterrent, and the multi-billion pound spending programme to renew the Trident nuclear weapons programme, and during the 2017 election campaign Corbyn struggled during a TV debate when asked if he would be willing to use the missiles Labour would be spending so much money on. Thornberry made three points in response to these questions. She refused to say whether or not Corbyn would be willing to use nuclear weapons. She told Today: Jeremy would do anything to protect our country and whether or not we use nuclear weapons is not something I think that we should be talking about in advance. And she told Good Morning Britain. The use of a nuclear weapon is a decision on a level that no politician anywhere has to make. It is completely out on its own. And no one in the end knows how they would use it, whether they would use it, because it is, it has such extraordinary force and millions of people can be killed. She claimed that previous prime ministers had refused to say whether or not they would use nuclear weapons. She told Good Morning Britain: No leader has said one way or the other until very recently whether they were prepared to use the nuclear weapon or not. And she told the Today programme: One of the reasons that Margaret Thatcher would not answer that question is because she said in order to protect ourselves we have to be clear that we will do whatever we can to protect ourselves and we are not prepared to say one way or the other in what circumstances we would use nuclear weapons. On this point, Thornberry is wrong. Previous prime ministers have routinely said that, in extremis, they would be willing to use a nuclear weapon. The deterrent only has deterrent value if people think it might be used. What is true, though, is that previous prime ministers have not discussed the exact circumstances in which it would or would not be used. Thornberry claimed any Labour decision over the use of nuclear weapons might not just be taken by Corbyn on his own. She told Good Morning Britain: I don\u2019t necessarily believe that it will be a decision that will be made by one individual. I suspect that the way that Jeremy makes decisions is that he takes advice and that we work collectively. I am not prepared to go into whether we would use nuclear weapons or not, whether we would make a decision collectively to use nuclear weapons or not, in what circumstances. This is also questionable. Although prime ministers consult on almost all decisions, ultimately the final say with decisions about war rest with the PM. In response to her interviews, the Conservatives are urging Labour to clarify its position. In a statement issued by CCHQ, the defence minister Johnny Mercer said: It is important that Labour urgently clarifies their position on whether or not they would actually be prepared to use our nuclear deterrent if needed. They should start by telling us who exactly will sit on this committee that would consider whether or not to authorise a nuclear strike or not in the face of a foreign threat? Although there is an inherent contradiction in Labour\u2019s policy \u2013 no one who knows anything about Corbyn believes for a moment he would ever authorise a nuclear strike, regardless of what the party\u2019s official position is \u2013 it is worth pointing out that there are good reasons to question whether any PM would, in extremis, authorise a nuclear attack. Three years ago the BBC filmed a simulated war gaming exercise, which involved former top military figures and government officials deciding how to respond to a Russian invasion of Latvia. The exercise ended with Russia launching a nuclear attack against the west. To the apparent surprise of the film-makers, the committee decided not to retaliate with a nuclear attack against Russia, on the grounds that the consequences would be just too awful. Later, on the Today programme, Thornberry said service personnel would be paid a \u201cproper wage\u201d through the lifting of the public sector pay cap under Labour\u2019s proposals. We ask them to make the ultimate sacrifice and the least we can do is to give them some decent pay. They have effectively had a pay cut over the last few years and we think that is wrong. So much of the accommodation provided to the military is through the private sector and some of it is really terrible. Thornberry welcomed the Tories\u2019 pledge to stop \u201cvexatious and unfair actions\u201d against veterans, but pointed towards Theresa May\u2019s undelivered announcement of a similar policy. However, she said she did not believe the Human Rights Act had to be changed to address this, and said prosecuting authorities should instead not allow such claims to be heard in court. Questioned about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal support for the armed forces, Thornberry said: \u201cWhen you see Jeremy interacting with members of the armed services \u2026 you can see he is incredibly empathetic.\u201d However, she was unable to provide an example of when Corbyn backed UK military action abroad. I think that people from the military listening to the radio this morning, and those from their families and supporters, would want the same that we do, which is, if and when we use military action, we use military action in order to ensure we can stop genocides or unfair actions happening. In principle, Jeremy is not a pacifist, we are not pacifists. There will be times where we need to use military force. But when we use it we need to ensure it actually makes the situation better in the long term. Pointing to interventions in the Middle East and Libya, she said recent military campaigns had not led to what the UK had wanted. Nevertheless, she restated Labour\u2019s support for maintaining the Trident nuclear weapons system. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has been questioned over what would be on the ballot paper under Labour\u2019s plans to offer a second referendum. We want to be able to negotiate the sort of deal that we have been talking to the Europeans about for more than three years. It is being in a customs union, in a single market, in a close alignment of rules and regulations. We have talked to them uphill and down dale about what it is we would do and what our deal is. And we think that\u2019s the best way of looking after jobs in the economy. She was also asked whether she would use a nuclear weapon to defend the UK. Moving on to another election pledge, Wallace said serving personnel would be provided with free wraparound care for their four- to 11-year-old children. The \u00a3165m scheme to help service people \u201cwith their pressures\u201d would be introduced alongside a veterans\u2019 railcard and a new help-to-buy scheme under a future Tory government. \u201cWe\u2019re going to invest in the most important equipment of our armed forces if we win this election and that is our servicemen and women,\u201d he said. There should be a 10-year limit on the prosecution of soldiers unless \u201ccompelling new evidence\u201d emerges, Wallace said. But he stressed the UK would not be leaving the European court of human rights. Asked what exactly would change, Wallace said: Firstly in events that have happened outside the jurisdiction of the [European court of human rights], such as Afghanistan and Iraq, the government believes there should be a statute of limitations of at least 10 years unless compelling new evidence comes forward to make sure that we can\u2019t have lawyers \u2026 going out shopping round Iraq and Afghanistan looking for victims. Asked whether it would apply to everyone who might be involved in these inquests, including paramilitaries, terrorists and soldiers, Wallace said it would apply for all. If you want to make a claim that an already investigated crime or already inquest event has taken place, and in some of these inquests we\u2019re into the third or fourth inquest of the same event, if one of these has already taken place and you want to go back and effectively in some areas abuse our legal system with new evidence without much specifics, then actually you need to go direct to the European court in the Hague. Asked how this is not an \u201camnesty for terrorists\u201d, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not an amnesty. Everyone will still be able to avail themselves of the European court of human rights in the Hague. But what they won\u2019t be able to avail themselves of the right, is continually going back to our courts in the UK.\u201d Questioned over his previous remarks in the House of Commons, when he said \u201cI don\u2019t support amnesty for people who went out and killed many of these young men and women who went out to defend us. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a solution\u201d, he replied: I don\u2019t. This is about people who have already had trials, already been prosecuted, already had inquests \u2026 People have been tried, under inquest found not to have been at fault, then suddenly along comes a claim of new evidence. Very rarely does it see much test before it falls over and time and time again our service personnel are reinvestigated. We\u2019re not leaving the European convention on human rights, what we\u2019re doing is changing the route to that and we\u2019re saying that our courts are not there to be abused. There are inquests going on at the moment to things that have gone on in the 1970s that have already been two or three inquests. Questioned over the failure of previous defence secretary\u2019s to promise to deliver the proposal, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to finish this.\u201d Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has said the Conservatives\u2019 election pledge to protect veterans from prosecution is not an \u201camnesty\u201d. He said the Tories\u2019 pledge to change the law would protect veterans from \u201cvexatious\u201d legal action and would take up the defence select committee\u2019s recent recommendations on limiting prosecutions of soldiers. Wallace told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that conflicts between different pieces of international law have meant that lawyers defending people representing \u201cterrorists killed in the act of terror\u201d have led to \u201ccontinued, repeated\u201d inquests. How do we make sure that soldiers are not above the law but that vexatious claims don\u2019t trigger continued investigations time and time again into the same people? That is unfair to our soldiers and people who\u2019ve gone out to defend us, whether that\u2019s in Iraq, Afghanistan or Northern Ireland. Asked on whether the law would apply retroactively, Wallace noted the independence of the judiciary and said that the changes would apply only to future prosecutions. This isn\u2019t an amnesty, because if people haven\u2019t been investigated and they haven\u2019t had an inquest, then of course they won\u2019t be able to avail themselves of that. This is about repeated and vexatious claims. This is about people who have already had trials, have already been prosecuted, already had inquests. The Conservatives want to end unfair trials of veterans where no new evidence has been produced and the accusations have been questioned exhaustively in court by amending the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to incidents \u2013 including deaths during the Troubles \u2013 which took place before the law came into force in 2000. In July, the House of Commons defence select committee said a 10-year \u201cqualified statute of limitations\u201d should be introduced to protect veterans and serving armed forces personnel from reinvestigation for alleged crimes. It also called on the government to consider amending the Human Rights Act to provide a presumption against prosecution for historical offences. The report, Drawing a Line: Protecting Veterans By a Statute of Limitations, criticised the government for breaking a promise to safeguard veterans of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles from the \u201cspectre\u201d of repeated investigations of events that occurred decades ago. And it welcomed previous Ministry of Defence (MoD) proposals to opt out from the European convention on human rights during future conflicts. However, it points out that under MoD plans those who served in Northern Ireland and those who served abroad would be subject to different legislative regimes. The MoD and Northern Ireland Office have been in dispute over such reforms. However, Sinn F\u00e9in has previously raised fears over the amnesty proposal. One of the party\u2019s MPs, Francie Molloy, said that any attempt to create a hierarchy \u201cby protecting perpetrators of murders and other serious crime committed by British state forces are totally unacceptable\u201d. News that British Steel may be about to be bought by a Chinese conglomerate for \u00a370m could spark discussion about Britain\u2019s industrial policy on the campaign trail. A deal with Jingye Group could go through in the next couple of days according to our reporter Rob Davies, who has seen an email sent to employees about the sale. That is good news for the company\u2019s 4,000 employees, most of whom work in the marginal constituency of Scunthorpe. The seat is held by Labour\u2019s Nic Dakin with a majority of just over 3,000. The North Lincolnshire town is traditional Labour territory but it also voted heavily for Brexit \u2013 68.68% in favour of leaving compared with 31.32% for remain. Here\u2019s Rob\u2019s full story: On the Ulster campaign trail, the SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, says Northern Ireland should become a leader in renewable energy technology. Eastwood, who is standing for the constituency of Foyle, says better education of children to raise awareness of global warming is a moral imperative. We cannot force our children and their children to pay the price for our casual disregard for the body of science which says we are destroying our climate. We should also take the opportunity to become a world leader in renewable technology and climate rehabilitation. Keith Vaz announced last night he was standing down, a move that spares Jeremy Corbyn a tricky issue because the longstanding MP for Leicester East was facing suspension from the Commons for \u201cexpressing interest\u201d in buying cocaine for prostitutes. Vaz, who won the seat from the Tories in 1987, said in a statement that the people of Leicester \u201cwill always be in my heart\u201d. He continued: I have decided to retire after completing 32 years as the Member of Parliament for Leicester East. In that time I have won eight general elections. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve my constituency since I came to the city in 1985. I want to thank the people of Leicester East for their absolute loyalty and support. Corbyn paid generous tribute to his now ex-parliamentary colleague, saying: Keith Vaz was among the pioneering group of black and Asian Labour MPs elected in 1987. I was proud to support his selection and incredibly proud when he won, taking the seat from the Tories. Keith has made a substantial and significant contribution to public life, both as a constituency MP for the people of Leicester and for the Asian community across the country. He has helped to pave the way for more BAME people to become involved in politics. His work in parliament has been exemplary as Britain\u2019s first Asian-origin minister, chair of the home affairs select committee, a campaigner on diabetes issues and most recently trying to help the peace process in Yemen. You can read our full story on his decision here: Most of the papers lead with election-related stories, with the Times going on the row over Labour\u2019s spending plans and the Mail and the Telegraph leading on the Tories\u2019 rehashed policy to ban prosecutions of veterans. Here are some of the front pages: Boris Johnson will visit the Black Country today as he pushes his party\u2019s policies to help service personnel and veterans. Jeremy Corbyn will be with other senior members of the Labour leadership team to discuss migration policy. The Lib Dems are talking about education and will promise every adult in England \u00a310,000 to spend on education and training throughout their life. It seems likely that Nigel Farage will have something to say about both immigration and veterans when he launches the Brexit party\u2019s campaign in Hartlepool. Also present will be the party\u2019s chairman, Richard Tice, who is standing as MP for the Teesside town. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be on the stump in Aberdeen. Good morning. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and welcome to the election live blog. The fifth day of the campaign might be Armistice Day but there is no prospect of a ceasefire between the parties. The unusual instance of Remembrance Day falling in an election campaign has left the big players unable to resist promoting policies for veterans. The Tories are planning to offer more childcare help for families in the military, a railcard for veterans and will also repeat previous pledges to prevent \u201cvexatious\u201d legal claims such as those faced by ex-soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Labour has said it will improve pay and conditions for service personnel by scrapping the public sector pay cap, better housing and improved access to schools for children of force members. Another major focus will be immigration. Our political editor, Heather Stewart, reports that Labour activists are pushing Jeremy Corbyn to incorporate radical changes to migration policy in the party\u2019s manifesto. Senior leaders are meeting today to thrash out the party\u2019s definitive stance with many calling for them to adopt the more open border policy backed by members at party conference in September. The Tories are hoping to portray Labour as soft on immigration and believe that a more liberal policy could cost Corbyn votes in northern and Midlands heartland seats. One Midlands seat that will be a bit different this time is Leicester East, where Keith Vaz\u2019s name will not be on the ballot paper for the first time in 32 years. The former minister, who was facing suspension from the Commons for \u201cexpressing willingness\u201d to purchase cocaine for sex workers, announced last night that he is standing down. Vaz, who is 62, said it had been \u201can honour and a privilege to serve my constituency\u201d, while Corbyn said Vaz had led the way for black and Asian Labour MPs. No campaign day would be complete without a spending row and this one will be no exception with Labour hitting back at Tory claims that its policies would cost \u00a31.2tn. Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s election coordinator, described the claims as \u201cabsolute work of fiction by the Conservatives\u201d. Our economic correspodent, Richard Partington, has interrogated the Tory claims and concludes that they have added in the cost of Labour policies over a five-year period to inflate the headline number.

      "body": "<p>The former Bolivian president Evo Morales has been granted asylum by Mexico, the country\u2019s top diplomat has said, following the veteran socialist\u2019s announcement on Sunday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/bolivian-president-evo-morales-resigns-after-election-result-dispute\">he would resign</a>.</p> <p>Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, told reporters: \u201cWe will immediately proceed to inform Bolivia\u2019s foreign ministry that under international law, it should offer safe conduct [to Morales].\u201d</p> <p>Mexico had \u201cdecided to grant political asylum to Evo Morales in virtue of the urgent situation which he faces in Bolivia where his life and safety are at risk\u201d, Ebrard added. The minister confirmed that Morales had accepted the asylum offer.</p> <p>The president\u2019s exit has created chaos and uncertainty in Bolivia as well as stoking fears about a power vacuum. Looting, vandalism and arson carried out by both his supporters and opponents have been already been reported.</p> <p>Morales\u2019 decision to step down followed several quick-fire developments on Sunday, beginning with the release of a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) that said it had found \u201cclear manipulations\u201d of the voting system in last month\u2019s presidential election and could not verify the first-round victory for Morales. The president responded by saying he would call fresh elections but stepped down after the head of the army publicly called for him to leave his post.</p> <p>On Monday, Morales used social media to accuse the opposition leaders Carlos Mesa and Luis Fernando Camacho of instigating a coup against him. \u201c[They] lie and try to blame us for the chaos and violence that they provoked,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The news brought mixed reactions around the world. Donald Trump welcomed it as \u201ca significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere\u201d.</p> <p>The US president said in a written statement: \u201cAfter nearly 14 years and his recent attempt to override the Bolivian constitution and the will of the people, Morales\u2019s departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom and the Bolivian military for abiding by its oath to protect not just a single person, but Bolivia\u2019s constitution.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"046bef6d4e02c108d4f604acd4d15bb233b8d6b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/046bef6d4e02c108d4f604acd4d15bb233b8d6b2/0_122_3081_1849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morales supporters being arrested in La Paz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morales supporters being arrested in La Paz on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous leader, is an iconic figure for the international left and was the last survivor of Latin America\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/05/pinktidespreads\">pink tide</a>\u201d of two decades ago.

      "bodyText": "The former Bolivian president Evo Morales has been granted asylum by Mexico, the country\u2019s top diplomat has said, following the veteran socialist\u2019s announcement on Sunday that he would resign. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, told reporters: \u201cWe will immediately proceed to inform Bolivia\u2019s foreign ministry that under international law, it should offer safe conduct [to Morales].\u201d Mexico had \u201cdecided to grant political asylum to Evo Morales in virtue of the urgent situation which he faces in Bolivia where his life and safety are at risk\u201d, Ebrard added. The minister confirmed that Morales had accepted the asylum offer. The president\u2019s exit has created chaos and uncertainty in Bolivia as well as stoking fears about a power vacuum. Looting, vandalism and arson carried out by both his supporters and opponents have been already been reported. Morales\u2019 decision to step down followed several quick-fire developments on Sunday, beginning with the release of a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) that said it had found \u201cclear manipulations\u201d of the voting system in last month\u2019s presidential election and could not verify the first-round victory for Morales. The president responded by saying he would call fresh elections but stepped down after the head of the army publicly called for him to leave his post. On Monday, Morales used social media to accuse the opposition leaders Carlos Mesa and Luis Fernando Camacho of instigating a coup against him. \u201c[They] lie and try to blame us for the chaos and violence that they provoked,\u201d he said. The news brought mixed reactions around the world. Donald Trump welcomed it as \u201ca significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere\u201d. The US president said in a written statement: \u201cAfter nearly 14 years and his recent attempt to override the Bolivian constitution and the will of the people, Morales\u2019s departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard. \u201cThe United States applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom and the Bolivian military for abiding by its oath to protect not just a single person, but Bolivia\u2019s constitution.\u201d Morales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous leader, is an iconic figure for the international left and was the last survivor of Latin America\u2019s \u201cpink tide\u201d of two decades ago. But the country has been roiled by mass protests since last month\u2019s disputed election result. In Mexico Ebrard issued a statement on Monday defining what had happened as a \u201cmilitary coup\u201d, and calling for an urgent meeting of the OAS. \u201cWhat happened yesterday [in Bolivia] is a step backwards for the whole continent,\u201d he said. \u201cMilitary coups never bring anything positive and that is why we are worried.\u201d Mesa, Morales\u2019 closest rival in October\u2019s disputed election, said the president was brought down by a popular uprising, not the military. He said the military had made a decision not to deploy in the streets because \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to take lives\u201d. In Bolivia the immediate concern was the void left as resignations by Morales and his vice-president, \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linares, were followed by the next in line, the senate president, Adriana Salvatierra. Her deputy, Jeanine A\u00f1ez, is expected to assume the interim presidency. In a wave of resignations, parliamentarians, local politicians and top brass in the army and police also stepped down. \u201cWe are living in chaos with no one assuming the reins of power, said Carlos Cordero, a political scientist at La Paz\u2019s San Andr\u00e9s university. He said no clear timeline had emerged for scheduling a fresh vote. A senior US state department official said a copy of Morales\u2019s resignation letter was circulating: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to determine if that is a valid document or something else that somebody fabricated, but we have seen a draft that has been signed.\u201d Giving Washington\u2019s view, a senior US official said: \u201cOur understanding is that what happens in fact is that people serving in public security forces and the police declined to repress the protests and later that members of the armed forces declined to repress these protests. \u201cAnd at that point Evo Morales resigned when leaders of the security forces pointed out the obvious: he had lost the faith of the public, and that the security situation had become especially grave.\u201d Commenting on the wave of resignations, the official said. \u201cThere is still a constitutional structure and therefore a clear line in the constitution for creating a legitimate succession of authority \u2026 if there is a vacuum of power, there are people who clearly have it within their reach to help reestablish a legitimate structure of governance.\u201d Another senior US official said he expected the legislative assembly to meet later on Monday or on Tuesday, and that talks were ongoing to ensure enough politicians are present to form a quorum. \u201cWe certainly hope that all members of the assembly participate fully,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important to say that they have the absolute right to participate fully in the political debates that their country is facing without hindrance, without threats, without violence and that they deserve protection.\u201d On the question of who should be able to stand in new elections, the same US official said: \u201cOur position is that people who are directly implicated in trying to distort the outcome of the elections should not participate in the follow-on election \u2026 That\u2019s not a statement about any political party.\u201d The US state department issued a statement calling for the OAS to send a mission to Bolivia to oversee the electoral process. \u201cThe Bolivian people deserve free and fair elections,\u201d it said. Social media fuelled competing claims of arson attacks or death threats against both sides after Morales\u2019 resignation. Armed intruders broke into Morales\u2019 home in Cochabamba and he accused \u201ccoup plotters\u2019 of an arson attack on his sister\u2019s home and of making death threats against his ministers and their children. Spain\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the role of Bolivia\u2019s police and army in the resignation and urged \u201call actors to avoid resorting to violence\u201d and \u201cguarantee the safety of all Bolivians \u2026 including former president Morales himself, his relatives and members of his administration\u201d. Amid claims of a witch-hunt, the head of Bolivia\u2019s supreme electoral tribunal, Mar\u00eda Eugenia Choque, stepped down after the release of the OAS report. The attorney general\u2019s office said it would investigate the tribunal\u2019s judges for possible fraud, and police later said Choque had been detained along with 37 other officials on suspicion of electoral crimes. Local media later quoted her as saying: \u201cI have been the prisoner of imposed decisions.\u201d On Monday a tense calm returned to La Paz after weeks of street protests. Gone were the crowds chanting: \u201cThis is not Cuba, nor Venezuela. This is Bolivia, and Bolivia is respected.\u201d One resident, Carlos Jim\u00e9nez, 50, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty \u2026 The people are divided but most of us think the president abused his power. [He] has to accept the people don\u2019t want him any more.\u201d Bolivia\u2019s state news agency, ABI, said Morales announced his resignation from Chapare province, where he began his political career as a union leader. He said he was returning there. \u201cI return to my people who never left me. The fight goes on,\u201d he said. However, the Democratic congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, alleged that the events in Bolivia amounted to a coup. \u201cThe people of Bolivia deserve free, fair, and peaceful elections \u2013 not violent seizures of power,\u201d she tweeted.

Nor did many residents of their pretty South Yorkshire village, who thought they had escaped the worst after a major emergency was declared across the county on Thursday night.</p> <p>They only realised they were in trouble when the water started rushing down the lane by their house. Two nearby rivers, the Don and <a href=\"https://riverlevels.uk/flood-warning-ea-beck-catchment\">Ea Beck</a>, had breached their banks, spilling into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/11/we-cant-go-fishlake-residents-defy-floodwaters-and-authorities\">Fishlake</a>, which centuries ago was settled on a floodplain.

A spokeswoman said it could not send in employees for health and safety reasons, and had been asked to stay away by the emergency services while the severe flood warning was in place. While expressing sympathy for residents, she criticised them for using the fire service as \u201ca courier service\u201d. Throughout Monday, fire officers ferried prescriptions via dinghy from house to house, checking that anyone who wanted to leave could do so.</p> <p>For many residents, the council\u2019s absence was all the more jarring given how many journalists had managed to travel on amphibious vehicles to reach the village, hitching a ride from the nearby pit village of Stainforth. The Guardian was given a lift by one of these \u201cLand Rover heroes\u201d, Neil Carpenter, who with his son Lewis had been providing a shuttle service all weekend, refusing money for petrol.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you have seen here is people who have very little, giving a lot,\u201d said town councillor Phil Bedford, who was coordinating a respite centre at Stainforth community resource centre, which was filled with donations of everything from sanitary towels to tins of beans \u2013 and even a pair of flippers. \u201cThis is a response from the people not the authorities.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has agreed to chair a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee on Tuesday to discuss the response to the recent severe floods, after he was urged by Jeremy Corbyn to \u201ctake personal charge\u201d of the situation. The announcement by Downing Street came as residents began a clean-up operation, and warned that further damage was likely unless existing water was pumped away. Corbyn had said that he disagreed with the prime minister\u2019s assessment at the weekend that the flooding was \u201cnot looking like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency\u201d and urged him to convene the Cobra meeting. The Labour leader wrote to Johnson: \u201cIf this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the east Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared.\u201d He called for the government to ensure \u201cevery resource is being utilised to aid those that need it and protect against future potential floods\u201d and \u201cthat the insurance industry fulfils its responsibilities\u201d. Downpours last week meant several areas from Yorkshire to Derbyshire and the east Midlands were deluged with one month\u2019s worth of rain in a day. On Monday, the Environment Agency had five severe \u201cdanger to life\u201d flood warnings in place, all in and around Doncaster, as well as 39 flood warnings across the country. Last week the River Don burst its banks, leaving houses inundated by floodwater and forcing residents out of their homes. Residents in Fishlake, near Doncaster, raised concerns that more flooding was likely unless the existing water was pumped away, with more rain forecast for Thursday night. In Fishlake, 51-year-old Grant Berry said he had spent three dark nights marooned on the first floor of his house in Fishlake, relying on candles for light after the electricity was knocked out. It was just before 1am on Saturday that the Environment Agency issued a \u201cdanger to life\u201d warning for the village after a month\u2019s rain fell in 24 hours. But Berry and his wife, Samantha, did not get it, having not signed up to the agency\u2019s text alerts. Nor did many residents of their pretty South Yorkshire village, who thought they had escaped the worst after a major emergency was declared across the county on Thursday night. They only realised they were in trouble when the water started rushing down the lane by their house. Two nearby rivers, the Don and Ea Beck, had breached their banks, spilling into Fishlake, which centuries ago was settled on a floodplain. The couple had just a few minutes to grab their most precious belongings and a packet of candles before their ground floor was a foot underwater, tripping the electrics. At the bottom of the drive, the floodwaters had reached waist-height. The couple were going nowhere. All weekend, they sat upstairs eating crisps and corned beef, taking turns to look forlornly out of the window at the For Sale sign outside, poking up from the floodwater. \u201cWe can forget about selling up now,\u201d said Berry, showing the Guardian around the musty ground floor on Monday after the waters had receded, the floorboards warped after their rapid submersion. Like at least half of the 175 households in Fishlake, the Berrys had no intention of abandoning their property, even though the threat to life warning was firmly in place. Not only did they have nowhere to go, but they worried their home could be targeted by looters. John Waite, 75, one of the voluntary flood wardens, insisted the door of a local funeral parlour had been forced, leading to the surreal sight of coffins \u2013 empty, thankfully \u2013 \u201cfloating down the high street\u201d. But South Yorkshire police said there were no confirmed reports. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a drone up, boats and crime prevention patrols and we can\u2019t find any evidence of criminality,\u201d said a spokeswoman. In the Hare and Hounds, Andrew Benford was stroking his border terrier, Mazy. Along with several other homeless residents, the pair had been sleeping together on a camp bed in the pub since Friday night when their bungalow was flooded. The new landlords, Scott and Angie Godfrey, had been amazing, said Benford. \u201cThey can\u2019t do enough for us.\u201d On Monday afternoon the first high-volume pump arrived in Fishlake to reduce water levels, which were still several foot deep in some areas of the village. In nearby Bentley Ings, which flooded on Thursday night, an RAF Chinook helicopter had been deployed to reinforce flood banks with aggregate. However, there was no sign of Doncaster council in Fishlake. A spokeswoman said it could not send in employees for health and safety reasons, and had been asked to stay away by the emergency services while the severe flood warning was in place. While expressing sympathy for residents, she criticised them for using the fire service as \u201ca courier service\u201d. Throughout Monday, fire officers ferried prescriptions via dinghy from house to house, checking that anyone who wanted to leave could do so. For many residents, the council\u2019s absence was all the more jarring given how many journalists had managed to travel on amphibious vehicles to reach the village, hitching a ride from the nearby pit village of Stainforth. The Guardian was given a lift by one of these \u201cLand Rover heroes\u201d, Neil Carpenter, who with his son Lewis had been providing a shuttle service all weekend, refusing money for petrol. \u201cWhat you have seen here is people who have very little, giving a lot,\u201d said town councillor Phil Bedford, who was coordinating a respite centre at Stainforth community resource centre, which was filled with donations of everything from sanitary towels to tins of beans \u2013 and even a pair of flippers. \u201cThis is a response from the people not the authorities.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You don\u2019t have to have an Alexa device in your kitchen to worry that Amazon might be monitoring you. You don\u2019t have to work for the company, either. You don\u2019t even have to shop with it, although, obviously, all these things help.</p> <p>The presenter of Dispatches: The Secrets of Amazon (Channel 4), Sophie Morgan, investigated some of the more immediately troubling aspects of our relationship with what is now the most valuable public company in the world, a retail behemoth that accounts for a third of all online purchases in Britain.</p> <p>One of Amazon\u2019s bigger PR headaches is the ongoing concern about working conditions in its fulfilment centres, so much so that the company has mounted an advertising campaign featuring employees saying stuff like: \u201cI bake cakes every Tuesday!\u201d The undercover investigator dispatched by Dispatches to work as a \u201cstower\u201d (scanning and distributing products across a vast warehouse) failed to uncover much evidence of this one-big-happy-family vibe.</p> <p>The motivational sign on the wall said: \u201cWork Hard. Have Fun. Make History\u201d, but one employee had a pithier slogan: \u201cEvery second you stow, they know.\u201d Workers were expected to stow an item every 10 seconds, for a total of about 2,000 products a day. The system keeps track of it all.</p> <p>Toilet breaks obviously slow things down. \u201cTry not to exceed 10 minutes,\u201d said one worker. \u201cAny more than 10 minutes and they might be coming to you.\u201d Amazon says: \u201cWe do not monitor toilet breaks.\u201d</p> <p>The programme also investigated some of the products carried by Amazon, particularly those sold by third parties, which may not meet safety standards. By way of example, Morgan purchased a rubber duck that was 30% DEHP, a plastic additive that by law should comprise no more than 0.1% of the toy, on account of it reducing male fertility. Obviously, once we leave the EU we can have all the toxic bath toys it is our sovereign right to enjoy, but in the meantime Amazon has suspended sale of the ducks while it investigates the show\u2019s claims.</p> <p>In April this year it was revealed that Amazon was also selling books that promote anorexia. The offending titles were removed, but there remains a whole \u201cbreatharian\u201d genre \u2013 potentially dangerous \u2013 that the retailer seems happy to continue to flog (I easily found a book on the site written by a woman who claims not to have eaten in five years). \u201cThere needs to be some accountability,\u201d said a dietician. Amazon said: \u201cAs a bookseller we provide our customers with access to a variety of viewpoints, including books that some customers may find objectionable.\u201d</p> <p>This is the way of watchdog programmes: cautious accusation followed by mealy-mouthed denial. But Amazon\u2019s unprecedented market dominance means that we are probably legally unequipped to deal with its misdeeds. What else can you say about a company that complies fully with UK tax law and still only pays 2% direct tax on revenues of \u00a311bn?</p> <p>The creepiest stuff about Amazon\u2019s reach is also, unfortunately, the hardest to understand. As well as being a retailer, it is the third largest advertising company in the world, behind Google and Facebook, and your data is one of its top products.</p> <p>I tend to think that if you have an Alexa in your house, you don\u2019t care enough about privacy to deserve any, but Amazon does not just collect data from you through your purchases or browsing habits. \u201cAmazon places tracking software called cookies across a range of sites to learn more about us,\u201d said Morgan. I am capable of being alarmed by that without quite knowing what it means, but third-party trackers can and do know when you visit a website about mental health. \u201cYou do not expect Amazon marketing services to know that you\u2019re depressed,\u201d said Frederike Kaltheuner of Privacy International. \u201cIt\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon is not the only online retailer to do this, but the alarming thing is that it is well on its way to being the only online retailer, and more. It already owns companies such as Whole Foods. It also provides web hosting services to the government. And it is always going to have the cheapest socks.</p> <p>This investigation could not exactly illuminate all the dark corners \u2013 devoting 30 minutes to the subject of Amazon is like writing a four-page pamphlet called Climate Crisis, but it was, nevertheless, deeply worrying, and a little wearying. Perhaps what was missing was a little of our own stupid complicity. We let all this happen, because we wanted those damn socks. And when did we want them? Tomorrow!</p>",

You don\u2019t even have to shop with it, although, obviously, all these things help. The presenter of Dispatches: The Secrets of Amazon (Channel 4), Sophie Morgan, investigated some of the more immediately troubling aspects of our relationship with what is now the most valuable public company in the world, a retail behemoth that accounts for a third of all online purchases in Britain. One of Amazon\u2019s bigger PR headaches is the ongoing concern about working conditions in its fulfilment centres, so much so that the company has mounted an advertising campaign featuring employees saying stuff like: \u201cI bake cakes every Tuesday!\u201d The undercover investigator dispatched by Dispatches to work as a \u201cstower\u201d (scanning and distributing products across a vast warehouse) failed to uncover much evidence of this one-big-happy-family vibe. The motivational sign on the wall said: \u201cWork Hard. Have Fun. Make History\u201d, but one employee had a pithier slogan: \u201cEvery second you stow, they know.\u201d Workers were expected to stow an item every 10 seconds, for a total of about 2,000 products a day. The system keeps track of it all. Toilet breaks obviously slow things down. \u201cTry not to exceed 10 minutes,\u201d said one worker. \u201cAny more than 10 minutes and they might be coming to you.\u201d Amazon says: \u201cWe do not monitor toilet breaks.\u201d The programme also investigated some of the products carried by Amazon, particularly those sold by third parties, which may not meet safety standards. By way of example, Morgan purchased a rubber duck that was 30% DEHP, a plastic additive that by law should comprise no more than 0.1% of the toy, on account of it reducing male fertility. Obviously, once we leave the EU we can have all the toxic bath toys it is our sovereign right to enjoy, but in the meantime Amazon has suspended sale of the ducks while it investigates the show\u2019s claims. In April this year it was revealed that Amazon was also selling books that promote anorexia. The offending titles were removed, but there remains a whole \u201cbreatharian\u201d genre \u2013 potentially dangerous \u2013 that the retailer seems happy to continue to flog (I easily found a book on the site written by a woman who claims not to have eaten in five years). \u201cThere needs to be some accountability,\u201d said a dietician. Amazon said: \u201cAs a bookseller we provide our customers with access to a variety of viewpoints, including books that some customers may find objectionable.\u201d This is the way of watchdog programmes: cautious accusation followed by mealy-mouthed denial. But Amazon\u2019s unprecedented market dominance means that we are probably legally unequipped to deal with its misdeeds. What else can you say about a company that complies fully with UK tax law and still only pays 2% direct tax on revenues of \u00a311bn? The creepiest stuff about Amazon\u2019s reach is also, unfortunately, the hardest to understand. As well as being a retailer, it is the third largest advertising company in the world, behind Google and Facebook, and your data is one of its top products. I tend to think that if you have an Alexa in your house, you don\u2019t care enough about privacy to deserve any, but Amazon does not just collect data from you through your purchases or browsing habits. \u201cAmazon places tracking software called cookies across a range of sites to learn more about us,\u201d said Morgan. I am capable of being alarmed by that without quite knowing what it means, but third-party trackers can and do know when you visit a website about mental health. \u201cYou do not expect Amazon marketing services to know that you\u2019re depressed,\u201d said Frederike Kaltheuner of Privacy International. \u201cIt\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d Amazon is not the only online retailer to do this, but the alarming thing is that it is well on its way to being the only online retailer, and more. It already owns companies such as Whole Foods. It also provides web hosting services to the government. And it is always going to have the cheapest socks. This investigation could not exactly illuminate all the dark corners \u2013 devoting 30 minutes to the subject of Amazon is like writing a four-page pamphlet called Climate Crisis, but it was, nevertheless, deeply worrying, and a little wearying. Perhaps what was missing was a little of our own stupid complicity. We let all this happen, because we wanted those damn socks. And when did we want them? Tomorrow!",

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage is facing calls from Brexit supporters to stand down further candidates to help Boris Johnson after he made a dramatic public U-turn by agreeing to withdraw his party from all Conservative-held seats. The Brexit party leader claimed he had changed his mind about fielding candidates in 317 seats held by the Tories after Johnson released a video pledging to take Britain out of the EU by 2020 and to pursue a Canada-style trade deal. The abrupt nature of Farage\u2019s reversal prompted claims from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party that he and the prime minister had struck a secret pact in favour of a hard Brexit, which both sides denied. Farage said he had been offered a peerage by the Tories as recently as last Friday but claimed he had turned it down. Senior Tories are now pressing behind the scenes for the Brexit party leader to make further concessions and stand back in Labour-held target seats, after Farage conceded that the presence of his party in those contests could lead to a hung parliament and a second referendum. Farage claimed he now had more optimism about Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal after the prime minister\u2019s clarifications, having previously condemned it as a sellout and not a real Brexit. He said: \u201cI have got no great love for the Conservative party at all, but I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance \u2026 and stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats \u2013 they even want to revoke the result of the referendum \u2013 I think our action, our announcement today, prevents a second referendum from happening.\u201d Farage pledged to pour his resources into targeting seats held by remain parties and Labour, who accused him and Johnson of entering into an \u201calliance with Donald Trump to sell out our country\u201d. Johnson welcomed Farage\u2019s decision but did not answer questions about whether he had offered him a peerage or knighthood and whether the video making fresh promises of a hard Brexit had been coordinated to help the Brexit party leader climb down. Some pro-Brexit Tories are hoping for further movement from Farage in the coming days, possibly in terms of focusing the party\u2019s financial resources on a small number of seats where the Conservatives have little chance of winning and came third to Ukip in 2015. Steve Baker, a leading Tory Eurosceptic, said: \u201cThis is a welcome announcement but the reality is that until Boris has got a clear majority in parliament then Brexit is at risk and indeed the future of the country. I hope the right decisions will be taken overall to make that possible.\u201d Senior Conservatives suggested there was still time for Farage to row back from standing candidates in Tory target areas before Friday\u2019s deadline. \u201cOur whole strategy relies on winning new seats. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake in the next few days. If they\u2019re now in the business of deciding we need to get this thing done, they need to make some more choices,\u201d one Brexiter Conservative candidate said. But a senior Brexit party source dismissed the idea outright and claimed the party still planned to run in every Labour-held constituency. \u201cThe Tories can take a running jump. We\u2019ve just saved them 40 or 50 seats and they are still moaning,\u201d the source said. Farage sent an email to supporters on Monday night pledging: \u201cWe will contest every seat held by Corbyn\u2019s remainer Labour party, which has openly betrayed five million Labour leave voters. And we will stand in all seats held by the other remainer parties.\u201d The Brexit party claimed it was helping the Tories by standing candidates in Labour-held areas, as it was taking votes off Corbyn\u2019s party more than Johnson\u2019s in places such as the super-marginal of Bishop Auckland. However, it is more widely believed by pollsters that Farage takes about two votes off the Conservatives for every one vote off Labour. Pollsters and political experts were split over whether the decision would have much effect. Polls suggest the Tories would hold on to many of their seats but need to win key Labour targets to reach a majority. Chris Curtis, YouGov\u2019s political research manager, said: \u201cFarage\u2019s decision to stand aside in current Conservative-held seats and not in Labour-held seats that the Tories will be looking to gain will likely make very little difference.\u201d He said it was \u201cunlikely to be a game-changing moment\u201d. However, James Johnson, a former polling expert for Theresa May, said the substance of Farage\u2019s move would be significant. He said: \u201cOn paper, Farage\u2019s decision still makes it harder for the Tories to gain seats. But in practice I expect this will seriously harm the general attractiveness of the Brexit party. Voters everywhere will see this as the party admitting that a vote for it is one that could undermine Brexit.\u201d In Scotland, the Brexit party will field candidates in \u201cmost if not all\u201d seats, except the 13 held by Conservatives, Farage said. Asked about candidates and members who might be feeling disheartened at being asked to stand aside for the Tories, Farage said: \u201cMaking a big decision like this is difficult.\u201d He said all those who had put themselves forward as candidates had been aware they might be asked to stand down and \u201cput country first\u201d. He claimed that at a meeting where they were told this, they applauded. Labour strategists were not too downhearted about Farage\u2019s announcement. They said they would be trying to test the potential impact of the decision on Labour seats in the Midlands and the north of England in the coming days using polling, focus groups and canvass returns. They fear the absence of a Brexit party candidate could make it easier for the Tories to hold on to some of the seats Labour is targeting, such as Blackpool North. But in Labour-held seats, they believe the presence of Farage\u2019s party could help them to avoid being unseated by the Tories. One Labour candidate said: \u201cIn terms of the heartlands Labour-held seats, what we want there is that there is both a Brexit and a Tory candidate.\u201d Farage made his announcement in the Brexit party target seat of Hartlepool. He said his party\u2019s climbdown had come after months of unsuccessfully trying to create a leave alliance with the Tories. At the rally in the County Durham seat, which voted 70% to leave the EU, Farage said he had concluded that if the Brexit party stood a candidate in every seat, it could split the vote and usher in dozens of Liberal Democrat MPs, in turn creating the circumstances for a second referendum. Farage said he had been reassured after Johnson said he would not accept an extension of the transition period for Britain leaving the EU beyond the end of 2020. The prime minister has also said he will negotiate a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d trade deal with no political alignment, which he says is closer to what leave voters want. The Tories are due to launch another attack on Labour\u2019s economic policies on Tuesday, pitching the election as a straight battle between Johnson and Corbyn. The party will claim that Labour\u2019s plans could hand a \u00a32,400 extra tax bill to families but Labour dismissed the calculation as \u201cmore fake news from Tory HQ\u201d as it has not even published its manifesto yet. Some people in the audience at Farage\u2019s announcement on Monday sighed with disappointment. However, one local supporter, Dave Paul, said he trusted Farage\u2019s strategy. \u201cHe\u2019s Mr Brexit. We are right behind Nigel,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 12 November. Top stories Across NSW more than 575 schools will shut their doors today, while aged care homes remain on high alert and animal shelters scramble to rehome pets as much of the state and other parts of Australia prepare for catastrophic fire conditions. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, declared a week-long state of emergency on Monday in the wake of devastating fires on the state\u2019s mid-north coast in which three people died and at least 150 homes were destroyed. On last night\u2019s Q&amp;A, the federal shadow climate minister, Mark Butler, said climate change debates should be put aside as the bushfire crisis mounts. Australian white nationalists have revealed plans to recruit members from the \u201cdisgruntled, white male population\u201d. In a series of leaked videos the leader of an extremist group has revealed his aim is to attract members from mainstream society under the guise of a men\u2019s fitness club, while secretly harbouring an explicitly white supremacist agenda. The plans include the ambition to create a series of \u201cAnglo-European\u201d enclaves in Australian cities based on Orania, a segregated Afrikaner town in South Africa. Payday loans targeting the financially vulnerable are being taken out at the rate of more than 30,000 a week, with the amount borrowed in Australia on track to be worth $1.7bn by year\u2019s end. New data on the industry to be released on Tuesday shows that 4.7m individual loans worth an estimated $3bn have been paid out in the past three years, with more than 310,000 extra households taking on the high-interest debt products since mid-2016. Australia Josh Frydenberg will argue for reform of major international economic institutions including new trade dispute rules and greater input for \u201cemerging\u201d Asian economies in a speech to be delivered on Tuesday at the Australian National University. A Sydney retiree has been convicted of terrorism and jailed for 12 years by a Vietnamese court in a judgment human rights advocates have described as \u201cessentially a death sentence\u201d. The world Two people are in a critical condition in Hong Kong after another day of protests and violent clashes between anti-government protesters and police that left more than 60 people injured. A police officer shot an unarmed 21-year-old male university student in the stomach as demonstrators attempted to disrupt the Monday morning rush hour as part of a day of planned protests and strikes. The British founder of the organisation that trained the Syrian rescue group known as the White Helmets has died in Istanbul. James Le Mesurier, 48, was found dead near his apartment in central Istanbul. Turkish media reports said he was found with fractures to his head and legs and appeared to have fallen from a balcony. Hillary Clinton has called the UK government\u2019s suppression of a report into potential Russian infiltration of British politics \u201cdamaging, inexplicable and shaming\u201d. The potentially incendiary report by the intelligence and security committee has already been approved by the intelligence agencies. The chief executive of Uber has attempted to limit the damage after calling the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u201ca mistake\u201d similar to a fatal accident that occurred during tests of his company\u2019s self-driving car. A mouse deer that was feared lost to science has been captured on film by camera traps set up in a Vietnamese forest. The pictures of the rabbit-sized animal, also known as the silver-backed chevrotain, are the first to be taken in the wild and come nearly 30 years after the last confirmed sighting. Recommended reads Bobin burned down in the NSW fires but is unvanquished. Ned Haughton writes a letter to his hometown: \u201cI saw the insides of trees as infernos. I saw blackened hillsides with nothing left but rock and ash. I saw rainforest on fire. I saw fucking creek beds on fire. Creek beds completely dry, with water in the few deep pools a foot lower than I have ever seen in my 35 years of knowing you. I saw a country school blackened and twisted and melted to the ground today. After only 136 years.\u201d \u201cThere might be a place where \u2018raving inner city lunatics\u2019 are the only people who are concerned about climate change but it is certainly not Michael McCormack\u2019s electorate of Riverina,\u201d writes Gabrielle Chan. \u201cHere in south-western New South Wales, the effects of climate change could not be more keenly felt, as we continue to manage for an extended fire season, as we continue to sell down stock and towns actively deal with water shortages and quality issues for drinking and irrigation. They are just the headlines to our lives.\u201d The Reserve Bank\u2019s latest statement of monetary policy release on Friday had a rather upbeat tone. And yet, writes Greg Jericho, \u201cit is actually a pretty dismal level of optimism. A decade on from the GFC, what constitutes an upbeat assessment is one that is rather depressing, and where the return to average growth is continually pushed off to a later date.\u201d Listen The Guardian\u2019s central and eastern Europe correspondent, Shaun Walker, interviewed George Soros at his New York residence. He tells Today in Focus\u2019 Anushka Asthana how the financier rose to such prominence \u2013 and how he deals with his many enemies.

Almost at the very moment that Sam Gyimah, the Lib Dems\u2019 business spokesperson, was sitting down to chat to a handful of apprentices in Marylebone after a near pointless two-mile journey in the party\u2019s electric battle bus, Nigel Farage was busy handing out P45s to 317 of the Brexit party\u2019s own candidates in Hartlepool. Still, as they had all stumped up a non-refundable \u00a3100 for the privilege, the party was over \u00a330K to the good. And Nige had kept Boris Johnson and Arron Banks happy. You win some, you win some. It wasn\u2019t the most challenging outing for Gyimah.

Fight for our rights and for equality! \u201cMy role is to fight, to beat my chest, to lift my head and keep fighting always. \u201cIn a racist society, it is not enough not to be racist, we must be anti-racist! Football needs more respect, the world needs more respect! \u201cThank you all for the support messages!\u201d Shakhtar condemned the alleged racism in a statement, while their goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov admits the players were left shocked and said he had never experienced anything like it before. The 35-year-old, who has won 92 caps for Ukraine, said on his club\u2019s website: \u201cEveryone is somewhat shocked by what has happened in the stands. I\u2019ve seen that for the first time ever. I\u2019ve never thought that people can behave like that. \u201cWe discussed the incident with the Dynamo players in the tunnel. They also have representatives of other nationalities in the team. \u201cI saw that [Dynamo midfielder Gerson] Rodrigues was also shocked, because this, as it turns out, concerned him as well. The referee had said he would stop the game if this happened again.\u201d Dynamo said in a statement that the club would not tolerate racism and that they would co-operate fully with any investigation. They also added: \u201cWe consider hasty the allegation of a pre-determined guilt of the fans, when the investigation into the circumstances of this case has not even begun.\u201d Sunday\u2019s incident came a week after Brescia\u2019s Mario Balotelli kicked the ball into the crowd after claiming he had been targeted during his side\u2019s defeat at Serie A rivals Verona. The former Liverpool and Manchester City striker also threatened to walk off the pitch, while Verona have been handed a partial stadium ban.",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The former Rudd-era federal government climate adviser, the economist Ross Garnaut, remembered fondly the bipartisan support he said existed when he was commissioned to compile his landmark government review on climate policy in 2008.</p> \n<p>Back then, Garnaut said, the science \u201ctold us if we did not change the trajectory of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere\u201d then the conditions for \u201cdifficult bushfires\u201d would become more frequent.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, it looks like the science was right,\u201d Garnaut said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/11/a-letter-to-my-home-town-bobin-burned-down-in-the-nsw-fires-but-unvanquished\">A letter to my home town Bobin, burned down in the NSW fires but unvanquished | Ned Haughton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The host, Tony Jones, handed Falinksi an audience question on whether the Liberal party had ever moved on from an era when its former leader Tony Abbott was describing the science of climate change as \u201cabsolute crap\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cTony Abbott did not deny climate change,\u201d offered Falinski who, with the gentlest of prods, decided not to prosecute his point.</p> \n<p>Sarah McNamara, the chief executive of the Australian Energy Council that represents electricity and gas companies, said there would only be progress when \u201cpolitics and ideology\u201d was taken out of the debate, segueing neatly to an audience question suggesting that energy policy should be removed entirely from political hands and given instead to regulators.</p> \n<p>Butler was pressed by an audience member and Jones on Labor\u2019s climate policy, the latter wanting to know if the party would change its targets.</p> \n<p>While Butler would not rule out a change to better fit target years \u2013 based, for example on the year 2035 rather than 2030 \u2013 he said the party would have targets that kept the country on a \u201cpathway to net zero emissions by 2050\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy\">Ross Garnaut: three policies will set Australia on a path to 100% renewable energy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Garnaut drew on his new book, Superpower, to give the audience a glimpse of a future where the politics on energy had once again become bipartisan, and Australia\u2019s economy was forging ahead on the back of some of the world\u2019s cheapest power prices fed by its embarrassment of solar and wind resources.</p> \n<p>On that point, Jones asked Falinski if his party was still looking to subsidise a new coal-fired power plant. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not an option we are considering,\u201d said Falinski \u2013 a response that surprised Jones and, perhaps, might also surprise the Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who has been pushing for that outcome in north Queensland.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, issued a plea last night to set aside public debates about climate change while communities are fighting for their lives and homes in the face of unprecedented bushfires. Speaking at the beginning of ABC TV\u2019s Q&amp;A program last night, Butler said his political colleagues on all sides should stick to an unwritten protocol of \u201cputting political disputes aside\u201d while people were in harm\u2019s way during emergencies. Butler\u2019s comments came the evening after the morning of an incendiary statement from the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who said anyone linking climate change to Australia\u2019s ongoing bushfire disaster were the \u201cravings\u201d of \u201cpure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies\u201d. Fire authorities in New South Wales and Queensland are warning of horrific conditions for bushfires on Tuesday and Wednesday, with some areas seeing warnings hit \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels for the first time since the new category was added to the top of the fire danger index in 2009. Butler said while McCormack had appeared to have been reacting to statements from the Greens MP, Adam Bandt, the deputy prime minister should have \u201cstayed above it\u201d instead of entering into a public fight that was \u201cbeneath the office of the deputy prime minister\u201d. Butler said instead of covering the impacts of the bushfires and the responses of communities to them, television news bulletins were concentrating instead on a political spat. There would be a time for a serious debate on the impacts of climate change, he said, but \u201cthat time is not right now\u201d. If Butler\u2019s plea to keep the climate change debate out of the bushfire response was meant to calm the Q&amp;A audience and his fellow panellists, then it worked. But ignoring Butler\u2019s request, the panel showed it was able to walk and simultaneously chew the climate change gum with a debate that never looked like teetering into the gutter of McCormack\u2019s earlier \u201cravings\u201d. The NSW firefighter James Lavery asked if fire services could be properly funded \u201cparticularly in the context of the growing threat of climate change?\u201d A student, Poppy Burton, was part of a group that was \u201cmore inclined for direct action\u201d to help regional communities with food and donations, rather, she said, than the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d offered by the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Moments later, the Liberal MP Jason Falinski responded with \u201cour thoughts and prayers\u201d for people in harm\u2019s way. The former Rudd-era federal government climate adviser, the economist Ross Garnaut, remembered fondly the bipartisan support he said existed when he was commissioned to compile his landmark government review on climate policy in 2008. Back then, Garnaut said, the science \u201ctold us if we did not change the trajectory of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere\u201d then the conditions for \u201cdifficult bushfires\u201d would become more frequent. \u201cUnfortunately, it looks like the science was right,\u201d Garnaut said. The host, Tony Jones, handed Falinksi an audience question on whether the Liberal party had ever moved on from an era when its former leader Tony Abbott was describing the science of climate change as \u201cabsolute crap\u201d. \u201cTony Abbott did not deny climate change,\u201d offered Falinski who, with the gentlest of prods, decided not to prosecute his point. Sarah McNamara, the chief executive of the Australian Energy Council that represents electricity and gas companies, said there would only be progress when \u201cpolitics and ideology\u201d was taken out of the debate, segueing neatly to an audience question suggesting that energy policy should be removed entirely from political hands and given instead to regulators. Butler was pressed by an audience member and Jones on Labor\u2019s climate policy, the latter wanting to know if the party would change its targets. While Butler would not rule out a change to better fit target years \u2013 based, for example on the year 2035 rather than 2030 \u2013 he said the party would have targets that kept the country on a \u201cpathway to net zero emissions by 2050\u201d. Garnaut drew on his new book, Superpower, to give the audience a glimpse of a future where the politics on energy had once again become bipartisan, and Australia\u2019s economy was forging ahead on the back of some of the world\u2019s cheapest power prices fed by its embarrassment of solar and wind resources. On that point, Jones asked Falinski if his party was still looking to subsidise a new coal-fired power plant. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not an option we are considering,\u201d said Falinski \u2013 a response that surprised Jones and, perhaps, might also surprise the Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who has been pushing for that outcome in north Queensland.",

The government has to accept that it needs to invest in a proper rail links, especially between major cities, and that it will not realise any short-term returns on that investment.\u201d <em>Auckland resident, aged 30</em></p> <p>\u201cWe need better transport infrastructure, particularly within the Greater Auckland area. The extensive urban sprawl due to traditionally low-density housing in Auckland makes this a complex challenge. This is compounded by the unique geographical features of the Auckland landscape, such as the densely populated North Shore only being easily accessible from the CBD via the harbour bridge. The major public transport option in Auckland is the bus, which isn\u2019t much fun when it takes an hour into town from the \u201caffordable suburbs\u201d with properties $800,000 on average, and further burdens the overstretched road network. Rush hour starts at 4pm now. It is disheartening to hear that we pay over nine times our income for housing in Auckland, according to the median multiples measure, yet we are so much further behind other cities in terms of public transport infrastructure. It is one of the many things which makes you question whether your investment in this city was worth it.\u201d <em>Laura, 32, Auckland</em></p> <p>\u201cFix the housing crisis. Find a way to make suburban living more attractive and create opportunities and destination spaces outside the city centres.\u201d<em> Lola Davies, 28, Wellington</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Find a way to make suburban living more attractive and create opportunities and destination spaces outside the city centres</p> <footer> <cite>Lola Davies</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNew Zealand needs some decent public transport around its main cities. No city currently has an underground rail system (although construction has started on a relatively small one for Auckland) and the only real public transport available in Auckland currently is an inefficient bus system. Our motorways are clogged every morning and evening with car traffic \u2013 and nearly every vehicle has just one person in it. New Zealand needs public transport that works, and New Zealanders need to change how they commute to use it. The whole country seems to think that we\u2019re largely blameless for climate change, but when we commute like this, paired with the intensive agriculture, we have a long way to go before we can actually claim to be faultless.\u201d <em>Camille B, 17, North Auckland</em></p> <p>\u201cHistorically, New Zealand\u2019s infrastructure has been created by the state: the railways and public health in the 19th century; state housing in the \u201830s; hydro-electricity schemes in the 1970s. In the 21st century the multiple challenges of climate, demographics and technology will require the state to once again take the lead with investment in a Green New Deal to provide public transport, solar energy, affordable housing and universal basic services. New Zealand has been a social laboratory in the past and must be once again if we are to build an inclusive, sustainable society.\u201d<em> John Kerr, 56, Christchurch</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/bulging-at-the-seams-auckland-a-super-city-struggling-with-its-own-success\">'Bulging at the seams': Auckland, a super city struggling with its own success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe need to change our housing and transport so we can cope with an increased population. Continuing the status quo \u2013 suburban sprawl with everyone driving a car \u2013 will put our forests and waterways under continued pressure. Central and local government could begin this transition by investing in light rail, which would both take pressure off roads and encourage denser housing. Another needed development is commuter rail. This would prevent depopulation of smaller towns by allowing workers with jobs in the larger cities to live in cheaper areas, easing pressure on housing. These developments in infrastructure would not only boost the economy, but give everyone a better quality of life and more time to enjoy New Zealand\u2019s beautiful natural setting.\u201d <em>David Saunders, 28, Christchurch</em></p> <h2>Managing immigration</h2> <p>I think the government should restrict immigration further perhaps while increasing international aid which might go some way to compensate. I understand further restrictions on immigration may appear callous. However, in NZ there is a shortage of housing and services are strained. Allowing too much immigration also runs the risk of diminishing voting for left leaning government as has happened in Germany and other countries. <em>Christchurch resident, aged 33</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kids go to school daily without breakfast, shoes and other basic necessities</p> <footer> <cite>Marc</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cConsidering the pace of change, New Zealand\u2019s transition to a multicultural society has been fairly painless; but I still believe immigration needs to be lowered to a more sustainable level, if only for the sake of everyone who is already here. We are woefully behind in terms of infrastructure and housing. In places such as Auckland, we are nowhere near capable of accommodating everyone. I watched housing go from fairly affordable, to completely unaffordable in a matter of six or so years. Banks are telling 35 year olds to ask their parents for money/equity \u2013 it\u2019s truly sad! We need more incentives and schemes which encourage individuals and families to build houses; the process is daunting, but with help, many more would chose this option. In certain areas, building is more affordable than buying residential, and we desperately need that housing stock. We also need more effective policies designed to funnel immigrants into the smaller towns and provinces. But that in itself, will of course require more investment in infrastructure.\u201d<em> Rory, 35, Auckland</em></p> <p>\u201cNZ is a nation whose infrastructure has scale to support only 3.5m people. At 5m we are at breaking point. Rail networks are worse than 100 years ago. Roading is stuck in the 1960\u2019s. Health services are massively underfunded with endless waiting lists for essential surgery. Poverty stalks the suburbs affecting nearly 50% of families. Kids go to school daily without breakfast, shoes and other basic necessities. Teachers are underpaid and live just above the poverty line just like nurses, police, and many who traditionally would have been middle class. Farmers are massively indebted due to being victims of falling global food commodity prices. Tourism supposedly offers a lifeline of foreign earnings, but at the cost of sacrificing the remaining natural environment we have. New Zealanders find it more affordable to holiday outside of NZ rather than compete with the hoards of international tourists who befoul the natural spaces in long queues to get their essential instagram shots. Meanwhile foreign billionaires quietly buy up isolated tracts of land and build bunkers to retreat to when the fall of society happens. The problem is New Zealanders are too meek to protest and stop letting this happen.\u201d<em> Marc, 43, Richmond</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abaae70f2430f0e430be6af1454c835bb6f29782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abaae70f2430f0e430be6af1454c835bb6f29782/0_164_4918_2951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People enjoy the music at Hoani Waititi Marae to commemorate Waitangi Day in Auckland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People enjoy the music at Hoani Waititi Marae to commemorate Waitangi Day in Auckland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Investing in regional areas</h2> <p>\u201cAs New Zealand\u2019s population grows, particularly in Auckland, pressure increases on regions that are only experiencing slow growth. New Zealand has an ageing population. Healthcare and aged care is a primary concern. Regions such as the Wairarapa cannot attract enough doctors. Short staffed GP practices are not accepting new patients, new residents have no GP close by, and those already on the books wait weeks to see a GP leading to the poor health outcomes the region experiences. The regional hospitals are underfunded, there are long waiting lists for many procedures, such as hip replacement, that severely restrict quality of life. New Zealand should be reducing it\u2019s high cancer rates and poor outcomes by offering screening programmes but what is on offer has been cut back or overpromised by central Government. Australia is a far more attractive country when it comes to and better health outcomes for a range of cancers and other diseases. How long before new immigrants realise this and make the leap across the ocean, turning New Zealand into a pit stop. <br>The regions do not have the resources to solve healthcare and housing crisis, the central government needs to invest some of the deficit. <em>Denise Williams, 54, Masterton</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to preserve this slice of paradise \u2013 there aren\u2019t many left in this world!</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Johnson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPut more emphasis on regional development. Auckland is developing at a rate which leaves the rest of the country under-catered for, and reinforces social inequality. Thus, using an immigration system which directs immigrants away from Auckland and towards the regions is a first essential. And while they are at it, providing more services which help immigrants to understand the perspectives of and to live like New Zealanders would be welcome. I know we are not a rich country, but it can\u2019t all be left to charities and chance.\u201d <em>Daleaway, 70+, Kapiti region</em></p> <p>\u201cI think we need to focus on moving people \u2013 particularly new immigrants \u2013 to other centres. Auckland is simply too full and the infrastructure cannot handle the ever growing population. Granted, the population will continue to rise but I believe providing incentives to live in the country side or Rotorua or Christchurch or Dunedin or any smaller city will help \u201cspread the load\u201d of an ever growing population on our small country. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love and embrace our multicultural society \u2013 but I don\u2019t want my quality of life and my way of life (that I have known for 29 years) to be jeopardised through overpopulation. We need to preserve this slice of paradise \u2013 there aren\u2019t many left in this world!\u201d <em>Jim Johnson, 29, Auckland</em></p> <p><br></p>",

The government has to accept that it needs to invest in a proper rail links, especially between major cities, and that it will not realise any short-term returns on that investment.\u201d Auckland resident, aged 30 \u201cWe need better transport infrastructure, particularly within the Greater Auckland area. The extensive urban sprawl due to traditionally low-density housing in Auckland makes this a complex challenge. This is compounded by the unique geographical features of the Auckland landscape, such as the densely populated North Shore only being easily accessible from the CBD via the harbour bridge. The major public transport option in Auckland is the bus, which isn\u2019t much fun when it takes an hour into town from the \u201caffordable suburbs\u201d with properties $800,000 on average, and further burdens the overstretched road network. Rush hour starts at 4pm now. It is disheartening to hear that we pay over nine times our income for housing in Auckland, according to the median multiples measure, yet we are so much further behind other cities in terms of public transport infrastructure. It is one of the many things which makes you question whether your investment in this city was worth it.\u201d Laura, 32, Auckland \u201cFix the housing crisis. Find a way to make suburban living more attractive and create opportunities and destination spaces outside the city centres.\u201d Lola Davies, 28, Wellington \u201cNew Zealand needs some decent public transport around its main cities. No city currently has an underground rail system (although construction has started on a relatively small one for Auckland) and the only real public transport available in Auckland currently is an inefficient bus system. Our motorways are clogged every morning and evening with car traffic \u2013 and nearly every vehicle has just one person in it. New Zealand needs public transport that works, and New Zealanders need to change how they commute to use it. The whole country seems to think that we\u2019re largely blameless for climate change, but when we commute like this, paired with the intensive agriculture, we have a long way to go before we can actually claim to be faultless.\u201d Camille B, 17, North Auckland \u201cHistorically, New Zealand\u2019s infrastructure has been created by the state: the railways and public health in the 19th century; state housing in the \u201830s; hydro-electricity schemes in the 1970s. In the 21st century the multiple challenges of climate, demographics and technology will require the state to once again take the lead with investment in a Green New Deal to provide public transport, solar energy, affordable housing and universal basic services. New Zealand has been a social laboratory in the past and must be once again if we are to build an inclusive, sustainable society.\u201d John Kerr, 56, Christchurch \u201cWe need to change our housing and transport so we can cope with an increased population. Continuing the status quo \u2013 suburban sprawl with everyone driving a car \u2013 will put our forests and waterways under continued pressure. Central and local government could begin this transition by investing in light rail, which would both take pressure off roads and encourage denser housing. Another needed development is commuter rail. This would prevent depopulation of smaller towns by allowing workers with jobs in the larger cities to live in cheaper areas, easing pressure on housing. These developments in infrastructure would not only boost the economy, but give everyone a better quality of life and more time to enjoy New Zealand\u2019s beautiful natural setting.\u201d David Saunders, 28, Christchurch Managing immigration I think the government should restrict immigration further perhaps while increasing international aid which might go some way to compensate. I understand further restrictions on immigration may appear callous. However, in NZ there is a shortage of housing and services are strained. Allowing too much immigration also runs the risk of diminishing voting for left leaning government as has happened in Germany and other countries. Christchurch resident, aged 33 \u201cConsidering the pace of change, New Zealand\u2019s transition to a multicultural society has been fairly painless; but I still believe immigration needs to be lowered to a more sustainable level, if only for the sake of everyone who is already here. We are woefully behind in terms of infrastructure and housing. In places such as Auckland, we are nowhere near capable of accommodating everyone. I watched housing go from fairly affordable, to completely unaffordable in a matter of six or so years. Banks are telling 35 year olds to ask their parents for money/equity \u2013 it\u2019s truly sad! We need more incentives and schemes which encourage individuals and families to build houses; the process is daunting, but with help, many more would chose this option. In certain areas, building is more affordable than buying residential, and we desperately need that housing stock. We also need more effective policies designed to funnel immigrants into the smaller towns and provinces. But that in itself, will of course require more investment in infrastructure.\u201d Rory, 35, Auckland \u201cNZ is a nation whose infrastructure has scale to support only 3.5m people. At 5m we are at breaking point. Rail networks are worse than 100 years ago. Roading is stuck in the 1960\u2019s. Health services are massively underfunded with endless waiting lists for essential surgery. Poverty stalks the suburbs affecting nearly 50% of families. Kids go to school daily without breakfast, shoes and other basic necessities. Teachers are underpaid and live just above the poverty line just like nurses, police, and many who traditionally would have been middle class. Farmers are massively indebted due to being victims of falling global food commodity prices. Tourism supposedly offers a lifeline of foreign earnings, but at the cost of sacrificing the remaining natural environment we have. New Zealanders find it more affordable to holiday outside of NZ rather than compete with the hoards of international tourists who befoul the natural spaces in long queues to get their essential instagram shots. Meanwhile foreign billionaires quietly buy up isolated tracts of land and build bunkers to retreat to when the fall of society happens. The problem is New Zealanders are too meek to protest and stop letting this happen.\u201d Marc, 43, Richmond Investing in regional areas \u201cAs New Zealand\u2019s population grows, particularly in Auckland, pressure increases on regions that are only experiencing slow growth. New Zealand has an ageing population. Healthcare and aged care is a primary concern. Regions such as the Wairarapa cannot attract enough doctors. Short staffed GP practices are not accepting new patients, new residents have no GP close by, and those already on the books wait weeks to see a GP leading to the poor health outcomes the region experiences. The regional hospitals are underfunded, there are long waiting lists for many procedures, such as hip replacement, that severely restrict quality of life. New Zealand should be reducing it\u2019s high cancer rates and poor outcomes by offering screening programmes but what is on offer has been cut back or overpromised by central Government. Australia is a far more attractive country when it comes to and better health outcomes for a range of cancers and other diseases. How long before new immigrants realise this and make the leap across the ocean, turning New Zealand into a pit stop. The regions do not have the resources to solve healthcare and housing crisis, the central government needs to invest some of the deficit. Denise Williams, 54, Masterton \u201cPut more emphasis on regional development. Auckland is developing at a rate which leaves the rest of the country under-catered for, and reinforces social inequality. Thus, using an immigration system which directs immigrants away from Auckland and towards the regions is a first essential. And while they are at it, providing more services which help immigrants to understand the perspectives of and to live like New Zealanders would be welcome. I know we are not a rich country, but it can\u2019t all be left to charities and chance.\u201d Daleaway, 70+, Kapiti region \u201cI think we need to focus on moving people \u2013 particularly new immigrants \u2013 to other centres. Auckland is simply too full and the infrastructure cannot handle the ever growing population. Granted, the population will continue to rise but I believe providing incentives to live in the country side or Rotorua or Christchurch or Dunedin or any smaller city will help \u201cspread the load\u201d of an ever growing population on our small country. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love and embrace our multicultural society \u2013 but I don\u2019t want my quality of life and my way of life (that I have known for 29 years) to be jeopardised through overpopulation. We need to preserve this slice of paradise \u2013 there aren\u2019t many left in this world!\u201d Jim Johnson, 29, Auckland",

The prosecution has said the defendant would have known the clip was about child abuse from a thumbnail image displayed when she accessed her WhatsApp account.

According to another pollster, Opinium, Labour has overtaken the Brexit party among all leave voters for the first time (although it lags well behind the Conservatives).</p> \n<p>The pollster has the Conservatives on 66% of leave voters, with Labour on 15%. Brexit party support among its core voting segment is only 12%.</p> \n<h2><strong>So </strong><strong>will Farage\u2019s announcement significantly damage </strong><strong> Labour?</strong></h2> \n<p>Look more closely at Labour leavers, people who voted out in the referendum and for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party in 2017.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage\u2019s unilateral announcement that he will engage in a one-way electoral pact with the Conservatives will be an undoubted relief to Boris Johnson, but the benefit may be more limited than it first appears. Headline polling data already indicated that the Brexit party was being successfully squeezed by the Tories\u2019 pro-Brexit strategy. Its polling average had slumped from 12% in the third week of October to its current 9%. Four polls released over the weekend paint an even bleaker picture, placing the Brexit party at an average of 7.5%. There was already no real prospect that it would capture a seat in parliament, even if Farage changed his mind and decided to stand. Such is the Brexit party\u2019s weakness that Labour is recovering among leave voters, albeit modestly. According to another pollster, Opinium, Labour has overtaken the Brexit party among all leave voters for the first time (although it lags well behind the Conservatives). The pollster has the Conservatives on 66% of leave voters, with Labour on 15%. Brexit party support among its core voting segment is only 12%. So will Farage\u2019s announcement significantly damage Labour? Look more closely at Labour leavers, people who voted out in the referendum and for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party in 2017. The Opinium data records a gain of 10 points in a week for the opposition, rising from 38% to 48%. In this key category, Farage\u2019s party had lost eight points, sinking to 7%. Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, thinks Farage\u2019s announcement could actually help Labour candidates such as Melanie Onn in Grimsby, where she is defending a majority of 2,565 against the Conservatives. \u201cLabour\u2019s vote will go down if the Brexit party stands, but the Conservative vote will go down by more because leave supporters are a higher proportion of its own base. You have to wonder if Farage understands his own electorate,\u201d the academic said. The danger for the Conservatives is a repeat of the Peterborough effect, where Labour hung on to the seat in this year\u2019s byelection, helped by a split in the leave vote. Lisa Forbes won for Labour with 31% of the vote, while the Brexit party obtained 29% and the Conservatives (who had held the seat in 2015) took 21%. Can Farage do anything about that? The small print of the Farage declaration is his announcement that \u201cwe will concentrate our total effort into all the seats that are held by the Labour party\u201d \u2013 although the Brexit party has yet to spell out exactly where it will run candidates. Backing down further to give the Tories a clear run in target seats held by Labour would be far more useful, given how close Johnson\u2019s party is to an overall majority. But it would raise questions over what the point of the Brexit party is if it runs a further reduced slate of candidates. What about the strategic position? The Conservatives are suddenly faced with a much simpler election campaign: the party can shift resources away from seats it had been defending to focus on Labour gains. And with Farage aiming primarily at Corbyn\u2019s party, there should be no real need to defend the argument that Johnson\u2019s deal \u201cis not a proper Brexit\u201d. But for Labour there are, in England and Wales at least, other possibilities: it is easy to present Farage\u2019s manoeuvre as an unattractive pact, possibly brokered under pressure from Donald Trump, who told the Brexit party leader in a radio interview to \u201cteam up\u201d with the Conservatives. That means, paradoxically, that one of the victims of Farage\u2019s decision to put one foot over the sidelines could be the Lib Dems.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s biggest backer, the union Unite, has told the high court that the party\u2019s parliamentary candidate in Redcar is unfit to be an MP. Anna Turley, who was the Labour MP in the North Yorkshire town until last week and hopes to regain the seat, is suing Unite over an article published on the Skwawkbox blog that related to an application she made for union membership. Turley \u2013 a moderate who three years ago called the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, an \u201carsehole\u201d on Twitter \u2013 claims the article, which contained a press statement from Unite, libelled her. She is also suing Stephen Walker, a journalist who edits and publishes the hard-left blog, and says Unite misused her private information. The hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, which began on Monday, is expected to last three days and will hear from witnesses such as Labour\u2019s Ruth Smeeth appearing via video link, statements from former MPs and testimony from high-ranking union officials. It could prove to be highly embarrassing as Labour MPs and Unite attempt to put on a show of togetherness during the general election campaign. A barrister representing Unite and Walker told a judge that Turley had been dishonest and \u201cregrettably\u201d was not fit to be an MP. Anthony Hudson QC told Mr Justice Nicklin that Turley\u2019s dishonesty \u201cpermeates through every part of the case\u201d. He claimed she had been \u201cdeceiving people so she could vote against Mr McCluskey and oust Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. The case relates to Turley\u2019s application to join Unite in December 2016, which she submitted the day before the announcement of a Unite election for general secretary. McCluskey, one of Corbyn\u2019s most influential advisers, was facing a possible challenge from the moderate Gerard Coyne. An article appeared on Skwawkbox in April 2017 that claimed Turley had broken the rules because she had joined Unite\u2019s community section, which was supposed to be exclusively for unwaged members, and she had made a false declaration to do so. A Unite spokesperson was quoted in the article as saying: \u201cAnyone joining on a fraudulent basis will prompt an investigation. A complaint has been received and is being investigated.\u201d According to Turley\u2019s counsel, she joined as a Unite Community member and was told by Unite in March 2017 that she should move to become an \u201cindustrial\u201d member. Turley replied days later apologising and asking how she should transfer her membership. Kate Wilson, for Turley, said the Skwawkbox article in April 2017 conveyed the meaning that Turley had acted dishonestly in submitting her application. According to court documents, Turley applied to join Unite Community after she read about the challenge to McCluskey\u2019s leadership on the Birthday Club Group of MPs, a confidential WhatsApp group of Labour moderates. The Birthday Club WhatsApp was set up to help like-minded MPs to arrange celebrations and became a forum for dissent. On 5 December 2016, Smeeth, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent North and a Unite member, sent a message to the group\u2019s members saying McCluskey was to resign to trigger an early election for a new general secretary. Smeeth wrote to the group that it was \u201cgame on in Unite\u201d and suggested that the MPs could join Unite Community, according to court papers. The Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Chris Leslie asked Smeeth to share the link to sign up for membership, the documents claims. After receiving the link, Turley replied: \u201cDone. Now for a shower.\u201d Documents submitted to court show Unite discussed contacting Turley to inform her that she was not entitled to be a Unite Community member in both January and February 2017 and finally contacted her in March. Six days after receiving an email, Turley replied saying she did not know she had joined the wrong section and asking how she could transfer to the right section. Walker, a journalist who is close to Unite, contacted the union about Turley\u2019s membership in early April and received the statement that appeared in the Skwawkbox article, court documents said. Unite and Walker\u2019s legal team will claim that Turley acted \u201cdishonestly and deceitfully\u201d in the run-up to the court case by lying about the circumstances in which she joined Unite and then trying to cover up those lies, court documents show. According to Turley\u2019s legal team, Unite has admitted breaching its client\u2019s rights under the Data Protection Act. The case continues.",

Bruises? Broken bones? Or my son to be killed by her?\u201d The alleged reply was: \u201cIt won\u2019t come to that.\u201d</p> <p>The inquest, which began on Monday and is expected to last for two weeks, heard that Speed, who was looking after Archie at her home in Rushbury, near Church Stretton, Shropshire, is serving a life sentence after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/22/woman-arrested-over-of-seven-year-old-shropshire-boy\">found guilty of murder</a>.</p> <p>Spriggs, from Shrewsbury, said he reported to social services in 2013 that he had found bruises on Archie\u2019s upper body and the boy had told him he had been held upside down and shaken by his mother. Spriggs said he told social services he had photographic evidence but nobody went to view the images.</p> <p>He said he told social services in 2014 that bruises had appeared on Archie\u2019s body in unusual places such as the inside or underside of his limbs. The boy told him that his mother had hit him but Spriggs said he saw no evidence that social services began any investigation.</p> <p>Spriggs claimed Archie told him in May 2017 that he had been abused and neglected. Again, Spriggs said he went to social services but was told that no investigation would take place as no threat to his son had been found. When he asked what the previous investigations had consisted of, he was allegedly told it was one phone call to the boy\u2019s headteacher.</p> <p>\u201cI pleaded with them to protect my son,\u201d he said. \u201cI even asked them to put him in care so he would be safe.\u201d</p> <p>Spriggs said he also contacted the police and Archie\u2019s school. \u201cI just wanted Archie to be safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not feel my concerns were taken seriously.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI did everything so that Archie and I could have contact with each other. Throughout my son\u2019s life, everything I did was for him. I love my son and wanted him safe. I contacted many organisations and I do not believe that any of the organisations took my concerns seriously.\u201d</p> <p>A serious case review said agencies missed opportunities to intervene in the situation.</p> <p>The inquest was told that part of Spriggs\u2019 statement to the court was disputed by the local authority and West Mercia police. The inquest continues. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The father of a seven-year-old boy who was murdered by his mother has told an inquest that he pleaded with social services and police to protect his son but was repeatedly brushed off. Matthew Spriggs, whose son Archie Spriggs was strangled by his former partner Lesley Speed on the day of a family court custody hearing in September 2017, told Shropshire coroner\u2019s court he could not comprehend her actions In a statement read to the court, Spriggs said he raised serious concerns about Archie as early as 2013 but was not taken seriously. He claimed that in the months before his son died, he telephoned social services and asked: \u201cWhat is it going to take for you to investigate? Bruises? Broken bones? Or my son to be killed by her?\u201d The alleged reply was: \u201cIt won\u2019t come to that.\u201d The inquest, which began on Monday and is expected to last for two weeks, heard that Speed, who was looking after Archie at her home in Rushbury, near Church Stretton, Shropshire, is serving a life sentence after being found guilty of murder. Spriggs, from Shrewsbury, said he reported to social services in 2013 that he had found bruises on Archie\u2019s upper body and the boy had told him he had been held upside down and shaken by his mother. Spriggs said he told social services he had photographic evidence but nobody went to view the images. He said he told social services in 2014 that bruises had appeared on Archie\u2019s body in unusual places such as the inside or underside of his limbs. The boy told him that his mother had hit him but Spriggs said he saw no evidence that social services began any investigation. Spriggs claimed Archie told him in May 2017 that he had been abused and neglected. Again, Spriggs said he went to social services but was told that no investigation would take place as no threat to his son had been found. When he asked what the previous investigations had consisted of, he was allegedly told it was one phone call to the boy\u2019s headteacher. \u201cI pleaded with them to protect my son,\u201d he said. \u201cI even asked them to put him in care so he would be safe.\u201d Spriggs said he also contacted the police and Archie\u2019s school. \u201cI just wanted Archie to be safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not feel my concerns were taken seriously.\u201d He added: \u201cI did everything so that Archie and I could have contact with each other. Throughout my son\u2019s life, everything I did was for him. I love my son and wanted him safe. I contacted many organisations and I do not believe that any of the organisations took my concerns seriously.\u201d A serious case review said agencies missed opportunities to intervene in the situation. The inquest was told that part of Spriggs\u2019 statement to the court was disputed by the local authority and West Mercia police. The inquest continues.",

      "body": "<p>Jonathan Freedland is incorrect to depict our parliamentary elections as a presidential contest (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/09/jews-brexit-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Many Jews oppose Brexit, but how can we vote for Corbyn?</a>, 9 November). Neither is he justified in assuming that Jews should be treated as a single homogeneous entity in considering which way to vote, despite his acknowledgement that views are not uniform.</p> <p>The accusations against Jeremy Corbyn are well known. His long history as a defender of Palestinian rights has undoubtedly involved association with people with unacceptable views about Jews. But that does not make him antisemitic and, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/jeremy-corbyn-what-i-m-doing-to-banish-antisemitism-from-the-labour-party-a3821961.html\" title=\"\">as he has stated</a>, a line must be drawn when opposition to Israel\u2019s government is based on antisemitic ideas or involves comparison with the Nazis.</p> <p>Freedland might also have mentioned Corbyn\u2019s long-term support for Jewish causes such as the commemoration of Holocaust Memorial Day, condemnation of the persecution of Jews in Iran and Yemen, and terrorist attacks against Jewish schools and synagogues, as well as support for Jewish communal institutions in the UK.</p> <p>Nevertheless, more must be done to reassure many in the Jewish community that their fears are taken seriously. Corbyn needs to take a clear lead in showing progress in the Labour party\u2019s internal procedures, including no tolerance for antisemitic views among prospective candidates and providing regular aggregate reports on the outcome of disciplinary processes.</p> <p>However, nothing justifies Freedland in invoking the spectre of the Holocaust as a deterrent to those who wish to oppose what he calls \u201ca hard Brexit enforced by an Islamophobe\u201d, not to mention more than nine years of austerity. It is to be hoped that he will reconsider embracing this dangerous form of identity politics.<br><strong>Dr Anthony Isaacs</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Whenever I read Jonathan Freedland writing about his fear of antisemitism, part of me wants to weep. My mother was a Jewish refugee who became a Quaker, so I became familiar with the Jewish practices of friends and family, as well as the open listening and acceptance of Quakers. The narratives we tell ourselves about the world, and our place in it, have a deep impact on our beliefs and actions. I have just re-read William Blake\u2019s The Angel, in which the writer loses touch with her angel because she is afraid and so she arms herself with shields and spears to protect herself. She has lost the capacity to approach the world with love. When we teach ourselves to see hatred and suspicion in every corner, we will indeed see it everywhere. When we reach out in order to understand one another, we see each other\u2019s hopes and fears, what guides and motivates us, what brings us grief and joy. However hard it may be, we all need to do this.</p> <p>I hear antisemitic comments with horror and I am concerned that the policies of the far right will divide people even more. I long for a government whose policies will heal those divides. I think Jeremy Corbyn is aware of that need, and I am deeply sorry that many Jews do not believe him. He does not deserve to be a focus of fear. I cannot understand why he gets the blame for every misdeed in the party. He is not perfect, any more than the rest of us, yet he stands for the fairer, greener society that we are crying out for. Please, Jonathan, believe that a kinder world is possible and help to make it happen.<br><strong>Ruth Tod</strong><br><em>Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article by Jonathan Freedland, a man whose journalism I generally admire, has disappointed me. He wheels out the old tropes in a most un-Guardian like way. To give one example: that Jeremy Corbyn consorts with terrorists. To truly seek peace in any situation, you have to talk to both sides in any conflict. Tony Blair succeeded by talking to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Not to have done so would have been remiss.</p> <p>I am a secular Jew, all of whose Polish maternal family of origin perished in Auschwitz, and whose French paternal grandfather was picked up in Paris and died in Drancy holding camp. I too am perhaps oversensitive. To quote Freedland\u2019s words: \u201cI am afraid that Jewish history has made us that way, prone to imagining the worst.\u201d Despite that, I categorically refute that either Jeremy Corbyn or the Labour party are antisemitic. They are, like me, against the government and spirit of Netanyahu, and its imperialist (and internationally unlawful) actions in Palestine. A world of difference intentionally ignored by the smear press, and seemingly by Freedland as well.<br><strong>Andy Stelman</strong><br><em>Bishops Castle, Shropshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland has no need to apologise for imagining the worst. After the previously unimaginable genocide suffered by European Jews in the last century, how could anyone expect a Jewish person, or indeed any person, to be free of fear again? All the more reason to be equally clear. It is preposterous and irresponsible to associate, as Freedland does, the prospect of a Corbyn government with the fates of those who \u201cnever made it out in time\u201d. <br><strong>Jeff Wallace</strong><br><em>Cardiff</em></p> <p>\u2022 Thank you yet again, Jonathan Freedland, this time for explaining so clearly the dilemma Jewish voters face, which many of us had not properly understood before. Why can Corbyn not see that the only hope for the future of the Labour party is a promise from him now that following the election, which he cannot win outright, he will stand down? Is he really so insulated from reality that he cannot see the damage he is doing?<br><strong>Alison Watson</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland poses the dilemma for many Jewish remainers between voting for an antisemitic Labour leadership and a hard-Brexit Tory party. But I was surprised that he did not mention the obvious alternative. The Liberal Democrats are genuinely welcoming to all people and intolerant of all forms of racism, and they are committed to remaining in the EU, either by revoking article 50 if they should win, or supporting a people\u2019s vote in cooperation with other parties. As many Jewish people tend to live in the same areas as each other, such as the three constituencies of the London borough of Barnet, a collective Jewish vote for the Lib Dems would be an effective and viable choice for electing MPs representing a party that has, at its heart, the interests of a large proportion of the population that includes Jewish remainers. <br><strong>Jackie Marks</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland is incorrect to depict our parliamentary elections as a presidential contest (Many Jews oppose Brexit, but how can we vote for Corbyn?, 9 November). Neither is he justified in assuming that Jews should be treated as a single homogeneous entity in considering which way to vote, despite his acknowledgement that views are not uniform. The accusations against Jeremy Corbyn are well known. His long history as a defender of Palestinian rights has undoubtedly involved association with people with unacceptable views about Jews. But that does not make him antisemitic and, as he has stated, a line must be drawn when opposition to Israel\u2019s government is based on antisemitic ideas or involves comparison with the Nazis. Freedland might also have mentioned Corbyn\u2019s long-term support for Jewish causes such as the commemoration of Holocaust Memorial Day, condemnation of the persecution of Jews in Iran and Yemen, and terrorist attacks against Jewish schools and synagogues, as well as support for Jewish communal institutions in the UK. Nevertheless, more must be done to reassure many in the Jewish community that their fears are taken seriously. Corbyn needs to take a clear lead in showing progress in the Labour party\u2019s internal procedures, including no tolerance for antisemitic views among prospective candidates and providing regular aggregate reports on the outcome of disciplinary processes. However, nothing justifies Freedland in invoking the spectre of the Holocaust as a deterrent to those who wish to oppose what he calls \u201ca hard Brexit enforced by an Islamophobe\u201d, not to mention more than nine years of austerity. It is to be hoped that he will reconsider embracing this dangerous form of identity politics. Dr Anthony Isaacs London \u2022 Whenever I read Jonathan Freedland writing about his fear of antisemitism, part of me wants to weep. My mother was a Jewish refugee who became a Quaker, so I became familiar with the Jewish practices of friends and family, as well as the open listening and acceptance of Quakers. The narratives we tell ourselves about the world, and our place in it, have a deep impact on our beliefs and actions. I have just re-read William Blake\u2019s The Angel, in which the writer loses touch with her angel because she is afraid and so she arms herself with shields and spears to protect herself. She has lost the capacity to approach the world with love. When we teach ourselves to see hatred and suspicion in every corner, we will indeed see it everywhere. When we reach out in order to understand one another, we see each other\u2019s hopes and fears, what guides and motivates us, what brings us grief and joy. However hard it may be, we all need to do this. I hear antisemitic comments with horror and I am concerned that the policies of the far right will divide people even more. I long for a government whose policies will heal those divides. I think Jeremy Corbyn is aware of that need, and I am deeply sorry that many Jews do not believe him. He does not deserve to be a focus of fear. I cannot understand why he gets the blame for every misdeed in the party. He is not perfect, any more than the rest of us, yet he stands for the fairer, greener society that we are crying out for. Please, Jonathan, believe that a kinder world is possible and help to make it happen. Ruth Tod Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire \u2022 This article by Jonathan Freedland, a man whose journalism I generally admire, has disappointed me. He wheels out the old tropes in a most un-Guardian like way. To give one example: that Jeremy Corbyn consorts with terrorists. To truly seek peace in any situation, you have to talk to both sides in any conflict. Tony Blair succeeded by talking to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Not to have done so would have been remiss. I am a secular Jew, all of whose Polish maternal family of origin perished in Auschwitz, and whose French paternal grandfather was picked up in Paris and died in Drancy holding camp. I too am perhaps oversensitive. To quote Freedland\u2019s words: \u201cI am afraid that Jewish history has made us that way, prone to imagining the worst.\u201d Despite that, I categorically refute that either Jeremy Corbyn or the Labour party are antisemitic. They are, like me, against the government and spirit of Netanyahu, and its imperialist (and internationally unlawful) actions in Palestine. A world of difference intentionally ignored by the smear press, and seemingly by Freedland as well. Andy Stelman Bishops Castle, Shropshire \u2022 Jonathan Freedland has no need to apologise for imagining the worst. After the previously unimaginable genocide suffered by European Jews in the last century, how could anyone expect a Jewish person, or indeed any person, to be free of fear again? All the more reason to be equally clear. It is preposterous and irresponsible to associate, as Freedland does, the prospect of a Corbyn government with the fates of those who \u201cnever made it out in time\u201d. Jeff Wallace Cardiff \u2022 Thank you yet again, Jonathan Freedland, this time for explaining so clearly the dilemma Jewish voters face, which many of us had not properly understood before. Why can Corbyn not see that the only hope for the future of the Labour party is a promise from him now that following the election, which he cannot win outright, he will stand down? Is he really so insulated from reality that he cannot see the damage he is doing? Alison Watson London \u2022 Jonathan Freedland poses the dilemma for many Jewish remainers between voting for an antisemitic Labour leadership and a hard-Brexit Tory party. But I was surprised that he did not mention the obvious alternative. The Liberal Democrats are genuinely welcoming to all people and intolerant of all forms of racism, and they are committed to remaining in the EU, either by revoking article 50 if they should win, or supporting a people\u2019s vote in cooperation with other parties. As many Jewish people tend to live in the same areas as each other, such as the three constituencies of the London borough of Barnet, a collective Jewish vote for the Lib Dems would be an effective and viable choice for electing MPs representing a party that has, at its heart, the interests of a large proportion of the population that includes Jewish remainers.

Now local governments across the UK must follow suit and go one step further in a bid to tackle the impending climate emergency for current and future generations. The climate crisis is the greatest environmental and health risk of the 21st century, and transport accounts for 26% of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, with the main sources being petrol and diesel cars.

      "body": "<p>A text-message ping in the middle of the night: \u201cI have been raped.\u201d I like to think I would do the right thing. Unfortunately, I know what this is because I have talked to enough people at <a href=\"https://rapecrisis.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Rape Crisis</a>. I would tell the woman in question to not clean her teeth or have a drink, to not shower and, if possible, to not pee. In other words, maintain yourself in a violated state in order to keep any evidence intact. (In giving this advice, I would be well aware that it is extremely unlikely she would be able to take it.) I would then take her to the police station \u2013 to the rape suite, as they are lovingly called.</p> <p>Or would I? Would I tell her to go through a system that would involve her being questioned about what she was wearing? Did she know the guy? Did they exchange texts? Had she been drinking?</p> <p>Would I tell her to go through an investigation during which her phone and her laptop could be taken from her; to get involved in a process that could take two years to get to court? Could I give her that advice in the full knowledge that the guy would probably get away with it? Would I give her a lecture on her duty to other women on the basis he might rape again?</p> <p>I don\u2019t know. It sticks in my craw to say this, but it has never been easier to get away with rape. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is in crisis. The number of reported rapes is rising, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/10/half-of-victims-drop-out-of-cases-even-after-suspect-is-identified\" title=\"\">half of rape victims</a> are dropping out of prosecutions even when the suspect has been identified. Police are referring fewer cases to the CPS, which in turn is prosecuting fewer cases. This is the way it has been going for a decade. The number of convictions has dropped. Who really cares?</p> <p>This is simply another depressing \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d, although I would like it to be everyone\u2019s issue. Dare I say it is also an electoral issue? I often think of Andrea Dworkin saying she was less concerned with men learning to cry than with them stopping \u201cthe crimes of violence against us\u201d. I don\u2019t need men to tell me rape is awful. I need them to take it seriously enough to change the system.</p> <p>Every day I am told what the <em>real</em> issues are: austerity, hospitals, housing, the weird void that is Brexit. Violence against women? Not so much. A crime, sure, but a fact of life. Women live in fear of sexual assault, and modify their behaviour accordingly. This is captivity redefined as common sense. Girls wear cycling shorts under their skirts at school or when doing bar work to stop men grabbing them. A woman\u2019s job is to stop men raping them. This is rape culture, then \u2013 where we all assume violence against women is inevitable.</p> <p>To change that requires political will. Where is it? Women who have had sex in the past have apparently surrendered their rights, and now they have to surrender their digital pasts, too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/25/fatal-hateful-rise-of-choking-during-sex\" title=\"\">The newly popular \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d defence</a> implies complicity in your own murder. The US president is a pussy grabber. Harvey Weinstein wanders free while awaiting trial for allegations he denies.

      "bodyText": "A text-message ping in the middle of the night: \u201cI have been raped.\u201d I like to think I would do the right thing. Unfortunately, I know what this is because I have talked to enough people at Rape Crisis. I would tell the woman in question to not clean her teeth or have a drink, to not shower and, if possible, to not pee. In other words, maintain yourself in a violated state in order to keep any evidence intact. (In giving this advice, I would be well aware that it is extremely unlikely she would be able to take it.) I would then take her to the police station \u2013 to the rape suite, as they are lovingly called. Or would I? Would I tell her to go through a system that would involve her being questioned about what she was wearing? Did she know the guy? Did they exchange texts? Had she been drinking? Would I tell her to go through an investigation during which her phone and her laptop could be taken from her; to get involved in a process that could take two years to get to court? Could I give her that advice in the full knowledge that the guy would probably get away with it? Would I give her a lecture on her duty to other women on the basis he might rape again? I don\u2019t know. It sticks in my craw to say this, but it has never been easier to get away with rape. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is in crisis. The number of reported rapes is rising, but half of rape victims are dropping out of prosecutions even when the suspect has been identified. Police are referring fewer cases to the CPS, which in turn is prosecuting fewer cases. This is the way it has been going for a decade. The number of convictions has dropped. Who really cares? This is simply another depressing \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d, although I would like it to be everyone\u2019s issue. Dare I say it is also an electoral issue? I often think of Andrea Dworkin saying she was less concerned with men learning to cry than with them stopping \u201cthe crimes of violence against us\u201d. I don\u2019t need men to tell me rape is awful. I need them to take it seriously enough to change the system. Every day I am told what the real issues are: austerity, hospitals, housing, the weird void that is Brexit. Violence against women? Not so much. A crime, sure, but a fact of life. Women live in fear of sexual assault, and modify their behaviour accordingly. This is captivity redefined as common sense. Girls wear cycling shorts under their skirts at school or when doing bar work to stop men grabbing them. A woman\u2019s job is to stop men raping them. This is rape culture, then \u2013 where we all assume violence against women is inevitable. To change that requires political will. Where is it? Women who have had sex in the past have apparently surrendered their rights, and now they have to surrender their digital pasts, too. The newly popular \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d defence implies complicity in your own murder. The US president is a pussy grabber. Harvey Weinstein wanders free while awaiting trial for allegations he denies. Brett Kavanaugh sits on the US supreme court, despite the allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against him, which again he denies. Here in Britain, we shared the rush of the #MeToo movement; a moment when we understood the ubiquity of sexual violence. Why then is the system still failing us in plain sight? Why is this not a priority? Enough essays now on consent, kink and ambivalence, all portrayed as interesting grey areas.

      "body": "<p>On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver ripped into frivolous lawsuits meant to silence dissent, an issue with which he has personal experience: two years ago, Last Week Tonight was sued by Bob Murray, the then CEO of Murray Energy, the largest private coal company in America, after the show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw6RsUhw1Q8\">did a segment</a> highly critical of the coal executive.</p> <p>Since then, \u201cbecause the case has been in litigation, we haven\u2019t been able to discuss it\u201d, Oliver explained. But Murray recently dropped the lawsuit, \u201cso we can finally tell you exactly what happened \u2013 which is honestly worth doing, not only because it\u2019s a crazy story, but it actually points to a much bigger problem here\u201d.</p> <p>But first, Oliver offered some background on the Murray lawsuit: Murray objected to Oliver\u2019s characterization of him as \u201csomeone who looks like a geriatric Dr Evil\u201d and a segment in which a staff member dressed up as a squirrel and delivered the message \u201cEat shit, Bob!\u201d on a large check (in reference to a former employee\u2019s diss of the CEO written on a $3.22 bonus check).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN8bJb8biZU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UN8bJb8biZU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Murray\u2019s lawsuit sought damages, because he claimed that \u201cnothing has ever stressed him more than this vicious and untruthful attack\u201d. It\u2019s \u201can odd thing to say\u201d, Oliver commented, \u201cgiven that, as I just mentioned, he oversaw a company whose mine collapse in Utah resulted in the deaths of nine people.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, the lawsuit was a bullshit attempt to silence us,\u201d Oliver continued, \u201cperhaps best exemplified by a motion that Murray filed to try to get a gag order to prevent us from rebroadcasting the story or even having it up online.\u201d (The piece is still online, \u201cbig time\u201d, at <a href=\"http://www.stillontheinternetbigtime.com\">www.stillontheinternetbigtime.com</a>.)</p> <p>The lawsuit was, unsurprisingly, dismissed by a West Virginia court last February, but Murray appealed the case to the West Virginia supreme court. The case languished there for over a year before Murray dropped it (Murray Energy is also, perhaps relatedly, now reorganizing for bankruptcy).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/04/john-oliver-exploitable-voting-machines\">John Oliver on exploitable voting machines: 'We must fix this'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which raises the question: \u201cWhat was the point of him putting us through all of this in the first place?\u201d Oliver asked. \u201cI would argue that winning the case was never really his goal.\u201d And that intent connects to Oliver\u2019s larger issue of the day: Slapp (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) lawsuits. Slapp suits are, Oliver explained, \u201cfrivolous suits with no legal merit specifically designed to stifle public debate or dissent.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole point is to put the defendant through a difficult, painful experience and even if cases fail in lower court, as they often do, the plaintiffs can find ways to extend them through intensive discovery requests, depositions and appeals that drain the defendants\u2019 time and resources.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much everyone from judges to legal scholars agree that Slapp suits are a scourge,\u201d Oliver continued, which is why 30 states have some sort of anti-Slapp legislation, usually requiring plaintiffs to sufficiently justify their claims early in the process. But that means 20 states do not have such laws \u2013 including West Virginia, where Murray filed his suit against Oliver despite neither of them living in the state. Murray also, according to the Washington Post, sued nine journalists between 2001 and 2015 for critical coverage, as well as environmental protesters at the company\u2019s headquarters in Ohio.

      "bodyText": "On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver ripped into frivolous lawsuits meant to silence dissent, an issue with which he has personal experience: two years ago, Last Week Tonight was sued by Bob Murray, the then CEO of Murray Energy, the largest private coal company in America, after the show did a segment highly critical of the coal executive. Since then, \u201cbecause the case has been in litigation, we haven\u2019t been able to discuss it\u201d, Oliver explained. But Murray recently dropped the lawsuit, \u201cso we can finally tell you exactly what happened \u2013 which is honestly worth doing, not only because it\u2019s a crazy story, but it actually points to a much bigger problem here\u201d. But first, Oliver offered some background on the Murray lawsuit: Murray objected to Oliver\u2019s characterization of him as \u201csomeone who looks like a geriatric Dr Evil\u201d and a segment in which a staff member dressed up as a squirrel and delivered the message \u201cEat shit, Bob!\u201d on a large check (in reference to a former employee\u2019s diss of the CEO written on a $3.22 bonus check). Murray\u2019s lawsuit sought damages, because he claimed that \u201cnothing has ever stressed him more than this vicious and untruthful attack\u201d. It\u2019s \u201can odd thing to say\u201d, Oliver commented, \u201cgiven that, as I just mentioned, he oversaw a company whose mine collapse in Utah resulted in the deaths of nine people. \u201cObviously, the lawsuit was a bullshit attempt to silence us,\u201d Oliver continued, \u201cperhaps best exemplified by a motion that Murray filed to try to get a gag order to prevent us from rebroadcasting the story or even having it up online.\u201d (The piece is still online, \u201cbig time\u201d, at www.stillontheinternetbigtime.com.) The lawsuit was, unsurprisingly, dismissed by a West Virginia court last February, but Murray appealed the case to the West Virginia supreme court. The case languished there for over a year before Murray dropped it (Murray Energy is also, perhaps relatedly, now reorganizing for bankruptcy). Which raises the question: \u201cWhat was the point of him putting us through all of this in the first place?\u201d Oliver asked. \u201cI would argue that winning the case was never really his goal.\u201d And that intent connects to Oliver\u2019s larger issue of the day: Slapp (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) lawsuits. Slapp suits are, Oliver explained, \u201cfrivolous suits with no legal merit specifically designed to stifle public debate or dissent. \u201cThe whole point is to put the defendant through a difficult, painful experience and even if cases fail in lower court, as they often do, the plaintiffs can find ways to extend them through intensive discovery requests, depositions and appeals that drain the defendants\u2019 time and resources. \u201cPretty much everyone from judges to legal scholars agree that Slapp suits are a scourge,\u201d Oliver continued, which is why 30 states have some sort of anti-Slapp legislation, usually requiring plaintiffs to sufficiently justify their claims early in the process. But that means 20 states do not have such laws \u2013 including West Virginia, where Murray filed his suit against Oliver despite neither of them living in the state. Murray also, according to the Washington Post, sued nine journalists between 2001 and 2015 for critical coverage, as well as environmental protesters at the company\u2019s headquarters in Ohio. The local newspaper that covered the small protest, the Chagrin Valley Times, and the protest\u2019s organizers beat Murray\u2019s suit but were tied up in litigation for years; the paper paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and removed its Murray-related articles from its website. The Ohio judge in the 2014 case explicitly wrote in his decision that the ruling demonstrated the need for Ohio to adopt anti-Slapp legislation. This was the point, Oliver said: \u201cLawsuits are like famous Instagram pugs \u2013 they don\u2019t have to work to be considered very, very successful. \u201cBy cultivating a reputation for being aggressively litigious, Murray may have actually got what he wanted and successfully applied a chokehold to how he is covered.\u201d Oliver pointed to two lawsuits against Murray with serious and corroborated accounts of workplace harassment and misconduct that have been suspiciously underreported in the press. \u201cI would argue that one reason [for the silence] might be that organizations are justifiably wary of getting sued by Murray,\u201d Oliver said, \u201cbecause even if they are baseless, his lawsuits can do major damage.\u201d The suit against Last Week Tonight cost them over $200,000 in legal fees, Oliver said, \u201cand even though our insurance covered part of it, and we were lucky that HBO stood by us. This lawsuit was infuriating, took up a lot of time and resources, and resulted in a tripling of our libel insurance premiums despite the fact that, to reiterate: we fucking won this case!\u201d The whole episode points to how \u201cwe badly need effective anti-Slapp laws nationwide to deter powerful people like Bob Murray from using the courts to shut down people\u2019s legitimate dissent\u201d, Oliver said. Murray will probably sue them again for the new segment, Oliver concluded, despite the fact that every line was vigorously vetted by lawyers and that \u201cloose, figurative language that cannot reasonably be understood to convey facts\u201d \u2013 AKA jokes \u2013 have long been considered protected speech by the supreme court. And in the end, Oliver said, \u201cit would be really tempting to say a bunch of loose, figurative things about Bob Murray right now not just on our behalf, but on behalf of every small newspaper and individual that he has sued and on behalf of every employee who\u2019s felt ill-treated by his company and who may have wanted to tell him to, say, eat shit, but couldn\u2019t\u201d. The last two years have been \u201ctoo exhausting\u201d to say more about Bob Murray, Oliver said \u2013 but he could sing, and he launched into a five-minute, Times Square-set musical number of jokes aptly titled Eat Shit, Bob.",

      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank\u2019s latest statement of monetary policy release on Friday had a rather upbeat tone that has been reflected somewhat by investors. And yet, it is actually a pretty dismal level of optimism. A decade on from the GFC, what constitutes an upbeat assessment is one that is rather depressing, and where the return to average growth is continually pushed off to a later date. Less than a month ago the odds seemed pretty short that we would be seeing another interest rate cut to 0.5%; now the market predicts around only a 50% chance of that happening by May next year: There is actually not a great deal of reasoning behind that change in outlook. Yes, there has been a pickup in housing lending, but credit growth remains very limp so the RBA would certainly not be worried at this stage about housing prices taking off. Retail trade figures in September were awful and inflation growth also remains utterly moribund. It is as though investors have just decided the Reserve Bank won\u2019t cut rates any lower and will try other means \u2013 such as quantitative easing. Or perhaps it believes that next month\u2019s mid-year fiscal and economic outlook (Myefo) might contain some stimulatory package that could offset the need for another cut. That would be a logical response from the government, but given the government\u2019s recent statements it is not a logical expectation. At least the bond market is now suggesting better times ahead.

In its latest statement on monetary policy released on Friday it headlined its domestic outlook: \u201cDomestic growth is expected to strengthen\u201d. The \u201cstrengthening\u201d, however, is not for a while. Yes, the RBA expects GDP and household consumption growth to improve but it only sees GDP growth reach 3% by June 2021: And while you might think, oh well, good things come to those who wait, and at least the RBA has a positive outlook, it is worth recalling that in its November statement in 2018 its headline was: \u201cDomestic GDP growth is expected to remain above trend over the forecast period.\u201d It didn\u2019t. In fact this year has seen a pretty significant decline in the outlook for GDP growth compared with last year: This time last year the Reserve Bank was anticipating GDP to grow by 3.2% in the 12 months to June 2019 \u2013 it ended up being less than half that at just 1.4%. So while it might be nice that the RBA now sees GDP growth getting back to above 3% by the end of 2021 \u2013 i.e. more than two years away \u2013 let us not treat it as a prediction set in stone. Similarly, the RBA has downgraded its predictions for wages growth. Last year it hoped wages would be growing by 2.6% by the middle of next year.

Underlying all of these predictions, both from the market and the RBA itself, is a bizarre reality that even with interest rates at record lows, there is no expectation of a return to average growth for another two years. Two more years of tepid economic activity and an expectation the Reserve Bank will no longer cut rates but might have to undertake more extreme measures. And this is all based around the fact that there is little expectation the government will do anything other than talk up the importance of the budget surplus. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "Payday loans targeting the financially vulnerable are being taken out at the rate of more than 30,000 a week, with the amount borrowed in Australia on track to be worth $1.7bn by year\u2019s end. New data on the industry to be released on Tuesday shows that 4.7 million individual loans worth an estimated $3bn have been paid out in the past three years, with more than 310,000 extra households taking on the high-interest debt products since mid-2016. The number of loans being written per month has skyrocketed from 100,000 a month in 2016 to more than 135,000 a month this year, generating lenders an estimated $550m profit over the past three years. The Stop the Dept Trap alliance, comprising 20 consumer advocacy groups, will release the report to highlight the harm caused by ongoing delays to laws to crack down on the sector promised by the Coalition in 2016. A draft of small amount credit contract legislation to increase protections for vulnerable consumers was released by the government in 2017, but despite promising it would introduce the bill by the end of that year, it failed to do so. Short-term, high-interest loans, which are for amounts up to $2,000 and charge annual interest rates as high as 407%, are targeted at people in financial stress and can see vulnerable people caught in a debt spiral. The Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive, Gerard Brody, said the amount lent through the sector in the past three years had doubled from $881m in 2016 to the $1.7bn estimate for the end of 2019. \u201cThe harm continues to grow and there is a growing proportion of households that are affected by these products,\u201d Brody told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat these loans do is hold people back and prevent them from getting ahead.\u201d Fuelling the booming sector has been the growth in online loans, with the research showing that 85.8% of loans are generated online, compared to just 5.6% a decade ago. The research also highlights the number of financially stressed and financially distressed households that are indebted to the sector. The report defines financially stressed as those who cope with their financial situation by juggling credit cards and loans, but who are described as the \u201cworking poor\u201d, while the financially distressed are not meeting their financial commitments and are often dependent on welfare. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to the research, the number of financially stressed households with payday loans has jumped from just 21,000 in 2010 to 554,000. About 15% of payday loan borrowers are expected to fall into a debt spiral, meaning an extra 324,000 Australian households face entering a debt path that may result in events such as bankruptcy. Brody said the growth in financially stressed households accessing loans in the sector was the result of a combination of the ease with which people could access loans online, the lack of regulation and a growing number of people in financial stress. \u201cThere is a group in the community that are increasingly doing it tough, for those lower income working folk, their lives are becoming increasingly insecure and that is why they are turning to this industry.\u201d The number of women using payday loans has also risen, jumping more than 100,000 since 2016 to 287,000, to now account for 23% of all borrowers, with almost half of these single parents. Brody said that while the government had been \u201cacting all tough\u201d on the banks since the royal commission, it was allowing unscrupulous payday lenders to escape legislative reform that would help protect consumers. It wants the recommendations of the Small Amount Credit Contract review \u201curgently\u201d passed into law, putting in place a cap on the total payments of a consumer lease and limiting loan repayments to 10% of a consumer\u2019s income. \u201cThis legislation will be critical to making payday loans and consumer leases fair for all Australians. There are only 10 sitting days left to get it done,\u201d Brody said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the federal government to do their part to protect Australians from financial harm and introduce these changes to Parliament as a matter of urgency.\u201d The assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, has said the government remains committed to reforming the sector, but reforms must \u201cstrike the right balance in enhancing consumer protection, while also ensuring these products and services can continue to fulfil an important role in the economy.\u201d The delay over the reforms comes after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was forced to hose down suggestions of an internal backlash over the changes, saying as treasurer that he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about people on low incomes getting into deeper financial difficulty. Last year, the Nationals MP George Christensen was one who spoke out against the proposed crackdown, saying the industry was needed for those \u201cdesperate\u201d for financial help. The Institute of Public Affairs, the National Credit Providers Association and the Consumer Household Equipment Rental Providers Association have been lobbying the government not to support the changes.",

But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won\u2019t be necessary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2019/nov/11/are-electric-cars-cheaper-to-maintain-and-four-other-common-ev-questions-answered\">\u2018Are electric cars cheaper to maintain?\u2019 \u2013 and four other common EV questions answered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,\u201d says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. \u201cBut once they get started, they discover there\u2019s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.\u201d</p> <p>When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about \u201crange anxiety\u201d \u2013 the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn\u2019t a cause for concern. \u201cThe New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,\u201d explains Rice. \u201cAnd that\u2019s plenty for most of us.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts09-vehicle-mileage-and-occupancy#table-nts0901\" rel=\"nofollow\">7,400</a> \u2013 this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people\u2019s day-to-day needs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7727c8947591fa0f8611d2f29cff98aa5d410e8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7727c8947591fa0f8611d2f29cff98aa5d410e8e/0_475_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RENAULT ZOE (B10)E3 VERSION\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you need to charge up when out and about, the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frithjof Ohm INCL.

Most electric car drivers charge at home \u2013 something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there\u2019s no need to panic \u2013 the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to <a href=\"https://www.zap-map.com/statistics/#location\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zap-Map</a>).</p> <p>And with cheap running costs, electric cars can be good for your bank balance as well as your conscience. The initial cost of an electric car tends to be higher than that of a petrol or diesel equivalent \u2013 though the government currently offers a grant of up to \u00a33,500 towards brand new 100% electric vehicles.</p> <p>But it\u2019s in the daily running costs where electric vehicles really excel. Fully electric vehicles with a list price of under \u00a340,000 are exempt from vehicle excise duty (AKA road tax) as well as London\u2019s congestion charge and its ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) charge. EVs don\u2019t need oil changes and have fewer moving parts, so you could save 20-30% on servicing and maintenance costs compared with a petrol or diesel car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Do you have a pressing question about electric cars?

      "bodyText": "At the back of many motorists\u2019 minds, there\u2019s a nagging question: should my next car be electric? Increasing numbers of them are deciding \u2013 yes, it should. Electric vehicle (EV) sales are accelerating rapidly, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) figures for September 2019 showing a 236.4% rise year-on-year. There\u2019s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won\u2019t be necessary. \u201cPeople often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,\u201d says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. \u201cBut once they get started, they discover there\u2019s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.\u201d When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about \u201crange anxiety\u201d \u2013 the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn\u2019t a cause for concern. \u201cThe New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,\u201d explains Rice. \u201cAnd that\u2019s plenty for most of us.\u201d According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 \u2013 this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people\u2019s day-to-day needs. And when you do need to charge your battery, it\u2019s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home \u2013 something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there\u2019s no need to panic \u2013 the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map). And with cheap running costs, electric cars can be good for your bank balance as well as your conscience. The initial cost of an electric car tends to be higher than that of a petrol or diesel equivalent \u2013 though the government currently offers a grant of up to \u00a33,500 towards brand new 100% electric vehicles. But it\u2019s in the daily running costs where electric vehicles really excel. Fully electric vehicles with a list price of under \u00a340,000 are exempt from vehicle excise duty (AKA road tax) as well as London\u2019s congestion charge and its ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) charge. EVs don\u2019t need oil changes and have fewer moving parts, so you could save 20-30% on servicing and maintenance costs compared with a petrol or diesel car. And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car. But choosing a car isn\u2019t just about drawing up budgets \u2013 it\u2019s about how it feels. And if you\u2019ve never driven an electric car before then it\u2019s time to get behind the wheel. \u201cI find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,\u201d says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. \u201cAs there\u2019s no gear changes, they\u2019re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float \u2013 they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,\u201d suggests Rice. \u201cAnd don\u2019t just try it out in town \u2013 take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do.

An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts.

Submit it above for your chance to have your question answered by an EV expert...</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Battery technology is developing rapidly, so newer EVs will have a greater range than older models. For example, the New Renault ZOE has a 52kWh battery, which is good for up to 245 miles, according to Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) testing*. That\u2019s a 73% increase in battery capacity compared with the first ZOE, which launched seven years previously.</p> <p>Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.</p> <p><strong>Do electric cars pay road tax?<br></strong>Yes and no \u2026 depending on the age and price.</p> <p>All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called \u201croad tax\u201d), as it\u2019s all based on tailpipe emissions \u2013 and as EVs generate 0 g/km of CO<sub>2</sub>, they\u2019re exempt.</p> <p>However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over \u00a340,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (\u00a3310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.</p> <p>Fortunately, it\u2019s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the \u00a340,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at \u00a325,670 \u2013 no VED is just one of the reasons it\u2019s the ideal first electric car.</p> <p><strong>Are electric cars automatic?<br></strong>Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don\u2019t have a clutch or gear stick, but that\u2019s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don\u2019t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.</p> <p>Confused? Rice explains: \u201cICE cars need gears as they can only generate power/torque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0dd26561c5d38cfc4305d0a82edeeafa29c4daa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd26561c5d38cfc4305d0a82edeeafa29c4daa1/0_0_3540_5000/708.jpg\" alt=\"RENAULT ZOE (B10)ACCESSOIRE - PRISE DOMESTIQUE GREEN\u2019UP\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dedicated home charger - provided for free** with a New Renault ZOE - is far faster than an normal plug</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PRODIGIOUS Production/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Can I charge my electric car at home?<br></strong>Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it\u2019s the preferred option for most EV owners.</p> <p>When it comes to charging at home, you have two options.

The worst thing that I could possibly imagine had just happened \u2013 I had signed and dated proof that I wasn\u2019t a good driver \u2013 but it didn\u2019t mean that I wasn\u2019t a good enough human. Knowing I had room to improve made me realise that I had room to breathe, too. The path of progress is paved with first times \u2013 first kisses, first dates, first days of university, first jobs and, yes, even first failures. But failure isn\u2019t a permanent state of disgrace, it\u2019s a call to evolve, practise patience, overcome adversity and celebrate the fact that life isn\u2019t necessarily about getting to your final destination as fast as you can. Every success I\u2019ve experienced is a result of something I learned that first time I failed my driving test. My first failure was a lesson in humility, resilience, and in really getting to grips with the mechanics of windscreen wipers, and led to something money can\u2019t buy \u2013 truly believing in myself for the very first time.

Harsh decisions? \u201cThat is to the referees,\u201d said Pep. But they were harsh decisions, eh? \u201cAsk the referees please, not to me,\u201d he replied. But surely you must have an opinion, Pep? \u201cAsk Mike Reilly and the guys who are in the VAR, don\u2019t ask me,\u201d he insisted, sounding not unlike a captive soldier refusing to divulge any information other than his name, rank and service number.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/10/liverpool-symmetrical-full-backs-world-leaders\">Liverpool\u2019s symmetrical full-backs have turned them into world leaders | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While he probably won\u2019t care, Pep learned today that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/11/manchester-city-better-liverpool-luck-rodri\">won\u2019t face censure</a> for ostentatiously shouting \u201cTHANK YOU <em>SOOOO</em> MUCH!!!\u201d at referee Michael Oliver while pumping the official\u2019s hand shortly after the final whistle. Showing rare self-awareness, the FA decided that levelling a charge of \u201cexpressing sarcastic gratitude\u201d might send him over the edge altogether, not least because it would be impossible to defend oneself against such a charge without sounding even more like Kevin The Teenager than at the time of the original alleged offence.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters after the game, Rodri claimed his side were vastly superior over the course of the 90 minutes, although it remains to be seen if the FA haul in the City midfielder to answer charges of sarcastic excuse-making. \u201cI think we were much better overall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe created more chances than them, but they arrive to our goal three times and scored three goals. We are leaving with a bittersweet feeling, because we wanted to win.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately for Rodri and chums, Liverpool also wanted to win and did so in fine style, prompting their manager to sing his side\u2019s praises. \u201cI am so proud of my team more than ever,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cTo make this performance against the strongest team in Europe \u2013 so proud. I am so proud, we played so good.\u201d Actually, hang on \u2026 it was actually Pep who said that and on this occasion we <em>think</em> he actually meant it. With sarcasm being the brain\u2019s natural defence against the less intelligent, it\u2019s small wonder the Fiver has spent all day feeling more than a mite confused.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI love my race, I fight for colour, whatever I do is for us, for love \u2026 I will never shut up in the face of such an inhuman and despicable act!

      "bodyText": "PEP TALK Short of dashing out of his technical area to procure a tree branch with which to give Mike Dean a damned good thrashing, it\u2019s difficult to imagine quite how Pep Guardiola could have gone more Basil Fawlty on the fourth official during Manchester City\u2019s defeat at the hands of Liverpool yesterday. More specifically, it was the hands of Trent Alexander-Arnold that Pep felt had cost his team, what with the young full-back pawing the ball twice in his own penalty area but getting away with it on both occasions. Harsh decisions? \u201cThat is to the referees,\u201d said Pep. But they were harsh decisions, eh? \u201cAsk the referees please, not to me,\u201d he replied. But surely you must have an opinion, Pep? \u201cAsk Mike Reilly and the guys who are in the VAR, don\u2019t ask me,\u201d he insisted, sounding not unlike a captive soldier refusing to divulge any information other than his name, rank and service number. While he probably won\u2019t care, Pep learned today that he won\u2019t face censure for ostentatiously shouting \u201cTHANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!!!\u201d at referee Michael Oliver while pumping the official\u2019s hand shortly after the final whistle. Showing rare self-awareness, the FA decided that levelling a charge of \u201cexpressing sarcastic gratitude\u201d might send him over the edge altogether, not least because it would be impossible to defend oneself against such a charge without sounding even more like Kevin The Teenager than at the time of the original alleged offence. Speaking to reporters after the game, Rodri claimed his side were vastly superior over the course of the 90 minutes, although it remains to be seen if the FA haul in the City midfielder to answer charges of sarcastic excuse-making. \u201cI think we were much better overall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe created more chances than them, but they arrive to our goal three times and scored three goals. We are leaving with a bittersweet feeling, because we wanted to win.\u201d Unfortunately for Rodri and chums, Liverpool also wanted to win and did so in fine style, prompting their manager to sing his side\u2019s praises. \u201cI am so proud of my team more than ever,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cTo make this performance against the strongest team in Europe \u2013 so proud. I am so proud, we played so good.\u201d Actually, hang on \u2026 it was actually Pep who said that and on this occasion we think he actually meant it. With sarcasm being the brain\u2019s natural defence against the less intelligent, it\u2019s small wonder the Fiver has spent all day feeling more than a mite confused. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI love my race, I fight for colour, whatever I do is for us, for love \u2026 I will never shut up in the face of such an inhuman and despicable act! My tears were of indignation, repudiation and helplessness, helplessness that I could do nothing at that moment. But we are taught very early to be strong and to fight! Fight for our rights and for equality! My role is to fight, to beat my chest, to lift my head and keep fighting always. In a racist society, it is not enough not to be racist, we must be anti-racist. Football needs more respect, the world needs more respect!\u201d \u2013 Shakhtar\u2019s Taison makes a statement after being sent off for responding to racist abuse from Dynamo Kyiv fans. The Brazilian player gave the crowd the finger and booted the match-ball into the stands, for which he was shown a red card. RECOMMENDED LISTENING FOOTBALL WEEKLY! FOOTBALL WEEKLY!!

Meanwhile, Granit Xhaka says he can see a future at Arsenal despite \u2026 you know. \u201cI\u2019ve been 100% behind the club since I came here,\u201d he told Swiss newspaper Blick. \u201cWhen my shirt number lit up on the fourth official\u2019s panel and our own fans broke into gleeful jubilation, that hit me very hard and really upset me,\u201d Xhaka sobbed. \u201cIt was very hurtful and frustrating.\u201d Phil Neville will be without four players for England\u2019s friendly with Czech Republic on Tuesday. Steph Houghton and Ellen White are rested, while Jodie Taylor and Alex Greenwood have pulled out with injuries. In a landmark day for the Fiver, He Did One during Juventus\u2019s home win over Milan. He walked down the tunnel after being replaced by eventual matchwinner Paulo Dybala, and reportedly left the ground before the final whistle. \u201cIt is a problem to be resolved with His teammates,\u201d puffed Maurizio Sarri. Fun and games in the Bundesliga: Eintracht Frankfurt captain David Abraham was sent off after bundling Freiburg coach Christian Streich to the floor in the closing minutes of Freiburg\u2019s 1-0 win. \u201cFootball is a contact sport,\u201d Streich mused afterwards, \u201c[but] that was on the wrong side of it. At 54, you can be run over by a young buffalo.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp is relaxed about the prospect of winning Liverpool\u2019s first Club World Cup next month. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that,\u201d he breezed. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who has to be the first on the moon or the first winning the [Club] World Cup with Liverpool,\u201d added Klopp, who was a year old when Neil Armstrong comfortably beat him to it. Matteo Guendouzi could earn his first senior France cap during the international break, after being called up to replace the injured Blaise Matuidi for the qualifiers against Moldova and Albania.

It was the largest uprising of enslaved people in American history, and involved up to 500 rebels from across the west African diaspora and from multiple plantations, who rose up against planters in a region marked for its particular brutality against the enslaved. They planned to march on New Orleans.</p> \n<p>Scott\u2019s re-enactment began on a cold, grey Friday morning outside a baptist church on the fringes of the small town of LaPlace, about 30 miles from New Orleans. Scott, 54, disembarked from a white coach holding a machete. As a small group of re-enactors followed in single file, holding replica muskets, pitchforks and sickles, he turned to them. \u201cThose who wish to die free, rise with me!\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The rebels chanted a chorus:</p> \n<p><em>On to New Orleans!</em></p> \n<p><em>Freedom or death!</em></p> \n<p><em>We\u2019re going to end slavery!</em></p> \n<p><em>Join us!</em></p> \n<p>In an interview two weeks before the performance began, Scott said the idea of re-enacting a slave rebellion came to him six years ago. He was drawn to 1811 because of its explicitly political nature, the depth of its organization and the fact it has largely been overlooked by historians.</p> \n<p>Within six months of deciding on the concept, he met the British artist Jeremy Deller in London. Deller, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/dec/06/turnerprize2004.turnerprize\">who won the Turner prize in 2004</a>, had staged a re-enactment of a violent confrontation in 1984 between police and striking miners in Yorkshire named <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/deller-the-battle-of-orgreave-archive-an-injury-to-one-is-an-injury-to-all-t12185\">The Battle of Orgreave</a>. Scott had been loosely aware of the work before \u2013 but became more attuned to its relevance as he started to plan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F41548f66958e1cca0eed1c81eac733065cf526ec%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5760_3840&amp;left-caption=Reenactors%20under%20the%20direction%20of%20performance%20artist%20Dread%20Scott.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff35b04fd443a9b2e739b1bcfe172e57158ba4004%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3879_2551&amp;right-caption=Photographs%20by%20Marianna%20Massey%2FGetty%20Images&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"portrait + march 1\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F41548f66958e1cca0eed1c81eac733065cf526ec%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5760_3840&amp;left-caption=Reenactors%20under%20the%20direction%20of%20performance%20artist%20Dread%20Scott.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff35b04fd443a9b2e739b1bcfe172e57158ba4004%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3879_2551&amp;right-caption=Photographs%20by%20Marianna%20Massey%2FGetty%20Images&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\">portrait + march 1</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cArtists are starting to use re-enactment to talk about this connection between past and present,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a tradition I\u2019m working in, but it\u2019s also something that\u2019s a developing field.\u201d</p> \n<p>It took years to raise the funds of over $1m, which included <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/antennaworks/slave-rebellion-reenactment\">money from 500 individual donations</a>, to pull off the spectacle. But as word of mouth about the project got out, African Americans from all over the country signed up.</p> \n<p>Re-enactment culture in the US has largely been confined to white spaces and traditional history. Scott hoped from the outset that the piece would represent a transformative experience for all of those taking part. Many participants, like pastor Donald August, came from southern Louisiana and traced their ancestry back to slavery in this region.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy great-grandmother was a slave here,\u201d he said, holding a replica pistol. \u201cThis is empowering, it\u2019s enlightening. For years I\u2019ve tried to understand this 1811 revolt, to understand the mindset of the people participating who fought for freedom.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It gives me a piece of gratitude for what I have in my life, and what my ancestors experienced for me just to be here</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Others had travelled from Illinois, California and New York.</p> \n<p>Some, like Betty Love, who recently moved to New Orleans from Seattle, knew nothing about the rebellion beforehand and used the experience to get closer to her roots.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put this into words,\u201d Love said. \u201cI get overtaken by emotion.

      "bodyText": "Ten years after police in Oakland killed his unarmed nephew Oscar Grant, Cephus \u201cBobby\u201d Johnson put on a coarse cloth shirt and a red replica headpiece, clutched a machete and marched with 400 other re-enactors through the old plantation land of southern Louisiana. Over two days, men and women marched 26 miles, through winding levee walkways, suburban sprawl and the historic streets of New Orleans, dressed as participants from a little-known slave rebellion that occurred here in 1811. The re-enactment was a piece of performance art by the New York artist Dread Scott. For many taking part, it was an experience grounded in the trauma and complications of the present day. Johnson thought about Grant. His 2009 shooting death became a focal point in the nationwide struggle for racial justice, well before the white officer who pulled the trigger was convicted of manslaughter. \u201cOscar didn\u2019t die in vain. And neither did our sisters and brothers that took the sword and took the cane machete to fight and die for freedom,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey opened the door for us to be standing here today.\u201d The 1811 revolt had been written out of formal history for much of the 20th century until, in 1996, a historian named Albert Thrasher published a book that re-examined its significance. It was the largest uprising of enslaved people in American history, and involved up to 500 rebels from across the west African diaspora and from multiple plantations, who rose up against planters in a region marked for its particular brutality against the enslaved. They planned to march on New Orleans. Scott\u2019s re-enactment began on a cold, grey Friday morning outside a baptist church on the fringes of the small town of LaPlace, about 30 miles from New Orleans. Scott, 54, disembarked from a white coach holding a machete. As a small group of re-enactors followed in single file, holding replica muskets, pitchforks and sickles, he turned to them. \u201cThose who wish to die free, rise with me!\u201d he said. The rebels chanted a chorus: On to New Orleans! Freedom or death! We\u2019re going to end slavery! Join us! In an interview two weeks before the performance began, Scott said the idea of re-enacting a slave rebellion came to him six years ago. He was drawn to 1811 because of its explicitly political nature, the depth of its organization and the fact it has largely been overlooked by historians. Within six months of deciding on the concept, he met the British artist Jeremy Deller in London. Deller, who won the Turner prize in 2004, had staged a re-enactment of a violent confrontation in 1984 between police and striking miners in Yorkshire named The Battle of Orgreave. Scott had been loosely aware of the work before \u2013 but became more attuned to its relevance as he started to plan. \u201cArtists are starting to use re-enactment to talk about this connection between past and present,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a tradition I\u2019m working in, but it\u2019s also something that\u2019s a developing field.\u201d It took years to raise the funds of over $1m, which included money from 500 individual donations, to pull off the spectacle. But as word of mouth about the project got out, African Americans from all over the country signed up. Re-enactment culture in the US has largely been confined to white spaces and traditional history. Scott hoped from the outset that the piece would represent a transformative experience for all of those taking part. Many participants, like pastor Donald August, came from southern Louisiana and traced their ancestry back to slavery in this region. \u201cMy great-grandmother was a slave here,\u201d he said, holding a replica pistol. \u201cThis is empowering, it\u2019s enlightening. For years I\u2019ve tried to understand this 1811 revolt, to understand the mindset of the people participating who fought for freedom.\u201d Others had travelled from Illinois, California and New York. Some, like Betty Love, who recently moved to New Orleans from Seattle, knew nothing about the rebellion beforehand and used the experience to get closer to her roots. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put this into words,\u201d Love said. \u201cI get overtaken by emotion. It gives me a piece of gratitude for what I have in my life, and what my ancestors experienced for me just to be here.\u201d From the Baptist church, Scott\u2019s rebels marched in a tight, three-berth line, a few hundred yards to the Woodland plantation house. The former sugar plantation home, built in 1793, is still standing today and was where the rebellion began in January 1811. According to recent histories, the small group of rebels waited until nightfall to storm the building, hacking the son of a planter to death, and badly injuring the home\u2019s owner. They were led by a slave driver named Charles Deslondes, and burned down a number of plantation homes as they marched towards the city, picking up more rebels along the way. On the march, Scott assumed the role of Deslondes. Neighbors stood by their homes and peeked out of their windows, as about 60 re-enactors brandished their weapons and cheered as a white actor giving a particularly flamboyant performance was executed on the front porch. As it wound along the sparse streets of LaPlace, the re-enactment drew a visceral reaction from a group of onlookers. At an elementary school along the route, dozens of children had been brought outside to watch the marchers go by. Afterwards, Toni Robinette, the principal, wiped her eyes and asked them: \u201cY\u2019all understand what slavery was?\u201d \u201cSlavery was tragedy,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were stolen, taken from their homeland. Taken here to do what?\u201d \u201cWork,\u201d the students called. Robinette said later that the students are only beginning to study the history of enslavement in Louisiana. Claudine Hebert, 64, stood outside in her house in her bathrobe, photographing the re-enactors on her phone. \u201cIt makes it real,\u201d Hebert said. \u201cYou can see things or read things, but to actually see it live makes a difference. I\u201dm hoping white people will stop this thinking that they\u2019re better than black people, because they\u2019re not.\u201d But in this red state that voted overwhelmingly to elect Donald Trump in 2016 and in 1989 elected a former Klan wizard to the state house, racist criticism was not far away. Kurt Falterman, 50, stood by his garage and watched, angry that the re-enactment caused traffic delays. \u201cThat\u2019s history.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage has had a long night of the where-the-soul-should-be. In seclusion from the media for the past 48 hours, the Brexit party leader has been contemplating the best way to wimp out like a boss from his promise to field 600 candidates in the forthcoming election. Those weren\u2019t the exact words Farage used in Hartlepool to describe the move, which will see his party contest none of the 317 seats the Conservatives won in 2017, and target only Labour instead. \u201cAfter 25 years of battling, it\u2019s not been easy,\u201d Nigel explained solemnly to a crowd of his supporters he\u2019d charged \u00a32.50 each to attend. He\u2019d \u201cgenuinely tried for months\u201d to put together a leave alliance between his party, Tory leavers and pro-Brexit Labour MPs, he lamented \u2013 but it could not be done. \u201cSo in a sense,\u201d he concluded, gearing up for a vintage Farage reverse ferret, \u201cwe now HAVE a leave alliance. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve done it unilaterally.\u201d Funny sort of alliance. Maybe spend some of the \u00a32.50s on a dictionary. As for what had prompted this change of heart, was it a high-level personal meeting with Boris Johnson? Written undertakings? Formal assurances? None of these, actually. \u201cLast night I saw Boris Johnson on a video,\u201d conceded Farage, \u201csaying we won\u2019t extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020.\u201d Aha. The ultimate guarantee \u2013 a Boris Johnson tweet. If this was supposed to be a rally, you\u2019d have to call it Triumph of the Willy. Here was a guy who\u2019d spent 10 days bullishly making Johnson an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse. And yet, it seems the PM does not negotiate with Faragists. The Brexit party leader is one of those hapless movie villains who tells a millionaire he\u2019s kidnapped his wife, and the millionaire goes: \u201cGreat, you can keep her.\u201d You knew Nigel was deeply subdued because he completely forgot to mention Armistice Day, a date out of which he\u2019d normally have wrung at least two minutes of material, despite having once appeared to a standing ovation at a rally for a German far-right party. The Hartlepool Grand hotel ballroom contained the sort of audience which regards standard paper poppies as tantamount to war grave urination. The minimum standard of poppy here was large enamel, rising through XXL enamel, to luxury jewelled, all the way up to six-inch crocheted. The Brexit party will still be contesting Hartlepool, fielding its party chairman, Richard Tice \u2013 a sort of radicalised knitting pattern model, who\u2019d be as at home showing off the shawl collar of an Aran cardigan as he would be finding out in real time what WTO laws actually mean. The best thing I heard about Tice was that, another lifetime ago, he shared a flat in Paris with the supermodel Kate Moss. He didn\u2019t mention that here.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the FTSE 100 index of top UK shares has closed 30 points lower at 7,328. Multinationals and major exporters were hit by the strengthening pound, although banks and house builders held onto their gains. Construction was one of the bright spots in the UK economy in the last quarter, growing by 0.6%. But economic uncertainty threatens to pull the sector back again. Clive Docwra, Managing Director of construction consulting and design agency McBains, explains; \u201cThese latest figures reflect the uncertainty the sector is currently experiencing. They show an increase in new work over July to September, and in particular higher than expected increases in housing, commercial and industrial new work, but a slowdown in September itself. We expect this slowdown to continue over the next few months, especially given last month\u2019s confirmation of a further delay in Brexit. \u201cBusiness and investors hate uncertainty, so the continuing saga of if and when the UK leaves the EU, plus the added unpredictability of the general election, means there will be a continued reluctance to commit funding to new projects. \u201cWe also need to see the major parties make strong policy commitments to boost the housebuilding programme, which is failing to deliver the number of homes required to meet the housing shortage.\u201d Business owners from construction, manufacturing and TV have told us how they\u2019re coping through the slowdown: Shares in UK banks and housebuilders are rallying in London, as fears of a hung parliament recede a little. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have both gained over 4%, as have building firms Persimmon and Barratt Development. Traders are calculating that Boris Johnson is strengthened by the Brexit Party\u2019s decision today not to challenge Conservative candidates in seats they won two years ago. The pound is still holding its earlier gains, at six-month highs against the euro. But there\u2019s still several weeks of electioneering to come, so plenty of time for twists and turns. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, explains: \u201cAll eyes must now be on the Liberal Democrats. Will Farage\u2019s move incite a mirror image reaction from the Liberal Democrats, potentially stepping aside in order to increase Labour\u2019s chances and \u201ctake the fight\u201d back to the Conservatives? As we approach the December 12 elections, investors should anticipate conflicting headlines, with currency moves perhaps disproportionate to the overall impact. Sterling is now at the whim of headline risk which, as Christmas approaches, waning market liquidity will exacerbate.\u201d Back on GDP.... Chris Giles of the Financial Times has done some impressive number crunching, to prove a couple of important points. 1) The growth rate of the UK economy has been slowing, slowly but steadily, over the last seventy years. 2) The UK lagged behind major rivals in the post-war period, before closing the gap after joining the European Common Market.... Over in New York, stocks have opened lower. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 139 points, or 0.5%, to 27,541. Trade war jitters are pulling Wall Street away from last Friday\u2019s record closing high. The broader S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq, are both down around 0.5%. Investors are disappointed that Donald Trump denied agreeing to lift some tariffs on China last week, to help secure a Phase One trade deal. Jingye has issued a statement, saying it plans to invest \u00a31.2bn in British Steel over the next decade. It also promised to make job offers to \u201cas many employees as possible\u201d across the group.... Newsflash: British Steel has been saved from closure, after a Chinese industrial giant agreed to buy the company\u2019s assets. Jingye Steel is lifting British Steel out of liquidation, a move that could save thousands of jobs at sites including its blast furnace in Scunthorpe. Here\u2019s the official announcement from the Official Receiver: The Official Receiver and Special Managers from EY can confirm that a sales contract has been entered into with Jingye Steel (UK) Ltd and Jingye Steel (UK) Holding Ltd (together, Jingye), to acquire the business and assets of British Steel Limited (BSL), including the steelworks at Scunthorpe, UK mills and shares of FN Steel BV, British Steel France Rail SAS and TSP Engineering. The sale also includes the shares owned by BSL in Redcar Bulk Terminal Limited. Completion of the contract is conditional on a number of matters, including gaining the necessary regulatory approvals. The parties are working together to conclude a sale as soon as reasonably practicable. The business will continue to trade as normal during the period between exchange and completion. Support from employees, suppliers and customers since the liquidation has been a critical factor in achieving this outcome. This move, if approved, would end six months of uncertainty, since British Steel fell into liquidation in May. Britain\u2019s growth was even slower once you adjust for population increases. This chart shows how growth on a per capita basis has been weak in recent quarter (data here). By my rough maths, GDP-per-capita only rose by 0.2% in the last quarter, slower than the headline increase of 0.3%. Officially, GDP-per-capita overtook its pre-crisis levels in 2015. But... Alfie Sterling of the New Economics Foundation has calculated that living standards are still below 2008 levels, once you adjust for consumer price inflation [rather than using the \u2018price deflator\u2019 used by the ONS to remove the impact of rising prices on GDP]. More here. Sajid Javid is correct when he says that Britain is expected to grow faster than Japan, Italy and Germany in 2019 and 2020. But that\u2019s hardly impressive. Italy has been stagnating for years, Germany will probably tumble into recession on Thursday, and Japan\u2019s export-driven economy has been hurt by the US-China trade war. UK chancellor Sajid Javid has insisted that the UK economy is in good shape, despite annual growth slowing to a nine-year low. But he\u2019s also cited ongoing uncertainty over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Javid told reporters: Over the last nine years since the Conservatives have been back in office we\u2019ve seen nine consecutive years of growth. The chancellor cited \u201crecord high unemployment\u201d and real wages growth, adding: These are all good signs of the fundamental strength of the economy. Q: But annual growth is now the weakest since 2010.... Javid blames \u201cglobal factors\u201d, pointing out that the IMF expect Britain to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan over the next couple of years. We are doing better than many of our competitors.... Here at home there are factors at play, and the number one issue is around uncertainty, around Brexit. Here\u2019s my colleague Phillip Inman on today\u2019s growth figures: The British economy has avoided recession after officials figures showed it grew 0.3% in the third quarter of the year. The GDP data for July to September from the Office for National Statistics showed the UK returned to growth after a dip of 0.2% between April and June. A technical recession is defined by two successive quarters of negative growth. There were fears that Brexit uncertainty could have pushed the economy into further negative growth, but Britain\u2019s services sector \u2013 which encompasses a range of industries from movie production to banking and IT \u2013 performed strongly enough to push the UK into positive territory. Britain\u2019s attraction as a centre for film production was one of the main drivers of growth, as it has been over the past two years, the ONS said. Spending on IT accelerated as firms upgraded their computer systems and improved online services to their customers. Here\u2019s his full story: Nigel Farage\u2019s decision not to run Brexit candidates in Conservative constituencies has also lifted the pound to a six-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.168. Traders are calculating that a hung parliament is now less likely. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: The pound is stronger since a clear, decisive election win for the Conservatives will provide clarity on Brexit \u2013 anything else becomes messy. This is a big boost to the Conservative Party as the Brexit Party had talked about fielding 600 candidates. It changes the electoral map. Mr Farage seems to have been persuaded by Boris Johnson\u2019s commitment not to extend the transition period beyond December 2020. Mr Farage and everyone else knew it would have been crazy politics for the Brexit Party to take Leave votes away from the Tories and enable a pro-Remain grouping to take seats. The Brexit Party will however contest Labour and other pro-Remain parties. It\u2019s a massive moment for the campaign and gives the Tories a clear run at Downing Street. But it will not make it any easier to hoover up seats from opposition parties \u2013 the risk of the Brexit Party sucking in Leaver votes in areas being targeted by the Tories remains. For Labour and in particular the Lib Dems in the south of England, it\u2019s going to make life very hard to dislodge incumbent Tories. Back in the City, the pound has just jumped to a one-week high. Sterling had already been lifted by the news that Britain had avoided recession. But the rally has accelerated in the last few minutes, as Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage announced he won\u2019t contest the 317 seats which the Conservative party won in 2017. The pound is up a cent today, at $1.288. Farage\u2019s move could be a significant boost to Boris Johnson\u2019s chances of winning a majority in next month\u2019s general election. But, he\u2019s not (yet anyway) pledged to withdraw from Tory target seats.... Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Worryingly, business investment has fizzled out in the last couple of year.s The ONS reports that it was flat in the last quarter alone, but has shrunk in five of the last eight quarters: Britain\u2019s economy is now paying the price of years of austerity, argues TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cA decade of cuts and under-investment has slammed the handbrake on economic growth. \u201cWhen Britain needed rebuilding after the crash the Conservatives opted for austerity and tax breaks for big business. \u201cWorking families paid the price for these political choices. They deserve better.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy benefited from a boom in UK-based film and TV production in the last quarter, the ONS says. That helped the wider information and communication industry to grow by 0.8% in the last quarter, nearly three times faster than the wider economy. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg has crunched today\u2019s GDP data, to show that UK growth has fallen steadily since the EU referendum Intensifying Brexit uncertainties over the last three years have gradually eroded the UK\u2019s underlying growth momentum. After averaging 0.6% in 2015, the average quarterly pace of growth has slowed each year since then. Down from 0.38% in 2018, the quarterly pace has slowed to 0.22% for the first three quarters of 2019 \u2013 barely half of the UK\u2019s potential rate (c0.4%). The slowdown highlights the pains of political uncertainties linked to Brexit and the upcoming general election on 12 December. Despite the rebound in real GDP, at 0.5%, the quarterly pace of nominal GDP growth was the slowest of the year so far. He also sent these charts over: Today\u2019s GDP report shows that private consumption, government spending and net trade all made a positive contribution to growth. But \u2018gross fixed capital formation\u2019 (a broad measure of investment) contracted in Q3, and manufacturing has also shrunk over the last six months. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, isn\u2019t impressed that the UK economy has barely grown over the last six months: \u201cOver the last year, growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade. \u201cThe fact that the Government will be celebrating 0.1% growth in the last six months is a sign of how low their hopes and expectations for our economy are. \u201cLabour will build a high-wage, high-skill economy by investing for growth in every region and nation of the UK.\u201d This chart shows how Britain\u2019s annual growth rate has slumped to a nine-year low (the blue line) despite growth picking up in the last quarter (the red bars). Economist Simon French of City firm Pantheon is also concerned that growth fell in August and September, after a punchy July (+0.3%). CNBC\u2019s Joumanna Bercetche is concerned that factory output is weak (with no growth in the last quarter). Avoiding recession is obviously welcome news. But the broader picture is that the UK economy is struggling along. With growth at a nine-year low, few experts are celebrating. Tej Parikh, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, fears growth could slow in the current quarter - continuing the recent \u2018yo-yo\u2019 formation. The UK economy has been in stop-start mode all year, with growth punctuated by the various Brexit deadlines. Indeed, the pick-up in the third quarter numbers may slightly exaggerate the strength in the economy, with some activity likely to have been brought forward before October 31st. The final quarter of 2019 could be weaker as stockpiles continue to be run down. \u201cWhile high employment has provided some support for the economy, underlying weaknesses in investment and productivity still need addressing. With uncertainty likely to persist and a continued slowdown in global markets, the onus is on the new government to stimulate economic activity and move the UK beyond its current yo-yo pattern of growth.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the confusion over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is damaging growth. Household spending remains the main motor of growth, with a 0.4% rise in the third quarter bolstered by stronger earnings growth. By contrast, business investment was flat, reflecting the continued drag from Brexit-related uncertainty, which looks set to continue into the fourth quarter.\u201d Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, is concerned that the economy shrank a little in August and September. The stronger headline figure masks an alarming loss of momentum through the quarter from a relatively strong July outturn and therefore does little to suggest any meaningful improvement in UK\u2019s underlying growth trajectory..... Despite the pick-up in growth, a slowing global economy has weakened firms\u2019 cashflow, disrupted supply chains and stifled investment and is likely to squeeze economic activity in the fourth quarter and beyond, unless action is taken. Alarmingly, most sectors of UK manufacturing have contracted over the last six months. As the chart shows, car production slumped in the second quarter because auto plants brought their annual shutdowns forward to April, in case of a hard Brexit. That meant the production bounced back in the summer. But if you strip car making out, UK manufacturing is clearly struggling: The ONS says: Manufacturing failed to grow in Quarter 3 2019, with falls in many industries almost solely offset by an increase in the manufacturing output of transport equipment. This recovery in car production follows a decline in Quarter 2, because of partial closures of various car manufacturing plants. The Office for National Statistics has tweeted the key points from today\u2019s GDP report, including the fact that annual growth has hit a near-decade low: On an annual growth basis, the UK economy is dragging its feet behind the US and France - but ahead of Italy: Britain\u2019s service sector provided the bulk of the growth in the last quarter, growing by 0.4% in July-September. The construction sector grew by 0.6%, as building activity picked up. But production and manufacturing stagnated again, with no growth in the quarter. The ONS says: Production was flat in the three months to September 2019; this sector has not seen positive rolling three-month growth since April 2019. Manufacturing, the largest sub-sector of production, was also flat in the three months to September 2019. Although the UK has avoided recession, the economy is still looking weak. On an annual basis, UK GDP only rose by 1.0% in July-September compared with Q3 2018. That\u2019s the lowest annual growth rate since the first quarter of 2010 (as Britain clawed its way out of the Great Recession). The economy did shrink in September, by 0.1%. But strong growth in July means the economy expanded in the third quarter of the year. NEWSFLASH: Britain has avoided recession. The UK economy expanded by 0.3% in the third quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u2019s a welcome return to growth, following the 0.2% contraction in the second quarter. More to follow\u2026 Not long to wait..... UK chancellor Sajid Javid will be quizzed about the state of the economy by the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam: Bakery chain Greggs isn\u2019t weighed down by recession worries. The high street takeaway group has hiked its profit forecasts for the year, after posting a 12.4% jump in sales for the last six weeks. Shares have surged 13% this morning, as new offering such as the vegan sausage roll keep luring customers in. The UK was actually the worst-performing EU economy in the second quarter of 2019. A 0.2% contraction put it at the bottom of the growth league, behind Germany and Sweden (which shrank by 0.1%). We\u2019ll find out how Germany\u2019s economy fared in the third quarter on Thursday - economists fear it could fall into recession.... In the City, the FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares has dropped by 0.5% in early trading. It\u2019s down 37 points at 7322, a one-week low. Traders say there\u2019s some nervousness ahead of today\u2019s GDP report, not helped by Moody\u2019s threat on Friday night to downgrade the UK. Financial markets are unsettled by the latest protests in Hong Kong. Police have shot a protester after anti-government demonstrators took to the streets during rush hour. Bloomberg also reckons the UK\u2019s economy has lost momentum due to the ongoing Brexit crisis, saying: The U.K. almost certainly avoided a recession ahead of the now-postponed October 31 deadline to leave the European Union. The economy expanded 0.4% between July and September, thereby avoiding a second straight quarter of contraction, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Brexit stockpiling has led to volatility in output this year but the underlying picture is one of an economy that has lost momentum amid the turmoil convulsing British politics. Several economists believe that Britain\u2019s service sector drove the economy back into growth. Here\u2019s Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also expects a bounceback: The rebound is largely expected to have been driven by the services sector, which makes up almost 80% of the UK economy and tends to do all the heavy lifting in most cases. The services sector is expected to contribute 0.4% of growth in Q3, with private consumption also contributing to a healthy rebound. But Howard Archer of IHS Markit fears the underlying economy remains weak. He predicts: Even if GDP fell 0.1% month-on-month in September, third-quarter GDP quarterly growth will have been 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. Reasonable consumer spending growth, healthy tourism and positive contributions from government spending and investment were probably behind the economy\u2019s growth in the third quarter. It also looks likely there was some, albeit limited stockbuilding in September ahead of the scheduled 31 October Brexit due date. However, another drop in business investment amid heightened uncertainty is likely to have weighed on the economy. The Daily Express has taken something of a flyer on this morning\u2019s GDP figures. Their front page says there is a \u201cBoris Boost as Economy Bounces Back\u201d, even though we don\u2019t actually have the growth data yet. It boldly declares: BORIS JOHNSON\u2019S election hopes have been majorly boosted as the latest financial data will show the UK economy growing once again after a previous quarter of contraction. They\u2019re probably safe, as economists expected 0.4% growth to be announced at 9.30am. But as the Financial Times\u2019s Chris Giles points out, that wouldn\u2019t be a sizzling performance at all. Good morning. We\u2019re about to learn whether the UK has plunged into its first recession since the financial crisis. GDP figures for the third quarter of 2019, due at 9.30am GMT, will show how the economy fared in September, and over the last three months. It\u2019s an important healthcheck, as Brexit uncertainty grips the country, the global economy slows and trade war tensions remain high. These are the most eagerly awaited growth figures in some time, because the UK economy actually shrank by 0.2% in April-June. If it also contracted in July-September then we\u2019re in recession -- a body blow to the government as the general election campaign heats up. Economists fear that GDP dipped by 0.1% in September. But even if that happens, they\u2019re hopeful that recession can be avoided -- because previous data has shown strong growth of 0.4% in July. The City consensus is that GDP rose by 0.4% during the quarter as a whole. But on an annual basis, growth is expected to have dropped to just 1.1%, from 1.3% three months ago. That would be a weak result, showing that the freeze in business investment since the EU referendum has hurt the economy. A surge in Brexit stockpiling at the start of the year has made it harder to interpret recent economic data, as some firms ran down their inventories after the first Brexit deadline of 29th March was pushed back. Today\u2019s growth figures come shortly after Moody\u2019s warned that it could slash the UK\u2019s credit rating. In a downbeat assessment of Britain\u2019s economic prospects, Moody\u2019s criticised the \u201cincreasing inertia and, at times, paralysis\u201d seen since the Brexit vote. The UK\u2019s institutional frameworks have become less capable or predictable, it fears. Moody\u2019s warned: UK institutions have weakened as they have struggled to cope with the magnitude of policy challenges that they currently face, including those that relate to fiscal policy. The UK\u2019s economic and fiscal strength are likely to be weaker going forward and more susceptible to shocks than previously assumed. It has now lowered its outlook on Britain\u2019s credit rating, currently Aa2, from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d. That implies the rating could soon be cut. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK GDP for September, and the third quarter of 2019 9.30am GMT: UK industrial production and services index in September 9.30am GMT: UK trade balance for September",

We extend our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his friends and family during this difficult time.\u201d</p> <p>Rogers set a school record with 27 career touchdowns that still stands at Michigan State despite playing only two seasons at the Lansing school, winning the Fred Biletnikoff award as the best college wide receiver in the nation during his junior season.</p> <p>The 6ft 3in, 220lb star was chosen with the No 2 pick in the 2003 draft behind only Carson Palmer and almost immediately made good on his $9.1m signing bonus with the Lions, catching 22 passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns in his first five professional games, but his rookie year was abruptly cut short when he broke his collarbone during a speed drill.</p> <p>Rogers broke his collarbone again on the third play of the 2004 campaign, ending his second season. By the end of year three, he was out of football entirely, finishing with 36 receptions for 440 yards and three touchdowns in 15 appearances.</p> <p>The Saginaw native was arrested at least six times from 2008-12 on charges ranging from assault and battery and probation violations to DUI, open container violations and marijuana possession.</p> <p>In 2017, Rogers <a href=\"https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/sports/college/msu/football/2017/04/19/charles-rogers-michigan-state-lions/100577018/\">told the Lansing State Journal</a> that he became addicted to Vicodin during his time with the Lions. He also said he smoked marijuana throughout his time in college and the pros.</p> <p>\u201cI am getting my life together. \u2026 A fresh start,\u201d he said in that interview. \u201cDo I need a little love? Yeah. Am I still trying to find Charles Rogers? Yeah. I stay optimistic and positive. I\u2019ve been to hell and back, but I stay strong. I still have faith. I\u2019m still a young man. It ain\u2019t over. I\u2019m going to be all right, you know? I\u2019m going to be all right.\u201d</p> <p>Don Durrett, who coached Rodgers at Saginaw High School, told the Free Press he was the best athlete he\u2019d any seen across sports.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, he was \u2013 and I\u2019m including Flint, too, since I coached at Flint Northern all those years \u2013 he\u2019s the best athlete I ever seen. I mean, honestly,\u201d Durett told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about basketball, football and track together. He could have had a scholarship in all three sports.

No cause of death has been reported, but several of his former coaches said he was suffering from liver disease and cancer. \u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Charles Rogers,\u201d the Lions said in a statement Monday. \u201cFrom Saginaw, to East Lansing, to Detroit, Charles\u2019 connection to the state of Michigan and its football community was felt by many during the course of his life. We extend our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his friends and family during this difficult time.\u201d Rogers set a school record with 27 career touchdowns that still stands at Michigan State despite playing only two seasons at the Lansing school, winning the Fred Biletnikoff award as the best college wide receiver in the nation during his junior season. The 6ft 3in, 220lb star was chosen with the No 2 pick in the 2003 draft behind only Carson Palmer and almost immediately made good on his $9.1m signing bonus with the Lions, catching 22 passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns in his first five professional games, but his rookie year was abruptly cut short when he broke his collarbone during a speed drill. Rogers broke his collarbone again on the third play of the 2004 campaign, ending his second season. By the end of year three, he was out of football entirely, finishing with 36 receptions for 440 yards and three touchdowns in 15 appearances. The Saginaw native was arrested at least six times from 2008-12 on charges ranging from assault and battery and probation violations to DUI, open container violations and marijuana possession. In 2017, Rogers told the Lansing State Journal that he became addicted to Vicodin during his time with the Lions. He also said he smoked marijuana throughout his time in college and the pros. \u201cI am getting my life together. \u2026 A fresh start,\u201d he said in that interview. \u201cDo I need a little love? Yeah. Am I still trying to find Charles Rogers? Yeah. I stay optimistic and positive. I\u2019ve been to hell and back, but I stay strong. I still have faith. I\u2019m still a young man. It ain\u2019t over. I\u2019m going to be all right, you know? I\u2019m going to be all right.\u201d Don Durrett, who coached Rodgers at Saginaw High School, told the Free Press he was the best athlete he\u2019d any seen across sports. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, he was \u2013 and I\u2019m including Flint, too, since I coached at Flint Northern all those years \u2013 he\u2019s the best athlete I ever seen. I mean, honestly,\u201d Durett told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about basketball, football and track together. He could have had a scholarship in all three sports. That\u2019s how good. \u2026 I haven\u2019t seen nobody that fast that could do it all. He was just a blessed athlete that could do it all.\u201d",

Way above them at the Benito Villamar\u00edn were their fans: 6,000 had applied for tickets; 602 actually got them, and they were enjoying this. Now they were, anyway.

And then, late on Sunday night, they headed back outside again, their supporters still there, Betis\u2019s gone now. Together they sang Sevilla\u2019s anthem, which is much more than an anthem, and their version of the Marseillaise.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe dedicate this victory to Reyes and Puerta,\u201d said the captain, Jes\u00fas Navas, who knows what this match meant to them. Who knows what it means, full stop.</p> \n<p>No one has played more league games for the club than Navas, going back 16 years. No one at Sevilla has played more derbies, either. Opposite him, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/sep/03/i-know-i-can-leave-football-a-happy-man-joaquin-wins-the-derby-for-betis\" title=\"\">no one at Betis has played more than Joaqu\u00edn</a> \u2013 the man who, when he scored the winner last year, declared that he could now retire happy but left unhappy this time. Most of the men with Navas, meanwhile, had never played one at all. Of the 14 footballers who played for Sevilla in the city\u2019s \u201cgrand derby\u201d and the country\u2019s grandest on Sunday night, nine are new. And so is the manager. Lopetegui held, and lost, the two biggest jobs in Spanish football, becoming the Sevilla manager with a year of being coach at both Spain and Real Madrid, but he never experienced anything quite like this.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fail to see what this means; we know what this game is,\u201d Lopetegui had insisted last week. \u201cThose of us that are new have done a crash course in the Seville derby.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t complete yet. Ten thousand fans turned up, flags and flares bringing colour, players lining up before them at their stadiums \u2013 and that was for training the day before. Flames lit up Triana bridge. On the morning of the match, Betis won the boat race on the Guadalquivir, a competition going back half a century. And as the team buses made their way there \u2013 just over four kilometres for Sevilla, not much more than 40 metres for Betis \u2013 they were given a guard of honour, accompanied en route. Upon arrival, more fans and more fireworks awaited.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/11/hansi-flick-bayern-munich-bayern-munich-bundesliga\">Hansi Flick weaves magic as Borussia Dortmund curse their Bayern jinx | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is the game you can\u2019t lose, especially for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/31/nabil-fekir-rubi-and-a-picture-that-sums-up-sport-real-betis-celta-vigo-la-liga-sid-lowe\" title=\"\">Betis manager Rubi</a>, over whose head the axe hovered, held at bay by a last-minute winner against Celta and a draw at Madrid but not entirely banished. For Lopetegui, too. Madrid and Spain was heavy baggage with which to arrive in Seville, and some weren\u2019t convinced. There was no rejection as such, but there were reservations. He would not have been their candidate as coach, even if he was Monchi\u2019s \u2013 and on a three-year deal, no less. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/sevilla-monchi-liverpool-europa-league-final\" title=\"\">Lopetegui\u2019s presentation</a>, the sporting director insisted, by way of explanation: \u201cHe needs to win.\u201d He did, too. On Sunday night, above all.</p> \n<p>Sevilla have impressed at times, the beginning of an idea forming and pretty fast for a club that brought in 13 players and moved out 15, trying to build an almost entirely new side. But they have flaws, particularly up front: Munir scored a hat-trick in Europe, but wasn\u2019t in the squad for the derby and hasn\u2019t scored a league goal; Chicharito Hern\u00e1ndez has just one; and Munas Dabbur hasn\u2019t played a minute. Luuk De Jong has played more than any striker, but came into Sunday with a solitary goal.</p> \n<p>Sevilla began the season top but lost against Madrid and then let a 2-0 lead slip at Eibar, losing 3-2. They won the most enjoyable game so far, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/sevilla-and-sociedads-special-show-puts-madrid-derby-in-shade\" title=\"\">3-2 against Real Sociedad</a>, yet every time you were ready to take them seriously, seeing glimpses of a genuinely good team, they didn\u2019t take that step. Real Madrid came, played defensively, and defeated them 1-0. At Barcelona, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/07/a-new-sevilla-but-the-same-old-story-as-barcelona-blow-them-away\" title=\"\">they dominated but lost 4-0</a>.

Before the derby Lopetegui had been asked if this might prove a turning point and, while he not unjustly insisted that Sevilla are on the right track already, there was something in that idea which was revealed at the end \u2013 expressed in Lopetegui\u2019s release. His reaction showed what this meant. It showed how much he had suffered, too.</p> \n<p>Lucas Ocampos, the most impressive of Sevilla\u2019s new signings, scored the first after 13 minutes \u2013 his fifth this season. At the other end, Fekir sliced just over the bar and Loren Moron equalised just before half-time. Then Alex Moreno drew a sharp save from Tomas Vaclik. It was no classic \u2013 Banega was one of the few to look like he had time to play \u2013 but it was a derby. Noisy, tense, different. Next, Luuk de Jong, the striker who took 19 shots to get his first goal and hadn\u2019t yet got his second, smashed a second into the roof of the net to give Sevilla the lead. Banega had made it brilliantly, slipping away from one man and slipping the ball past four.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/11/dimitri-payet-revenge-marseille-lyon-ligue-1\">Dimitri Payet has his revenge as Marseille finally beat Lyon in Ligue 1</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was still half an hour left and Betis chucked everything at Sevilla: by the end, Joaqu\u00edn, Tello, Fekir, Loren, and Borja Iglesias were all on the pitch, with Alex Moreno flying up outside them and Sergio Canals pretty much a one-man midfield. They racked up the shots, too \u2013 18 of them. Loren hit the post, Joaqu\u00edn on the floor appealing for a penalty, just before a wonderful run from Joaqu\u00edn drew the best chance of all only for Tomas Vaclik to make a superb save at the far post from Moreno. And yet real chances were few. The delivery had been perfect that time but not the next, or the next. As time ticked the pressure grew and Sevilla got deeper, exhausted now, so the final ball got worse.</p> \n<p>The nerves did too, right up until the final whistle, leaving Rubi shaking his head. \u201cWe deserved something more,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe showed courage and all that was lacking was the result. This hurts but it\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Loren said. Sidnei added: \u201cIt\u2019s cruel but that\u2019s football.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sevilla had won the derby \u2013 their first derby, in most cases. De Jong said: \u201cIt\u2019s a special game, the great derby, and it\u2019s special for me now too. It\u2019ll be in my head a long time, my [whole] life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ocampos said: \u201cI\u2019m more than happy. I come from a country where cl\u00e1sicos are important. It\u2019s my first derby. I won the most important one in Argentina and now I\u2019ve won one of the most important here. I\u2019m off to celebrate with my teammates; we deserve this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Diego Carlos called it \u201cmad, magical, crazy\u201d. Sergio Reguil\u00f3n could barely walk but no one was wiping the smile from his face. \u201cWe knew it was a special game,\u201d he said but not, he admitted, quite this special. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted, but so happy, like a little kid: I\u2019m blown away, it\u2019s wild: this is the <em>hostia</em> [the dog\u2019s bollocks],\u201d he grinned, a little potty-mouthed. \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the word: the <em>hostia</em>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lopetegui said: \u201cIt was exciting, emotional. We showed great personality at an important moment. There\u2019s a lot of passion, it\u2019s very special. It\u2019s been fantastic and we got a happy ending, too \u2013 and when you get a happy ending you enjoy it even more. We\u2019re very happy and we saw what it means for the fans, the team, the city.\u201d</p> \n<p>For him, too. Sevilla\u2019s coach was the last man out there late on Sunday night, standing alone in front of the fans as they waited to be allowed to head home. High in the stand, they were singing his name. He applauded, gestured, had one final look and then at last turned to leave. Waiting quietly for him was Monchi, the sporting director who believed in him.

      "bodyText": "When it was over, Julen Lopetegui started roaring, mouth so wide you could fit his half of Seville inside. He wore a wild look in his eyes and punched the air with the kind of force that dislocates shoulders. Which might not sound so unusual, but it is for him. \u00c9ver Banega was the first to leap into his arms, and then others followed, violence in the embrace. Across the pitch, in the far corner where Banega was going now, the rest of Sevilla\u2019s players hopped about, doing that disco thing, waving their arms up and down and shouting. Way above them at the Benito Villamar\u00edn were their fans: 6,000 had applied for tickets; 602 actually got them, and they were enjoying this. Now they were, anyway. The tension had gone with the whistle, and a 2-1 victory. When, eventually, they got to the dressing room, the winners of the 130th Seville derby posed for a celebratory photo with two framed pictures the kitmen take everywhere, forever accompanying them on their journey \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes and Antonio Puerta, born locally, raised at Sevilla and taken too soon. And then, late on Sunday night, they headed back outside again, their supporters still there, Betis\u2019s gone now. Together they sang Sevilla\u2019s anthem, which is much more than an anthem, and their version of the Marseillaise. \u201cWe dedicate this victory to Reyes and Puerta,\u201d said the captain, Jes\u00fas Navas, who knows what this match meant to them. Who knows what it means, full stop. No one has played more league games for the club than Navas, going back 16 years. No one at Sevilla has played more derbies, either. Opposite him, no one at Betis has played more than Joaqu\u00edn \u2013 the man who, when he scored the winner last year, declared that he could now retire happy but left unhappy this time. Most of the men with Navas, meanwhile, had never played one at all. Of the 14 footballers who played for Sevilla in the city\u2019s \u201cgrand derby\u201d and the country\u2019s grandest on Sunday night, nine are new. And so is the manager. Lopetegui held, and lost, the two biggest jobs in Spanish football, becoming the Sevilla manager with a year of being coach at both Spain and Real Madrid, but he never experienced anything quite like this. \u201cYou can\u2019t fail to see what this means; we know what this game is,\u201d Lopetegui had insisted last week. \u201cThose of us that are new have done a crash course in the Seville derby.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t complete yet. Ten thousand fans turned up, flags and flares bringing colour, players lining up before them at their stadiums \u2013 and that was for training the day before. Flames lit up Triana bridge. On the morning of the match, Betis won the boat race on the Guadalquivir, a competition going back half a century. And as the team buses made their way there \u2013 just over four kilometres for Sevilla, not much more than 40 metres for Betis \u2013 they were given a guard of honour, accompanied en route. Upon arrival, more fans and more fireworks awaited. This is the game you can\u2019t lose, especially for the Betis manager Rubi, over whose head the axe hovered, held at bay by a last-minute winner against Celta and a draw at Madrid but not entirely banished. For Lopetegui, too. Madrid and Spain was heavy baggage with which to arrive in Seville, and some weren\u2019t convinced. There was no rejection as such, but there were reservations. He would not have been their candidate as coach, even if he was Monchi\u2019s \u2013 and on a three-year deal, no less. At Lopetegui\u2019s presentation, the sporting director insisted, by way of explanation: \u201cHe needs to win.\u201d He did, too. On Sunday night, above all. Sevilla have impressed at times, the beginning of an idea forming and pretty fast for a club that brought in 13 players and moved out 15, trying to build an almost entirely new side. But they have flaws, particularly up front: Munir scored a hat-trick in Europe, but wasn\u2019t in the squad for the derby and hasn\u2019t scored a league goal; Chicharito Hern\u00e1ndez has just one; and Munas Dabbur hasn\u2019t played a minute. Luuk De Jong has played more than any striker, but came into Sunday with a solitary goal. Sevilla began the season top but lost against Madrid and then let a 2-0 lead slip at Eibar, losing 3-2. They won the most enjoyable game so far, 3-2 against Real Sociedad, yet every time you were ready to take them seriously, seeing glimpses of a genuinely good team, they didn\u2019t take that step. Real Madrid came, played defensively, and defeated them 1-0. At Barcelona, they dominated but lost 4-0. And last weekend they drew 1-1 with Atl\u00e9tico. Yet if Sevilla hadn\u2019t won any of the big games, they\u2019ve now won the biggest. Before the derby Lopetegui had been asked if this might prove a turning point and, while he not unjustly insisted that Sevilla are on the right track already, there was something in that idea which was revealed at the end \u2013 expressed in Lopetegui\u2019s release. His reaction showed what this meant. It showed how much he had suffered, too. Lucas Ocampos, the most impressive of Sevilla\u2019s new signings, scored the first after 13 minutes \u2013 his fifth this season. At the other end, Fekir sliced just over the bar and Loren Moron equalised just before half-time. Then Alex Moreno drew a sharp save from Tomas Vaclik. It was no classic \u2013 Banega was one of the few to look like he had time to play \u2013 but it was a derby. Noisy, tense, different. Next, Luuk de Jong, the striker who took 19 shots to get his first goal and hadn\u2019t yet got his second, smashed a second into the roof of the net to give Sevilla the lead. Banega had made it brilliantly, slipping away from one man and slipping the ball past four. There was still half an hour left and Betis chucked everything at Sevilla: by the end, Joaqu\u00edn, Tello, Fekir, Loren, and Borja Iglesias were all on the pitch, with Alex Moreno flying up outside them and Sergio Canals pretty much a one-man midfield. They racked up the shots, too \u2013 18 of them. Loren hit the post, Joaqu\u00edn on the floor appealing for a penalty, just before a wonderful run from Joaqu\u00edn drew the best chance of all only for Tomas Vaclik to make a superb save at the far post from Moreno. And yet real chances were few. The delivery had been perfect that time but not the next, or the next. As time ticked the pressure grew and Sevilla got deeper, exhausted now, so the final ball got worse. The nerves did too, right up until the final whistle, leaving Rubi shaking his head. \u201cWe deserved something more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe showed courage and all that was lacking was the result. This hurts but it\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Loren said. Sidnei added: \u201cIt\u2019s cruel but that\u2019s football.\u201d Sevilla had won the derby \u2013 their first derby, in most cases. De Jong said: \u201cIt\u2019s a special game, the great derby, and it\u2019s special for me now too. It\u2019ll be in my head a long time, my [whole] life.\u201d Ocampos said: \u201cI\u2019m more than happy. I come from a country where cl\u00e1sicos are important. It\u2019s my first derby. I won the most important one in Argentina and now I\u2019ve won one of the most important here. I\u2019m off to celebrate with my teammates; we deserve this.\u201d Diego Carlos called it \u201cmad, magical, crazy\u201d. Sergio Reguil\u00f3n could barely walk but no one was wiping the smile from his face. \u201cWe knew it was a special game,\u201d he said but not, he admitted, quite this special. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted, but so happy, like a little kid: I\u2019m blown away, it\u2019s wild: this is the hostia [the dog\u2019s bollocks],\u201d he grinned, a little potty-mouthed. \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the word: the hostia.\u201d Lopetegui said: \u201cIt was exciting, emotional. We showed great personality at an important moment. There\u2019s a lot of passion, it\u2019s very special. It\u2019s been fantastic and we got a happy ending, too \u2013 and when you get a happy ending you enjoy it even more. We\u2019re very happy and we saw what it means for the fans, the team, the city.\u201d For him, too. Sevilla\u2019s coach was the last man out there late on Sunday night, standing alone in front of the fans as they waited to be allowed to head home. High in the stand, they were singing his name. He applauded, gestured, had one final look and then at last turned to leave. Waiting quietly for him was Monchi, the sporting director who believed in him. He put an arm round Lopetegui\u2019s shoulders and they went down the tunnel together at the end of Monchi\u2019s 46th derby. For Lopetegui it was just the first, but it was a start. Talking points \u2022 There was a moment when the camera caught the Eibar left\u2011back Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel muttering: \u201cThis is a fucking storm.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t talking about the weather, either \u2013 although it was grim in up at Ipurua, rain swirling round. Instead, he was talking about Real Madrid, who were putting in easily their best performance of the season, all quick touches and movement, Eden Hazard back in tackle-hurdling mode, and tearing Eibar apart. \u2022 Silly, just silly. Genuinely, it has reached the point now where it\u2019s a disappointment if Lionel Messi doesn\u2019t score a brilliant free-kick every single time he gets the chance to take one. This weekend he scored two stupidly good ones, bending them both over the wall and right into the corner. Which meant that, thanks to a penalty, he wrapped up a dead-ball hat-trick. Afterwards, Ernesto Valverde was asked if he almost prefers Messi to have a free-kick than a penalty. He is, after all, running at a 40% hit rate this season in the league. Yes, fortyflippingpercent. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe it,\u201d Valverde said. But then he added: \u201cWell, almost. We know with Messi than anything can happen.\u201d \u2022 Already the record holder at Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, Lucas P\u00e9rez is now the record-holder at Alav\u00e9s too, after he scored for a seventh consecutive game as Alav\u00e9s beat Valladolid 3-0. \u2022 That goal from Capa: whoosh! A wonderful volley and in the 88th minute too, to give Athletic a 2-1 win against Levante. And what about Ferran Torres\u2019s 97th-minute belter for Valencia? Tasty.",

There is still time and opportunity for us to turn things around and make positive changes in the way we use our land.\u201d</p> <p>The study, published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1028-6\">Nature Ecology and Evolution</a>, calculated the biomass of moths caught in 34 light traps which have operated every night for at least 30 years in the long-running <a href=\"https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/insect-survey\">Rothamsted Insect Survey</a>, which began in 1967.</p> <p>Biomass is an important measure because it signals the quantity of moths available to pollinate plants and provide food for birds, bats and small mammals. Researchers believe that moth declines are likely to mirror falls in the populations of other flying insects.</p> <p>Two common causes given for the decline of moths are agricultural intensification and light pollution in urban areas.</p> <p>The study found that traps in urban areas and on arable land had caught a far lower abundance of moths than grassland and woodland.</p> <p>Between 1983 and 2017, the average weight of moths caught in a woodland trap each year was 81,889 milligrams. In a grassland trap it was 44,828mg and in traps based on arable farmland the weight of moths fell to 36,280mg. In urban areas \u2013 where moths are affected by light pollution \u2013 it was 31,673mg.</p> <p>But while moths in grassland have declined by 18% since 1983 and in woodland by 15%, moth abundance remained stable on arable land.</p> <p>According to Macgregor, this could show that chemical-sensitive species had already been obliterated from farmland by agricultural chemicals used in the 1960s before the Rothamsted survey began.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of our farmland was pretty intensively farmed already by 1967 so species that were going to be driven out by agriculture might have already gone by the time of the beginning of this dataset,\u201d said Macgregor. \u201cIf we went back to 1930 or 1850 there could be a massive decline but there\u2019s not any way to know that unfortunately.\u201d</p> <p>The study found that rather than a precipitous recent decline, there has been a slower, steady decline since 1982 and considerable fluctuation between years. The researchers believe these fluctuations are caused by extreme weather and climatic changes.</p> <p>It appears that the dry weather in 1975 and heatwave in 1976 caused a massive boom in British insect populations, with the average moth trap biomass increasing by 207% between 1967 and 1982. In the mid-1990s, there was a crash with the average biomass per trap of 93,100mg in 1996 falling to 70,486mg in 1997 and 45,773mg in 1998 before stabilising at around 50,000mg at the turn of the century.</p> <p>The co-author <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/ecology-evolution/chris-d-thomas/\">Chris Thomas</a>, professor of biology at the University of York and <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.14608\">a critic of some analyses purporting to show \u201cinsectageddon\u201d</a>, said there was no single simple explanation for declines in insect populations since the 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that short-term studies and infrequent sampling can give erroneous estimates of biomass change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe complexity of insect population change requires more, better and longer-running data if we are to draw robust conclusions, particularly for parts of the world where insect data are limited.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, said: \u201cThis research provides further evidence that there is a current long-term decline in insect biodiversity. The historical sharp increase in the estimate of moth biomass during the 1970s on these 34 sites is new and unexpected.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is a need for additional corroboration and explanation.\u201d</p>",

The lead author of the new analysis said this slump in moth populations since the 1980s fitted with other insect studies showing more dramatic recent declines. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not the case that everything is fine,\u201d said Dr Callum Macgregor. \u201cWe do know that insects are in long-term decline as a whole, and also that the majority of insect species are declining. \u201cThe concerning thing about the decline is that it\u2019s over a 35-year period and there\u2019s no real sign that that long-term declining trend is reversing. \u201cHaving said that, the implication of a phrase like \u2018insect Armageddon\u2019 is that it\u2019s an end-of-days scenario and it\u2019s almost hopeless, and I don\u2019t think it is hopeless. There is still time and opportunity for us to turn things around and make positive changes in the way we use our land.\u201d The study, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, calculated the biomass of moths caught in 34 light traps which have operated every night for at least 30 years in the long-running Rothamsted Insect Survey, which began in 1967. Biomass is an important measure because it signals the quantity of moths available to pollinate plants and provide food for birds, bats and small mammals. Researchers believe that moth declines are likely to mirror falls in the populations of other flying insects. Two common causes given for the decline of moths are agricultural intensification and light pollution in urban areas. The study found that traps in urban areas and on arable land had caught a far lower abundance of moths than grassland and woodland. Between 1983 and 2017, the average weight of moths caught in a woodland trap each year was 81,889 milligrams. In a grassland trap it was 44,828mg and in traps based on arable farmland the weight of moths fell to 36,280mg. In urban areas \u2013 where moths are affected by light pollution \u2013 it was 31,673mg. But while moths in grassland have declined by 18% since 1983 and in woodland by 15%, moth abundance remained stable on arable land. According to Macgregor, this could show that chemical-sensitive species had already been obliterated from farmland by agricultural chemicals used in the 1960s before the Rothamsted survey began. \u201cA lot of our farmland was pretty intensively farmed already by 1967 so species that were going to be driven out by agriculture might have already gone by the time of the beginning of this dataset,\u201d said Macgregor. \u201cIf we went back to 1930 or 1850 there could be a massive decline but there\u2019s not any way to know that unfortunately.\u201d The study found that rather than a precipitous recent decline, there has been a slower, steady decline since 1982 and considerable fluctuation between years. The researchers believe these fluctuations are caused by extreme weather and climatic changes. It appears that the dry weather in 1975 and heatwave in 1976 caused a massive boom in British insect populations, with the average moth trap biomass increasing by 207% between 1967 and 1982. In the mid-1990s, there was a crash with the average biomass per trap of 93,100mg in 1996 falling to 70,486mg in 1997 and 45,773mg in 1998 before stabilising at around 50,000mg at the turn of the century. The co-author Chris Thomas, professor of biology at the University of York and a critic of some analyses purporting to show \u201cinsectageddon\u201d, said there was no single simple explanation for declines in insect populations since the 1980s. \u201cWe found that short-term studies and infrequent sampling can give erroneous estimates of biomass change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe complexity of insect population change requires more, better and longer-running data if we are to draw robust conclusions, particularly for parts of the world where insect data are limited.\u201d Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, said: \u201cThis research provides further evidence that there is a current long-term decline in insect biodiversity. The historical sharp increase in the estimate of moth biomass during the 1970s on these 34 sites is new and unexpected.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is a need for additional corroboration and explanation.\u201d",

The 2016 US presidential candidate told the Guardian it was \u201cincredibly surprising and unacceptable that in your country there is a government report sitting there about Russian influence and your current government isn\u2019t releasing it\u201d. The potentially incendiary report by the intelligence and security committee has already been approved by the intelligence agencies. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October and had been expected to sign off the report by the end of last month. However, No 10 indicated that the parliamentary report would not be made public before the election, citing a sign-off process that it said could take six weeks.

They think that they are the all-powerful, strong men who should be ruling,\u201d she said, linking the suppression of the report to a rising authoritarian turn in western leaders. The report specifically examines attempts by Russia to affect the outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum. That there was Russian influence in the 2016 presidential campaign is now widely accepted \u2013 though denied by Donald Trump who describes it as \u201ca hoax\u201d. Clinton said: \u201cSomeone said to me: \u2018Quit with the Russians\u2019. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ll quit with the Russians when the Russians quit with us\u2019.

She was anxious, she said, about Britain trying \u201cto separate yourselves from Europe at a time when democracies need to stick together because we are truly under pressure from dictatorships and authoritarian regimes\u201d. At the event promoting The Book of Gutsy Women, co-authored with her daughter, Chelsea, the former US secretary of state said: \u201cI am, as a great admirer of Britain, concerned, because I can\u2019t make sense of what is happening. \u201cWe have a president who admires dictators and takes their help and does all kinds of crazy stuff. So we need you to be the sane member of this partnership going forward.\u201d \u2022 The full interview with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton will appear in Guardian Review on Saturday 16 November.",

      "bodyText": "A Patek Philippe watch has sold for a record 31m Swiss francs (\u00a324.2m) at a charity auction hosted by Christie\u2019s in Switzerland. It is by far the highest price ever paid for a wristwatch, and all of the proceeds will be donated to research into muscular dystrophy. The Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime 6300A-010, which was created specially for the charity auction Only Watch, was bought by a private telephone bidder following a five-minute auction at the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues, in Geneva, on Saturday. It had been expected to sell for SFr2.5-3m. The watch beat the previous record, set by a Daytona Rolex once owned by Paul Newman, which sold for $17.8m in 2017. Sabine Kegel, the head of Christie\u2019s watch department in Geneva, said the watch was \u201cthe most complicated wristwatch ever made \u2026 it does nearly everything except making coffee\u201d. She said the watch had attracted \u201ca lot of interest from new clients because it was a charity auction\u201d. The watch has four spring barrels driving 20 complications and features a reversible case with two dials in rose gold and black. It has five chiming modes, two of which are patented world firsts: an acoustic alarm that strikes the pre-selected time and a date repeater sounding the date on demand. Kegel, who had been on the phone to a rival bidder during the auction of lot 28, said the room erupted with applause when the gavel came down. \u201cIt was really very exciting, and there was such a great atmosphere in the room with standing ovations after each sale,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much money was raised that the scientific research can now go ahead to clinical trials.\u201d Fifty watches created specially for the Only Watch charity sale raised SFr38.6m for research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic condition that affects one in 3,000 male births. The biennial auction was founded in 2005 by Luc Pettavino, the former chief executive of the Monaco Yacht Show, after his son, Paul, was diagnosed with the disease and died aged 21 in 2016. \u201cBreaking records is obviously a source of pride and happiness,\u201d said Pettavino, who is president of the Mon\u00e9gasque Association against Myopathies. \u201cWhat a beautiful moment and emotion shared together.

Sesame Street\u2019s human characters were multi-ethnic and looked and talked like ordinary people, performing normal jobs. From its early years to now, the show has taken its cues from one of its most memorable songs: Who Are the People in Your Neighborhood? It\u2019s moved beyond math and reading to teach kids about, well, life. Simple human dignity, what people do all day and why.

The format of the newer episodes is different too, with more emphasis on story-driven segments that can run as long as 10 minutes.

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s governing socialist party has ruled out a grand coalition with its arch-rivals, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), after a deadlocked election marked by a surge in support for the far-right Vox party. After winning the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years but again failing to secure a majority, the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) also rejected any return to the polls, saying yet another election would be \u201can institutional failure\u201d. The PSOE won 120 seats on Sunday \u2013 three fewer than in the inconclusive election in April. Its leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the acting prime minister, appealed for his opponents and rivals to \u201cact generously and responsibly to unblock the political situation in Spain\u201d. The PP finished second with 88 and Vox came third, more than doubling its seat count from 24 to 52. The anti-austerity Unidas Podemos came fourth with 35 seats, followed by the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left with 13 seats. The centre-right Citizens party tumbled to sixth place, dropping from 57 seats to 10, which prompted the resignation of its leader, Albert Rivera. As predicted in pre-election polls, Vox, which was founded by disgruntled PP members six years ago, vaulted into third place, buoyed by the collapse of the Citizens vote and by its aggressive opposition to Catalan independence. The party, led by Santiago Abascal, has called for a \u201creconquest\u201d of Spain and for the building of an \u201cunbreachable wall\u201d around the north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. It regularly attacks what it sees as the hegemony of political correctness and wants to repeal laws on gender-based violence. In a recent interview, the president of the National Francisco Franco Foundation, which exists to preserve and promote the late dictator\u2019s life and work, said Vox was now the party that best embodied Franco\u2019s legacy. On Sunday night Abascal proclaimed the party\u2019s results a breakthrough in its culture war against the progressive left. \u201cWe have led a cultural and political change, because we have opened up all the forbidden debates and told the left that the story isn\u2019t over yet and that they don\u2019t have any moral superiority,\u201d he said. Abascal was congratulated by far-right European politicians including France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini and the Netherlands\u2019 Geert Wilders. The PSOE\u2019s organisational secretary, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, said Spain needed a new government as quickly as possible. However, he said the socialists would not share power with the PP, which had criticised the PSOE\u2019s handling of the recent unrest in Catalonia and which, like Citizens, had enlisted Vox\u2019s support in taking power in some regions over the past year. S\u00e1nchez has been criticised by rightwing opponents for being too soft on Catalan separatists. He refused to yield to calls from the PP and Vox to take drastic action after the Spanish supreme court\u2019s decision to jail nine separatist leaders for sedition over their role in the failed push for regional independence two years ago prompted huge protests and violent scenes in Catalonia. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bet on a grand coalition government with a right that doesn\u2019t shoulder its responsibilities,\u201d said \u00c1balos. \u201cWe had to deal with the crisis in Catalonia in absolute solitude.\u201d \u00c1balos also said the party hoped to avoid having to rely on the support of pro-independence Catalan parties. On Monday the anonymous, pro-independence Catalan group known as Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic organised a blockade of the motorway between France and Spain in an effort to bring the Spanish government to the negotiating table. The PSOE faces a huge battle to secure the numbers and the political impasse looks likely to stretch on. To regain office, S\u00e1nchez would need the backing of 176 of the 350 MPs in the congress of deputies \u2013 or for other parties to abstain and facilitate another minority PSOE government. Sunday\u2019s election was triggered when the PSOE failed to find viable support for a new administration after its victory in April. The socialists were unable to reach an agreement with Unidas Podemos, while Rivera flatly refused to do anything to facilitate S\u00e1nchez\u2019s return to office. Rivera, once seen as the future of Spain\u2019s political centre, announced on Monday he was standing down as Citizens leader and as an MP. His decision to drag the party further to the right in the hope of competing with the PP and Vox had proved disastrous, as he acknowledged in his resignation speech. \u201cWhen a political project is successful, a leader has to know that that success belongs to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a leader also needs to know that bad results are their responsibility alone.\u201d Rivera\u2019s leadership had been frequently criticised by party members who despaired of his departure from the centre ground and of the legitimacy he had lent Vox by doing deals with them. His replacement will have to decide whether to return to the centre or whether to try to keep pace with Vox. The PSOE will be looking to capitalise on its diminishing momentum as Spaniards are growing tired of the deadlock. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big mess and things are even worse now than they were before,\u201d said Juan Lu\u00eds Castro, 73, a retired aviation mechanic from north-east Madrid. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to know what\u2019s going to happen next.

Even the most sublime music would become irritating if you played it over and over again for weeks: the issue with the big Christmas hits isn\u2019t always the songs themselves, more the way we gorge on them, like a drunk with a selection box at 9pm on Christmas Day. Still, some are definitely more annoying than others: in ascending order of irritation \u2026</p> <h2>20. Mariah Carey \u2013 All I Want for Christmas Is You<br></h2> <p>There\u2019s a reason Carey\u2019s homage to Phil Spector \u2013 the lyric is essentially Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) reworked \u2013 has become the all-conquering latterday Christmas classic: there\u2019s something bulletproof about the songwriting, that more or less withstands constant seasonal repetition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f5e3e245dc949433e421aba15c470909efd0d23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f5e3e245dc949433e421aba15c470909efd0d23/0_0_4088_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slade \u2026 whose Christmas hit is peculiarly British.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slade \u2026 who get wheeled out every Christmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Bamber/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>19. Slade \u2013 Merry Xmas Everybody<br></h2> <p>As has often been pointed out, Merry Xmas Everybody is a peculiarly British record: for all its singalong chorus, it carries a hint of doleful resignation, of gritting teeth and getting on with it despite yourself, of doggedly plodding on, that seems to ring down through the ages.</p> <h2>18. The Pogues - Fairytale of New York<br></h2> <p>Now the most ubiquitous Christmas song in Britain, Fairytale of New York is beginning to suffer from overfamiliarity that dims how emotionally complex and clever it is: but its open ending \u2013 you never quite know what will happen to its two protagonists \u2013 still packs a tearjerking punch.</p> <h2>17. Wham! \u2013 Last Christmas<br></h2> <p>A far better, classier song than its Christmas novelty status suggests, Last Christmas pulls off the classic cheery music/melancholy lyric trick with considerable aplomb: \u201cMy God,\u201d snaps the disconsolate narrator, \u201cI thought you were someone to rely on.\u201d</p> <h2>16. Darlene Love \u2013 Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)<br></h2> <p>Spector\u2019s 1963 album A Christmas Gift for You provided the model for umpteen festive pop songs that followed. Love\u2019s final contribution is its finest moment: the music uplifting, the lyrics and vocal raw and inconsolable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEyGZlBdkaA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AEyGZlBdkaA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>15. The Pretenders \u2013 2000 Miles<br></h2> <p>A moment of melancholy respite amid the razzy jollity, 2000 Miles \u2013 a song that\u2019s actually about the death of Pretenders guitarist James Honeyman-Scott \u2013 always feels like a chilly gust of fresh air on a Christmas compilation.</p> <h2>14. The Waitresses \u2013 Christmas Wrapping<br></h2> <p>The hipster\u2019s Xmas novelty record of choice \u2013 insouciant, once-obscure, very New York \u2013 Christmas Wrapping has survived its latterday festive-heavy rotation with charm intact, perhaps because it views Christmas as something you have to cope with rather than adore.</p> <h2>13. Elton John \u2013 Step Into Christmas<br></h2> <p>The overfamiliarity of the big Xmas hits has led to a kind of festive crate-digging, where lesser-known examples get their belated moment in the spotlight: hence the recent popularity of Step Into Christmas and its addictive chorus, a relative flop on release.</p> <h2>12. Low \u2013 Just Like Christmas<br></h2> <p>There is a mini-industry of alt-rock bands doing \u201cknowing\u201d Christmas songs \u2013 often no less annoying than the traditional canon \u2013 but Low\u2019s lo-fi depiction of a journey through Sweden is the best: filled with an authentic sense of wonder.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJPc7esgvsA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IJPc7esgvsA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>11. Wizzard \u2013 I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day<br></h2> <p>The second best of the glam Christmas classics: Roy Wood in more-is-more Brummie Spector mode, the syrupiness of its sentiment undercut by a hint of knowing cynicism: its opening sound is a cash register\u2019s ker-ching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c707843e64d5f4d446524f63bc245285c408ecdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c707843e64d5f4d446524f63bc245285c408ecdc/0_0_2060_3000/687.jpg\" alt=\"Oh, deer \u2026 it\u2019s Leona Lewis.\" width=\"687\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oh, deer \u2026 it\u2019s Leona Lewis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Hale/Redferns via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Leona Lewis \u2013 One More Sleep<br></h2> <p>Unpromising raw material \u2013 X Factor winner attempts to arrest commercial slide by going for Christmas market \u2013 yields surprisingly palatable result, aided by the fact that it is relatively recent, and therefore hasn\u2019t been played to death for 40 years.</p> <h2>9. Mike Oldfield \u2013 In Dulci Jubilo<br></h2> <p>The problem here is not the tune itself \u2013 reliably lovely when rendered by a choir. It\u2019s Oldfield\u2019s decision to perform said tune at the same speed as the theme from The Archers that sets one\u2019s teeth on edge. Extra point deducted for smarmy behold-the-prog-virtuoso-playing-all-the-instruments video.</p> <h2>8. Greg Lake \u2013 I Believe in Father Christmas<br></h2> <p>Annoying largely because it is wildly hypocritical: if you are keen to moan on about the commercialisation of Christmas, it is probably best not to do it on a novelty single designed to cash in on the Christmas market.</p> <h2>7. Mud \u2013 Lonely This Christmas<br></h2> <p>Slade\u2019s Merry Xmas Everybody was famously a reaction to early 70s industrial strife: Mud\u2019s 1974 chart topper actually sounds like the benighted era that spawned it. Lumbering and depressing, complete with a tatty Elvis impersonation, by the end, you are praying for a powercut.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeyHl1tQeaQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZeyHl1tQeaQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <h2>6.

John Lennon \u2013 Happy Xmas (War Is Over!)<br></h2> <p>Infuriating from its opening line (\u201cSo this is Christmas \u2013 and what have you done?\u201d sneers Lennon in sanctimonious imagine-no-possessions-I-wonder-if-you-can mode), Happy Xmas (War Is Over!) ups the ante even further 41 seconds in with the nerve-jangling arrival of Yoko Ono and the Harlem Community Choir.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/18/how-we-made-shakin-stevens-merry-christmas-everyone\">Shakin' Stevens: how we made Merry Christmas Everyone</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>4. Paul McCartney \u2013 Wonderful Christmas Time<br></h2> <p>Even before the spirit-crushing moment when the choir of children sing their song \u2013 \u201cDing dong, ding dong / Ding dong, ding!\u201d \u2013 Wonderful Christmas Time gives the weird impression that Macca was going out of his way to annoy everyone in earshot: its sound is shrill and flimsy, its mood perky and ingratiating.</p> <h2>3. Cliff Richard \u2013 Millennium Prayer<br></h2> <p>You can\u2019t blame Cliff for attempting to refocus attention on the Christian message of the season, but setting The Lord\u2019s Prayer to the tune of Auld Lang Syne is a spectacularly tin-eared and awkward way to do it, not least because the words audibly don\u2019t fit the melody.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bjQzJAKxTrE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2.

The Pogues - Fairytale of New York Now the most ubiquitous Christmas song in Britain, Fairytale of New York is beginning to suffer from overfamiliarity that dims how emotionally complex and clever it is: but its open ending \u2013 you never quite know what will happen to its two protagonists \u2013 still packs a tearjerking punch. 17. Wham! \u2013 Last Christmas A far better, classier song than its Christmas novelty status suggests, Last Christmas pulls off the classic cheery music/melancholy lyric trick with considerable aplomb: \u201cMy God,\u201d snaps the disconsolate narrator, \u201cI thought you were someone to rely on.\u201d 16. Darlene Love \u2013 Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) Spector\u2019s 1963 album A Christmas Gift for You provided the model for umpteen festive pop songs that followed. Love\u2019s final contribution is its finest moment: the music uplifting, the lyrics and vocal raw and inconsolable. 15. The Pretenders \u2013 2000 Miles A moment of melancholy respite amid the razzy jollity, 2000 Miles \u2013 a song that\u2019s actually about the death of Pretenders guitarist James Honeyman-Scott \u2013 always feels like a chilly gust of fresh air on a Christmas compilation. 14. The Waitresses \u2013 Christmas Wrapping The hipster\u2019s Xmas novelty record of choice \u2013 insouciant, once-obscure, very New York \u2013 Christmas Wrapping has survived its latterday festive-heavy rotation with charm intact, perhaps because it views Christmas as something you have to cope with rather than adore. 13. Elton John \u2013 Step Into Christmas The overfamiliarity of the big Xmas hits has led to a kind of festive crate-digging, where lesser-known examples get their belated moment in the spotlight: hence the recent popularity of Step Into Christmas and its addictive chorus, a relative flop on release. 12. Low \u2013 Just Like Christmas There is a mini-industry of alt-rock bands doing \u201cknowing\u201d Christmas songs \u2013 often no less annoying than the traditional canon \u2013 but Low\u2019s lo-fi depiction of a journey through Sweden is the best: filled with an authentic sense of wonder. 11. Wizzard \u2013 I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day The second best of the glam Christmas classics: Roy Wood in more-is-more Brummie Spector mode, the syrupiness of its sentiment undercut by a hint of knowing cynicism: its opening sound is a cash register\u2019s ker-ching. 10. Leona Lewis \u2013 One More Sleep Unpromising raw material \u2013 X Factor winner attempts to arrest commercial slide by going for Christmas market \u2013 yields surprisingly palatable result, aided by the fact that it is relatively recent, and therefore hasn\u2019t been played to death for 40 years. 9. Mike Oldfield \u2013 In Dulci Jubilo The problem here is not the tune itself \u2013 reliably lovely when rendered by a choir. It\u2019s Oldfield\u2019s decision to perform said tune at the same speed as the theme from The Archers that sets one\u2019s teeth on edge. Extra point deducted for smarmy behold-the-prog-virtuoso-playing-all-the-instruments video. 8. Greg Lake \u2013 I Believe in Father Christmas Annoying largely because it is wildly hypocritical: if you are keen to moan on about the commercialisation of Christmas, it is probably best not to do it on a novelty single designed to cash in on the Christmas market. 7. Mud \u2013 Lonely This Christmas Slade\u2019s Merry Xmas Everybody was famously a reaction to early 70s industrial strife: Mud\u2019s 1974 chart topper actually sounds like the benighted era that spawned it. Lumbering and depressing, complete with a tatty Elvis impersonation, by the end, you are praying for a powercut. 6. Shakin\u2019 Stevens \u2013 Merry Christmas Everyone \u201cOh, I wish that every day was Christmas,\u201d offers Shaky, in the middle of a song cut from similarly plasticky jaunty cloth to Wonderful Christmas Time. \u201cWhat a nice way to spend the year.\u201d What an absolutely horrifying suggestion. 5. John Lennon \u2013 Happy Xmas (War Is Over!) Infuriating from its opening line (\u201cSo this is Christmas \u2013 and what have you done?\u201d sneers Lennon in sanctimonious imagine-no-possessions-I-wonder-if-you-can mode), Happy Xmas (War Is Over!) ups the ante even further 41 seconds in with the nerve-jangling arrival of Yoko Ono and the Harlem Community Choir. 4. Paul McCartney \u2013 Wonderful Christmas Time Even before the spirit-crushing moment when the choir of children sing their song \u2013 \u201cDing dong, ding dong / Ding dong, ding!\u201d \u2013 Wonderful Christmas Time gives the weird impression that Macca was going out of his way to annoy everyone in earshot: its sound is shrill and flimsy, its mood perky and ingratiating. 3. Cliff Richard \u2013 Millennium Prayer You can\u2019t blame Cliff for attempting to refocus attention on the Christian message of the season, but setting The Lord\u2019s Prayer to the tune of Auld Lang Syne is a spectacularly tin-eared and awkward way to do it, not least because the words audibly don\u2019t fit the melody. 2. Band Aid \u2013 Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? \u201cI am responsible for two of the worst songs in history,\u201d Bob Geldof glumly suggested in 2010. \u201cThe other is We Are The World.\u201d He has a point: even if you are not irked by its colonial viewpoint and cartoon vision of Africa, the music alone \u2013 lugubrious, portentous, tinny \u2013 will do the trick. 1. David Bowie and Bing Crosby \u2013 Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth When considering this leaden duet, let us consult a genuine authority on the subject. Bowie said, \u201cI hate that song\u201d when a version of Little Drummer Boy was first mooted, and was so furious that his record company released it as a single, he signed to another label.",

A beginner\u2019s guide to becoming obsessed with Jeanette Winterson. More proof of the heroism of librarians in a report into how libraries are helping to cope with the US opioid crisis. William Burroughs wrote a treatment for a film called Bladerunner. (But not that one.)

He is just a kid who loves polar bears, and he is alsoone of 20 competitors, all aged between nine and 15, on this year\u2019s Junior Bake Off. </p> <p>Junior Bake Off was a regular feature in the BBC years, but this is Channel 4\u2019s first attempt at putting a school-age spin-off on their blockbuster baking show. They have assembled a formidable presenting team. There is Prue, of course, who needs no introduction. She is accompanied, on the judging side, by former Bake Off contestant Liam Charles, whose enthusiasm is infectious and irresistible (and the perfect antidote to surly, sneery Paul Hollywood). Then there is Harry Hill, an inspired choice of presenter. Hill spends most of his time making jokes to camera, to the adult viewers, which sail over the heads of the young bakers. (At one point Tilly laments to the cameraman: \u201cI think he\u2019s playing games with me!\u201d)</p> <p>And these kids are good! Astonishingly good. These tiny dots, the younger of whom need their aprons tied for them by the older contestants, turn out exquisite craquelin-topped choux pastry, and 3D structures made out of five kinds of bread. They make biscuits that look like fish fingers and cakes that look like microphones. They are enthusiastic, and earnest, and wear their knowledge as lightly as angel cake, and they give me fragile hope for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66cc5a1aec3de5dfd9e8c28ab0e9346f87e1517c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66cc5a1aec3de5dfd9e8c28ab0e9346f87e1517c/0_154_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A formidable presenting team\u2019 ...

For one thing, the bakes themselves are preposterously obscure; I am a professional baker and I can honestly say I have never been called upon to make a 3D sugar display case. Paul Hollywood is brash and capricious (though, to be fair, he always was). The contestants are now so polished that they are boring to watch, and they all have an eye on a book deal and on the career that follows, crafting their public image as carefully as they craft their tartes tatin. We fell in love with this show because of how sweet it was, but now it leaves a bitter taste.</p> <p>But that\u2019s OK, because we have Junior Bake Off \u2013 the Bake Off we deserve. Here, the contestants are baking things you have heard of, and might actually want to eat (or even bake yourself). Viennese whirls! Sausage rolls! Pancakes! The showstoppers are completely ridiculous, but in a good way \u2013 the bread sculptures, for example, were modelled on what each baker wanted to be when they grew up, and featured a plane (pilot), a classroom (teacher) and an ice-cream parlour (ice-cream parlour owner). What\u2019s not to love?</p> <p>The appeal of Bake Off has never really been in the baking. It is a show about success and failure and bouncing back; it is about creativity and growth and making your grandma proud. And these kids deliver in spades. There are tears, and sunken disasters, and drama, but none of it feels manipulative. In fact, quite the opposite. In one heart-in-mouth moment, Oliver runs into George and knocks his perfect plate of English madeleines to the floor. Both contestants dissolve into tears for all of 30 seconds, then everything is OK again. (\u201cMy career as a juggler is over,\u201d quips George afterwards.)</p> <p>The very best thing is that, however brilliant these kids are, they are still kids. They clutch their plushy soft-toy mascots during the judging; they beatbox as Harry Hill raps along with them. They giggle and grin and gurn at each other, remembering only occasionally that there are cameras watching, this is national television, and that millions of us across the country are cheering them along.</p> <p><em>Olivia Potts is a writer and chef.

(At one point Tilly laments to the cameraman: \u201cI think he\u2019s playing games with me!\u201d) And these kids are good! Astonishingly good. These tiny dots, the younger of whom need their aprons tied for them by the older contestants, turn out exquisite craquelin-topped choux pastry, and 3D structures made out of five kinds of bread. They make biscuits that look like fish fingers and cakes that look like microphones. They are enthusiastic, and earnest, and wear their knowledge as lightly as angel cake, and they give me fragile hope for the future. This is also a breath of fresh air after an adult Bake Off that was widely condemned as cruel, overly complicated and just a bit stale. For one thing, the bakes themselves are preposterously obscure; I am a professional baker and I can honestly say I have never been called upon to make a 3D sugar display case. Paul Hollywood is brash and capricious (though, to be fair, he always was). The contestants are now so polished that they are boring to watch, and they all have an eye on a book deal and on the career that follows, crafting their public image as carefully as they craft their tartes tatin. We fell in love with this show because of how sweet it was, but now it leaves a bitter taste. But that\u2019s OK, because we have Junior Bake Off \u2013 the Bake Off we deserve. Here, the contestants are baking things you have heard of, and might actually want to eat (or even bake yourself). Viennese whirls! Sausage rolls! Pancakes! The showstoppers are completely ridiculous, but in a good way \u2013 the bread sculptures, for example, were modelled on what each baker wanted to be when they grew up, and featured a plane (pilot), a classroom (teacher) and an ice-cream parlour (ice-cream parlour owner). What\u2019s not to love? The appeal of Bake Off has never really been in the baking. It is a show about success and failure and bouncing back; it is about creativity and growth and making your grandma proud. And these kids deliver in spades. There are tears, and sunken disasters, and drama, but none of it feels manipulative. In fact, quite the opposite. In one heart-in-mouth moment, Oliver runs into George and knocks his perfect plate of English madeleines to the floor. Both contestants dissolve into tears for all of 30 seconds, then everything is OK again. (\u201cMy career as a juggler is over,\u201d quips George afterwards.) The very best thing is that, however brilliant these kids are, they are still kids. They clutch their plushy soft-toy mascots during the judging; they beatbox as Harry Hill raps along with them. They giggle and grin and gurn at each other, remembering only occasionally that there are cameras watching, this is national television, and that millions of us across the country are cheering them along.

Speculation continues over where the party will stand but it is not expected to run in Northern Ireland or parts of Scotland.</p> \n<p>As he spelled out his general election strategy at a rally in Hartlepool, which voted 70% to leave the EU, Farage said he had concluded that if the Brexit party had stood a candidate in every seat it could split the vote and usher in dozens of Liberal Democrat MPs and, in turn, create the circumstances for a second referendum.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe Brexit party will not contest the 317 seats the Conservatives won at the last election. We will concentrate our total effort into all the seats that are held by the Labour party, who have completely broken their manifesto pledge in 2017 to respect the result of the referendum, and we will also take on the rest of the remainer parties. We will stand up and fight them all.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said this strategy was reliant on Johnson sticking to his promises on delivering Brexit, and getting Brexit party MPs into parliament to keep the pressure on him.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are going to keep saying: remember you told us we were leaving at the end of 2020.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage has said the Brexit party will not field any candidates against the Conservatives in the 317 seats they won at the last general election, after Boris Johnson committed to leaving the EU by 2020 and pursuing a Canada-style trade deal. Farage said his party\u2019s climbdown came after months of trying to create a leave alliance with the Tories, but he felt it was time to put the country before his party and make a \u201cunilateral\u201d move. He will announce on Friday in which seats the Brexit party is standing. Speculation continues over where the party will stand but it is not expected to run in Northern Ireland or parts of Scotland. As he spelled out his general election strategy at a rally in Hartlepool, which voted 70% to leave the EU, Farage said he had concluded that if the Brexit party had stood a candidate in every seat it could split the vote and usher in dozens of Liberal Democrat MPs and, in turn, create the circumstances for a second referendum. He said: \u201cThe Brexit party will not contest the 317 seats the Conservatives won at the last election. We will concentrate our total effort into all the seats that are held by the Labour party, who have completely broken their manifesto pledge in 2017 to respect the result of the referendum, and we will also take on the rest of the remainer parties. We will stand up and fight them all.\u201d He said this strategy was reliant on Johnson sticking to his promises on delivering Brexit, and getting Brexit party MPs into parliament to keep the pressure on him. \u201cWe are going to keep saying: remember you told us we were leaving at the end of 2020. Remember you told us we\u2019re not going to have political alignment. He will know, just as Mrs May\u2019s vote disappeared in the European elections of this year, the same will happen again if a British prime minister breaks firm commitments and promises made to the British people. \u201cI have got no great love for the Conservative party at all, but I can see right now that by giving Boris half a chance \u2026 and stopping the fanatics in the Liberal Democrats \u2013 they even want to revoke the result of the referendum \u2013 I think our action, our announcement today, prevents a second referendum from happening.\u201d Farage said he had been reassured after Johnson said he would not accept an extension of the transition period for Britain leaving the EU beyond the end of 2020. The prime minister has also said he will negotiate a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d trade deal with no political alignment, which is closer to what leave voters want. Farage, who is not standing for election himself, said he had been offered a peerage by the government on Friday but turned it down. Speculation will continue as to what he or his party will get out of the decision to stand down parliamentary candidates. Farage\u2019s announcement lifted sterling on the foreign exchange markets. The pound hit a six-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.168. Sterling was also up a cent against the US dollar at $1.288. City traders are calculating that a hung parliament is now less likely \u2013 although the Brexit party will still be competing in Conservative target seats. Other political parties were quick to criticise the move, with Ian Lavery, the chair of the Labour party, saying Johnson had formed an alliance with Farage and in effect Donald Trump, with whom he has a close relationship. Lavery said: \u201cThis is a Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson alliance with Donald Trump to sell out our country and send \u00a3500m per week from our NHS to US drugs companies.\u201d Ed Davey, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cNigel Farage standing down shows the Conservatives and the Brexit party are now one and the same.

      "body": "<p>What Lamar Jackson is doing is warping our perception of football. Jackson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/10/nfl-week-10-scores-lamar\">put on a show against the hapless Bengals</a> on Sunday, cementing his status as the MVP front-runner. Jackson became the first quarterback in NFL history to finish two games in the same season with a perfect passer rating (on a minimum of 20 attempts), and was so good even the Bengals fans were moved to chant \u201cM-V-P\u201d as he left the field.</p> <p>The Ravens as an organization deserve credit for handing their entire football operations over to this once-in-a-lifetime talent. Never have we seen such a smooth, efficient runner. Jackson is unique aesthetically <em>and </em>statistically.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/11/vikings-cowboys-score-dalvin-cook\">Dalvin Cook powers Minnesota Vikings to prime-time road win over Cowboys</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Ravens opted to move on from the plodding Joe Flacco last year and turned their offense into a wholesale option system behind the unprecedented threat of Jackson\u2019s legs and arm. They took concepts first built in the 1940s and injected them with all the sprinklings of the modern game.</p> <p>We\u2019ve <em>almost</em> seen this before, with Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers. The Niners were just scratching the surface with option football when Kaepernick helped propel them to a Super Bowl against these very Ravens. Back then, Greg Roman was the offensive coordinator for the Niners. Now, in Baltimore, Roman is finishing what he started.</p> <p>But this is still different. Kaepernick never played with the efficiency or precision of Jackson. He just wasn\u2019t quite the same thrower; nobody has been the same runner. We have had springy quarterbacks before. We\u2019ve had quarterbacks look like the best athletes on the field \u2013 an almost oxymoronic state of the game: Cam Newton, Michael Vick et al. But we\u2019ve never had a quarterback quite as effective at running the ball.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to say Jackson plays at his own pace, but we typically ascribe that to slower guys. Jackson is explosive in tight spaces. He slithers through creases, drops his shoulder and accelerates, all in one liquid movement. He\u2019s good slow and fast. He plays at whatever pace serves him. His running style is almost indescribable. His shoulders and feet move at different speeds. Jackson appears to be floating above the turf, his feet dabbing the ground \u2013 the merest contact for maximum velocity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SNFonNBC/status/1193617450417508352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lj_era8?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Lj_era8</a> pressed all the buttons on this run \ud83c\udfae<br>(via@ NFL)<a href=\"https://t.co/CsPVww96UA\">pic.twitter.com/CsPVww96UA</a></p>&mdash; SNF on NBC (@SNFonNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SNFonNBC/status/1193617450417508352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>That. That is football pornography.</p> <p>When Baltimore\u2019s offense is rolling \u2013 when the aggressive plays, speedy weapons, and up-tempo pace work in unison \u2013 the offense is less about executing football plays and more about waging psychological warfare. They have found a sweet spot where guys play with freedom and confidence but don\u2019t break from the team construct. They have the best tight end trio in the game, one of the sports best athletes at wide receiver, and the game\u2019s top run-blocking offensive line. How do you plan coherent strategy against a lineup in which everyone is dangerous from everywhere? You can\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/10/nfl-week-10-scores-lamar\">NFL round-up: Lamar Jackson dazzles as Baltimore Ravens rout Bengals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Option football is unsophisticated at its core. Turning the quarterback into a runner makes every offensive play a 1-v-1 matchup across the board. And the Ravens one is better than yours \u2013 often much better. The team is so in on the system, and defense are so utterly terrified of Jackson\u2019s legs, that the offensive line can run-up to the second-level and take-on linebackers \u2013 not seal then climb as is traditional. It\u2019s flat-out unfair.</p> <p>Cincinnati\u2019s defense was as clueless as expected against such a system. The Ravens started to have so fun. Behold: the most effective offense in the NFL, in all its wackadoo goodness:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/espn/status/1193601534598303744\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lamar Jackson and RGIII running the option together in Baltimore \ud83d\udc40<br><br>(via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFL</a>)<a href=\"https://t.co/qZnRTPO13r\">pic.twitter.com/qZnRTPO13r</a></p>&mdash; ESPN (@espn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/espn/status/1193601534598303744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>No big deal: that\u2019s just three Heisman trophy winners in one backfield \u2013 backup quarterback Robert Griffin III, Mark Ingram and Jackson. The sick part: you know the Ravens will come back to that package later in the season, giving Griffin the option to throw.</p> <p>Jackson becoming a legitimate passing threat makes this whole thing sing. He has grown so much in just one year.<strong> </strong>Last year,<strong> </strong>he was often a beat too early or too late on throws over the middle. He missed sight adjustments. Little nuances of the game \u2013 hot reads, precision over accuracy (throwing to a specific spot for runs after the catch, not just to complete the pass) and when and where to pull the ball to run \u2013 would ebb and flow. In other words: he was a rookie starting in the NFL.</p> <p>What makes an offense great? In short, the ability to efficiently attack multiple parts of the field and overstress any defense. Good offenses can do something so well that defenses have to adjust their systems to stop it. Great offenses punish the defense for that adjustment. Jackson\u2019s evolution has made the top offense in the league, and crystalized Roman\u2019s vision of what a modern offense could look like with a dual-threat at quarterback.</p> <p>The Ravens face the 24th-ranked schedule, by <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff/2019\">DVOA</a>, the rest of the way. A 13-3 season seems reasonable. Lamar Jackson is coming for it all: MVP, the Super Bowl, your team\u2019s soul.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI think Dalvin believes that he\u2019s really good. I believe that too.\u201d <em>\u2013 Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer</em></p> <p>Yeah, Dalvin is probably right on this one. The Vikings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/11/vikings-cowboys-score-dalvin-cook\">upset the Cowboys in Dallas, 28-24</a>, despite a monster game from Dak Prescott and the Cowboys pass offense. Dalvin Cook continued to show why he\u2019s neck-and-neck with Christian McCaffrey for the title of best all-around running back in the league. Cook ran for 97-yards, including the go-ahead touchdown on fourth down, and had another 86-yards receiving to set up three other scores.

Entering Week 10, the Falcons ranked 31st in team pressure rate (19%), while the Saints allowed the 4th-lowest pressure rate (22%).</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2> <p>Patrick Mahomes went for 36-of-50 for 446-yards and three touchdowns without a turnover against the Titans on a bum wheel. And the Chiefs lost. The Titans remain the league\u2019s zonkiest team.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be a Mahomes game without an illogical completion.

      "bodyText": "What Lamar Jackson is doing is warping our perception of football. Jackson put on a show against the hapless Bengals on Sunday, cementing his status as the MVP front-runner. Jackson became the first quarterback in NFL history to finish two games in the same season with a perfect passer rating (on a minimum of 20 attempts), and was so good even the Bengals fans were moved to chant \u201cM-V-P\u201d as he left the field. The Ravens as an organization deserve credit for handing their entire football operations over to this once-in-a-lifetime talent. Never have we seen such a smooth, efficient runner. Jackson is unique aesthetically and statistically. The Ravens opted to move on from the plodding Joe Flacco last year and turned their offense into a wholesale option system behind the unprecedented threat of Jackson\u2019s legs and arm. They took concepts first built in the 1940s and injected them with all the sprinklings of the modern game. We\u2019ve almost seen this before, with Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers. The Niners were just scratching the surface with option football when Kaepernick helped propel them to a Super Bowl against these very Ravens. Back then, Greg Roman was the offensive coordinator for the Niners. Now, in Baltimore, Roman is finishing what he started. But this is still different. Kaepernick never played with the efficiency or precision of Jackson. He just wasn\u2019t quite the same thrower; nobody has been the same runner. We have had springy quarterbacks before. We\u2019ve had quarterbacks look like the best athletes on the field \u2013 an almost oxymoronic state of the game: Cam Newton, Michael Vick et al. But we\u2019ve never had a quarterback quite as effective at running the ball. It\u2019s tempting to say Jackson plays at his own pace, but we typically ascribe that to slower guys. Jackson is explosive in tight spaces. He slithers through creases, drops his shoulder and accelerates, all in one liquid movement. He\u2019s good slow and fast. He plays at whatever pace serves him. His running style is almost indescribable. His shoulders and feet move at different speeds. Jackson appears to be floating above the turf, his feet dabbing the ground \u2013 the merest contact for maximum velocity. That. That is football pornography. When Baltimore\u2019s offense is rolling \u2013 when the aggressive plays, speedy weapons, and up-tempo pace work in unison \u2013 the offense is less about executing football plays and more about waging psychological warfare. They have found a sweet spot where guys play with freedom and confidence but don\u2019t break from the team construct. They have the best tight end trio in the game, one of the sports best athletes at wide receiver, and the game\u2019s top run-blocking offensive line. How do you plan coherent strategy against a lineup in which everyone is dangerous from everywhere? You can\u2019t. Option football is unsophisticated at its core. Turning the quarterback into a runner makes every offensive play a 1-v-1 matchup across the board. And the Ravens one is better than yours \u2013 often much better. The team is so in on the system, and defense are so utterly terrified of Jackson\u2019s legs, that the offensive line can run-up to the second-level and take-on linebackers \u2013 not seal then climb as is traditional. It\u2019s flat-out unfair. Cincinnati\u2019s defense was as clueless as expected against such a system. The Ravens started to have so fun. Behold: the most effective offense in the NFL, in all its wackadoo goodness: No big deal: that\u2019s just three Heisman trophy winners in one backfield \u2013 backup quarterback Robert Griffin III, Mark Ingram and Jackson. The sick part: you know the Ravens will come back to that package later in the season, giving Griffin the option to throw. Jackson becoming a legitimate passing threat makes this whole thing sing. He has grown so much in just one year. Last year, he was often a beat too early or too late on throws over the middle. He missed sight adjustments. Little nuances of the game \u2013 hot reads, precision over accuracy (throwing to a specific spot for runs after the catch, not just to complete the pass) and when and where to pull the ball to run \u2013 would ebb and flow. In other words: he was a rookie starting in the NFL. What makes an offense great? In short, the ability to efficiently attack multiple parts of the field and overstress any defense. Good offenses can do something so well that defenses have to adjust their systems to stop it. Great offenses punish the defense for that adjustment. Jackson\u2019s evolution has made the top offense in the league, and crystalized Roman\u2019s vision of what a modern offense could look like with a dual-threat at quarterback. The Ravens face the 24th-ranked schedule, by DVOA, the rest of the way. A 13-3 season seems reasonable. Lamar Jackson is coming for it all: MVP, the Super Bowl, your team\u2019s soul. Quote of the week \u201cI think Dalvin believes that he\u2019s really good. I believe that too.\u201d \u2013 Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer Yeah, Dalvin is probably right on this one. The Vikings upset the Cowboys in Dallas, 28-24, despite a monster game from Dak Prescott and the Cowboys pass offense. Dalvin Cook continued to show why he\u2019s neck-and-neck with Christian McCaffrey for the title of best all-around running back in the league. Cook ran for 97-yards, including the go-ahead touchdown on fourth down, and had another 86-yards receiving to set up three other scores. I\u2019d say that qualifies as really good. Stat of the week Your weekly reminder that the NFL is weird and nobody knows anything: The Falcons entered week 10 with just seven sacks all season. The Saints have one of best offensive lines in football, if not the best. So, of course, the Falcons had six sacks when they faced off Sunday. The Falcons pass rush was too much for Drew Brees and the Saints O-line, generating pressure on 35% of dropbacks. Entering Week 10, the Falcons ranked 31st in team pressure rate (19%), while the Saints allowed the 4th-lowest pressure rate (22%). MVP of the week Patrick Mahomes went for 36-of-50 for 446-yards and three touchdowns without a turnover against the Titans on a bum wheel. And the Chiefs lost. The Titans remain the league\u2019s zonkiest team. It wouldn\u2019t be a Mahomes game without an illogical completion. This time, he opted to throw while jumping into his line of scrimmage, buying him the extra half-second needed to allow him to complete the pass. Video of the week This is such an illogical, audacious, stupid play call \u2013 and it is wonderful: Utilizing all four downs and calling a fake punt: smart. Doing so with a flea-flicker that requires your punter to thread the needle 20-yards down the field: Dumb. Somehow, it worked. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 Minkah Fitzpatrick\u2019s been a Steeler for seven games. Over that time, he has four interceptions, two fumble recoveries, two touchdowns and one forced fumble. His midseason acquisition from the Dolphins will go down as one of the deals of the decade. \u2022 The Rams\u2019 offensive line is sinking their season. All of a sudden Andrew Whitworth, a perennial All-Pro player, is just OK. The rest of the line has been a disaster. No matter how creative Sean McVay\u2019s scheme can be, it all falls apart when you cannot protect the passer. The Rams are the third-best team in their own division. After losing 17-12 to the Steelers and their backup quarterback, missing the playoffs seems likely. \u2022 Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins defense continue to spoil the organization\u2019s plan to tank the season. With two wins in as many weeks, Miami is likely out of the picture for the first overall pick in the upcoming draft, the sole focus of the team heading into the season. \u2022 Adam Vinatieri is 14-for-20 on extra points this season. That\u2019s a 70% conversion rate, which would be the worst extra point rate for a season in NFL history (minimum 20 attempts). His career is coming to a slow, agonizing end. Here\u2019s hoping he has one more great moment before the Colts ultimately decide to move on.",

Three years later it collapsed. In a letter to staff, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is Jingye?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Jingye emerged as the most likely owner after talks with Ataer, a division of the Turkish military pension fund Oyak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/british-steel-turkish-army-fund-takeover-in-danger-of-collapse\">fell through in October</a>. Founded in 1988 by a former Communist party official, Li Ganpo, the Chinese conglomerate has hotel and retail interests. However, steelmaking, which it started doing in the early 1990s, is now its primary focus: its Chinese mills produce about 15m tonnes of steel a year, exporting to 80 countries.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much is Brexit to blame?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is not the only factor in the crisis, but it is important and will remain crucial even if Jingye buys British Steel.

On the weekend of Der Klassiker we were emphatically reminded that Borussia Dortmund\u2019s bad place is against ostensibly their biggest domestic rivals.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Munich,\u201d wrote the ESPN journalist Stephan Uersfeld, \u201cDortmund are the new Hamburg.\u201d</p> \n<p>They are currently in the second tier, but Hamburg have lost their past nine Bundesliga games at Bayern dating back to 2010, including two 8-0s, two 6-0s, two 5-0s and a 9-2. There is more than flippancy in the comparisons. Dortmund have now been on the end of six successive Bundesliga defeats at the Allianz Arena, with the five most recent by scores of 5-1, 4-1, 6-0, 5-0 and now 4-0.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-match-report\">Bayern Munich crush Dortmund thanks to Robert Lewandowski double</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They themselves didn\u2019t need the focus of the numbers to feel the jinx. Ten days on from Halloween, Lucien Favre\u2019s team looked spooked from the get-go, with the ominous sign 39 seconds in when Roman B\u00fcrki had to be quickly off his line to clear from Robert Lewandowski, after the visitors\u2019 defence was split by a simple straight ball. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time in another chastening experience in Bavaria for BVB.</p> \n<p>It was an evening that S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Christof Kneer called \u201cbad news for the league\u201d, as Bayern made the very idea of competition look fanciful.</p> \n<p>Many of the familiar themes were present \u2013 Lewandowski\u2019s utter dominance against his former team, beginning from the superb, stooping first-half header from Benjamin Pavard\u2019s cross, was unavoidable. Dortmund\u2019s tentativeness was another, and the extent to which they were simply exhausted by the efforts expended by their stirring Champions League comeback against Internazionale might have been more closely examined in a context outside that of their recent history in Munich.</p> \n<p>The not-quite-fit Jadon Sancho, who dribbled the ball out of play in his first involvement and was uncommonly indecisive before being substituted with ten minutes still to go in the first half, was perhaps a symptom of that hangover.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed19e75a5c7bf34e70c09114dfa3f091924d23a9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed19e75a5c7bf34e70c09114dfa3f091924d23a9/0_35_1928_1157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho looked off the pace before being replaced after just 35 minutes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho looked off the pace before being replaced after just 35 minutes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TF-Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet this felt, six days on from Niko Kovac\u2019s exit, like a new beginning under Hansi Flick, the coach who was Bayern\u2019s stash pick in the summer, brought in above Kovac\u2019s head seemingly exactly for the sort of eventuality like last week\u2019s capitulation in Frankfurt. The effects have been, according to the influential Thomas M\u00fcller (who famously didn\u2019t click with Kovac), \u201coutstanding in such a short time\u201d.</p> \n<p>Leon Goretzka, starting in the league for the first time this season, talked about Flick having \u201cchanged the attitude\u201d of the team already and it was evident from the off in the snap and press that the champions employed all over the field \u2013 a style that, many argued, Kovac couldn\u2019t draw from a set of players who simply didn\u2019t have it in them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/freiburg-coach-knocked-over-eintracht-frankfurt-captain-christian-streich-david-abraham\">Frankfurt\u2019s captain sent off for knocking over Freiburg coach, sparking chaos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was difficult to judge whether Dortmund\u2019s lethargy was a result of digging deep on Tuesday, or whether they simply looked slower by comparison with Bayern\u2019s renewed hunger. The goal which effectively finished the game, by Serge Gnabry, was tucked away after a lightning transition, a mere 64 seconds into the second half.</p> \n<p>\u201cFlick has managed to make Bayern believe they are Bayern again,\u201d wrote Kneer. Not that anyone in the Bayern camp is under any illusions that this is a quick fix.</p> \n<p>There was even the odd banner supporting Kovac and his brother (and assistant) Robert, thanking them for their efforts and signalling there is acknowledgement in the fanbase that it wasn\u2019t all down to the coach. This was an occasion, though, to express relief, to embrace the hope that the inertia of the past few years might be drawing to a close. Uli Hoeness, in his last match as president, exulted in the stands \u2013 \u201cHe nearly knocked me down the stairs after the first goal,\u201d his habitual watching partner Karl-Heinz Rummenigge remarked \u2013 and his seal of approval for Flick followed. \u201cClearly Flick is our first candidate as a coach,\u201d Hoeness said, signalling that his step back from the frontline won\u2019t make his opinions more hidden.</p> \n<p>On the other side, it was a deflating end to a run of three successive wins in big games for Favre, bookended by that triumph against Inter, and it was an indication that questions over his suitability to take Dortmund to where they really want to go will still be asked.</p> \n<p>Favre, who had talked about his side having \u201cnothing to lose\u201d going into this game, could be argued to still not quite have the requisite ambition, with Marco Reus and Paco Alc\u00e1cer \u2013 admittedly, both with fitness issues - only brought on after an hour with BVB already two down and hanging on in the game by their fingernails.</p> \n<p>Ambition has never been an issue for the Rekordmeister. Flick and his future can wait. For now, playing like the big, bad Bayern of old felt good.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/11/julen-lopetegui-sevilla-real-betis-la-liga-seville-derby\">Julen Lopetegui roars as the king of Seville and repays Monchi\u2019s faith | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 There were moments of reflection, both silent and full of applause, around all Bundesliga grounds before kick-off as the league paid its respects to late Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke, 10 years on from his passing. It also served to highlight the work of the Robert Enke Foundation, involved in helping people with mental health issues and also children with heart conditions.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It was a special Saturday afternoon in Berlin as Hertha commemorated 30 years since the fall of the wall before their home game with RB Leipzig. The home side also wore special kits for the occasion, and local lad Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt opened the scoring with a cracker. Unfortunately for his fellow Berliner, the coach Ante Covic, Leipzig came back, led home by a Timo Werner brace and the presence in the stand of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, recently appointed to Hertha\u2019s supervisory board, was a reminder of gradually rising expectation as they were leapfrogged by Union in the table, one week on from the derby.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"980f2c6fab91596cf73ee4624371e35ed1643e30\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/980f2c6fab91596cf73ee4624371e35ed1643e30/0_127_4725_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers assemble a replica Berlin Wall on the halfway line, which was then pulled down before kicked off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers assemble a replica Berlin Wall on the halfway line, which was then pulled down before kicked off.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/englische-woche/2019/nov/08/rb-leipzig-defence-club-bundesliga-bayern-munich\">In defence of RB Leipzig</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u2022 Two coaches were on their way after the weekend\u2019s action \u2013 K\u00f6ln, unsurprisingly, moved on Achim Beierlorzer after his team\u2019s heartbreaking last-gasp Friday night defeat against Hoffenheim, while Sandro Schwarz left Mainz after their 3-2 defeat by Union, the top-flight debutants\u2019 first away win of the season.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The end of an entertaining enough meeting between Freiburg and Eintracht Frankfurt in Sunday\u2019s late game (won 1-0 by Freiburg) exploded with a left-field twist in the dying embers of stoppage time when the Eintracht captain, David Abraham \u2013 on his way to hurriedly return the ball from touch \u2013 quite deliberately leaned in and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/freiburg-coach-knocked-over-eintracht-frankfurt-captain-christian-streich-david-abraham\" title=\"\">bodychecked the home head coach Christian Streich</a>, knocking the 54-year-old off his feet and sparking a huge melee. Abraham, who had been simmering for a number of minutes before the collision, was sent off, meaning Eintracht finished with nine, as was the already substituted Vincenzo Grifo of Freiburg.</p> \n<p>Abraham was on a post-match charm offensive, posing for pics with Grifo on social media and releasing a club statement in which he apologised to Streich but he still faces the prospect of a long ban.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ca371822-af3e-436a-881c-d85291645bf2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n

      "bodyText": "Every team has their blind spot, their house of horror, where they can\u2019t put a foot right. On the weekend of Der Klassiker we were emphatically reminded that Borussia Dortmund\u2019s bad place is against ostensibly their biggest domestic rivals. \u201cIn Munich,\u201d wrote the ESPN journalist Stephan Uersfeld, \u201cDortmund are the new Hamburg.\u201d They are currently in the second tier, but Hamburg have lost their past nine Bundesliga games at Bayern dating back to 2010, including two 8-0s, two 6-0s, two 5-0s and a 9-2. There is more than flippancy in the comparisons. Dortmund have now been on the end of six successive Bundesliga defeats at the Allianz Arena, with the five most recent by scores of 5-1, 4-1, 6-0, 5-0 and now 4-0. They themselves didn\u2019t need the focus of the numbers to feel the jinx. Ten days on from Halloween, Lucien Favre\u2019s team looked spooked from the get-go, with the ominous sign 39 seconds in when Roman B\u00fcrki had to be quickly off his line to clear from Robert Lewandowski, after the visitors\u2019 defence was split by a simple straight ball. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time in another chastening experience in Bavaria for BVB. It was an evening that S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Christof Kneer called \u201cbad news for the league\u201d, as Bayern made the very idea of competition look fanciful. Many of the familiar themes were present \u2013 Lewandowski\u2019s utter dominance against his former team, beginning from the superb, stooping first-half header from Benjamin Pavard\u2019s cross, was unavoidable. Dortmund\u2019s tentativeness was another, and the extent to which they were simply exhausted by the efforts expended by their stirring Champions League comeback against Internazionale might have been more closely examined in a context outside that of their recent history in Munich. The not-quite-fit Jadon Sancho, who dribbled the ball out of play in his first involvement and was uncommonly indecisive before being substituted with ten minutes still to go in the first half, was perhaps a symptom of that hangover. Yet this felt, six days on from Niko Kovac\u2019s exit, like a new beginning under Hansi Flick, the coach who was Bayern\u2019s stash pick in the summer, brought in above Kovac\u2019s head seemingly exactly for the sort of eventuality like last week\u2019s capitulation in Frankfurt. The effects have been, according to the influential Thomas M\u00fcller (who famously didn\u2019t click with Kovac), \u201coutstanding in such a short time\u201d. Leon Goretzka, starting in the league for the first time this season, talked about Flick having \u201cchanged the attitude\u201d of the team already and it was evident from the off in the snap and press that the champions employed all over the field \u2013 a style that, many argued, Kovac couldn\u2019t draw from a set of players who simply didn\u2019t have it in them. It was difficult to judge whether Dortmund\u2019s lethargy was a result of digging deep on Tuesday, or whether they simply looked slower by comparison with Bayern\u2019s renewed hunger. The goal which effectively finished the game, by Serge Gnabry, was tucked away after a lightning transition, a mere 64 seconds into the second half. \u201cFlick has managed to make Bayern believe they are Bayern again,\u201d wrote Kneer. Not that anyone in the Bayern camp is under any illusions that this is a quick fix. There was even the odd banner supporting Kovac and his brother (and assistant) Robert, thanking them for their efforts and signalling there is acknowledgement in the fanbase that it wasn\u2019t all down to the coach. This was an occasion, though, to express relief, to embrace the hope that the inertia of the past few years might be drawing to a close. Uli Hoeness, in his last match as president, exulted in the stands \u2013 \u201cHe nearly knocked me down the stairs after the first goal,\u201d his habitual watching partner Karl-Heinz Rummenigge remarked \u2013 and his seal of approval for Flick followed. \u201cClearly Flick is our first candidate as a coach,\u201d Hoeness said, signalling that his step back from the frontline won\u2019t make his opinions more hidden. On the other side, it was a deflating end to a run of three successive wins in big games for Favre, bookended by that triumph against Inter, and it was an indication that questions over his suitability to take Dortmund to where they really want to go will still be asked. Favre, who had talked about his side having \u201cnothing to lose\u201d going into this game, could be argued to still not quite have the requisite ambition, with Marco Reus and Paco Alc\u00e1cer \u2013 admittedly, both with fitness issues - only brought on after an hour with BVB already two down and hanging on in the game by their fingernails. Ambition has never been an issue for the Rekordmeister. Flick and his future can wait. For now, playing like the big, bad Bayern of old felt good. Talking points \u2022 There were moments of reflection, both silent and full of applause, around all Bundesliga grounds before kick-off as the league paid its respects to late Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke, 10 years on from his passing. It also served to highlight the work of the Robert Enke Foundation, involved in helping people with mental health issues and also children with heart conditions. \u2022 It was a special Saturday afternoon in Berlin as Hertha commemorated 30 years since the fall of the wall before their home game with RB Leipzig. The home side also wore special kits for the occasion, and local lad Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt opened the scoring with a cracker. Unfortunately for his fellow Berliner, the coach Ante Covic, Leipzig came back, led home by a Timo Werner brace and the presence in the stand of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, recently appointed to Hertha\u2019s supervisory board, was a reminder of gradually rising expectation as they were leapfrogged by Union in the table, one week on from the derby. \u2022 Two coaches were on their way after the weekend\u2019s action \u2013 K\u00f6ln, unsurprisingly, moved on Achim Beierlorzer after his team\u2019s heartbreaking last-gasp Friday night defeat against Hoffenheim, while Sandro Schwarz left Mainz after their 3-2 defeat by Union, the top-flight debutants\u2019 first away win of the season. \u2022 The end of an entertaining enough meeting between Freiburg and Eintracht Frankfurt in Sunday\u2019s late game (won 1-0 by Freiburg) exploded with a left-field twist in the dying embers of stoppage time when the Eintracht captain, David Abraham \u2013 on his way to hurriedly return the ball from touch \u2013 quite deliberately leaned in and bodychecked the home head coach Christian Streich, knocking the 54-year-old off his feet and sparking a huge melee. Abraham, who had been simmering for a number of minutes before the collision, was sent off, meaning Eintracht finished with nine, as was the already substituted Vincenzo Grifo of Freiburg. Abraham was on a post-match charm offensive, posing for pics with Grifo on social media and releasing a club statement in which he apologised to Streich but he still faces the prospect of a long ban.",

He was educated at Ampleforth college, North Yorkshire. From the age of 11, he and Branson embarked on a series of short-sighted business ventures, including a budgerigar breeding scheme that ended gruesomely: \u201cThey multiplied quicker than we could sell them,\u201d said Branson, \u201cand eventually many got eaten by rats before my mum released the rest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d798a577edf716fee2b5060767933381baec283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d798a577edf716fee2b5060767933381baec283/0_117_2416_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cathy Tyson and Bob Hoskins in Mona Lisa, 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cathy Tyson and Bob Hoskins in Mona Lisa, 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A rudimentary business plan to grow and sell fir trees in time for Christmas was mapped out on the back of an envelope but <a href=\"https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/ideas-are-rabbits\" title=\"\">went awry</a> when rabbits devoured the seedlings that the boys had planted in Branson\u2019s parents\u2019 garden. Branson dropped out of school to set up his own magazine, Student, launched in 1968 and aimed at readers his own age; Powell distributed it, though the pair fell out when Branson became convinced that his friend\u2019s plan to transform it into a co-operative amounted to a coup.</p> <p>A rapprochement came about when Branson persuaded Powell, who had just completed his first term at the University of Sussex, to abandon his studies and join him in a mail-order record company, promising him a 40% stake; it was to be named Slipped Disc until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/18/tessa-watts\" title=\"\">Tessa Watts</a>, another staff member, happened to remark that they were all \u201cvirgins\u201d at business. Virgin ran a smattering of record shops, including one in Notting Hill where customers were invited to hang out on bean bags (\u201cNot surprisingly some people stayed all day and never got round to buying a thing,\u201d <a href=\"https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2017/10/simon-draper-virgin-records\" title=\"\">observed</a> the journalist Mick Brown) and another above a shoe shop on Oxford Street. The latter venue later expanded spectacularly to become its leading store.</p> <p>For some years, the record label resembled what its press officer Al Clark called an \u201caudio Arts Council\u201d, subsidising marginal or experimental musicians with the help of the Tubular Bells fortune. As the company grew it branched out into other areas, building a recording studio and buying the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/05/scala-cinema-vintage-goodwood\" title=\"\">Scala cinema</a> in London, hiring Woolley to manage it. Powell left Virgin in 1982, the same year his first marriage, to Branson\u2019s sister-in-law Merrill Tomassi, ended in divorce. He sold his Virgin shares to Branson for around \u00a31m. Branson sold the company to EMI in 1992 for \u00a3640m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0444fa589c6d28e493e9982ffd73651727b4109\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0444fa589c6d28e493e9982ffd73651727b4109/0_4_1836_1102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Rea, left, and Forest Whitaker in The Crying Game, 1\u00a7992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Rea, left, and Forest Whitaker in The Crying Game, 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Powell and Woolley ran Palace as a seat-of-the-pants operation with a loose, hip vibe (Powell\u2019s office, for instance, had a sofa but no desk), and its mixture of stratospheric highs and stomach-turning lows was later documented in Angus Finney\u2019s 1996 book The Egos Have Landed: The Rise and Fall of Palace Pictures.</p> <p>While Woolley brought his depth and breadth of film knowledge and his passion for cinema, Powell was portrayed in the book as a highly motivated, quick-witted figure with impeccable business acumen and a tight fist.

From the age of 11, he and Branson embarked on a series of short-sighted business ventures, including a budgerigar breeding scheme that ended gruesomely: \u201cThey multiplied quicker than we could sell them,\u201d said Branson, \u201cand eventually many got eaten by rats before my mum released the rest.\u201d A rudimentary business plan to grow and sell fir trees in time for Christmas was mapped out on the back of an envelope but went awry when rabbits devoured the seedlings that the boys had planted in Branson\u2019s parents\u2019 garden. Branson dropped out of school to set up his own magazine, Student, launched in 1968 and aimed at readers his own age; Powell distributed it, though the pair fell out when Branson became convinced that his friend\u2019s plan to transform it into a co-operative amounted to a coup. A rapprochement came about when Branson persuaded Powell, who had just completed his first term at the University of Sussex, to abandon his studies and join him in a mail-order record company, promising him a 40% stake; it was to be named Slipped Disc until Tessa Watts, another staff member, happened to remark that they were all \u201cvirgins\u201d at business. Virgin ran a smattering of record shops, including one in Notting Hill where customers were invited to hang out on bean bags (\u201cNot surprisingly some people stayed all day and never got round to buying a thing,\u201d observed the journalist Mick Brown) and another above a shoe shop on Oxford Street. The latter venue later expanded spectacularly to become its leading store. For some years, the record label resembled what its press officer Al Clark called an \u201caudio Arts Council\u201d, subsidising marginal or experimental musicians with the help of the Tubular Bells fortune. As the company grew it branched out into other areas, building a recording studio and buying the Scala cinema in London, hiring Woolley to manage it. Powell left Virgin in 1982, the same year his first marriage, to Branson\u2019s sister-in-law Merrill Tomassi, ended in divorce. He sold his Virgin shares to Branson for around \u00a31m. Branson sold the company to EMI in 1992 for \u00a3640m. Powell and Woolley ran Palace as a seat-of-the-pants operation with a loose, hip vibe (Powell\u2019s office, for instance, had a sofa but no desk), and its mixture of stratospheric highs and stomach-turning lows was later documented in Angus Finney\u2019s 1996 book The Egos Have Landed: The Rise and Fall of Palace Pictures. While Woolley brought his depth and breadth of film knowledge and his passion for cinema, Powell was portrayed in the book as a highly motivated, quick-witted figure with impeccable business acumen and a tight fist. Angela Morrison, a lawyer who worked for him, recalls in the book giving her new business card to a colleague, only for Powell to object: \u201cDon\u2019t give him that. He already knows you. These things cost money!\u201d Palace remained at the vanguard of independent cinema for many years, releasing work by directors such as Mike Leigh and Peter Greenaway, and still enjoyed many distribution successes, notably the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally (1988). But the staggering popularity of The Crying Game came too late, and at the time of the company\u2019s collapse in 1992 it was said to have amassed debts of around \u00a330m. Powell then set up Scala Productions, which enjoyed success with films including the Nick Hornby adaptation Fever Pitch (1997) and the Oscar-nominated musical drama Little Voice (1998); he was also one of the producers on Dark Blood, which had to be abandoned midway through filming in 1993 when its star, River Phoenix, died of a drugs overdose. (The director, George Sluizer, later pieced together an incomplete version which had its premiere in 2012.) Powell chaired the European Film Academy from 1996 to 2003, and was then appointed director of the National Film and Television School. He remained in the post for 15 years and was widely agreed to have instilled the place with a new dynamism, quieting in the process those critics who had questioned his lack of educational experience. He is survived by his partner, Sarah Cellan Jones, and by Amie and Jack, his children from his second marriage, to the singer Sandie Shaw, which ended in divorce in 1995. \u2022 Nik Powell, film producer and businessman, born 4 November 1950; died 7 November 2019",

For many people, the association of this competition with BP is seen as being at odds with that aim. \u201cTherefore, after due consideration, the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland have decided that this will be the last time that the galleries will host this exhibition in its present form.\u201d The decision comes nearly four years after Tate and the Edinburgh international festival announced they were ending long-running sponsorship partnerships with the petroleum firm. Campaigners had hoped that would quickly lead to the termination of all BP\u2019s arts sponsorship deals. That did not happen and regular protests continued at the big four recipients of BP money: the NPG, the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the Royal Shakespeare Company. In October the RSC broke ranks and announced it was ending its deal with BP two years early, citing pressure from young people. BP expressed disappointment at that decision and said everyone needed to work together to achieve a low-carbon future. \u201cIronically, the increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,\u201d it said. The NPG is due to host what would be the 31st BP Portrait Award next year, with the closing date for entries advertised as 11 December. It has been complicated because the NPG\u2019s building will close for nearly three years from July, when it traditionally hosts the prize exhibition. Observers see that as an opportunity to end the sponsorship. The gallery said it was considering options for the prize.",

      "bodyText": "The company behind plans for a giant fertiliser mine under the North York Moors hopes to rescue the struggling project by raising $600m (\u00a3465m) from new investors by March. Sirius Minerals has revised plans to finance the world\u2019s largest potash mine of its type after the $5bn project was thrown into doubt in September when it abandoned a bond issue, blaming a lack of government support and Brexit uncertainty. The London-listed company said on Monday it was already in talks with potential investors to fund the first phase of the project\u2019s development. The funds could provide an 11th-hour lifeline for what could prove to be the largest mine developed in the UK for a generation. Sirius has already raised $1.2bn to develop the Woodsmith mine but needs a further $3.8bn to turn the project into the world\u2019s biggest producer of polyhalite, a potent type of fertiliser. The embattled company hopes that once the initial work programme is complete the project will be considered less risky by investors and will attract further funds to complete the development. Chris Fraser, the chief executive of Sirius, said he was in discussions with potential strategic partners and debt investors \u201cwith the aim of securing the best route\u201d to finance the first phase of the project. The company\u2019s share price climbed by more than 10% after the announcement to about 3.6p on Monday morning. It is a meagre increase for the company\u2019s shareholders, which include about 85,000 retail investors, after shares have fallen more than 80% over the past year from 23p. The last-ditch plan comes weeks after the developer plunged the project into severe doubt by shelving a crucial fundraising because the company did not believe it would be able to raise the cash. Sirius pulled the plug on the $500m junk bond issue, blaming the investor uncertainty over Brexit and the government\u2019s unwillingness to issue $1bn worth of loan guarantees. It had previously warned that it would run the risk of going bust without the funding injection, but vowed to bring together a new financing plan. The developer said it would seek alternative investors and might turn to a sovereign wealth fund, large fertiliser companies or a major mining group for help. It ruled out further funds from Australia\u2019s richest woman, Gina Rinehart. The mining magnate has already invested $250m in the Woodsmith mine project through her Hancock Prospecting company. Helal Miah, an investment analyst at the Share Centre, said: \u201cToday\u2019s news is just a lifeline, nothing more, for a company that has a huge challenge with its viability and shows a company doing everything possible just to survive. \u201cAs an investor I would say it is still one to avoid because even if this funding were to be successful, further significant challenges will be met down the road, including convincing a government \u2013 assuming the Conservatives are successful \u2013 who have already turned them down once.\u201d Fraser said the progress achieved \u201con the ground\u201d in recent months \u201cremains a source of huge inspiration for the whole team\u201d. Sirius plans to construct a 1,500m-deep mine beneath the North York Moors national park that would use a 23-mile underground conveyor belt to ship tonnes of low-cost potash to Teesside for export. More than 1,000 people are at work on the site and Sirius believes the project could support about 2,500 high-earning jobs in the area once it is up and running.",

      "body": "<p>There was a time, in late 2017, when Shakira thought she might never sing again. After suffering a haemorrhage in her vocal cords, she could barely speak. \u201cI always thought there were going to be things in my life that would go away, like beauty, youth, all of that stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I never thought that my voice would leave me, because it\u2019s so inherent to my nature. It was my identity. So when I couldn\u2019t sing, that was unbearable. There were times I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed \u2013 I was so depressed.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s something almost fairytale-like about this: a cautionary fable about the danger of taking happiness for granted, starring the Colombian singer who sold a reported 75m records and became one of the richest women in pop. To give her voice the best chance to recover, there were periods when Shakira wouldn\u2019t speak at all. \u201cI had to communicate through signs and nobody could understand me.\u201d</p> <p>Her children \u2013 then two and four \u2013 couldn\u2019t read, so writing didn\u2019t help. She says she never fought with her partner, the Barcelona defender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/gerard-pique-catalan-referendum-footballer-express-himself\">Gerard Piqu\u00e9</a>, so much as when she couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cHe jokes that you would think you would want your wife to shut up \u2013 but when I had to remain quiet, he felt like one of those ex-convicts who are given their freedom and don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d How did she stay positive? \u201cI was not positive. I was so pessimistic. I was a bitter person to be around.\u201d She laughs. \u201cGerard saw the worst of me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When her voice returned, without an operation, 'it felt like I was having some kind of religious experience'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Doctors told her she needed surgery, but she wasn\u2019t convinced it would work. Instead she tried hypnosis and meditation, even going to Lourdes to get holy water. \u201cEither I needed surgery or divine intervention.\u201d When her voice eventually returned, without an operation, \u201cit felt like I was having some kind of religious experience\u201d. On her El Dorado tour, which she\u2019d been forced to postpone, every night on stage was \u201ca gift\u201d.</p> <p>A film of the tour is about to be released, which is why we\u2019re meeting in a hotel suite in Barcelona, by the window in the late afternoon, a darkening sky outside. Shakira sits cross-legged and tiny in a giant armchair, eating gummy sweets. A publicist is somewhere across the room in the shadows.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLrEF3_NEe4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nLrEF3_NEe4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLrEF3_NEe4\">Watch a trailer for Shakira\u2019s El Dorado tour film</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There is a palpable joy to Shakira\u2019s concert performances, filmed mostly at her Los Angeles show in August last year. She dances in sparkly fishnet leggings, her voice filling the stadium as she sings such Spanish-language favourites as Chantaje and her English-language crossover hits, including Whenever, Wherever and She Wolf. She thinks the experience has made her a better singer. \u201cYou go out in search of affirmation that you\u2019re good, that people like you. But this time it was different \u2013 I was out there because I wanted to feel the pleasure of singing.\u201d</p> <p>In February, Shakira will perform with Jennifer Lopez at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/sep/26/jennifer-lopez-and-shakira-to-headline-super-bowl-2020-halftime-show\">Super Bowl</a> half-time show, viewed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/the-10-greatest-super-bowl-half-time-shows-ranked\">a career high for many artists</a>. At least it was until 2016 and the NFL\u2019s treatment of the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had started kneeling during the national anthem in protest at racial inequality and police brutality. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/06/super-bowl-half-time-show-rihanna-cardi-b-colin-kaepernick\">Many artists, in solidarity with Kaepernick</a>, reportedly turned down the chance to perform at half-time. Did his protest have any impact on her decision to take to the stage? She looks down. \u201cWell, you know, I think it\u2019s the right thing to do for the Latino community because we\u2019ve also been through so much in Trump\u2019s America, with walls being built and \u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to celebrate our culture, you know?\u201d</p> <p>Why has Latin pop become so big? \u201cWell, it was about time,\u201d says Shakira. Now 42, she wrote her first songs at just eight and recorded her first album, Magia, at 13. \u201cWhen I started, Colombia had a nonexistent pop scene. I had to overcome so many obstacles to become an international pop singer. Later on, even when I crossed over to the Anglo-American market, I had to fight my own record company to put out music like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUT5rEU6pqM\">Hips Don\u2019t Lie</a>.

      "bodyText": "There was a time, in late 2017, when Shakira thought she might never sing again. After suffering a haemorrhage in her vocal cords, she could barely speak. \u201cI always thought there were going to be things in my life that would go away, like beauty, youth, all of that stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I never thought that my voice would leave me, because it\u2019s so inherent to my nature. It was my identity. So when I couldn\u2019t sing, that was unbearable. There were times I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed \u2013 I was so depressed.\u201d There\u2019s something almost fairytale-like about this: a cautionary fable about the danger of taking happiness for granted, starring the Colombian singer who sold a reported 75m records and became one of the richest women in pop. To give her voice the best chance to recover, there were periods when Shakira wouldn\u2019t speak at all. \u201cI had to communicate through signs and nobody could understand me.\u201d Her children \u2013 then two and four \u2013 couldn\u2019t read, so writing didn\u2019t help. She says she never fought with her partner, the Barcelona defender Gerard Piqu\u00e9, so much as when she couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cHe jokes that you would think you would want your wife to shut up \u2013 but when I had to remain quiet, he felt like one of those ex-convicts who are given their freedom and don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d How did she stay positive? \u201cI was not positive. I was so pessimistic. I was a bitter person to be around.\u201d She laughs. \u201cGerard saw the worst of me.\u201d Doctors told her she needed surgery, but she wasn\u2019t convinced it would work. Instead she tried hypnosis and meditation, even going to Lourdes to get holy water. \u201cEither I needed surgery or divine intervention.\u201d When her voice eventually returned, without an operation, \u201cit felt like I was having some kind of religious experience\u201d. On her El Dorado tour, which she\u2019d been forced to postpone, every night on stage was \u201ca gift\u201d. A film of the tour is about to be released, which is why we\u2019re meeting in a hotel suite in Barcelona, by the window in the late afternoon, a darkening sky outside. Shakira sits cross-legged and tiny in a giant armchair, eating gummy sweets. A publicist is somewhere across the room in the shadows. There is a palpable joy to Shakira\u2019s concert performances, filmed mostly at her Los Angeles show in August last year. She dances in sparkly fishnet leggings, her voice filling the stadium as she sings such Spanish-language favourites as Chantaje and her English-language crossover hits, including Whenever, Wherever and She Wolf. She thinks the experience has made her a better singer. \u201cYou go out in search of affirmation that you\u2019re good, that people like you. But this time it was different \u2013 I was out there because I wanted to feel the pleasure of singing.\u201d In February, Shakira will perform with Jennifer Lopez at the Super Bowl half-time show, viewed as a career high for many artists. At least it was until 2016 and the NFL\u2019s treatment of the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had started kneeling during the national anthem in protest at racial inequality and police brutality. Many artists, in solidarity with Kaepernick, reportedly turned down the chance to perform at half-time. Did his protest have any impact on her decision to take to the stage? She looks down. \u201cWell, you know, I think it\u2019s the right thing to do for the Latino community because we\u2019ve also been through so much in Trump\u2019s America, with walls being built and \u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to celebrate our culture, you know?\u201d Why has Latin pop become so big? \u201cWell, it was about time,\u201d says Shakira. Now 42, she wrote her first songs at just eight and recorded her first album, Magia, at 13. \u201cWhen I started, Colombia had a nonexistent pop scene. I had to overcome so many obstacles to become an international pop singer. Later on, even when I crossed over to the Anglo-American market, I had to fight my own record company to put out music like Hips Don\u2019t Lie. My music always had some kind of fusion \u2013 Colombian and Middle Eastern influences, so it made my path even harder.\u201d She lives in Barcelona with Piqu\u00e9 and their two sons. This tour is her first as a mother. \u201cI had no idea how this was going to feel,\u201d she says. \u201cAt some points, I thought it was going to be impossible.

      "bodyText": "Two people are in a critical condition in Hong Kong after another day of protests and violent clashes between anti-government protesters and police that left more than 60 people injured. A police officer shot an unarmed 21-year-old male university student in the stomach as demonstrators attempted to disrupt the Monday morning rush hour as part of a day of planned protests and strikes. Later in the day, a middle-aged man was doused in a flammable liquid and set on fire after arguing with protesters. Both the student and the man were in critical condition, according to Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority. The two incidents, both captured on video, come after the death of a protester on Friday who succumbed to injuries sustained after falling from a car park during a police dispersal of demonstrators. It was the first death directly linked to police action. The shooting and the man being set on fire, following closely after the death, could mark a turning point in five months of protests, which have grown increasingly violent. Speaking to reporters, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said: \u201cI do not want to go into details, but I just want to make it very clear that we will spare no effort in finding ways and means that could end the violence in Hong Kong as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cIf there is still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence the government will yield to pressure \u2026 I am making this clear and loud here.

In a sign of further confusion over how prime minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement will work, the parties\u2019 fisheries spokesmen have written to the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, asking why her department appears to claim that fish caught in waters off the coast of Northern Ireland will no longer be classed as Northern Irish fish. Labour\u2019s Luke Pollard and the DUP\u2019s Jim Shannon wrote that the province\u2019s fishing industry of 300 boats were questioning who will be in charge over customs, taxes, visas and enforcement of rules. The letter, sent before parliament dissolved for the election and leaked to the Guardian, can be disclosed after Johnson appeared to misunderstand his own Brexit deal on a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday. In a video shot in Northern Ireland on Thursday night, Johnson told exporters they would not need to fill in customs declarations when they sent goods across the Irish Sea, adding that if firms were asked to they should call him and he would \u201cdirect them to throw that form in the bin\u201d. This contradicted the view of Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, who told a House of Lords committee that businesses would need to complete \u201cexit summary declarations\u201d for such sending shipments. In the letter, Pollard and Shannon wrote: \u201cWe are taking the unprecedented step of writing a joint letter to you as the Labour and the DUP\u2019s spokespeople on fisheries to raise concern about the Brexit deal and fisheries in Northern Ireland.\u201d In the final week of October, officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the Northern Irish fishing industry that direct landings of fish into Northern Ireland would be subject to new obligations as if they were landing in an EU port, they wrote. \u201cThis would include the requirement to issue catch certificates and they [the officials] warned that tariffs could apply to these landings,\u201d the letter said. The letter points out that the department\u2019s press office attempted to clarify matters by issuing a second statement to the Guardian, which said: \u201cThe Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement bill applies EU customs legislation in Northern Ireland but excludes the territorial sea.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cThis seems to suggest that Northern Ireland\u2019s territorial waters are excluded from the Northern Ireland protocol, meaning they remain in the GB customs and VAT territory and not in the Northern Ireland/EU customs territory. \u201cThese two statements seem to suggest that the fish caught by Northern Irish fishers off the coast of Northern Ireland may no longer be classed as Northern Irish fish.

[Stefano] Sensi, who we signed from Sassuolo?\u201d</p> \n<p>These were unworthy remarks from a manager whose club splurged more than \u20ac150m on transfer fees in the summer window, delivering him several of the players he wanted most. Barella had been one of Conte\u2019s top priorities. Sensi was Inter\u2019s standout performer through the first two months of this season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/cristiano-ronaldo-angered-substitution-juventus-milan\">Cristiano Ronaldo \u2018leaves stadium early\u2019 after being substituted again by Sarri</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even if we accept the assessment that inexperience cost the <em>Nerazzurri</em>, Conte might still only have himself to blame. He raised no objections when the club packed Radja Nainggolan off to Cagliari on loan in August.</p> \n<p>Signed from Roma for the best part of \u20ac40m one year before, the Belgian chipped in seven goals and three assists during his single season at Inter and yet his reputation for enjoying life away from the training pitch appears to have counted against him. \u201cConte told me he had always rated me highly,\u201d the player told Corriere dello Sport, \u201cbut that this decision was taken for non\u2011footballing reasons.\u201d</p> \n<p>Inter\u2019s loss has been Cagliari\u2019s gain. Nainggolan had offers from China and several other clubs in Italy, but chose to return to the team with whom he made his Serie A debut. Together, they are threatening to gatecrash the Champions League.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Cagliari moved up to joint-third with a 5-2 demolition of Fiorentina. It was their seventh win in 12 games \u2013 matching their best start to a top-flight campaign. The last time they came out of the blocks this quickly, in 1969-70, they went on to win the Scudetto.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8987e9fb7c35ad1c26bf55b73de0ccb909ed8e08\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8987e9fb7c35ad1c26bf55b73de0ccb909ed8e08/0_105_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radja Naiggolan was a man possessed against Fiorentina, providing three assists and scoring a screamer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radja Naiggolan was a man possessed against Fiorentina, providing three assists and scoring a screamer.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enrico Locci/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That might be out of reach this time around, given the relentless pace set by Juventus and Conte\u2019s Inter. A European berth, however, hardly feels unattainable for a side capable of producing football as devastating as Cagliari did at the weekend. Each of their five goals was scored by a different player, and each showed a different way in which they could hurt an opponent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/freiburg-coach-knocked-over-eintracht-frankfurt-captain-christian-streich-david-abraham\">Frankfurt\u2019s captain sent off for knocking over Freiburg coach, sparking chaos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cagliari\u2019s opener demonstrated how they could dissect a defence with their passing: the ball switched from Luca Cigarini to Jo\u00e3o Pedro, Nainggolan, Marko Rog and then the back of the net in a sum total of five touches. Their second goal arrived from a corner: Cigarini finding Fabio Pisacane at the back post.</p> \n<p>Then came improvisation: Giovanni Simeone inventing a backheel finish after Nainggolan recovered the rebound from his own shot and volleyed back across the six-yard box. Next was a classic counterattack, the Belgian setting things in motion again when he won possession in his own half and marauded upfield before sliding the ball in for Jo\u00e3o Pedro to finish.</p> \n<p>Nainggolan himself got the fifth: a trademark 25-yard thunderbolt to remind us that, when necessary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAvkn6zYBJU\" title=\"\">he can resolve things all on his own</a>. The score by this stage was 5-0. A pair of late consolation goals from Fiorentina\u2019s teenage substitute Dusan Vlahovic made the final result look closer than this match truly was.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As brilliant as Nainggolan was on Sunday, with a goal and a hat-trick of assists, his presence alone cannot explain such transformation. The reality is that Cagliari reinvested the proceeds of Barella\u2019s transfer \u2013 which could rise to \u20ac49m if all bonuses are met \u2013 to tremendous effect.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/european-roundup-lionel-messi-hat-trick-sends-barcelona-top-as-real-chase\">European roundup: Lionel Messi hat-trick sends Barcelona top as Real chase</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rog was a club-record signing from Napoli at \u20ac15m this summer, surpassed days later by the arrival of Nahitan N\u00e1ndez for \u20ac18m from Boca Juniors. Aged 24 and 23 respectively, with more than 40 international caps between them for Croatia and Uruguay, their arrivals, together with that of Nainggolan, transformed a midfield in which Barella had often appeared to be waging a one-man war for survival.</p> \n<p>Up front, Simeone offered a fresh pace and directness. In a roundabout way, the cruciate ligament injury sustained by Leonardo Pavoletti might even have accelerated the team\u2019s evolution.</p> \n<p>Eleven of the striker\u2019s team-leading 16 goals last season came from headers, and as long as he was in the team the temptation would always be to concentrate on high balls into the box. Without him, Cagliari are much more inclined to keep the ball on the floor \u2013 making priorities instead of directness and quick transitions.</p> \n<p>Three months into this season, their form can no longer be dismissed. Cagliari have won away against Napoli and Atalanta, as well as drawing at Roma. Only the penalty-winning brilliance of Sensi allowed Inter to take all three points on their visit to the Sardegna Arena, an occasion marred by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/08/internazionale-romelu-lukaku-latest-victim-ultras-racism\" title=\"\">racist abuse of Romelu Lukaku</a>.</p> \n<p>Not even Nainggolan expected his team to do this well. Cagliari have amassed 24 points from their first 12 games and he confessed on Sunday that, when he signed, he would not have guessed they could hit such a figure before March. Although he believes he could have been an asset to Inter, his motivation in coming back to Cagliari was never to prove a point on the pitch.</p> \n<p>A greater priority was to be in a place where his wife, Claudia, could get the treatment and support she needs after being diagnosed with breast cancer. \u201cSometimes you need to think about being a man first of all,\u201d Nainggolan said in an interview with DAZN last month, \u201crather than just thinking about your career.\u201d</p> \n<p>Those two things, though, do not have to be mutually exclusive. Conte was wrong to say that Inter lack an experienced midfielder capable of taking games in hand. Their mistake was sending him out on loan to Cagliari.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cDifficult match, important victory #finoallafine\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cristiano/status/1193849256857260032\" title=\"\">Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s tweet</a> this morning is being read by the Italian press as an attempt to calm the waters after he was subbed off, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/cristiano-ronaldo-angered-substitution-juventus-milan\" title=\"\">apparently walked out of the stadium</a> during Juventus\u2019s game against Milan.

After the home of the midfielder Allan was broken into on Thursday, his wife raised the grim possibility that the incident could be linked to tension around the team. Carlo Ancelotti is under huge pressure to restore calm, while newspapers are speculating that Dries Mertens, a perceived ringleader of the revolt, could be sold as soon as January \u2013 an

      "bodyText": "After watching his Internazionale team throw away a two-goal lead against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday, Antonio Conte lamented a shortage of top-level experience in his playing squad. \u201cWho am I supposed to call on?\u201d he demanded. \u201cNicol\u00f2 Barella, who came here from Cagliari? [Stefano] Sensi, who we signed from Sassuolo?\u201d These were unworthy remarks from a manager whose club splurged more than \u20ac150m on transfer fees in the summer window, delivering him several of the players he wanted most. Barella had been one of Conte\u2019s top priorities. Sensi was Inter\u2019s standout performer through the first two months of this season. Even if we accept the assessment that inexperience cost the Nerazzurri, Conte might still only have himself to blame. He raised no objections when the club packed Radja Nainggolan off to Cagliari on loan in August. Signed from Roma for the best part of \u20ac40m one year before, the Belgian chipped in seven goals and three assists during his single season at Inter and yet his reputation for enjoying life away from the training pitch appears to have counted against him. \u201cConte told me he had always rated me highly,\u201d the player told Corriere dello Sport, \u201cbut that this decision was taken for non\u2011footballing reasons.\u201d Inter\u2019s loss has been Cagliari\u2019s gain. Nainggolan had offers from China and several other clubs in Italy, but chose to return to the team with whom he made his Serie A debut. Together, they are threatening to gatecrash the Champions League. On Sunday, Cagliari moved up to joint-third with a 5-2 demolition of Fiorentina. It was their seventh win in 12 games \u2013 matching their best start to a top-flight campaign. The last time they came out of the blocks this quickly, in 1969-70, they went on to win the Scudetto. That might be out of reach this time around, given the relentless pace set by Juventus and Conte\u2019s Inter. A European berth, however, hardly feels unattainable for a side capable of producing football as devastating as Cagliari did at the weekend. Each of their five goals was scored by a different player, and each showed a different way in which they could hurt an opponent. Cagliari\u2019s opener demonstrated how they could dissect a defence with their passing: the ball switched from Luca Cigarini to Jo\u00e3o Pedro, Nainggolan, Marko Rog and then the back of the net in a sum total of five touches. Their second goal arrived from a corner: Cigarini finding Fabio Pisacane at the back post. Then came improvisation: Giovanni Simeone inventing a backheel finish after Nainggolan recovered the rebound from his own shot and volleyed back across the six-yard box. Next was a classic counterattack, the Belgian setting things in motion again when he won possession in his own half and marauded upfield before sliding the ball in for Jo\u00e3o Pedro to finish. Nainggolan himself got the fifth: a trademark 25-yard thunderbolt to remind us that, when necessary, he can resolve things all on his own. The score by this stage was 5-0. A pair of late consolation goals from Fiorentina\u2019s teenage substitute Dusan Vlahovic made the final result look closer than this match truly was. As brilliant as Nainggolan was on Sunday, with a goal and a hat-trick of assists, his presence alone cannot explain such transformation. The reality is that Cagliari reinvested the proceeds of Barella\u2019s transfer \u2013 which could rise to \u20ac49m if all bonuses are met \u2013 to tremendous effect. Rog was a club-record signing from Napoli at \u20ac15m this summer, surpassed days later by the arrival of Nahitan N\u00e1ndez for \u20ac18m from Boca Juniors. Aged 24 and 23 respectively, with more than 40 international caps between them for Croatia and Uruguay, their arrivals, together with that of Nainggolan, transformed a midfield in which Barella had often appeared to be waging a one-man war for survival. Up front, Simeone offered a fresh pace and directness. In a roundabout way, the cruciate ligament injury sustained by Leonardo Pavoletti might even have accelerated the team\u2019s evolution. Eleven of the striker\u2019s team-leading 16 goals last season came from headers, and as long as he was in the team the temptation would always be to concentrate on high balls into the box. Without him, Cagliari are much more inclined to keep the ball on the floor \u2013 making priorities instead of directness and quick transitions. Three months into this season, their form can no longer be dismissed. Cagliari have won away against Napoli and Atalanta, as well as drawing at Roma. Only the penalty-winning brilliance of Sensi allowed Inter to take all three points on their visit to the Sardegna Arena, an occasion marred by racist abuse of Romelu Lukaku. Not even Nainggolan expected his team to do this well. Cagliari have amassed 24 points from their first 12 games and he confessed on Sunday that, when he signed, he would not have guessed they could hit such a figure before March. Although he believes he could have been an asset to Inter, his motivation in coming back to Cagliari was never to prove a point on the pitch. A greater priority was to be in a place where his wife, Claudia, could get the treatment and support she needs after being diagnosed with breast cancer. \u201cSometimes you need to think about being a man first of all,\u201d Nainggolan said in an interview with DAZN last month, \u201crather than just thinking about your career.\u201d Those two things, though, do not have to be mutually exclusive. Conte was wrong to say that Inter lack an experienced midfielder capable of taking games in hand. Their mistake was sending him out on loan to Cagliari. Talking points \u2022 \u201cDifficult match, important victory #finoallafine\u201d \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s tweet this morning is being read by the Italian press as an attempt to calm the waters after he was subbed off, and apparently walked out of the stadium during Juventus\u2019s game against Milan. A storm in a teacup or the beginnings of a seriously thorny dilemma for the club and for manager Maurizio Sarri? Ronaldo\u2019s replacement, Paulo Dybala, scored the winner, just as Douglas Costa had after replacing the Portuguese against Lokomotiv Moscow. Mostly, I\u2019m just musing on the irony of that \u201cuntil the end\u201d hashtag. \u2022 A midweek mutiny at Napoli \u2013 with players refusing to return to the punitive training camp demanded by owner Aurelio De Laurentiis \u2013 was followed up by another disappointing draw at home to Genoa. The team is now five games without a win and the whistles of the Stadio San Paolo suggested that fans were not on the players\u2019 side in this dispute. After the home of the midfielder Allan was broken into on Thursday, his wife raised the grim possibility that the incident could be linked to tension around the team. Carlo Ancelotti is under huge pressure to restore calm, while newspapers are speculating that Dries Mertens, a perceived ringleader of the revolt, could be sold as soon as January \u2013 an extraordinary turnaround for a player who has been adored by fans and surpassed Diego Maradona in the club\u2019s scoring charts just last month.",

It is being supported by other Muslim states. An initial hearing is expected at the ICJ in December.</p> \n<p>In the application, the vice-president of the Gambia, Isatou Touray, describes her state as \u201ca small country with a big voice on matters of human rights on the continent and beyond\u201d.</p> \n<p>In October 2016, Myanmar\u2019s military began what it described as \u201cclearance operations\u201d against the Rohingya, according to the submission. \u201cThe genocidal acts committed during these operations were intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group \u2026 by the use of mass murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as the systematic destruction by fire of their villages, often with inhabitants locked inside burning houses,\u201d it says.</p> \n<p>A \u201cpervasive campaign of dehumanisation\u201d had preceded the attacks, including demands from the local Rakhine Nationalities Development party for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to deal with the Rohingya, the application notes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7c4830bb-7c30-49a3-9757-d64b9e12cf2d\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Described as the world\u2019s most persecuted people, 1.1 million&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya\">Rohingya</a>&nbsp;people live in Myanmar.

Unlike the Buddhist community, they speak a language similar to the Bengali dialect of Chittagong in Bangladesh.</p>\n    <p>The Rohingya are reviled by many in Myanmar as illegal immigrants and suffer from systematic discrimination. The Myanmar government treats them as stateless people, denying them citizenship. Stringent restrictions have been placed on Rohingya people\u2019s freedom of movement, access to medical assistance, education and other basic services.</p>\n    <p>Violence broke out in northern Rakhine state in August 2017, when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/25/rohingya-militants-blamed-as-attack-on-myanmar-border-kills-12\">militants attacked government forces</a>. In response, security forces supported by Buddhist militia launched a \u201cclearance operation\u201d&nbsp;that&nbsp; ultimately killed at least 1,000 people and forced more than 600,000 to flee their homes. The UN\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/un-myanmars-treatment-of-rohingya-textbook-example-of-ethnic-cleansing\">top human rights official</a>&nbsp;said the military\u2019s response was \"clearly disproportionate\u201d to insurgent attacks and warned that Myanmar\u2019s treatment of its Rohingya minority appears to be a \"textbook example\u201d of ethnic cleansing.</p>\n    <p>When Aung San Suu Kyi rose to power there were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmars-great-hope-fails-to-live-up-to-expectations\">high hopes</a>&nbsp;that the Nobel peace prize winner would help heal Myanmar's entrenched ethnic divides. But she has been accused of standing by while violence is committed against the Rohingya.</p>\n    <p>In 2019, judges at the international criminal court authorised a full-scale investigation into the allegations of mass persecution and crimes against humanity. On 10 December 2019, the international court of justice in The Hague opened a case alleging genocide brought by the Gambia.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe\"><b>Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Members of Myanmar\u2019s military were the \u201cprime operatives\u201d behind a \u201csystematic campaign on Facebook\u201d that targeted the Rohingya, the submission says. </p> \n<p>The submission records that \u201cin the early hours of 9 October 2016, a small number of Rohingya, armed mainly with sticks, knives and a few firearms, reacting to Myanmar\u2019s persecution of the group, attacked three border guard police posts in northern Rakhine state\u201d.</p> \n<p>Shortly afterwards, Myanmar\u2019s military forces began \u201cclearance operations\u201d. During these operations, the Gambian submission says, troops \u201csystematically shot, killed, forcibly disappeared, raped, gang-raped, sexually assaulted, detained, beat and tortured Rohingya civilians, and burned down and destroyed Rohingya homes, mosques, madrassas, shops and Qur\u2019ans\u201d.</p> \n<p>There were mass killings of Rohingya men and boys, the application states. \u201cThe UN fact-finding mission reported that at the village of Dar Gyi Zar, soldiers captured a group of up to 200 men, women and children, and took them to a paddy field, where they were told to kneel,\u201d it says. The men and boys were separated.</p> \n<p>Women and children were taken to a house where they \u201cheard repeated gunfire and the screams of the men and boys outside\u201d. When they emerged, the women saw bodies of men and boys who had been piled up and burned using hay, harvested rice and shirts removed from the victims. Some were tied to trees and burned alive, it is alleged. Others had their throats cut with long knives.</p> \n<p>The 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Myanmar are said to be in \u201creal and significant danger\u201d of further genocidal acts. The Gambia is calling for punishment for those responsible, compensation for the victims and an immediate end to attacks.</p> \n<p>About 95% of the Gambia\u2019s population is Muslim, and its role was welcomed by human rights groups. Its attorney general, Abubacarr Marie Tambadou, previously served as a special assistant to the prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda.

      "bodyText": "Myanmar is to face accusations of genocide at the UN\u2019s highest court over its treatment of Rohingya Muslims. A 46-page application has been submitted to the international court of justice by the Gambia, alleging Myanmar has carried out mass murder, rape and destruction of communities in Rakhine state. If the ICJ takes up the case, it will be the first time the court in The Hague has investigated genocide claims on its own without relying on the findings of other tribunals, such as the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which it consulted for claims against Serbia and Croatia. Under the rules of the ICJ, the application argues, member states can bring actions against other member states over disputes alleging breaches of international law \u2013 in this case the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. The Gambia, a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, has taken the legal lead in drafting the claim against Myanmar. It is being supported by other Muslim states. An initial hearing is expected at the ICJ in December. In the application, the vice-president of the Gambia, Isatou Touray, describes her state as \u201ca small country with a big voice on matters of human rights on the continent and beyond\u201d. In October 2016, Myanmar\u2019s military began what it described as \u201cclearance operations\u201d against the Rohingya, according to the submission. \u201cThe genocidal acts committed during these operations were intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group \u2026 by the use of mass murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as the systematic destruction by fire of their villages, often with inhabitants locked inside burning houses,\u201d it says. A \u201cpervasive campaign of dehumanisation\u201d had preceded the attacks, including demands from the local Rakhine Nationalities Development party for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to deal with the Rohingya, the application notes. Members of Myanmar\u2019s military were the \u201cprime operatives\u201d behind a \u201csystematic campaign on Facebook\u201d that targeted the Rohingya, the submission says. The submission records that \u201cin the early hours of 9 October 2016, a small number of Rohingya, armed mainly with sticks, knives and a few firearms, reacting to Myanmar\u2019s persecution of the group, attacked three border guard police posts in northern Rakhine state\u201d. Shortly afterwards, Myanmar\u2019s military forces began \u201cclearance operations\u201d. During these operations, the Gambian submission says, troops \u201csystematically shot, killed, forcibly disappeared, raped, gang-raped, sexually assaulted, detained, beat and tortured Rohingya civilians, and burned down and destroyed Rohingya homes, mosques, madrassas, shops and Qur\u2019ans\u201d. There were mass killings of Rohingya men and boys, the application states. \u201cThe UN fact-finding mission reported that at the village of Dar Gyi Zar, soldiers captured a group of up to 200 men, women and children, and took them to a paddy field, where they were told to kneel,\u201d it says. The men and boys were separated. Women and children were taken to a house where they \u201cheard repeated gunfire and the screams of the men and boys outside\u201d. When they emerged, the women saw bodies of men and boys who had been piled up and burned using hay, harvested rice and shirts removed from the victims. Some were tied to trees and burned alive, it is alleged. Others had their throats cut with long knives. The 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Myanmar are said to be in \u201creal and significant danger\u201d of further genocidal acts. The Gambia is calling for punishment for those responsible, compensation for the victims and an immediate end to attacks. About 95% of the Gambia\u2019s population is Muslim, and its role was welcomed by human rights groups. Its attorney general, Abubacarr Marie Tambadou, previously served as a special assistant to the prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. He was instrumental in encouraging the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to support the case against Myanmar. Tambadou, who qualified as a barrister in the UK, said he wanted to \u201csend a clear message to Myanmar and to the rest of the international community that the world must not stand by and do nothing in the face of terrible atrocities that are occurring around us. It is a shame for our generation that we do nothing while genocide is unfolding right before our own eyes.\u201d The application has been drafted with the help of Prof Philippe Sands QC, who has written a book tracing the origins of the genocide convention. Sands, who is counsel for the Gambia, said: \u201cThe international court of justice is the ultimate guardian of genocide convention, conceived seven decades ago, on the initiative of Raphael Lemkin [the lawyer who devised the convention], to prevent and punish the horrors of the kind that have occurred \u2013 and are continuing to occur \u2013 in Myanmar. \u201cThe court will be acutely aware of its responsibilities, [and] will surely wish to live up to them in ensuring the fullest possible protection of individuals and groups.\u201d The prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), also in The Hague, has already opened a preliminary investigation against Myanmar.

      "bodyText": "You probably know Dave Raymond. Or, at least, if you\u2019ve paid any attention to sport and particularly American sport over the last 40 years or so, you know Dave Raymond\u2019s work. Not on the field, though: just to the side. For 15 years, Raymond was the man inside the suit of the Phanatic, the Philadelphia Phillies anarchic giant green mascot, the mascot upon whom most mascots since have been based. And after hanging up the furry suit, Raymond became essentially a mascot consultant: the chances are that if you\u2019ve heard of a mascot in North American sports, he\u2019s the brains behind it. And as with so many of these things, it all started accidentally. After graduating from college he took an internship with the Philadelphia Phillies, where he worked for the promotion and marketing department. One day, he was asked to take on a slightly different part of the job. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me what they wanted me to do right away,\u201d he says. \u201cThey kind of explained it briefly and told me I needed to go to New York to get fitted for \u2018the costume\u2019.

One in particular stands out, with the great but famously grumpy and rotund LA Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. \u201cTommy was a complicated guy,\u201d Raymond explains. \u201cOn one hand, he was one of the most respected ambassadors of American baseball.

My own visits to food banks both cheer me and concern me \u2013 it\u2019s great that they demonstrate real concern for people in need, but they also reveal a hidden instability at the heart of our nation. Uncertainty also looms for an estimated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49787913\" title=\"\">8.4 million people</a> in England who, according to the National Housing Federation, \u201care living in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/23/people-england-living-unsuitable-housing\" title=\"\">unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable home</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Recent research by KPMG found there are <a href=\"https://home.kpmg/uk/en/home/media/press-releases/2019/11/jobs-paying-less-than-real-living-wage-drops-to-seven-year-low.html\" title=\"\">5.19 million jobs</a> that pay less than the genuine living wage, an independently calculated rate based on what workers and families need to earn to get by. These figures demonstrate the scale of in-work poverty. And within this problem come regional disparities: Northern Ireland is held back by the highest percentage of jobs paying below the living wage at 23%. The north-east (22%) and Yorkshire and Humber (22%) also had higher than average rates of low pay compared to south-east England, where only 15% of jobs pay less than a real living wage.</p> <p>Today, the <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage\" title=\"\">Living Wage Foundation</a> announced that the living wage has increased to \u00a39.30 an hour UK-wide and \u00a310.75 in London, to reflect higher living costs in the capital. If the living wage were paid, that would be hundreds of pounds a month back in the lowest-paid workers\u2019 pockets.</p> <p>Employers are bound by law to pay a notional minimum wage, but that\u2019s not the same as the living wage. The living wage takes into account actual expenditure. Enlightened employers know this and I\u2019m pleased to say there are now almost 6,000 accredited <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/accredited-living-wage-employers\" title=\"\">living wage employers</a> that have chosen to pay all their workers a decent day\u2019s pay for a decent day\u2019s work. These companies also report significant business benefits, with higher levels of morale and lower levels of absenteeism.</p> <p>In September the chancellor announced a significant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/30/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-boris-johnson-groping-allegation-deeply-concerning-says-former-cabinet-minister-live-news?page=with:block-5d92184f8f08fbb0c171e29a#block-5d92184f8f08fbb0c171e29a\" title=\"\">increase to the national living wage</a>, the minimum wage for over-25s, with an expected target of \u00a310.50 within five years. This increase, from the current level of \u00a38.21, will be welcome for workers on low pay, but it is still far short of a living wage that would cover actual costs. The new real living wage of \u00a39.30 per hour is worth \u00a31.09 per hour more to a full-time worker each year than the national living wage, while the London living wage of \u00a310.75 is \u00a32.54 per hour more, the latter amounting to an average family\u2019s entire food, drink and utilities bills over a year \u2013 a life-changing amount.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/11/thousands-of-uk-workers-pay-to-rise-as-living-wage-increases\">Thousands of UK workers' pay to rise as living wage increases</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Christian faith makes a strong moral argument for paying the living wage.

That means ending their uncertainty.</p> <p>The living wage movement, started by faith leaders and community organisers in a church hall in east London in 2001, is now a global phenomenon with a reach far beyond the UK\u2019s shores.

My own visits to food banks both cheer me and concern me \u2013 it\u2019s great that they demonstrate real concern for people in need, but they also reveal a hidden instability at the heart of our nation. Uncertainty also looms for an estimated 8.4 million people in England who, according to the National Housing Federation, \u201care living in an unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable home\u201d. Recent research by KPMG found there are 5.19 million jobs that pay less than the genuine living wage, an independently calculated rate based on what workers and families need to earn to get by. These figures demonstrate the scale of in-work poverty. And within this problem come regional disparities: Northern Ireland is held back by the highest percentage of jobs paying below the living wage at 23%. The north-east (22%) and Yorkshire and Humber (22%) also had higher than average rates of low pay compared to south-east England, where only 15% of jobs pay less than a real living wage. Today, the Living Wage Foundation announced that the living wage has increased to \u00a39.30 an hour UK-wide and \u00a310.75 in London, to reflect higher living costs in the capital. If the living wage were paid, that would be hundreds of pounds a month back in the lowest-paid workers\u2019 pockets. Employers are bound by law to pay a notional minimum wage, but that\u2019s not the same as the living wage. The living wage takes into account actual expenditure. Enlightened employers know this and I\u2019m pleased to say there are now almost 6,000 accredited living wage employers that have chosen to pay all their workers a decent day\u2019s pay for a decent day\u2019s work. These companies also report significant business benefits, with higher levels of morale and lower levels of absenteeism. In September the chancellor announced a significant increase to the national living wage, the minimum wage for over-25s, with an expected target of \u00a310.50 within five years. This increase, from the current level of \u00a38.21, will be welcome for workers on low pay, but it is still far short of a living wage that would cover actual costs. The new real living wage of \u00a39.30 per hour is worth \u00a31.09 per hour more to a full-time worker each year than the national living wage, while the London living wage of \u00a310.75 is \u00a32.54 per hour more, the latter amounting to an average family\u2019s entire food, drink and utilities bills over a year \u2013 a life-changing amount. The Christian faith makes a strong moral argument for paying the living wage. The Bible urges us to treat one another fairly: those who are on the breadline are to be given back their dignity and self-respect. That means ending their uncertainty. The living wage movement, started by faith leaders and community organisers in a church hall in east London in 2001, is now a global phenomenon with a reach far beyond the UK\u2019s shores. It\u2019s simply a matter of decency: a decent day\u2019s wage for a decent day\u2019s work. You would need a distorted notion of morality to disagree with that. \u2022 John Sentamu is the archbishop of York",

Yet nothing is smoothed over, muted or reconciled. The poem, like much of the collection, logs the vertiginous and rocky inner voyage of a speaker in extremis after the loss of their mother.</p> <p>Although an ekphrastic poem, it belongs to its context.

The poem doesn\u2019t usually concern itself with directly \u201ctranslating\u201d the image. Visual associations sprout readily from initially abstract soil, seeded by the vivid quartet of nouns in lines two and three: shame, revelry, spillage, addiction. At first I \u201csaw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad\">Maenads</a> and Dionysian revels, the glory and comedy of inebriation, incontinence and violence. The term \u201cspirit of affliction\u201d could even suggest one of those hangover jokes, usually found funny only the morning after the morning after. I felt quite reluctant to look up \u201cbellarmine\u201d because the poem spoke so powerfully on its own.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.name-doctor.com/name-bellarmine-meaning-of-bellarmine-30371.html\">The word alludes</a> to the Tuscan saint and theologian of the counter-reformation, San <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Robert-Bellarmine\">Roberto Bellarmino</a>. Like its relative, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartmann_jug\">the Bartmann jug</a>, the bellarmine pot incorporates the face of a Bearded Man, and is designed to hold food or drink. Possibly the term originated in Protestant mockery of the ascetic Catholic Bellarmino. Berry\u2019s poem was commissioned by the Poetry Library and the Arts Council Collection for a Southbank Centre event in 2015, Artpoetry: Poets Respond to Paintings.</p> <p>The theological aspect of the backstory adds weight to a poem that interprets the visual as analogy, a portrait of good and evil, wrong and right. The term spirit of affliction gains nuance. Theologically, it can denote an evil spirit, so the Drunken Bellarmine could represent a demon. Job\u2019s afflictions also come to mind (\u201cThis heartsore / will not stop weeping.\u201d) The suffering, self-despising Bellarmine is also able wittily to criticise his creator: \u201cthe sky is sick / knitted too tightly.\u201d For a moment, he solipsistically interprets his surroundings and the \u201cyou\u201d he addresses (\u201cmy face is up your sleeve\u201d) as knitting.</p> <p>Primarily, the poem seems to be the oration of the Bellarmine upon himself, giving us a wonderfully accurate picture of ever-shifting comic-pathetic-demonic-human complexity. The vocabulary of self-analysis is gloriously rich: \u201ctheatrical\u201d, \u201centropic\u201d, \u201csticky\u201d. You can imagine a case of supernatural possession, in fact, the voice speaking through the poem\u2019s mouth, giving a new ambiguous timbre to the real voice without obliterating it, as would be the aim in a conventional dramatic monologue.</p> <p>The reference to \u201cleaking\u201d and \u201cthe bloody clump of cells\u201d later on suggest menstruation. The knitted, twisted Bellarmine oddly voices a unity of characterstics: it is man-woman, child-adult, sinner-confessor, philosopher-drunk. Of course his/her reasoning may not quite make sense, as when the wanting \u201cto be loved for the wrong reasons\u201d is glibly reversed to wanting \u201cto be hated for the right reasons\u201d. The Bellarmine is intelligent and self-aware, yet dominated by the most invasive and least rational-seeming of emotions, shame. The speaker hasn\u2019t found his voice or himself. He is physically split and that fissure is also his mental state. He (it\u2019s hard not to think of the speaker as primarily male) is almost physically wrecked, but not able to escape self-consciousness and self-mockery.</p> <p>In the drama of mourning, the body sometimes quite brutally pushes itself forward and takes control: mind and body engage, argue, coalesce. Dualism is exploded as myth. \u201cThese poems emerge from a place that had been completely mute for a long time,\u201d Berry said in <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/spectacular-endlessly-an-interview-with-emily-berry///\">an interview with Ralf Webb</a>. The revelatory processes of Stranger, Baby combine tidal energy with filigree verbal nuance and observation, creating a vigorous and unusual elegiac narrative, in which the pressure is as analytical as emotional.</p> <p>Despite that warning shout, \u201c<em>DON\u2019T LOVE ME\u201d</em>, the Bellarmine\u2019s plea is to be allowed to be childish. Whatever his stickiness and guilt, he has also mounted a convoluted argument for the right to be loved \u2013 one that, after all, mothers generally manage to grant their shamelessly messy babies.</p>",

The revelatory processes of Stranger, Baby combine tidal energy with filigree verbal nuance and observation, creating a vigorous and unusual elegiac narrative, in which the pressure is as analytical as emotional. Despite that warning shout, \u201cDON\u2019T LOVE ME\u201d, the Bellarmine\u2019s plea is to be allowed to be childish. Whatever his stickiness and guilt, he has also mounted a convoluted argument for the right to be loved \u2013 one that, after all, mothers generally manage to grant their shamelessly messy babies.",

It said some of the packages were marked \u201cdiamante\u201d or \u201cbrillante\u201d, similar to packages reported to have washed up in Florida during Hurricane Dorian in September. French police have contacted Florida authorities asking for their input into their investigation. A source close to the inquiry told AFP that tides started washing up the packages a month ago on beaches stretching from Nantes to as far south as the resort town of Biarritz. Local media reported finds of drug packages on beaches in La Rochelle and north of Arcachon, warning that people should not pick them up as they would be running a significant legal risk of a 10-year prison term for handling the drugs.

It may be that future political situations, ones less marked by discord, will see us pivot back to insouciant fun, but as things stand we\u2019re increasingly looking to the purveyors of yesterday\u2019s laughs to raise serious questions about our time.",

Another example is Israel, where elections in September failed to resolve the deadlock left by equally inconclusive polls in April.</p> <p>Other times, coalitions can be built, but only after increasingly difficult negotiations: the Netherlands (208 days) and Sweden (more than four months) set new records in 2017 and 2018.

In part because, from Germany to France, Italy to Austria and Spain to Sweden to Israel, fewer and fewer people are voting for the big, broad-church centre-right and centre-left parties that have dominated their respective national political stages since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s PP and PSOE would once garner 80% of the vote between them; they managed barely 48% on Sunday. In the Netherlands, the three big mainstream parties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/europes-governments-signal-relief-as-dutch-election-defeats-far-right\">scraped barely 40% together at the previous general election</a> \u2013 roughly the proportion that any one of them might previously have expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/spain-election-map-zip/giv-3902c8SDnfAkuTvX/\" data-alt=\"spain\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/spain-election-map-zip/giv-3902c8SDnfAkuTvX/\">spain</a> </figure>  <p>In Germany\u2019s 2017 poll, Angela Merkel\u2019s mighty conservative CDU and its centre-left SPD rival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/24/angela-merkel-faces-stark-choice-between-coalition-or-minority-rule\">fared worse than at any time since the 1940s</a>, while in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/swedish-election-far-right-on-course-for-sizeable-gains-in-vote\">Sweden the Moderates and Social Democrats held up better</a> but still lost ground.

Yes, say analysts, because the flimsy coalitions and splintered legislatures that generally emerge \u2013 if they emerge at all \u2013 from fragmented systems make it much more difficult to govern.</p> <p>Of necessity, they involve more parties - and those parties each have very different objectives.

Belgium has now been 170 days without a government, though that is still some way off its 541-day record after the 2010 elections. Why is this happening? In part because, from Germany to France, Italy to Austria and Spain to Sweden to Israel, fewer and fewer people are voting for the big, broad-church centre-right and centre-left parties that have dominated their respective national political stages since the end of the second world war. Spain\u2019s PP and PSOE would once garner 80% of the vote between them; they managed barely 48% on Sunday. In the Netherlands, the three big mainstream parties scraped barely 40% together at the previous general election \u2013 roughly the proportion that any one of them might previously have expected. In Germany\u2019s 2017 poll, Angela Merkel\u2019s mighty conservative CDU and its centre-left SPD rival fared worse than at any time since the 1940s, while in Sweden the Moderates and Social Democrats held up better but still lost ground. In Israel, Likud and Blue and White managed barely 25% of the vote each. The decline of the big parties has been paralleled by the rise of an array of smaller parties, ranging from far-right, nation-first types such as Germany\u2019s AfD and Spain\u2019s Vox to free-market, Green and far-left anti-austerity parties including Podemos, anti-system parties such as Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement and regional secessionists. One consequence of this fragmentation (the Netherlands is an extreme example: 28 parties fought the last election, 13 of them winning seats in parliament) is a huge increase in electoral volatility: 41% of Swedish voters backed a different party in 2018 than in 2014, a figure that is not unusual. Another, with the return of the extremes and the rise of identity politics, is increasing radicalisation \u2013 which means non-negotiable red lines and an inbuilt aversion to compromise and consensus, making coalition-building much harder. Neither major party in Israel, for example, is prepared to work with the Joint List of Israeli-Arab parties, which finished third in the latest elections, just as the centre-right and centre-left in Sweden will not go near the Sweden Democrats, and the PP and PSOE shun the Catalan separatists. Does this matter? Yes, say analysts, because the flimsy coalitions and splintered legislatures that generally emerge \u2013 if they emerge at all \u2013 from fragmented systems make it much more difficult to govern. Of necessity, they involve more parties - and those parties each have very different objectives. That can make it harder for countries to adopt reforms, pursue controversial but necessary policies, or play a decisive role on the international stage. Until now, Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system has appeared to protect it from such fragmentation: the proportional representation systems more common on the continent make it significantly easier for small parties to thrive. But the Brexit earthquake may have destroyed that supposedly stable two-party system, with the surge of the Liberal Democrats, the emergence of the Brexit party and the dominance of the Scottish Nationalists threatening to eat into the big parties\u2019 vote, plus tactical anti-Brexit voting potentially playing a role. While the Conservatives seem on course to finish as the largest party, they will not be able to forge alliances \u2013 so anything other than an outright Tory majority in the Commons may leave Boris Johnson, like S\u00e1nchez, bemoaning an inconclusive election, a hung parliament, and no stable government on the horizon.",

Because people with quick nunchi take the time to read the room, their chances of success in any social environment are high \u2013 they\u2019re more likely to fit in and make connections and are less prone to coming across as clueless or incompetent, or of committing awkward faux pas. \u201cAt a very basic level, people will be happier to be around you if you have quick nunchi,\u201d says Hong, \u201cand from a Machiavellian point of view, you can negotiate better\u201d by staying quiet, listening carefully, and gathering information from others before speaking. Because nunchi is a soft skill premised on discretion, Hong notes it can be a superpower for introverts. She claims approaching social situations through the lens of nunchi even helped her battle social anxiety, allowing her to remain grounded in stressful circumstances. In her book, Hong also makes the case that nunchi not only helps individuals but has factored into Korea\u2019s rapid development from one of the world\u2019s poorest nations to a high-income, culturally powerful country in a matter of generations. This is, as they say, big if true. Yet if the subtle art of nunchi is so powerful, why does it seem that these days corporate and world leaders seem to more often be blustery loudmouths, rather than sensitive, quiet types? Hong\u2019s investigation of this question illuminates why the concept of nunchi \u2013 with its emphasis on unity, relationship building, and collective harmony \u2013 may be particularly relevant at a cultural and political moment characterized by divisiveness. It is, after all, essentially the power of understanding others. \u201cIn the west, autonomy and individualism are emphasized, and nunchi seems to advocate the opposite,\u201d she says. \u201cBut developing nunchi doesn\u2019t mean becoming a lemming, it just means you are using data to your advantage to create comfort for yourself and everybody else.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Evo Morales has announced he will resign as president of Bolivia after the military called for him to step down and the police withdrew their support following weeks of unrest over disputed election results. In a televised address, Bolivia\u2019s president of nearly 14 years said he was stepping down for the \u201cgood of the country\u201d. but added in an attack on opponents whom he had accused of a coup attempt: \u201cDark forces have destroyed democracy.\u201d Morales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous leader, later said on Twitter that the police had an \u201cillegal\u201d warrant for his arrest and that \u201cviolent groups\u201d had attacked his home in Cochabamba, a city in central Bolivia. The commander of Bolivia\u2019s police force said in a television interview that there was no warrant for Morales\u2019s arrest. Video circulating on social media showed people walking through what was reported to be his ransacked home. The announcement by Morales came shortly after the commander-in-chief of the Bolivian armed forces, Williams Kaliman, exhorted him to resign his \u201cpresidential mandate allowing the pacification and maintenance of stability for the good of Bolivia\u201d. In Bolivia\u2019s main city, La Paz, people poured on to the streets waving the country\u2019s red, yellow and green flags. There were reports of patrols by vigilantes guarding businesses in Cochabamba. Morales\u2019s vice-president, \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, also resigned. The New York Times reported that Morales had flown from La Paz to Chimor\u00e9, in Cochabamba state, when it became clear that the military was turning on him. The area is populated by coca leaf growers, many of whom have remained loyal to Morales, himself a former coca farmer. His whereabouts in the early hours of Monday morning were unknown. The departure of Morales, a leftist icon and the last survivor of Latin America\u2019s \u201cpink tide\u201d of two decades ago, is likely to send shockwaves across the region at a time when left-leaning leaders have returned to power in Mexico and Argentina. In a tweet, Mexico\u2019s foreign affairs secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said it would offer political asylum to Morales in accordance with the country\u2019s \u201ctradition of asylum and non-intervention\u201d, if Morales sought it. He added that 20 other members of the government\u2019s executive and legislature were already in the Mexican ambassador\u2019s residence in La Paz. Some of Morales\u2019s leftist allies in Latin America, including the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and Argentinian president-elect, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, decried the turn of events as a \u201ccoup\u201d In a recording broadcast on Venezuelan state television, Maduro said: \u201cWe have to take care of our brother Evo Morales \u2026 We must declare a vigil in solidarity to protect him.\u201d Maduro\u2019s position has been bolstered by the return of left-leaning leaders in Mexico and Argentina. But Morales\u2019s resignation could unnerve the Venezuelan leader, who has clung to power this year despite an opposition campaign to convince the armed forces to rebel. The Cuban president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, another longtime Morales ally, tweeted his \u201csolidarity\u201d and said: \u201cThe world must be mobilised for the life and freedom of Evo.\u201d Brazil\u2019s government said it would back a democratic transition in neighbouring Bolivia and dismissed leftists\u2019 argument that a coup had occurred. \u201cThe massive electoral fraud attempt delegitimised Evo Morales, who had the right attitude and resigned in the face of popular outcry. Brazil will support a democratic and constitutional transition,\u201d the Brazilian foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, said in a tweet. The Colombian foreign ministry also called on Bolivian state institutions and political parties to work together to \u201censure that Bolivian citizens can express themselves freely at the polls\u201d. It requested a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) permanent council to discuss the situation. Earlier on Sunday, Morales had said he would call a new election after the OAS identified serious irregularities in the last vote and recommended a new ballot. A preliminary report based on the OAS audit of the vote said it had found \u201cclear manipulations\u201d of the voting system and could not verify a first-round victory for Morales. Carlos Mesa, the runner-up candidate in the disputed election, tweeted: \u201cI will never forget this singular day. The end of tyranny. I am grateful as a Bolivian for this historic lesson.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, Mesa said Morales and Garc\u00eda Linera should be disqualified from participating in new elections as they had committed fraud. The weeks-long standoff over the disputed election escalated over the weekend as police forces were seen joining anti-government protests. At least three people have died in the unrest, which began on 20 October, the day of the election, and more than 300 people have been injured in clashes between anti-government protesters and Morales supporters. The resignations of Morales and his vice-president meant it was not initially clear who would take the helm of the country pending the results of new elections. According to Bolivian law, in the absence of the president and vice-president, the head of the Senate would normally take over provisionally. However, the Senate president, Adriana Salvatierra, also stepped down late on Sunday. Legislators were expected to meet to agree on an interim commission or legislator who would have temporary administrative control of the country, according to a constitutional lawyer who spoke to Reuters.",

the situation tomorrow</li> \n   <li>More than 45 fires are burning in Queensland, with three watch and act fires south of Toowoomba and near Yeppoon</li> \n   <li>The NSW government has declared a state of emergency for seven days</li> \n   <li>More than 575 schools and TAFE campuses will be closed, the Department of Education said in its evening update</li> \n   <li>Declarations of catastrophic fire conditions were extended this afternoon, to now cover Greater Sydney, Greater Hunter and Illawarra Shoalhaven</li> \n   <li>The catastrophic rating was introduced in 2009 after the Victorian black Saturday bushfires, and it is the first time Sydney has been given the rating</li> \n   <li>It will be extreme fire danger in the Central Ranges, North Western, North Coast, New England, Southern Ranges and Northern Slopes</li> \n   <li>There is a statewide total fire ban in effect</li> \n   <li>Fire authorities have advised people to avoid bushland areas - which for many means leaving homes for coastal or larger towns and cities</li> \n   <li>All communities in Bellingen and Coffs Harbour west of the Pacific Highway have been advised to leave home early</li> \n   <li>Aged-care homes are on alert</li> \n   <li>An emergency level fire was threatening Port Lincoln in South Australia on Monday evening</li> \n   <li>Victoria is sending another 300 firefighters and New Zealand has pledged further support if needed</li> \n   <li>Defence bases have been ordered to provide whatever assistance is required to local firefighters</li> \n   <li>Bitter political arguments are playing out on the sidelines of the firefighting, with Greens and Nationals MPs blaming each other for the awful fire conditions, and Coalition politicians refusing to discuss the impact of climate change (and their lack of action to address it) on the crisis</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc917d48f08be4a102e6d5c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n

environment, as they may panic and hurt themselves if confined,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, the EVA asks that you remove all gear from your horse as it could get caught on fences, melt or become very hot and cause serious burns, plus do not leave rugs on your horse.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The AVA said the ideal environment is a large or series of small well-grazed paddocks with the internal gates left open, and warned horses should not be let onto roads where they could face danger from traffic as well as fire.<br></p> \n  <p>Northern Beaches Council mayor Michael Regan said it had opened

      "bodyText": "This is where we\u2019ll leave our rolling coverage today. Guardian Australia will be covering all the developments tomorrow. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far: More than 60 fires are still threatening NSW and the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast \u201chot, dry and gusty winds\u201d worsening the situation tomorrow More than 45 fires are burning in Queensland, with three watch and act fires south of Toowoomba and near Yeppoon The NSW government has declared a state of emergency for seven days More than 575 schools and TAFE campuses will be closed, the Department of Education said in its evening update Declarations of catastrophic fire conditions were extended this afternoon, to now cover Greater Sydney, Greater Hunter and Illawarra Shoalhaven The catastrophic rating was introduced in 2009 after the Victorian black Saturday bushfires, and it is the first time Sydney has been given the rating It will be extreme fire danger in the Central Ranges, North Western, North Coast, New England, Southern Ranges and Northern Slopes There is a statewide total fire ban in effect Fire authorities have advised people to avoid bushland areas - which for many means leaving homes for coastal or larger towns and cities All communities in Bellingen and Coffs Harbour west of the Pacific Highway have been advised to leave home early Aged-care homes are on alert An emergency level fire was threatening Port Lincoln in South Australia on Monday evening Victoria is sending another 300 firefighters and New Zealand has pledged further support if needed Defence bases have been ordered to provide whatever assistance is required to local firefighters Bitter political arguments are playing out on the sidelines of the firefighting, with Greens and Nationals MPs blaming each other for the awful fire conditions, and Coalition politicians refusing to discuss the impact of climate change (and their lack of action to address it) on the crisis ABC Weather has published an explanation of why Tuesday is looking so bad: it\u2019s a cold front. \u201cTomorrow with the winds you\u2019ll be seeing a more south-easterly direction,\u201d Grace Legge, senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, told the ABC. \u201cOnce that change comes through, it changes the direction that the fire\u2019s going, which means that you normally end up with a large fire front as the wind changes direction and moves the opposite way. \u201cYou\u2019d start to see the fires moving more north-easterly once a change has gone through.\u201d From AAP: Horse owners are being urged to move their animals to a safe place in the face of the catastrophic bushfire threat. The Australian Veterinary Association has warned that horses should not be locked in confined stables but rather placed in well-grazed paddocks. Dr Sam Nugent, president of Equine Veterinarians Australia, said the key was to act early. \u201cIt\u2019s critical not to lock your horses in a stable, holding yard or similar environment, as they may panic and hurt themselves if confined,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, the EVA asks that you remove all gear from your horse as it could get caught on fences, melt or become very hot and cause serious burns, plus do not leave rugs on your horse.\u201d The AVA said the ideal environment is a large or series of small well-grazed paddocks with the internal gates left open, and warned horses should not be let onto roads where they could face danger from traffic as well as fire. Northern Beaches Council mayor Michael Regan said it had opened Frenchs Forest Showground and North Narrabeen reserve for local residents to temporarily relocate large animals including horses. Attn: Canberra Carol Sparks is the mayor of Glen Innes Severn council, where devastating fires on Friday claimed at least two lives. She has written an op-ed which you can find here. Here\u2019s an excerpt: Already there are armchair experts ready with free advice about meeting with disaster. Let it be made perfectly clear that all the area that burned has already been a fire ground for two months. There were hazard reduction and backburns under state authority last month and last year. The properties were all well-prepared and extensively defended. People who have lived with fire risk for decades knew exactly what to do, and they did it. The full expertise and advice of fire controllers has been heeded at every turn. I\u2019ll put my 20-year Rural Fire Service medal up against your free advice any day of the week. The anger is real. The anger is justified. Because this disaster was all foreseen and predicted. For decades the link between a hotter, drier climate, land-clearing, excessive irrigation and increased fire risk have all been attested in scientific papers. Equally for decades there have been those who insist they know better. Their ignorance and arrogance have delivered us only ashes \u2013 let these now be swept away. Nick Stanley of the South Australian CFS has told ABC local radio there are more than 100 firefighters from 26 ground crews, eight waterbombing aircraft and three observation aircraft currently working on the fire threatening Port Lincoln. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing some fairly strong winds around the 50km/h mark, gusting 80-90km/h when this fire started,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to control a fire under those conditions is near-on impossible.\u201d The NSW RFS has reminded people it is not telling people to evacuate ahead of tomorrow, just to \u201cavoid bushfire prone areas\u201d. That could mean leaving your home and going to a large town or city, or to a shopping centre or another place far away from a bushland area. NSW Police have issued warnings and advice for the state\u2019s population ahead of Tuesday\u2019s serious fire conditions and total fire ban. \u201cIf you are threatened by fire, you need to take action to protect yourself. Do not be caught in the open,\u201d it said a short time ago. There are simply not enough fire trucks for every house. If you call for help, you may not get it. Do not expect a firetruck. Do not expect a knock on the door. Do not expect a phone call.\u201d \u201cStart taking action now to reduce your risk: Avoid bush fire prone areas. If your home is in a bush fire prone area, the safest option is to not be there. Do not travel through bushland areas. A safer location may be a large town or city, shopping centres or facilities well away from bushland. It may also be a designated \u2018Neighbourhood Safer Place\u2019. A Neighbourhood Safer Place is designed as a Place of Last Resort in bush fire emergencies only. Please note that travelling to or sheltering at a Neighbourhood Safer Place does not guarantee your safety. Your safest option will always be to leave early. People with special needs, such as the elderly and people with a disability, should always leave before the threat of bush fire. If it is unsafe to leave the area or stay and defend your property, and the path is clear, you should move to your pre-identified Neighbourhood Safer Place, or other safer location, prior to the impact of a bush fire. Be aware that when you are travelling to your Neighbourhood Safer Place there may be heavy smoke and poor visibility. It is important that you are familiar with the area. Gather at the Neighbourhood Safer Place location and remain there until the bush fire threat has passed. The conditions at the Neighbourhood Safer Place may be uncomfortable and you may be affected by heat, smoke and embers. Water, toilets and food may not be available at the Neighbourhood Safer Place and emergency service personnel may not be present. Neighbourhood Safer Places are not intended for pets and livestock. Lists of evacuation centres will be posted here by the RFS, and police keep their updates here. Defence bases have been given orders to provide any an all assistance required to local firefighting forces. Defence minister Linda Reynolds has asked the chief of the ADF, General Angus Campbell, \u201cto give an order to local base commanders, making clear that they have the authority to use Defence resources to respond to any local contingencies\u201d. \u201cSenior ADF officers and other commanders are empowered to provide emergency assistance in local emergency situations to save human life, prevent extensive loss of animal life, or widespread damage to property,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile our ADF personnel are not trained firefighters, they can provide other support for the nation\u2019s front line first responders.\u201d In South Australia the CFS has issued an emergency warning in the last hour for Duck Ponds, in the Lower Eyre Peninsula, where a fire is burning in an easterly direction towards Port Lincoln. \u201cThe Western Approach Rd, Duck Ponds fire is uncontrolled,\u201d it said. \u201cYou are now in danger. Take shelter in a solid building. Do not leave or enter this area in a vehicle or on foot. It is too late to leave as the roads will not be safe. Conditions are dangerous and firefighters are now unable to prevent the fire spreading. Shelter before the fire arrives as heat can kill you well before the flames reach you.\u201d The White Hut fire which was an emergency earlier this afternoon has now been contained, but the CFS warns \u201ca fast moving wind change is still expected this afternoon which may cause the fire to spread rapidly in a north easterly or easterly direction toward the locality of White Hut, Hundred Line Road and the Yorke Highway\u201d. An update on the Queensland situation: There are 10 fires at advice level, and four watch and act fires: Cobraball, Townson, Clumber and Thornton. And in NSW: There are 48 advice level fires burning across the state and 10 watch and act fires: Carral Creek, Carrai East, Coombes Gap complex, Hillville, Kian Road, Liberation Trail, Bril Bril, Mt Nardi national park, Newton Boyd and Coombadjha. Towns and communities west of the highway in the Coffs Harbour and Bellingen region are being advised to get clear of their homes tomorrow. This is a community newsletter released earlier this afternoon advising resident they will face \u201cextreme fire danger\u201d on Tuesday, with smoke and embers from the significant fires nearby potentially affecting areas kilometres ahead of the fires, predicted to spread to Coffs Harbour and the northern beaches. It\u2019s advised residents in areas west of the Pacific highway to self-relocate to a major urban area like Coffs Harbour, Woolgoolga, Sawtell, Bellingen, Urunga, and Dorrigo, but warned that some places east of the highway are not safe enough to take refuge. The warnings from authorities that people in areas of concern should leave for somewhere safer is not one to take lightly. Even the chief of the Blue Mountains Rural Fire Service is getting out. David Jones has urged residents to consider leaving their homes before late this afternoon, the Blue Mountains Gazette has reported. \u201cI really think leaving is the best option, we don\u2019t want to lose lives,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cI encourage people to go, I think it\u2019s the best. My family are going, even though my house at Medlow Bath is well prepared.\u201d Earlier, the mayor of the mid-north coast council, David West said the next few days \u201ccould be the most hazardous this community has ever had\u201d. The north coast has been hardest hit so far by the fires that have been burning since Friday. But West told the ABC earlier his community was \u201cvery resilient\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re country people,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only were they supporting each other, the community is supporting them as well. Huge donations of clothing, huge donations of help, to such a degree they had to turn people away. That\u2019s what makes regional New South Wales and regional Australia a very strong and vibrant community. \u201cCouncil is doing all it can, we\u2019re basically ceasing general operations of council and putting resources into supporting the community moving forward. The next three days could be the most hazardous this community has ever had.\u201d In the latest from the Nationals-Greens sniping over bushfires and climate and blame: Barnaby Joyce has told the Australian it\u2019s \u201cGreens policy\u201d that has made the threat worse, by locking up dams and preventing enough hazard reduction burns, and \u2013 I kid you not \u2013 making trees fall over on forest roads. \u201cSo many of the practicalities of fighting a fire and managing it have been stymied by the Greens,\u201d Joyce has said. \u201cA lot of people are talking once more about Indigenous land management because they didn\u2019t have to go through 1,001 reports that they have to go through today.\u201d He said there was nothing the parliament has done which brought about the devastation. \u201cThe problems we have got have been created by the Greens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the capacity to easily access [hazard] reduction burns because of all of the paperwork that is part of green policy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have access to dams because they have been decommissioned on national parks because of green policy. We have trees that have fallen over vehicles and block roads, so people cannot either get access to fight a fire or to get away from fires. And we can\u2019t knock over the trees because of Greens policy.\u201d It comes after Greens MP Adam Bandt said \u201cthoughts and prayers aren\u2019t enough\u201d and the government had done \u201ceverything in their power\u201d to make fires more likely, which deputy PM Michael McCormack labeled the \u201cravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies\u201d. But professor and bushfire researcher Jim McLennan from La Trobe University has said other residents in more metropolitan areas, around the country, were not as ready as they should be. \u201cIn the major capital cities, with population growth on the bushland fringes and more hot days with longer no-rain periods, there are city-dwellers who don\u2019t appreciate they are now on the fringe of fire areas,\u201d he told AAP. \u201cIn areas of greater population density, you are likely to get major problems with traffic, the possibility of accidents and tragedies. \u201cA lot of people are not bushfire-ready.\u201d The Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, says the region is \u201cwell seasoned\u201d and prepared for tomorrow\u2019s catastrophic conditions. The Blue Mountains experienced devastating blazes in 2013, losing over 200 homes. \u201cI\u2019ve been speaking to residents today who are quietly preparing,\u201d he told AAP. \u201cOur community quietly gets about doing what it needs to do.\u201d The bushfire in South Australia on the Yorke Peninsula has been downgraded to watch and act. At 1.30 AEDT, fire authorities said it posed a threat to lives and property. But firefighters have now halted the fire\u2019s advance and there have been no lives lost and damage to property. But, an approaching wind change could push the fire to the east. The latest update from the Department of Education has declared even more schools \u2013 both public and non-government \u2013 are closed tomorrow. We already reported that hundreds of schools would be closed on Tuesday, after a major announcement around 2.30pm. But to recap, and consolidate the new schools, the ABC is reporting that 367 schools are now closed across NSW. These are all through the catastrophic fire danger areas of the Illawarra, Shoalhaven and Greater Hunter. There are also numerous schools closed in metropolitan parts of Sydney near areas of bush. The full list is here. Also in Torrington, Richard Cork, another resident, returned home on Monday but said he noticed many of the animals he used to feed did not. He told AAP only seven of the 21 king parrots that normally visit his yard arrived on Monday. And of the four kangaroos that turned up, only one did, and had clear burns on its feet. More on the defence force\u2019s help for the fire-fighting effort tomorrow. The Royal Australian Air Force has flown firefighters in from Canberra, Adelaide and Hobart to Port Macquarie. Singleton barracks in NSW is on stand-by to provide accommodation and catering to firefighters. Queensland firefighters are using the Kokoda barracks in Canungra to refuel aircraft. And local base commanders across both states have the authority to use defence resources to respond to any local fires. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued its latest fire weather update for Tuesday. \u201cHot, dry and gusty winds will generate very dangerous fire conditions across large parts of the state,\u201d it says. Much of this has already been communicated by RFS NSW, but in full: Catastrophic fire danger is forecast for: Greater Hunter, Greater Sydney region and Illawarra/Shoalhaven. Extreme fire danger forecast for: North Coast, Southern Ranges, Central Ranges, New England, Northern Slopes and North Western Severe Fire Danger is forecast for the following fire areas: Far North Coast, Far South Coast and Monaro Alpine Very High Fire Danger is forecast for the following fire areas: Upper Central West Plains, Lower Central West Plains and Southern Slope In Torrington, NSW, near Glen Innes, resident Thomas Eveans has returned home to find \u201cnothing recoverable\u201d \u201cThe shed, the caravan parked beside it, the motorbike is gone,\u201d he told AAP. \u201cThere was an aluminium meltdown like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d Eveans evacuated on Friday in the face of a \u201cfive-pronged\u201d fire front. \u201cThe sound \u2013 it was like hearing a plane overhead coming into land,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the pastures are gone, we don\u2019t have any water,\u201d he added. \u201cWith the drought, the last thing we bloody needed was a fire.\u201d Storm Sparks and her young son, Zeke Bacon, told AAP they had heard some of their animals had survived. In good news, the Marsden, Mount Tarampa and Park Ridge South fires have been downgraded from stay informed, and Queensland RFS are now not required on scene. In Wytaliba, the NSW town where two people died in the fires on Friday, residents are still waiting to return home. The town remains a crime scene after the fires, and roads have been closed for four days in a row. Resident John Biles told AAP he had been going down to the roadblock every day. \u201cI manage a property down there with my brother,\u201d he said. \u201cEach night I find a motel in town, go to Vinnies and get another set of clothes, and then get back out here again in the morning.\u201d The Australian Defence Force and Commonwealth agencies will be available to help with this week\u2019s bushfires, Mathias Cormann has announced. In his role as special minister of state, he told the Senate the \u201cfull resources\u201d of the defence force would be \u201cavailable to assist where they can\u201d. \u201cAll commonwealth agencies have been activated and are prepared to assist the state [governments] and communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start talking about climate change and questioning some of what our leaders have been doing for the last 30 years,\u201d says Brad Edge. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for a class action from fire-affected people across the state.\u201d Every morning since Saturday, Edge, from Congarinni near Macksville on the mid-north coast of NSW, has returned to his property unsure if his house will still be standing. The 80-hectare bush property came under threat after two fires that had been burning for weeks at Kian Road and Fortescue Creek joined. Edge says the fires are unlike anything he\u2019s seen on the property in his 12 years there. \u201cOur place was nowhere near the areas of concern but when they joined up they blew across the Taylors Arm river and came into the area behind our place. A number of little spot fires have just increased over the last 48 hours,\u201d Edge told Guardian Australia on Sunday night. \u201cWe evacuated two days ago. We\u2019ve been going back each morning, making sure the fire pump is running, sprinklers are going. In the last night, the water-bombing helicopter spent about four hours at the back of our place.\u201d The fire flared up again on Sunday and fire crews were at the house trying to save it. On Monday morning, Edge returned. The house was still standing and crews had installed containment lines across the property. \u201cNot so much to stop it if the big winds come, but they\u2019re giving themselves points where they can try to fight it and bring the helicopters in,\u201d he says. He\u2019s not sure what will happen on Tuesday, when conditions are forecast to worsen. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s safe, but if the wind goes to the west there\u2019s a chance it won\u2019t be,\u201d he says. Edge, his wife and two young children have had to evacuate to multiple locations, depending on the direction of the fires. They were at his father-in-law\u2019s home first, in a suburban estate, but had to move again on Sunday when it came under threat. \u201cIt\u2019s a place you\u2019d never expect to be evacuated \u2013 it\u2019s quite unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a wife and two young kids. It\u2019s hard on everybody. My father-in-law, it\u2019s hard on him too.\u201d On Monday, they moved back to his father-in-law\u2019s place when conditions changed and they were advised to relocate from the home of friends they were staying with. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of friends who\u2019ve lost their property. We\u2019re not sure if ours will be there tomorrow,\u201d Edge says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, everybody is OK. Everything else is replaceable.\u201d New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has pledged further bushfire-fighting support if Australia needs it, in a conversation with Scott Morrison, reports AAP. Ardern said Australia would receive more support from its trans-Tasman neighbours if they needed it. \u201cOur thoughts are with Australia right now, these are devastating fires,\u201d Ardern said this afternoon. I contacted prime minister Morrison this morning just to touch base and offer New Zealand\u2019s full support. \u201cHe acknowledged that on one of his visits he had actually spoken to one of the New Zealanders already over there. \u201cI\u2019ve made the offer, to definitely let us know if further support is required. We\u2019re working through an additional request ... for additional firefighters.\u201d There are currently five New Zealand firefighters in the field, with a sixth on the way. \u201cThese people are specialists helping in air attack and heavy-machinery supervision, safety and managing interstate deployments,\u201d Fire and Emergency NZ manager Paul Turner said. Tomorrow\u2019s conditions for NSW and Queensland are dire, especially in the Greater Sydney, Hunter and Illawarra Shoalhaven, where it\u2019s forecast to be catastrophic. The NSW Rural Fire Service sends out bushfire alerts on radio, TV and the internet. If you\u2019re in an affected zone, you can tun in to your local ABC radio station, which is an official emergency broadcaster. They\u2019ll give necessary updates (and if you have a battery-powered AM radio, you can still get them if the power goes out). The ABC Emergency Facebook page also has a list of local Facebook pages, for specific information, here. Below is the RFS fact sheet. There is more information here. The electricity network operator Ausgrid has cancelled most planned maintenance work and put emergency crews on standby ahead of tomorrow. \u201cCatastrophic fire conditions and temperatures in the high 30s have been predicted across our network,\u201d said Ausgrid\u2019s chief operating officer, Trevor Armstrong. \u201cThe safety of the community and our people is our highest priority and that is why we have cancelled planned maintenance jobs where power would need to be interrupted for extended periods. Limited work will proceed but only in cases where it has been deemed safe to do so. \u201cWith strong winds expected, we\u2019re reminding people to stay well back from any fallen powerlines. If you see fallen wires, always assume they\u2019re live, stay eight metres away \u2013 which is about two car lengths \u2013 and call us on 131 388.\u201d The NSW department of education has updated its list of closures, with a number of additional schools and Tafes now shutting down for tomorrow. The list includes hundreds of government and non-government primary and high schools, and Tafes, including some in relatively suburban areas. Check the list here. More from Bobin resident Ned Haughton, who has taken to social media after seeing his town devastated by the fires. Victoria\u2019s Country Fire Authority is sending more than 300 members to NSW after the fire-ravaged state requested more help, AAP reports. The CFA is sending 286 firefighters, 18 supporting resources, six additional taskforce members and one CFA liaison officer to be positioned in the Hunter region and Goulburn ahead of the catastrophic fire weather conditions forecast for tomorrow. That\u2019s in addition to the 11 strike teams sent yesterday afternoon, which will be in position by 7pm. The CFA has also dispatched a fleet of 76 vehicles, including 55 tankers and 21 operational support vehicles. The South Australia Country Fire Service has issued an emergency warning for a fire in White Hutt on the southern Yorke peninsula: This fire may pose a threat to lives directly in its path. Act now. Leave, if the path is clear to a safer place, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive. If you cannot leave, identify where you will seek shelter from the bushfire. Heat from the fire will kill you. Do not enter this area as conditions are dangerous. The MARION BAY ROAD, WHITE HUT fire is uncontrolled. This scrub fire is burning in a SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION direction towards WARRENBEN CONSERVATION PARK AND EAST OF MARION BAY. Conditions are continually changing. An emotional video shot by Ned Haughton, a climate scientist who lost his childhood home in bushfires at Bobin. A language warning on this one. Not every year is going to get worse, but on average it\u2019s going to get worse. And every year we\u2019re probably going to see other regions having similar impacts, similar loss of property, sim loss of life. Bobin is a really tight community and we\u2019ve lost so many houses here, it\u2019s going to be hard to recover. Luckily we haven\u2019t lost too many lives, unlike the north coast. Shit happens sometimes, I wouldn\u2019t be that pissed off except state and liberal governments are just trying their hardest to shut down any decent action on climate. This is just not the right way to act if you care about the planet, if you care about your kids future, if you care about your community\u2019s future. The ABC is reporting there are eight houses confirmed destroyed in the bushfires at Yeppoon. This footage was taken yesterday evening. Conditions have now worsened, according to the NSW RFS, which means catastrophic conditions will now affect a third major region: the Illawarra Shoalhaven. \u201cThe fire danger is now expected to be worse than originally forecast,\u201d the RFS said. \u201cThe Illawarra Shoalhaven has now been added as an area of catastrophic fire danger. \u201cCatastrophic is the highest level of bush fire danger. Homes are not designed to withstand a fire under these conditions.\u201d Catastrophic conditions are equivalent to the conditions of Black Saturday, Australia\u2019s deadliest bushfire, in which 173 people died. This is a blistering editorial here from Tasmania\u2019s the Examiner, Launceston\u2019s daily paper. The regional paper is drawing the links between climate change and bushfires, and singling out Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d comments directly. A few quotes: It has an eerily similar ring to it: \u2018Thoughts and prayers\u2019. Australians rightly mock this platitude when it\u2019s rolled out by politicians after a mass shooting in the US, but now our own prime minister saw fit to present this meaningless line for victims of the bushfires on the mainland. Like how the US does nothing to end their deadly problem, our government also appears determined to cover its ears to the stark reality now facing us: Australia is drier than ever, hotter than ever, and less prepared than ever. The Tasmanian Fire Service is well aware of the risks. In Launceston this year, their state conference was titled \u2018Not the Norm\u2019: because the changing climate is putting humanity in a completely unpredictable position where every year is worse than the last. Yet while Australia faces unprecedented fires ... politicians continue to mislead on carbon emissions, or use rubbery accounting tricks to meet our emissions targets. In Brisbane: Smith says helicopters had to be grounded earlier today due to thick smoke obscuring visibility. He says he could not confirm how many houses had been destroyed. Superintendent Steve Smith from Queensland RFS is now speaking in Yeppoon: Overnight we have been able to conduct some work that has helped consolidate the fire line. The fire itself is approximately 1,100 hectares. Of that 1,100 hectares, about 35% of that fire edge is uncontained. So with the winds that we are seeing today and have just picked up in the last hour or so, we have once again seen some fire behaviour that is becoming quite erratic and quite intense. The Australian climate scientist Dr Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, has responded to the comments of the deputy PM, Michael McCormack, this morning, who dismissed links between climate change and bushfire as the \u201cravings\u201d of inner city greenies. Hare told me: \u201cThere\u2019s only one word for that really \u2013 bullshit. There\u2019s a strong and very well-established connection between climate change and wildfire risk. It\u2019s a foreseeable risk and one we need to plan for, and reduce our emissions to limit and prevent it. His comments are wilfully ignorant and, in a nutshell, bullshit.\u201d NSW updates: The Toorumbee Complex fires (formerly the Jacobs Spur and Armidale Road fires) has crossed the Macleay River and Armidale Road, and is heading north-east towards Millbank and Sundown Creek. The Coombes Gap Complex fire, west of Wauchope, is burning on both sides of the Oxley Highway around Long Flat. \u201cThe fire is spreading in multiple directions towards Ellenborough and Tilbaroo Crossing,\u201d the RFS says. The Washpool state forest fire near Coombadjha is still moving north towards Ewingar. \u201cSmoke and ash is likely in the area of Baryulgil. Watch out for embers which may start spot fires ahead of the main fire front.\u201d The Hillville Road fire, south of Taree, is \u201cspreading quickly\u201d. It is burning in a north and easterly direction. The RFS has told residents they are conducting backburning, so \u201cpeople in the area may see an increase in fire activity\u201d. And earlier, RFS inspector Ben Shepherd reminded us that other parts of NSW will still have \u201csevere and extreme\u201d dangers on Tuesday. The risk is all across the state, not just in the catastrophic and metro areas. \u201cWe need to ensure that people understand there is a risk in all bushland areas, stretching from Bega all the way to Byron, from the Victorian border to the Queensland border,\u201d he said. A full map is below. What does Tuesday\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire rating mean \u2013 and where does it apply? The deadliest bushfires in Australian history, the Black Saturday fires of February 2009, would have had a catastrophic rating. Those fires killed 173 people. Put simply, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said the rating means \u201cit\u2019s where people die\u201d. The catastrophic rating was introduced in 2009, and this is the first time it has been declared for Sydney. But Fitzsimmons said he could not ever remember worse conditions for Sydney. Affected areas are: The Hunter: Cessnock, Dungog, Lake Macquarie, Singleton and the Upper Hunter. North and north-west: Camden, central coast, the Hills, Hawkesbury, Hunters Hill, Ku-ring-gai, Lane Cove, Mosman, North Sydney, northern beaches, Ryde, Willoughby. Sydney west and inner west: Burwood, Canada Bay, Strathfield, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Liverpool, Parramatta Penrith, Sydney (includes some inner west suburbs). Sydney east: Randwick, Waverley, Woollahra. South and south-west: Georges River, Kogarah, Sutherland. In Queensland, an update on the Rosevale fire near Ipswich. The fire is still at watch and act, with residents being told to prepare to leave. Qld RFS says: \u201cA large fire is burning to the south of Baker Road, Kerwitz Road and Kelly and Dwyer Road, Rosevale. It is travelling in a north, north-easterly direction and is likely to impact Baker Road, Kerwitz Road, Kelly and Dwyer Road, Rosevale later today.\u201d An evacuation centre is open at Harrisville school of arts, Hall Street, Harrisville. At 12pm AEDT, 11am AEST. In NSW: NSW has declared a state of emergency for seven days, as Greater Sydney and the Great Hunter face \u201ccatastrophic\u201d conditions on Tuesday. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said this was necessary to save lives. This is the first time a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d warning has been issued for Sydney, and the conditions have been likened to Black Saturday. Up to 60 fires are now burning, with 40 not contained. Ten are at watch and act. 970,000 hectares have been burnt \u2013 nearly as much as the last three fire seasons combined Since Friday, three people have died and 100 have been injured, including 20 fire fighters. 150 homes have been destroyed. In Queensland: 47 fires are burning across the state. Three are of major concern: Cobraball near Yeppoon, Cooroibah on the Sunshine Coast and Thornton in the Lockyer Valley. Seven fires are at watch and act, with residents told to prepare to leave. 11,000 hectares have burnt in central Queensland alone. More than a dozen homes have been destroyed. In Queensland, three fires \u2013 Duingal near Gin Gin, Kilcoy Beerwah Road near Stanmore and Mount Stuart \u2013 are burning but now pose no threat to property. NSW Ambulance has issued the following health warning for those affected: People with any respiratory issues or who are particularly vulnerable can be the first to feel the effects of smoke which may aggravate their existing condition. Even healthy adults and children can be impacted by the effects of heavy smoke which can result in lung irritation. These conditions can have a serious impact on your health and it is important to remember that our bodies have to work extra hard to cope or cool down. Ensure you stay hydrated and pay particular attention to any symptoms (dizziness, headaches, racing pulse or nausea) of heat-related illness. Be aware of potential hazards such as embers, falling debris, damage to surroundings and reduced visibility which can cause injury. Paramedics are urging people in fire-affected areas to wear any form of eyewear and loose clothing to cover your skin to assist in reducing any incidental injury. NSW Ambulance recommends if anyone sustains any form of burn they should cool the affected area immediately with water \u2013 ideally running water \u2013 for a minimum of 20 minutes (for eyes ensure you flush the eye) and seek medical attention. We need people to really take care of themselves. If you have a pre-existing medical condition make sure you have all your medications with you and readily available at all times. Dramatic footage from Yeppoon in Queensland. This is part of the Cobraball, Bungundarra, Maryvale and Lake Mary fire, as named by the Queensland RFS. The fire is currently at watch and act and residents have been told to prepare to leave. As of 8am AEST, the RFS said the fire was travelling from Cobraball towards Bungundarra, Maryvale and Lake Mary. \u201cThe fire is currently impacting Mount Lizard, east of Evans Road, south of Mapes Road, south of Ingrey Road, east of Serpentine Road and north of Cobraball Road. The fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community.\u201d The University of Newcastle has closed all campuses tomorrow, apart from Newcastle city and Sydney. As of 11.20 AEDT, here\u2019s the latest on the bushfires across NSW and Queensland: 60 fires burning in NSW, and 47 across Queensland. At least 150 homes destroyed in NSW \u2013 with that expected to rise. 970,000 hectares burnt in NSW, nearly as much as the last three fire seasons combined. Greens MP Adam Bandt has also responded to deputy PM Michael McCormack\u2019s comments that the link between climate change and worsening bushfires was \u201cwoke capital-city greenies ravings\u201d. Bandt said McCormack was \u201ca dangerous fool\u201d. Thoughts and prayers are not enough, we need science and action too. They\u2019ve done everything in their power to make these catastrophic fires more likely. When you cuddle coal in Canberra, the rest of the country burns. Dael Allison is from the tiny NSW town of Bobin, north-west of Taree. \u201cBobin is shocking,\u201d she says. \u201cBobin is devastated. There would be entire hillsides that wouldn\u2019t have a tree standing.\u201d Allison drove with her partner, Rick Haughton, and son from Port Stephens to Bobin on Sunday to check on friends and on their property, where they grow eucalypts. The main house is still standing, but sheds, the original cottage they built and that their children spent the first years of their lives in, and most of the land are burnt out. \u201cWe\u2019ve had fires but I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Allison says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen fires that come right down to the water level of the creek. \u201cI don\u2019t know where fire crews are getting their water from.\u201d Allison says they made the two-and-a-half hour drive from Port Stephens where they are based because communications in the Bobin area have been down. \u201cOne of the reasons we went up there was so that we could talk to friends and check if they were OK and let their families know. People assume when there\u2019s no communication the worst has happened. But all the phone lines are down. \u201cThe whole area is just on fire. At least a dozen people I know have lost houses. That would be nowhere near the final count.\u201d Meanwhile, the Sydney radio host Alan Jones has blamed the Greens for the bushfire conditions, referencing a supposed lack of backburning. The 2GB host said there was in fact \u201croom for a bit of politics\u201d in looking at the causes of the current crisis: Let me just say here: I\u2019m not too sure what government can do in the light of this. It is a frightening spectacle. But I do say it is room for a bit of politics as far as I\u2019m concerned. Natale, the Greens leader, talks about it being a \u2018climate emergency\u2019. No, Mr Di Natale, you and your mob won\u2019t allow, and you\u2019re full of these local government areas where there\u2019s fuel on the floor, can\u2019t be cleared, we take too long, and now he\u2019s running for cover and saying it\u2019s a \u2018climate emergency\u2019. A Western Australian farmer, and 2010 Australian rural woman of the year, Sue Middleton, is the latest regional Australian to take aim at deputy PM Michael McCormack\u2019s comments earlier today. McCormack had said linking climate change to worsening bushfires was \u201cwoke capital-city greenies ravings\u201d. Here\u2019s Middleton replying to the ABC Canberra radio host Anna Vidot: In NSW, an update on the watch and act for the Washpool state forest fire near Coombadjha. It is now more than 31,800 hectares and is out of control. Water bombing aircraft are working to slow the fire to the north. According to the RFS: \u201cThe fire is burning on both sides of the Carnham Road, and both sides of the Clarence Way in the vicinity Eighteen Mile. \u201cThe fire on the Western side of the Clarence River is still moving north towards Ewingar.\u201d On Saturday, the CEO of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, Dr Richard Thornton, had this to say on why conditions are so bad. This fire season is influenced by the warm and dry conditions we\u2019ve been experiencing all year. In south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, the last three years have been dry and warm \u2013 it is these conditions that are driving the severity of the current bushfires. When preceding conditions have been like this, and the bush and grass is so dry, it doesn\u2019t take much for a fire to get going once the wind is up. Unfortunately that is what we\u2019ve seen, not just in recent days, but over the last few months. We need to start preparing now for these future risks, and not just the coming months, but the coming years and decades \u2013 we cannot keep doing things the same ... The issues are complex, and this is the role of research. We cannot any longer be sure of what is possible with our seasonal cycles. We need to focus on mitigation from climate change. This is an area in critical need of further research into weather prediction, land planning, infrastructure development, population trends, and community awareness. Yes, climate change is causing more severe weather, but demographic changes are having an equal impact and deserve just as much of our attention. In NSW, more than 100 people \u2013 including 20 firefighters \u2013 have been injured by bushfires, according to NSW Ambulance. The NSW Ambulance commissioner, Dominic Morgan, said 30 additional ambulance crews would be deployed, and he was considering bringing in more help from interstate. \u201cOver the last few days our doctors and paramedics have been exceedingly busy; they\u2019ve treated over 100 patients for fire-related activity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a whole range of things that have been confirmed from very severe burns, sadly resulting in a loss of life in some instances, right down to minor injuries and minor burns.\u201d The small NSW town of Torrington lost 12 homes on Friday. Residents of the village, population of only 81, described it as \u201capocalyptic\u201d and the worst bushfires in living memory. AAP has this report from on the ground: Residents thought they were going to die huddled in their small NSW community\u2019s fire station during an \u201capocalyptic\u201d bushfire that sounded like a freight train and rained down embers and soot. While some residents fled early on Friday, Linda Birch was among those to take refuge in the town\u2019s metal fire station. Smoke soon crept under the doors of the shed as embers bombarded the vents. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bushfire, it was a firestorm,\u201d she told AAP. \u201cThe ferocity of this storm was that immense that we needed to put masks on within the shed as well.\u201d Birch admitted she thought she was going to die, describing the situation as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. \u201cThe sound was like a freight train, we couldn\u2019t hear ourselves, we couldn\u2019t talk, we just reacted,\u201d Birch said. Torrington RFS captain Greg Kneipp and his deputy, his dad Bob, have been battling the blaze since it began two weeks ago, with a few days rest in between. They were thankful for the support of out-of-town and interstate crews, aerial water bombing and those carting water to the station to fill the trucks. \u201cThis would be the worst fire and I\u2019m 47 years in the RFS. This would be it by far and only because of the dry conditions is it so bad,\u201d Bob Kneipp told AAP. He said the camaraderie of the fire crew was one of the reasons he stayed in the RFS but has noticed young people are less likely to sign up. \u201cWe\u2019re a big happy family,\u201d he said. Watch and acts have been updated for the Toorumbee Complex, the Mt Nardi National Park, Hillville Road and Old Glen Innes Road fires. All are out of control. The Toorumbee Complex fire is a new fire, formed by the joining of multiple fires in the Willi Willi area, west of Kempsey. It was formerly known as the Jacobs Spur and Armidale Road fires. \u201cThe fire is burning in the area of Bellbrook, Hickeys Creek and Willawarrin on the southern and eastern side of the Armidale Road,\u201d the RFS says. \u201cThe fire has crossed the Macleay River and Armidale Road, and is heading north east towards Millbank and Sundown Creek.\u201d The Hillville Road fire is near Hillville, south of Taree. It is burning in a north and easterly direction and is spreading quickly. The fire is now more than 19,000 hectares in size. The Old Glen Innes Road fire is in the Newtown Boyd area and is 6,600 hectares in size. The latest RFS update says it has crossed the Boyd River. It is burning in an easterly and north-easterly direction towards Coutts Crossing. It has now merged with the Liberation Trail fire. In Queensland nearly 50 fires are burning with crews focused on three major fires: at Cobraball south-west of Yeppoon, Cooroibah on the Sunshine Coast, and Thornton in the Lockyer Valley. AAP reports that firefighters from Tasmania have flown in to help relieve exhausted local crews. Easterly winds expected on to pick up from Tuesday afternoon. Three houses have been lost at the Cobraball fire, which has also burned through 11,000 hectares of land, and has a 30km long front. Twenty-five people remain in an evacuation centre in Yeppoon with their homes not safe to return to. The assistant commissioner of Queensland Fire and Emergency Service, Megan Stiffler, said it was extremely lucky more homes had not been lost given the severity of the fires. Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons also spent some time stressing the full gravity of the catastrophic conditions forecast for Great Sydney and Greater Hunter tomorrow. The catastrophic rating was introduced in 2009, and this is the first time it has ever been forecast for Greater Sydney. Even before 2009, he says he can\u2019t remember seeing worse conditions in Sydney. Catastrophic is off the conventional scale. We are talking about indices that go well beyond the old scale of 100. And whilst it\u2019s unprecedented to have catastrophic here in Sydney, we have had catastrophic across New South Wales over the last decade since the new program came into effect in 2009. But I am confident in my memory that even when we were looking at rebranding the fire danger rating system to include catastrophic at the top, even when we were looking at the indices that drove that new branding of catastrophic, we could not find a time in history under the old metrics where we saw indices reaching what we now know are catastrophic levels here in the Greater Sydney environment. We are talking about something we haven\u2019t experienced before in Sydney in the Greater Sydney environment, albeit we have seen it across parts of New South Wales. Berejiklian is addressing the media now, in a joint press conference with Fitzsimmons. \u201cWe also need to stress that when something is determined to be catastrophic, there is a high degree of unpredictability,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly where the fires are going to flare up ... everybody has to assume the worst. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to have all hands on deck and that\u2019s why there is a state of emergency across the state.\u201d The state of emergency was declared after RFS commissioner Fitzsimmons wrote to Berejiklian last night requesting it be declared. The declaration grants emergency powers to the RFS commissioner. It\u2019s the first emergency declaration since October 2013. It gives the RFS commissioner the power to: Direct any government agency to conduct or refrain from conducting its functions; Control and coordinate the allocation of government resources; Evacuate people from property within the declared area; Close roads and thoroughfares to traffic; Pull down or shore up infrastructure at risk of collapse; Order the shutdown of essential utilities in the declared area including electricity, gas, oil and water; and Enter or take possession of property in the course of the emergency response. Berejiklian also called on the community to please pay attention to all warnings, and to do as fire authorities say. Tomorrow is about protecting life, protecting property and ensuring everybody is safe as possible. But we also ask the community to do their bit. Please do not ignore the messages you receive about your community. If you\u2019re told to evacuate, please do so. If you\u2019re told to take certain actions, please do so. And for heaven\u2019s sake, stay away from bushland tomorrow. The catastrophic weather conditions mean that things can change very quickly. You might think you\u2019re OK and a few minutes later, you won\u2019t be. Please heed all the messages you receive. Please act in a cautionary way and please do not be complacent. Tomorrow is not the day to be complacent. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejilkian, has declared a state of emergency in response to the bushfire crisis. The state of emergency will last for seven days. She said this was to ensure there was coordination and a whole-of-government response in place for tomorrow and the rest of the week: This is to make sure that we leave no stone unturned to keep our community safe tomorrow. I want to thank the heads of all the agencies for their cooperation and support. Everybody is fully supportive of this decision. We want to ensure that the lines of authority are clear tomorrow. The last time there was a state of emergency declared was in 2013 when we saw extensive bushfires throughout the Blue Mountains and other regions. And again on this occasion, we\u2019re taking every precaution. Fitzsimmons says firefighters from Victoria have sent in 50 additional fire trucks to help their NSW colleagues. \u201cWe already had over 1,400 interstate personnel helping out in New South Wales over the recent weeks. We got another 400 flying in and driving in today ahead of the conditions tomorrow.\u201d More than 65 fires are burning across NSW, of which more than half are uncontained. More than 10 are at watch and act. The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, is speaking live now: We can expect to see the alert levels increase up in northern NSW. The fire behaviour is still quite volatile and there are still lots of communities in the north-east of the state that remain at risk today. Watch and act is there for a reason. It is to ensure that people remain vigilant. Tomorrow we are facing some horrendous conditions. Earlier this morning, the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the link between climate change and worsening bushfires was \u201cwoke capital-city greenies ravings\u201d. Follow our politics live blog here for further developments and the growing response to that. The mayor of Glen Innes, Carol Sparks, who was herself evacuated at the weekend along with 6,000 others, has already hit back. She said: Well, I probably couldn\u2019t respond how I really feel on television but I think that Michael McCormack needs to read the science, and that is what I am going by, is the science. It is not a political thing. It is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change. Fuller comments from both her and McCormack are here. Queensland RFS have just issued this update to the Cobraball, Bungundarra, Maryvale and Lake Mary fire. It is still at prepare to leave. Currently as at 7.50am AEST Monday, 11 November, a dangerous fire is travelling from Cobraball towards Bungundarra, Maryvale and Lake Mary. The fire is currently impacting Mount Lizard, east of Evans Road, south of Mapes Road, south of Ingrey Road, east of Serpentine Road and north of Cobraball Road. The fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community. Fire crews continue to conduct backburning operations today in an effort to contain the blaze, but firefighters may not be able to protect every property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door. An evacuation area is located at the basketball courts at Cordingley Street, Yeppoon. The next update on this fire will be at 9.50am AEST. Full text here. More than 55 schools have been closed today across NSW, and six Tafe campuses. Only one school has been closed in Queensland \u2013 Thornton state school. A full list of NSW schools is here. Good morning and welcome to our continuing coverage of the bushfire crisis across New South Wales and Queensland. For those in fire-affected areas, please stay tuned to your local emergency broadcaster, and follow instructions from fire crews and authorities. Full alerts from the Rural Fire Service can be found here for NSW, and here for Queensland. As at 8.45am AEDT: There are 64 bush and grassfires across NSW, 40 of which are uncontained. The Queensland RFS have issued seven prepare to leave warnings since 10pm Sunday. They are for: Cobraball/Bungundarra/Maryvale/Lake Mary; Adelaide Park; Thornton and Lefthand Branch; Clumber and Moogerah; Tarome; Rosevale; Mount Alpen and Double Top. Queensland RFS have said today will bring \u201cslightly more favourable conditions\u201d than yesterday, but \u201cplease do not be complacent\u201d. Tomorrow catastrophic fire danger is forecast for the Greater Sydney and Greater Hunter. The NSW RFS has told residents \u201cuse today to get ready\u201d for tomorrow\u2019s worse conditions.",

      "bodyText": "Across New South Wales more than 575 schools will shut their doors on Tuesday, while aged care homes remain on high alert and animal shelters scramble to re-home pets as much of the state prepares for catastrophic fire conditions. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, declared a week-long state of emergency on Monday in the wake of devastating fires on the state\u2019s mid-north coast in which three people died and at least 150 homes were destroyed. While favourable conditions helped ease the bushfire threat on Monday, more than 60 bushfires continue to ravage the state and the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast \u201chot, dry and gusty winds\u201d on Tuesday which \u201cwill generate very dangerous fire conditions across large parts of the state\u201d. More than 1,300 firefighters have been mobilised and the chief of the defence force has ordered defence bases to provide any assistance requested by local firefighters. The severe fire danger prompted the Rural Fire Service to declare a catastrophic fire danger warning for large chunks of the state, including in the greater Sydney area, the Hunter, Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions. It is the first time the warning has been issued in greater Sydney and the first state of emergency since October 2013, when major bushfires killed two people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the state\u2019s Blue Mountains region. Both the premier and the commissioner of the RFS, Shane Fitzsimmons, urged people living in the catastrophic areas to head for built-up areas, with Berejiklian urging people to \u201cfor heaven\u2019s sake stay away from bushland\u201d. \u201cFires are starting extremely quickly, easily and spreading very, very quickly,\u201d Fitzsimmons told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe cannot guarantee a fire truck at every home, we cannot guarantee an aircraft will be overhead every time a fire is impacting on your property, we cannot guarantee that someone will knock on the door and give you a warning that there\u2019s fires nearby, and we certainly cannot guarantee that despite our best efforts the technological tools available will deliver you a message in time.\u201d A community newsletter released on Monday afternoon told Coffs Harbour and Bellingen residents in areas west of the Pacific highway to self-relocate to a major urban area like Coffs Harbour, Woolgoolga, Sawtell, Bellingen, Urunga and Dorrigo, but warned that some places east of the highway are not safe enough to take refuge. The warnings have put much of the state on high alert. Parents will be scrambling to find alternative arrangements for their children after the NSW government again increased the number of schools and Tafe campuses which will close on Tuesday. The full list of government and non-government schools and Tafe campuses now numbers more than 575. \u201cThe schools that are operational tomorrow have comprehensive emergency management plans in place which will be activated if required,\u201d the department said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Aged care providers have been put on notice that evacuations could be necessary. \u201cIn anticipation of hot, dry and windy conditions forecast for Tuesday 12 November, all of Anglicare\u2019s staff are reviewing the evacuation plans and making sure all contact lists are up to date,\u201d the Anglicare spokeswoman Tess Delbridge said. On the central coast, north of Sydney, the Gosford pound was calling for volunteers to help with short-term re-homing. \u201cWe are asking if there are any coasties who would be willing to collect a dog either this afternoon or tomorrow morning to crash at your home until Wednesday,\u201d the organisation wrote on Facebook. When Guardian Australia called the shelter on Monday, a staff member said, \u201cI\u2019ve got about 30 people here wanting to look after dogs.\u201d Berejiklian said on Monday she had declared a state of emergency at the request of the RFS. \u201cWith catastrophic weather conditions predicted for this week, particularly Tuesday with hot weather and strong winds, I have decided to take the commissioner\u2019s advice and make this declaration,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cEverybody has to assume the worst and we cannot allow complacency to creep in.\u201d It comes after fires tore through the mid-north coast of NSW over the weekend, killing three people and leaving 100 more injured, including 20 firefighters. Ten of the more than 60 fires in NSW remained at watch and act level on Monday evening. Dael Allison, from the tiny NSW town of Bobin, north-west of Taree, said at least a dozen people she knew had lost their homes. \u201cBobin is shocking,\u201d she says. \u201cBobin is devastated. There would be entire hillsides that wouldn\u2019t have a tree standing.\u201d Allison drove with her partner, Rick Haughton, and son from Port Stephens to Bobin on Sunday to check on friends and on their property, where they grow eucalypts. The main house is still standing but sheds, the original cottage they built and that their children spent the first years of their lives in, and most of the land are burned out. \u201cWe\u2019ve had fires but I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Allison said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen fires that come right down to the water level of the creek. \u201cI don\u2019t know where fire crews are getting their water from. \u201cThe whole area is just on fire. At least a dozen people I know have lost houses. That would be nowhere near the final count.\u201d The RFS inspector Ben Shepherd warned people outside of the catastrophic fire danger areas that other parts of NSW would still have \u201csevere and extreme\u201d dangers on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to ensure that people understand there is a risk in all bushland areas, stretching from Bega all the way to Byron, from the Victorian border to the Queensland border,\u201d he said. In Queensland, more than 65 fires were burning across the state on Monday evening, with firefighters battling three watch and act level fires at: Cobraball near Yeppoon, Townson and Thornton in the Lockyer Valley, and Clumber. Meanwhile, a bushfire threatened lives and properties in Rockingham, Western Australian, and homes and businesses in Port Lincoln, South Australia were threatened by an out-of-control bushfire on the outskirts of the Eyre peninsula town.",

      "body": "<p>Lou Reed\u2019s literary ambitions were there from the start, nurtured at Syracuse University in the early 1960s, where he studied English under the mysterious poet and short-story writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/04/classics.features\" title=\"\">Delmore Schwartz</a>, whom he would later acknowledge as his \u201cspiritual godfather\u201d. In 1966, having disappeared from public view for several years, Schwartz died alone and unsung, in a sleazy hotel in Times Square, aged 52. He had struggled with alcoholism, mental health issues and the heavy weight of early fame.</p> <p>Schwartz could have been a character in a Lou Reed song. Instead, Reed wrote two songs <em>about</em> him. The first, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae0no6_VkKk\" title=\"\">European Son (to Delmore Schwartz)</a>, is the final track on the Velvet Underground\u2019s 1967 debut album, <em>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</em>. The song was actually recorded a few months before the poet\u2019s death and sounds more like a put-down than a homage: \u201cBut now your blue clouds have gone/ You\u2019d better say so long/ Hey hey, bye bye bye.\u201d It may have been a riposte to the older writer\u2019s oft-voiced disdain for the pop song.</p> <p>In 1982, Reed opened his 11th solo album, <em>The Blue Mask</em>, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtiih7wk4uQ\" title=\"\">My House</a>, an altogether more reflective song in which the singer describes his mentor as \u201cthe first great man that I had ever met\u201d. He also compares their early friendship to that of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom in James Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses</em> \u2013 no shrinking violet, Lou.</p> <p>If Schwartz cast a long shadow, he was not the only ghost to haunt Reed\u2019s lyrical imagination. In 1990, alongside his former Velvet Underground collaborator John Cale, he released <em>Songs </em><em>for Drella</em>, an entire album of vignettes in memory of Andy Warhol, his other great creative touchstone. As <em>I\u2019ll Be Your Mirror</em>, a revised version of Reed\u2019s collected lyrics, highlights, he often trod a line between Warhol\u2019s deadpan, almost nihilistic blankness and Schwartz\u2019s more intensely descriptive and urgent poetry. Reed\u2019s core musical influences were similarly wide-ranging, spanning the uncompromising free jazz of Ornette Coleman and the honeyed harmonies of countless 50s doo-wop groups.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f8b37b0625eb058fcf68c8d0ea68d3ed50679f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f8b37b0625eb058fcf68c8d0ea68d3ed50679f4/0_179_6567_3941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lou Reed on stage in Copenhagen, August 1973\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lou Reed on stage in Copenhagen, August 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorgen Angel/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there was his subject matter, which veered from the graphic (Heroin, I\u2019m Waiting for the Man) to the intimate (Pale Blue Eyes, Perfect Day). Reed was nothing if not an artist of extremes. In one of the introductions to this volume, James Atlas describes him as \u201ca nihilist who loved life\u201d, which just about nails it. All this made him a singular songwriter, his best work often defined by that cruel-tender dynamic \u2013 has there ever been a more beautiful-sounding song about hustlers and speed freaks than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG6fayQBm9w\" title=\"\">Walk on the Wild Side</a>? This hefty book is so full of contrasts that, were you coming cold to Reed\u2019s oeuvre, it would be hard to reconcile the songwriter who penned the masochistic Venus in Furs with the romantic balladeer who, on I Found a Reason, croons: \u201cI found a reason to keep living, and the reason dear is you.\u201d Sinatra would have worked wonders with that couplet, but would not have ventured within a country mile of the former song\u2019s \u201cwhiplash girl-child in the dark\u201d.</p> <p>Martin Scorsese, in his richly anecdotal intro, writes that Reed \u201cspoke and sang in the voice of the lowest of the low, the dregs, the \u2018least among us\u2019 \u2013 the people looking for the first thing that gives them the right to be\u201d. This shores up the notion of Reed as the ultimate \u201cdirty realist\u201d songwriter. It is this Reed who occupies an exalted place in the canon of rock songwriters: the street poet whose junkies, dealers and misfits inhabit a now all-but-vanished New York.</p> <p>What intrigues most, though, as Reed\u2019s lyrics are laid bare, are the myriad other Lous: camp Lou (Vicious), bitchy Lou (Hangin\u2019 Round), nostalgic Lou (Coney Island Baby), hard-bitten Lou (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1E06cWL-cw\" title=\"\">Dirt</a>), crassly provocative Lou (I Wanna Be Black) and, perhaps surprisingly, activist Lou (There Is No Time), whose call to arms seems even more urgent in today\u2019s ongoing state of emergency.</p> <p>Atlas makes the bold claim that I Wanna Be Black is \u201can astonishing poem\u201d that would be \u201cnearly impossible to imagine being recited anywhere by anyone today\u201d. But astonishing is hardly the word for determinedly tasteless lines like: \u201cI wanna be black/ Have natural rhythm/ Shoot twenty feet of jism, too/ And fuck up the Jews.\u201d Deliberate offence in the service of satire no longer cuts it.

Ashley Young was suspended, but at 34 the captain is no long-term leader of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side. Instead the manager hinted it could be Maguire. \u201cHarry is captain material, so is David,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Harry\u2019s come in and been excellent in the dressing room and on the pitch. He can become a long\u2011term captain.\u201d Maguire was a little vulnerable here, one first-half mistake almost leading to Brighton pulling one back with United 2-0 up.

On one hand there was Sheffield United \u2013 organised, vibrant, full of ideas. On the other there was Spurs: ragged, listless, and largely clueless. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men are way off the pace in the Premier League and it is hard to know where the manager starts in regards to fixing their problems. One area he may want to target immediately is full-back. Not for the first time, Serge Aurier and Ben Davies were poor, offering little from an attacking or defensive point of view. Juan Foyth has impressed at right-back and could be the long-term answer there, while at left-back it may be time for Ryan Sessegnon to get a run of games. What\u2019s for sure is that something needs to change \u2013 and fast. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/tottenham-hotspur-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 1-1 Sheffield United</a></em></p> <h2>6) Traor\u00e9 now has two nations fighting over him</h2> <p>It would be easy to mock Aston Villa after they became the latest team to be shredded this season by Adama Traor\u00e9, whom Villa sold in 2015 without ever starting him in a Premier League match. But it has taken a while for Traor\u00e9, still only 23, to harness his undoubted talent. Only this season at Wolves has he developed into one of the most thrilling players around. \u201cHe\u2019s playing well, sticking to his tasks, helping the team,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo before adding the clincher: \u201cAnd he gives you these unique moments that only he can produce.\u201d No wonder Spain, whom Traor\u00e9 has represented at under\u201116 through to under-21 level, have given him his first senior call-up. The fact that he has pulled out with an unspecified injury gives hope to Mali that he can yet be persuaded to declare for the country his parents come from. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/wolves-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Wolves 2-1 Aston Villa</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f535524fc129e265d0bfa3898c05c1f7dc50287d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f535524fc129e265d0bfa3898c05c1f7dc50287d/0_0_3105_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adama Traor\u00e9 leaves Marvelous Nakamba in his wake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adama Traor\u00e9 leaves Marvelous Nakamba in his wake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Dalley/News Images/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) McNeil is a Burnley forward\u2019s dream winger</h2> <p>Much of the post-mortem from Turf Moor will focus on another wretched West Ham display, but that should not diminish a gloriously merciless performance from Burnley. Dwight McNeil has been a revelation since being thrown into the deep end midway through last season, and this was perhaps his finest game yet. The 19-year-old identified his opponents\u2019 achilles heel \u2013 the painfully hesitant keeper Roberto \u2013 and went about exposing it in brutal fashion, wasting no opportunity to lash a cross into the West Ham box. He delivered 12 in total, two of which ended up in the back of the net, with the sort of no-frills wing-play that is the stuff of dreams for Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood. Burnley delivered a 90-minute pummelling on Saturday, but while their brawny strikers took the acclaim, the biggest blows were landed by the spindly teenager on the margins. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/burnley-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Burnley 3-0 West Ham</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/10/brendan-rodgers-vision-leicester-city-sight-of-another-miracle-arsenal\">Brendan Rodgers\u2019 vision keeps Leicester in sight of another miracle</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8) Saint-Maximin following in Ginola and Robert\u2019s footsteps</h2> <p>Allan Saint-Maximin is the type of winger fans adore and at whom coaching technocrats roll their eyes. An elemental force of nature, Newcastle\u2019s latest cult hero is unusual in that \u2013 with his teacher mother wanting him to concentrate on his education and, in particular, learning English \u2013 the 22\u2011year\u2011old was not coached one- and two\u2011touch football in a conventional academy. Instead, he played street football near his home on the outskirts of Paris, and became a highly improvisational dribbler with adhesive tight control. When he joined Saint-\u00c9tienne, and later Nice, his unorthodox gifts set him apart. Now he belongs to a distinguished rollcall of flashy French wide boys \u2013 David Ginola, Laurent Robert, Hatem Ben Arfa \u2013 for whom Newcastle fans have long harboured a particular weakness. Enjoy him while you can. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/newcastle-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Newcastle 2-1 Bournemouth</a></em></p> <h2>9) Flores and Capoue can get Watford out of trouble</h2> <p>Watford have slowly been pulling themselves together under Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, while their manager has been trying to find his best formula. A shift to a back three has stuck, though he has flicked through options at right wing-back. Up front he has tried to find the partnership that might get the best out of Gerard Deulofeu, who would be happiest taking on the opposition by himself as long as he didn\u2019t have to defend. In midfield it has been constant churn, but that may have changed with the return of \u00c9tienne Capoue. The French defensive midfielder knows his role, plays it simply and allows others to advance. He made important interceptions and tacklesagainst Norwich, but his key contribution was the way he liberated Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 and Will Hughes to advance in possession and press hard when out of it. Watford\u2019s next two fixtures are against Burnley and Southampton. Flores might just want more of the same. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/08/norwich-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Norwich 0-2 Watford</a></em></p> <h2>10) Are Southampton the division\u2019s worst team?</h2> <p>As poor as Southampton have been, the problem for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl may not be the shortcomings of his own team but rather the quality of others. Southampton plan to stand by their manager but, having stayed up by the skin of their teeth in recent seasons, it is increasingly difficult to envisage them surviving another relegation battle. Is there a worse team in the division? Norwich may be bottom but have shown more courage and fight than Southampton. Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side turned in another abject performance in defeat at home to Everton on Saturday, and were booed off at full time. The home game against Watford at the end of November looks pivotal. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable but we\u2019ve been here in the past so we know what it is,\u201d said the Southampton midfielder, Oriol Romeu. \u201cWe have to be honest and try to be brave.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a

I love him at this football club\u201d Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace 5) Pochettino\u2019s problems at Spurs start at full-back VAR controversy aside, the most striking aspect of this game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was the contrast in the teams\u2019 displays. On one hand there was Sheffield United \u2013 organised, vibrant, full of ideas. On the other there was Spurs: ragged, listless, and largely clueless. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men are way off the pace in the Premier League and it is hard to know where the manager starts in regards to fixing their problems. One area he may want to target immediately is full-back. Not for the first time, Serge Aurier and Ben Davies were poor, offering little from an attacking or defensive point of view. Juan Foyth has impressed at right-back and could be the long-term answer there, while at left-back it may be time for Ryan Sessegnon to get a run of games. What\u2019s for sure is that something needs to change \u2013 and fast. Sachin Nakrani \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 1-1 Sheffield United 6) Traor\u00e9 now has two nations fighting over him It would be easy to mock Aston Villa after they became the latest team to be shredded this season by Adama Traor\u00e9, whom Villa sold in 2015 without ever starting him in a Premier League match. But it has taken a while for Traor\u00e9, still only 23, to harness his undoubted talent. Only this season at Wolves has he developed into one of the most thrilling players around. \u201cHe\u2019s playing well, sticking to his tasks, helping the team,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo before adding the clincher: \u201cAnd he gives you these unique moments that only he can produce.\u201d No wonder Spain, whom Traor\u00e9 has represented at under\u201116 through to under-21 level, have given him his first senior call-up. The fact that he has pulled out with an unspecified injury gives hope to Mali that he can yet be persuaded to declare for the country his parents come from. Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Wolves 2-1 Aston Villa 7) McNeil is a Burnley forward\u2019s dream winger Much of the post-mortem from Turf Moor will focus on another wretched West Ham display, but that should not diminish a gloriously merciless performance from Burnley. Dwight McNeil has been a revelation since being thrown into the deep end midway through last season, and this was perhaps his finest game yet. The 19-year-old identified his opponents\u2019 achilles heel \u2013 the painfully hesitant keeper Roberto \u2013 and went about exposing it in brutal fashion, wasting no opportunity to lash a cross into the West Ham box. He delivered 12 in total, two of which ended up in the back of the net, with the sort of no-frills wing-play that is the stuff of dreams for Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood. Burnley delivered a 90-minute pummelling on Saturday, but while their brawny strikers took the acclaim, the biggest blows were landed by the spindly teenager on the margins. Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Burnley 3-0 West Ham 8) Saint-Maximin following in Ginola and Robert\u2019s footsteps Allan Saint-Maximin is the type of winger fans adore and at whom coaching technocrats roll their eyes. An elemental force of nature, Newcastle\u2019s latest cult hero is unusual in that \u2013 with his teacher mother wanting him to concentrate on his education and, in particular, learning English \u2013 the 22\u2011year\u2011old was not coached one- and two\u2011touch football in a conventional academy. Instead, he played street football near his home on the outskirts of Paris, and became a highly improvisational dribbler with adhesive tight control. When he joined Saint-\u00c9tienne, and later Nice, his unorthodox gifts set him apart. Now he belongs to a distinguished rollcall of flashy French wide boys \u2013 David Ginola, Laurent Robert, Hatem Ben Arfa \u2013 for whom Newcastle fans have long harboured a particular weakness. Enjoy him while you can. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 2-1 Bournemouth 9) Flores and Capoue can get Watford out of trouble Watford have slowly been pulling themselves together under Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, while their manager has been trying to find his best formula. A shift to a back three has stuck, though he has flicked through options at right wing-back. Up front he has tried to find the partnership that might get the best out of Gerard Deulofeu, who would be happiest taking on the opposition by himself as long as he didn\u2019t have to defend. In midfield it has been constant churn, but that may have changed with the return of \u00c9tienne Capoue. The French defensive midfielder knows his role, plays it simply and allows others to advance. He made important interceptions and tacklesagainst Norwich, but his key contribution was the way he liberated Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 and Will Hughes to advance in possession and press hard when out of it. Watford\u2019s next two fixtures are against Burnley and Southampton. Flores might just want more of the same. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Norwich 0-2 Watford 10) Are Southampton the division\u2019s worst team? As poor as Southampton have been, the problem for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl may not be the shortcomings of his own team but rather the quality of others. Southampton plan to stand by their manager but, having stayed up by the skin of their teeth in recent seasons, it is increasingly difficult to envisage them surviving another relegation battle. Is there a worse team in the division? Norwich may be bottom but have shown more courage and fight than Southampton. Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side turned in another abject performance in defeat at home to Everton on Saturday, and were booed off at full time. The home game against Watford at the end of November looks pivotal. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable but we\u2019ve been here in the past so we know what it is,\u201d said the Southampton midfielder, Oriol Romeu. \u201cWe have to be honest and try to be brave.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Southampton 1-2 Everton",

We also think it is worth alerting readers to the fact that the Virgin West Coast transfers to new operator \u2013 First Trenitalia \u2013 on 8 December. We are reassured any complaints relating to travel before the cut-off date will continue to be handled by Virgin. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

At the heart of this swathe of Amazon basin is Iquitos, the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road.</p> <p>One of Peru\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/cifras_de_pobreza/exposicion_evolucion-de-pobreza-monetaria-2018.pdf\">poorest regions</a>, with the highest levels of <a href=\"https://www.inei.gob.pe/prensa/noticias/desnutricion-cronica-afecto-al-122-de-la-poblacion-menor-de-cinco-anos-de-edad-en-el-ano-2018-11370/\">infant malnutrition and anaemia</a>, Loreto now faces a growing threat from HIV and Aids. The virus has spread throughout the vast region since the first reported case in the early 1990s, and particularly affects sex workers, traders, oil workers and indigenous communities.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.dge.gob.pe/portal/docs/vigilancia/vih/Boletin_2018/diciembre.pdf\">epidemiological control department</a> of Peru\u2019s health ministry, infection rates in Loreto are exceeded only by Peru\u2019s capital, Lima, and its port district Callao, despite the population of the Amazon region being a fraction of the size.</p> <p>While Lima and Callao have a combined population of nearly 11 million, Loreto\u2019s inhabitants number less than 1 million. Between 2000 and 2018, around 72,000 cases of HIV and 30,000 cases of Aids were <a href=\"https://www.dge.gob.pe/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=362&amp;Itemid=362\">recorded</a> in Lima and Callao.

Treatment in Peru has improved dramatically in the past two decades, and in 2004 the country introduced <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4949315/\">free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment</a>.<strong> </strong>Barbar\u00e1n managed to get ARV treatment soon after she was diagnosed, thanks to relatives who lived abroad.</p> <p>Since the rubber boom at the beginning of the 20th century, Iquitos has been a trading post.

      "bodyText": "As the serpentine Amazon river meanders through a sea of jungle, a little red boat speeds across its muddy brown waters. Powered by two outboard motors, the vessel carries a cargo of volunteers, medics and nurses, an awning, and dozens of HIV screening tests. The first stop is Nueva Vida Yahua, an indigenous village 40 minutes down the Nanay river from Iquitos. The women are dressed in red skirts and grass tops worn draped over their shoulders, the men in long grass skirts and headdresses made from blue macaw feathers. As volunteers erect a canopy over a plastic table and chairs, a queue of people begins to form for the finger-prick HIV tests. Village elders use a megaphone to summon more people for the visit by the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF). Alongside the tests, team leader Silvia Barbar\u00e1n talks frankly to a group of young women \u2013 many of them breastfeeding infants or caring for toddlers - about the importance of safe sex and condom use. The women are curious, as though it\u2019s the first time anyone has ever talked to them about safe sex or HIV. The tests take just 15 minutes to show results: no one in this small hamlet is HIV positive. The mood is jubilant as the volunteers are led to the maloca, the village\u2019s principal palm-thatched hut. The head man, Anselmo Cahuachi, stands in the centre, singing a plaintive song and beating a drum as the villagers dance in a circle around him, each one holding a visitor by the hand. It is difficult to rush anything in Peru\u2019s largest state, Loreto. At the heart of this swathe of Amazon basin is Iquitos, the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road. One of Peru\u2019s poorest regions, with the highest levels of infant malnutrition and anaemia, Loreto now faces a growing threat from HIV and Aids. The virus has spread throughout the vast region since the first reported case in the early 1990s, and particularly affects sex workers, traders, oil workers and indigenous communities. According to the epidemiological control department of Peru\u2019s health ministry, infection rates in Loreto are exceeded only by Peru\u2019s capital, Lima, and its port district Callao, despite the population of the Amazon region being a fraction of the size. While Lima and Callao have a combined population of nearly 11 million, Loreto\u2019s inhabitants number less than 1 million. Between 2000 and 2018, around 72,000 cases of HIV and 30,000 cases of Aids were recorded in Lima and Callao. Data from the same period placed Loreto in third place, with roughly 6,000 cases of HIV and 4,000 of Aids. To counter the rising figures, HIV activists are taking to the river to detect and treat the virus and spread the safe sex message. \u201cThe geography of our jungle is a big problem for getting around,\u201d says Barbar\u00e1n, Iquitos\u2019 most recognisable and vocal activist for HIV awareness and LGBT rights. \u201cThanks to this boat we\u2019re saving lives, because with an early diagnosis we can give prompt treatment and that person can get on with their life.\u201d Barbar\u00e1n, whose turquoise hair is styled into a quiff, has been HIV-positive since 2000 and came close to death. Treatment in Peru has improved dramatically in the past two decades, and in 2004 the country introduced free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. Barbar\u00e1n managed to get ARV treatment soon after she was diagnosed, thanks to relatives who lived abroad. Since the rubber boom at the beginning of the 20th century, Iquitos has been a trading post. Add to that tourism and more internal movement and \u201csome infections which didn\u2019t exist in the region begin to enter,\u201d says Dr Jos\u00e9 Luis Sebasti\u00e1n, director of AHF for the Andean region. \u201cAs these are small circles it\u2019s felt in a much stronger way than in regions with a bigger population,\u201d he adds. Of the more than 4,000 people tested for HIV in Loreto by AHF between January and August, 5.8% have tested positive, which is slightly higher than health ministry figures. As dusk falls, the team is taken by noisy motorised rickshaws to the home of one of their youngest patients, in nearby Padre Cocha. Leonidas, eight, contracted HIV from his parents. Abandoned by his mother, Leonidas was adopted by his aunt Micaela Aquituari when his father \u2013 her brother \u2013 died from Aids in 2014. He lives with Aquituari, a health administrator, and his doting grandparents in a concrete shack with open blue wooden shutters. Electric cables hang off a discoloured wall, on which hangs a photo of Leonidas in his school uniform. \u201cMy brother died and we were very sad, but we have hope for life through his son,\u201d says Aquitari. \u201cFor us [my brother] lives through his son for as long as God wishes and we will carry on his treatment so he continues to have a long and happy life.\u201d Antiretroviral treatment pulled Leonidas back from the brink of death in 2014. He must take large, hard-to-swallow tablets each day for the rest of his life. He wants to be a doctor when he\u2019s older. Dr Carlos Benites, who leads Peru\u2019s HIV and Aids control programme, says indigenous populations living in the Amazon have certain risk factors due to local customs and practices. \u201cBeginning sexual relations early, the custom of having more than one sexual partner \u2026 the use of condoms is very low,\u201d Benites explains. Some Amazon groups believe they contract HIV because someone has cursed them, he adds. After Nueva Vida Yahua, the boat travels on to Tamshiyacu. The craft has been named \u2018Angely\u2019 after a girl in a remote village who died of Aids because she did not get treatment. In a torrential downpour, Jos\u00e9 Roca runs down the concrete steps to the riverside wearing hotpants and a soaking red T-shirt to help unload the boat. Roca, a former sex worker who runs a hair salon, has lived with HIV for more than two decades. \u201cI knew what I was getting into,\u201d Roca says of contracting HIV. \u201cThe pain was not for me, the pain was for my family.\u201d Peru\u2019s male LGBT community is the demographic most impacted by the virus. Barbar\u00e1n admits that sometimes she feels powerless to stop the virus\u2019 advance. \u201cYou have to tell people to love themselves and take care of themselves,\u201d she says. She and colleague Lupe Chistama talk frankly about safe sex to a group of young mothers and teenage girls.

The Waddington Arms, an old coaching inn, is not quite as ancient, but with a roaring log fire, cosy bedrooms and hearty food, was a wonderful refuge for our short winter break.

We had a warm, lived-in circular sitting room with open fire and comfortable sofas with books and magazines, and enjoyed breakfast and a three-course dinner in the 1713-built beamed warehouse.

Our favourite hideaway is the cosy Two Bridges Hotel near Princetown, a historic inn with huge log fires, comfy sofas and welcoming rooms to snuggle down in after a bracing day on the moor. The food and local ales (including Princetown\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.dartmoorbrewery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Jail Ale</a>) are superb, the staff are friendly and attentive (resourceful too \u2013 in last year\u2019s blizzard they improvised overnight accommodation for stranded motorists).

Soon we found ourselves charmed in to staying for dinner (my hake and mussels was seriously good) \u2013 and then decided to break our journey and stay the night. Our room was comfortable, in modern country style, and it\u2019s dog-friendly, too. It\u2019s in a gorgeous area, with great walks from the front door and a 15-minute drive to some of the best beaches in the UK, like <a href=\"https://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/north-east-england/northumberland/warkworth.htm\" title=\"\">Warkworth</a>, for bracing walks. <br><strong>\u2022 </strong><em>Doubles from \u00a3130 B&amp;B, <a href=\"http://northumberlandarms-felton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">northumberlandarms-felton.co.uk</a></em><br><strong>Katy</strong></p> \n<h2>The Royal at Heysham, Lancashire</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6f20e668b7ba7d0c37549e2ea9c2fc760a19c32\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6f20e668b7ba7d0c37549e2ea9c2fc760a19c32/0_62_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dining room at The Royal, Heysham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>When the new owners of our village pub announced a multimillion-pound refurbishment, we were apprehensive. But the revamped pub has kept the best of the old and brought back in to use rooms that were disused (and semi-derelict). Guest bedrooms were created, along with an outside seating area (with heaters and blankets provided). Although enlarged, the Royal is still cosy, with open fires in bar areas. Heysham village is one of Lancashire\u2019s hidden gems, with views over Morecambe Bay to the Lake District peaks from the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/heysham-coast\" title=\"\">nearby headland</a> (in the care of the National Trust).<br>\u2022 <em>Doubles from \u00a390 B&amp;B, <a href=\"https://www.theroyalheysham.co.uk/\" title=\"\">theroyalheysham.co.uk</a></em><br><strong>Graham Dean</strong></p> \n<h2>Romney Bay House Hotel, Kent</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adc0624a74fcbcd3570d71045a1a14cfd541d7d4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc0624a74fcbcd3570d71045a1a14cfd541d7d4/0_128_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romney Bay House Hotel, Littlestone, New Romney, Kent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>This is an ideal retreat after a day walking on the blustery expanses of Dungeness\u2019s shingle and around the local RSPB reserve\u2019s lagoons. After dark, settle into the cosy bar with local beers and a cheeseboard, or eat in the restaurant. We found it fascinating watching the ships in the Channel by night and enjoyed the huge skies and colours of dusk. Breakfast is in the conservatory, sheltered from the wind on the marshes, and dinners by chef Clinton Lovell centre on locally caught fish. With looks that reminded me of an ocean liner, this hotel is one of the few accommodation options on a lonely bit of coastline \u2013 and we found it was the perfect place to moor up on a crisp winter weekend. <br>\u2022 <em>Doubles from \u00a395 B&amp;B, <a href=\"http://www.romneybayhousehotel.co.uk/\" title=\"\">romneybayhousehotel.co.uk</a></em><br><strong>Amy Gardner</strong></p> \n<h2>Kilcamb Lodge Hotel, Highlands</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"566e107c60eef5bae564c740808e2ab47968ca74\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/566e107c60eef5bae564c740808e2ab47968ca74/0_32_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kilcamb Lodge Hotel, Highlands, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/dec/26/10-great-winter-walks-in-uk-readers-travel-tips\">10 great winter walks in the UK: readers\u2019 tips</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bedrooms at this secluded hotel overlook one of the Highland\u2019s longest sea lochs, Sunart, where otters and dolphins play in the water and pine martens and red squirrels inhabit the forests.

We found the bar\u2019s old-world feel of warm lighting and wood-panelled walls a welcome hiding place when the weather took a turn for the worse. To fully enjoy the wonderful colours of the local foliage at this time of year I\u2019d recommend joining one of the leaf peeping trips the hotel runs. Last year we also took part in a foraging expedition, identifying wild plants and coming up with dishes using ingredients found a short walk from the hotel. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3109 B&amp;B, angelabergavenny.com Keith Waddington Arms, Lancashire The beautiful Ribble Valley is home to the attractive, historic village of Waddington on the edge of the Forest of Bowland. One of its oldest buildings, Waddington Old Hall, gave refuge to King Henry VI in 1465. The Waddington Arms, an old coaching inn, is not quite as ancient, but with a roaring log fire, cosy bedrooms and hearty food, was a wonderful refuge for our short winter break. Numerous walks can be taken from the village: either gentle, following the path of the pretty stream, or more strenuous, such as a climb to the site of the old Moorcock Inn. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a370 B&amp;B, waddingtonarms.co.uk Kevin Cley Windmill, Norfolk With atmospheric wintry views across reed beds and bird-rich salt marshes to the North Sea, this converted windmill, a landmark on the north Norfolk coast, offered us an enjoyable stay. We had a warm, lived-in circular sitting room with open fire and comfortable sofas with books and magazines, and enjoyed breakfast and a three-course dinner in the 1713-built beamed warehouse. There are several circular bedrooms in the tower itself, and other rooms in older parts of the building. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3159 B&amp;B, cleywindmill.co.uk Paul Green Two Bridges Hotel, Dartmoor Living as we do in Devon, our go-to bolthole is wild and wonderful Dartmoor, especially in the winter when the snow-covered tors feel like another world. Our favourite hideaway is the cosy Two Bridges Hotel near Princetown, a historic inn with huge log fires, comfy sofas and welcoming rooms to snuggle down in after a bracing day on the moor. The food and local ales (including Princetown\u2019s own Jail Ale) are superb, the staff are friendly and attentive (resourceful too \u2013 in last year\u2019s blizzard they improvised overnight accommodation for stranded motorists). For added entertainment, there\u2019s a resident flock of geese. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a390 B&amp;B, twobridges.co.uk Delia Pemberton Northumberland Arms, Felton We went into this pub in the village of Felton for a drink, welcomed by friendly staff and a woodburning stove. Soon we found ourselves charmed in to staying for dinner (my hake and mussels was seriously good) \u2013 and then decided to break our journey and stay the night. Our room was comfortable, in modern country style, and it\u2019s dog-friendly, too. It\u2019s in a gorgeous area, with great walks from the front door and a 15-minute drive to some of the best beaches in the UK, like Warkworth, for bracing walks. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3130 B&amp;B, northumberlandarms-felton.co.uk Katy The Royal at Heysham, Lancashire When the new owners of our village pub announced a multimillion-pound refurbishment, we were apprehensive. But the revamped pub has kept the best of the old and brought back in to use rooms that were disused (and semi-derelict). Guest bedrooms were created, along with an outside seating area (with heaters and blankets provided). Although enlarged, the Royal is still cosy, with open fires in bar areas. Heysham village is one of Lancashire\u2019s hidden gems, with views over Morecambe Bay to the Lake District peaks from the nearby headland (in the care of the National Trust). \u2022 Doubles from \u00a390 B&amp;B, theroyalheysham.co.uk Graham Dean Romney Bay House Hotel, Kent This is an ideal retreat after a day walking on the blustery expanses of Dungeness\u2019s shingle and around the local RSPB reserve\u2019s lagoons. After dark, settle into the cosy bar with local beers and a cheeseboard, or eat in the restaurant. We found it fascinating watching the ships in the Channel by night and enjoyed the huge skies and colours of dusk. Breakfast is in the conservatory, sheltered from the wind on the marshes, and dinners by chef Clinton Lovell centre on locally caught fish. With looks that reminded me of an ocean liner, this hotel is one of the few accommodation options on a lonely bit of coastline \u2013 and we found it was the perfect place to moor up on a crisp winter weekend. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a395 B&amp;B, romneybayhousehotel.co.uk Amy Gardner Kilcamb Lodge Hotel, Highlands Bedrooms at this secluded hotel overlook one of the Highland\u2019s longest sea lochs, Sunart, where otters and dolphins play in the water and pine martens and red squirrels inhabit the forests. The Ardnamurchan peninsula is one of the wildest parts of the UK, with exhilarating walks everywhere you turn. We enjoyed trips to the Ardnamurchan distillery and the singing sands of Kentra Bay and, at sunset, one of the most beautiful sights I\u2019ve seen: the ruins of Castle Tioram at Loch Moidart. On returning to Kilcamb, there\u2019s roast venison from the hills behind, lobsters, scallops and langoustines from the loch in front and a roaring fire. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3185 B&amp;B, kilcamblodge.co.uk Nigel Murray Widbrook Grange, Wiltshire Close to the idyllic town of Bradford-on-Avon, we found this the perfect place for a winter break.

As we start the first full week of the election campaign, the party leaders are heading out on the trail with plenty of promises.

Their other commitments include improving service housing; a Police Federation-style representative body for personnel; an end to other privatisation within the military; and improved access to schools for children of force members.</p> \n<p>Labour MP Keith Vaz, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/labour-to-debate-whether-keith-vaz-will-stand-as-mp-at-election\">facing suspension from the House of Commons for six months</a> after he was found to have offered to buy cocaine for sex workers, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/labour-keith-vaz-stands-down\">announced he will not be standing for re-election</a>. Vaz, who has spent 32 years as the member of parliament for Leicester East, made the announcement on Sunday evening. Jeremy Corbyn praised Vaz, saying he was part of a pioneering group of black and Asian Labour MPs elected in 1987, and had \u201chelped to pave the way for more BAME people to become involved in politics\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/labour-derides-12tn-tory-costing-claims-as-work-of-fiction-corbyn\">Sajid Javid has attacked Labour\u2019s spending plans</a>, saying the price tag of the party\u2019s proposals could cost as much as \u00a31.2tn over five years. The Conservatives are keen to portray Corbyn\u2019s party as reckless when it comes to public spending, and published a 36-page document setting out their claim. Labour has dismissed the dossier as \u201can absolute work of fiction\u201d, as the two parties clashed again over their plans for the economy.

      "bodyText": "Hello and welcome to your Monday morning round-up of the day\u2019s news. As we start the first full week of the election campaign, the party leaders are heading out on the trail with plenty of promises. You can follow our live coverage of the day\u2019s politics here. What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s Armistice Day and the parties are using the anniversary to roll out announcements about proposals to help military personnel and their families. The Conservatives have proposed more thorough childcare for service families, a railcard for veterans and policies to assist veterans get jobs after leaving the service. Labour has said it will improve pay and conditions for serving military staff by scrapping the public sector pay cap, which it argues has meant a real-term pay cut of 5.8% since 2010 for an army private. Their other commitments include improving service housing; a Police Federation-style representative body for personnel; an end to other privatisation within the military; and improved access to schools for children of force members. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who was facing suspension from the House of Commons for six months after he was found to have offered to buy cocaine for sex workers, has announced he will not be standing for re-election. Vaz, who has spent 32 years as the member of parliament for Leicester East, made the announcement on Sunday evening. Jeremy Corbyn praised Vaz, saying he was part of a pioneering group of black and Asian Labour MPs elected in 1987, and had \u201chelped to pave the way for more BAME people to become involved in politics\u201d. Sajid Javid has attacked Labour\u2019s spending plans, saying the price tag of the party\u2019s proposals could cost as much as \u00a31.2tn over five years. The Conservatives are keen to portray Corbyn\u2019s party as reckless when it comes to public spending, and published a 36-page document setting out their claim. Labour has dismissed the dossier as \u201can absolute work of fiction\u201d, as the two parties clashed again over their plans for the economy. Richard Partington, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, has analysed their costing document. At a glance Labour activists are urging Jeremy Corbyn to incorporate the radical pro-migration policy passed at the party\u2019s conference into its manifesto this week as the Tories prepare to weaponise the issue in the election battle. Two years after the Grime4Corbyn movement launched with the aim of connecting energised fans with the Labour leader\u2019s politics, several of the genre\u2019s big names have called into question its effectiveness, with one grime manager saying the artists felt \u201cused\u201d by the Labour campaign. The Guardian has launched its election poll tracker, which shows results from all the main polling firms, but also comes with strong warnings about the reliability of polls in light of the last election\u2019s shock result. Here\u2019s a guide to what polls mean \u2013 and what they don\u2019t. Days after stepping down as Speaker, John Bercow gave an interview to the Observer in which he declined to reveal who he would vote for in the upcoming election, but said he did not think the Tories had a lock on the result, and didn\u2019t think the election would sort out the question of Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to be talking about this in five years, and possibly in 15 years,\u201d he said. The day ahead Boris Johnson will be visiting veterans today, on the anniversary of the end of the first world war. The Brexit party chairman Richard Tice and leader Nigel Farage will launch their campaign in Hartlepool. Senior Labour figures are expected to meet today to thrash out the details of the party\u2019s immigration policy, but a final decision will not be made until next weekend. Best of the rest &gt; A leaked Cabinet Office report says that almost half of rape victims \u2013 or about 20,000 women \u2013 drop out of investigations because they don\u2019t want to pursue a prosecution even when a suspect has been identified. &gt; Sydney faces an unprecedented \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire risk tomorrow as bushfires raging across Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard threaten parts of the country\u2019s biggest city amid soaring temperatures and high winds. &gt; Spain\u2019s socialist party has won the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years but the country once again emerged without a clear winner. The rightwing Vox party doubled its tally of seats to become the third largest group in parliament. Today in Focus podcast: Meeting George Soros Shaun Walker has spent years covering Russia and eastern Europe and watched how the billionaire philanthropist George Soros has become a figure of hate among populists and the far right. Our correspondent recently interviewed the financier and tells the podcast what happened. Plus: Lea Ypi on the millions of people who do not have a vote in the UK election. Lunchtime read: Eva Longoria on Time\u2019s Up, Trump and \u2018Texicans\u2019 Eva Longoria, the actor best known for her winning turn in Desperate Housewives, has switched to the other side of the camera to become the first Latina to direct a major Hollywood studio movie. She tells Emine Saner about her decision to \u201cconsciously hire\u201d women or people of colour for her new productions, the Time\u2019s Up movement and why she\u2019s more American than Trump. Sport Pep Guardiola said referees\u2019 chief Mike Riley should explain the latest controversy involving VAR as Manchester City fell nine points behind Liverpool in the title race with a 3-1 defeat at Anfield. Dominic Thiem beat Roger Federer in their opening game at the ATP finals in London while Novak Djokovic defeated Matteo Berrettini. Phil Neville refused to lay any blame on his players after defeat against Germany ensured a fifth loss in seven games for the Lionesses and pressure continued to mount on the manager. Hannah Cockcroft claimed a fifth consecutive T34 100m title with a stunning world-record time of 16.79sec at the World Para-Athletics Championships in Dubai. Under-fire Saracens are preparing for more ire from opposing crowds after their reception from Gloucester\u2019s Shed at the weekend. Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly left Allianz Stadium before the final whistle of Juventus\u2019s 1-0 Serie A win over Milan after being substituted for the second time in a week. And Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters did not play in Friday\u2019s game against the Lakers in Los Angeles after experiencing what reports claimed was a \u201cpanic attack\u201d on the team plane after taking a THC-infused edible. Business The Chinese industrial group Jingye could seal the purchase of British Steel in the coming days after staff were told that an exchange of contracts was imminent. The deal could save 4,000 jobs, mostly in Scunthorpe. On the markets, shares in Asia ticked lower amid concern about the worsening security situation in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index shed more than 1% today. The FTSE100 is set to drop slightly at the opening today while the pound will buy you $1.279 and \u20ac1.161.

We\u2019re starting out by looking at some announcements made before or early in the campaign that have already become points of contention \u2013 and we still have nearly five weeks to go.</p> <h2>Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to put 20,000 new police officers on the streets: technically true, but a return to former numbers at best</h2> <p><strong>Claim </strong>In one of his first announcements as prime minister, Boris Johnson declared that he would be recruiting 20,000 new police officers. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-campaign-to-recruit-20000-police-officers-launches-today\">He said</a>: \u201cGetting more police on our streets is an absolute priority and I\u2019m delighted our recruitment campaign for 20,000 new officers is now under way.\u201d Likewise, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cOne of the government\u2019s first actions was to commit to putting 20,000 new police officers on our streets.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Background </strong>The Conservatives\u2019 claim to be the party of law and order is under threat: violent crime has been rising (violence against the person offences were up 15% year on year in most recent official figures), police numbers are lower than they were in 2010 and the proportion of crimes being solved in England and Wales is falling, from 15% in 2015 to 7.4% this year.</p> <p><strong>Reality </strong>Despite the repeated use of the word \u201cnew\u201d, the recruitment drive should be seen more as a restoration of police numbers, which have fallen by about 20,000 since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> came to power in 2010. The total number of full-time equivalent officers in operational frontline roles stood at 103,347 at at March 2019, 20,039 lower than the 123,386 employed in 2010.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the fact that the 20,000 new officers will be spread over three years \u2013 the Home Office said 6,000 would be recruited in the first year and a further 14,000 would be recruited in the following two years. The department has said all new hires will be in addition to officers hired to fill existing vacancies. This is significant because about 6-7% of the workforce leave each year. The most recent data shows nearly 9,000 officers left in the year to March; it will be a challenge to hit the recruitment target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30fd4c7b1b9e239f61674e3b4346b158bd13b14c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30fd4c7b1b9e239f61674e3b4346b158bd13b14c/0_169_3524_2114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 20,000 new police officers will be spread over three years \u2013 about 6,700 each year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hubball/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> </p> <h2><strong>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s claim that drug prices in the NHS will be pushed up by a Tory trade deal with the US: not guaranteed, but reasonably reflects US aim in talks</strong></h2> <p><strong>Claim </strong>Jeremy Corbyn says that Boris Johnson is putting the NHS up for grabs and that a deal with Donald Trump would \u201cbetray our NHS\u201d. The Labour party also claims a deal with the US could force prices of drugs up, and mean sending US companies \u00a3500m of NHS money a week.</p> <p><strong>Background </strong>The government has denied that the NHS is in any way \u201cup for sale\u201d, and said it \u201ccould not agree to any proposals on medicine pricing or access that would put NHS finances at risk or reduce clinician and patient choice\u201d. Trump also dismissed Corbyn\u2019s claims, telling Nigel Farage on LBC: \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to have anything to do with your health service. We\u2019re just talking about trade.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Reality </strong>The US government, not Trump, has made very plain that it does want greater access to the NHS and other public services \u2013 which could include prisons, education and transport.</p> <p>The official <a href=\"http://Summary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\">wish-list for US-UK trade negotiations</a>, published in February, stated clearly that it would be looking for \u201cnon-discriminatory treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of goods and services\u201d in the UK\u2019s \u201cstate-owned and controlled enterprises (SOEs)\u201d. <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/0129USTR.pdf\">At a Washington hearing</a>, a representative of the US pharmaceutical industry body told the US trade representative they wanted \u201cfull market access for US products\u201d including \u201ccompetitive market-derived pricing\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z87xjnoFRMo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z87xjnoFRMo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Labour\u2019s figure of \u00a3500m a week appears to be taken from <a href=\"https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/tag/dr-andrew-hill/\">Andrew Hill</a>, a drug pricing expert who told Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches the NHS could end up paying \u00a327bn more on drugs each year, or some \u00a3500m a week in a post-Brexit US trade deal.</p> <p>Of course, the British government is not obliged to make an agreement with the US on these terms, so such an outcome may not transpire. The Johnson government\u2019s objectives have not been published. But despite Trump\u2019s protestations, American negotiators have been clear that they would seek substantially higher prices for drugs as part of any deal.</p> <h2>Sajid Javid\u2019s promise of a Brexit deal dividend: lack of figures make it hard to scrutinise, but most mainstream economists disagree</h2> <p><strong>Claim </strong>The chancellor, Sajid Javid, launched the Conservative pitch on the economy with a claim that passing the government\u2019s Brexit deal would deliver a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000bnx8/election-2019-sajid-javid\">deal dividend</a>\u201d that could benefit the whole nation.</p> <p><strong>Background </strong>A look at GDP figures shows a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/05/uk-service-sector-brexit-prices-profitability\">slowdown in growth over the three years</a> since the Brexit vote.According to the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14426\">Institute for Fiscal Studies and Citibank</a>, the economy is 2.5% to 3% (\u00a355-66bn) smaller than it would have been under remain. Javid argues that passing the Brexit deal would give companies the clarity they crave to start investing again, leading to higher economic growth that would form his \u201cdeal dividend\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Reality </strong>Javid did not give a figure for the divided, and the government has refused to publish a thorough impact assessment of the deal, making it tougher to scrutinise the chancellor on his claim.</p> <p>The chancellor is right to say that Mark Carney believes a deal would benefit the economy. But that is not the full story. The Bank of England\u2019s governor has said the deal would lift some of the uncertainty facing businesses, and that growth would accelerate in 2020. However, the Bank expects growth in later years to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/07/bank-of-england-vote-raises-chances-interest-rate-cut\">lower than under Theresa May\u2019s deal</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84af58eff6fa7163ddbdabadb4d44859184ea382\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84af58eff6fa7163ddbdabadb4d44859184ea382/0_191_5082_3049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Carney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has said a Brexit deal would lift some of the uncertainty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if the government deal were passed, many economists say uncertainty would linger for many years. Over the longer-term, the <a href=\"https://www.niesr.ac.uk/\">National Institute of Economic and Social Research</a> says Johnson\u2019s deal would shave up to 4% (\u00a370bn) from the size of the economy by the end of the 2020s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/30/boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-would-cost-uk-economy-70bn\">equivalent to \u00a370bn</a>. It also said continued uncertainty would do less damage than Johnson\u2019s deal.</p> <p>Brexit forecasts for the economy are tough to make given the range of potential outcomes. Removing some uncertainty might push up growth. But mainstream economists suggest the long-term impact could leave the economy smaller than alternative Brexit deals or Remain. </p> <h2>Lib Dems commit to making 26m homes more energy efficient: specialists say target is not realistic</h2> <p><strong>Claim </strong>Jo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.libdems.org.uk/plan-for-the-future-climate\">committed to \u201cinvesting \u00a315bn</a> over the next parliament to retrofit 26m homes. This would save the average household \u00a3550 a year on energy bills.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Background </strong>As part of a package of measures to tackle the climate emergency, the Lib Dems announced plans to upgrade every house in the UK to an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of band B by 2030.

      "bodyText": "Throughout the 2019 election campaign, the Guardian will be fact-checking claims made across the political spectrum as candidates fight for seats in the House of Commons. In an age of growing concern over the extent of misinformation in political debate, we\u2019ll seek to provide rapid, reliable correction to errors made in the debates and other key political discussions, as well as on claims made by candidates that make their way into wide circulation on social media. We\u2019ll also provide in-depth analysis of the plausibility of the parties\u2019 policies. But we\u2019ll be careful not to simply amplify malicious falsehoods \u2013 so if an outlandish claim shows up in an obscure corner of the internet, we\u2019ll take great care not to bring it to wider prominence through our reporting. If you see or hear something that makes you suspicious and want to flag it to the Guardian fact check team, you can contact us at factcheck@theguardian.com, go to this page, or use the form below. While the election campaign only formally started last week, all parties have been making policy pledges \u2013 from Brexit to law and order, from NHS spending to green initiatives \u2013 for a while. We\u2019re starting out by looking at some announcements made before or early in the campaign that have already become points of contention \u2013 and we still have nearly five weeks to go. Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to put 20,000 new police officers on the streets: technically true, but a return to former numbers at best Claim In one of his first announcements as prime minister, Boris Johnson declared that he would be recruiting 20,000 new police officers. He said: \u201cGetting more police on our streets is an absolute priority and I\u2019m delighted our recruitment campaign for 20,000 new officers is now under way.\u201d Likewise, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cOne of the government\u2019s first actions was to commit to putting 20,000 new police officers on our streets.\u201d Background The Conservatives\u2019 claim to be the party of law and order is under threat: violent crime has been rising (violence against the person offences were up 15% year on year in most recent official figures), police numbers are lower than they were in 2010 and the proportion of crimes being solved in England and Wales is falling, from 15% in 2015 to 7.4% this year. Reality Despite the repeated use of the word \u201cnew\u201d, the recruitment drive should be seen more as a restoration of police numbers, which have fallen by about 20,000 since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. The total number of full-time equivalent officers in operational frontline roles stood at 103,347 at at March 2019, 20,039 lower than the 123,386 employed in 2010. Then there\u2019s the fact that the 20,000 new officers will be spread over three years \u2013 the Home Office said 6,000 would be recruited in the first year and a further 14,000 would be recruited in the following two years. The department has said all new hires will be in addition to officers hired to fill existing vacancies. This is significant because about 6-7% of the workforce leave each year. The most recent data shows nearly 9,000 officers left in the year to March; it will be a challenge to hit the recruitment target. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s claim that drug prices in the NHS will be pushed up by a Tory trade deal with the US: not guaranteed, but reasonably reflects US aim in talks Claim Jeremy Corbyn says that Boris Johnson is putting the NHS up for grabs and that a deal with Donald Trump would \u201cbetray our NHS\u201d. The Labour party also claims a deal with the US could force prices of drugs up, and mean sending US companies \u00a3500m of NHS money a week. Background The government has denied that the NHS is in any way \u201cup for sale\u201d, and said it \u201ccould not agree to any proposals on medicine pricing or access that would put NHS finances at risk or reduce clinician and patient choice\u201d. Trump also dismissed Corbyn\u2019s claims, telling Nigel Farage on LBC: \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to have anything to do with your health service. We\u2019re just talking about trade.\u201d Reality The US government, not Trump, has made very plain that it does want greater access to the NHS and other public services \u2013 which could include prisons, education and transport. The official wish-list for US-UK trade negotiations, published in February, stated clearly that it would be looking for \u201cnon-discriminatory treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of goods and services\u201d in the UK\u2019s \u201cstate-owned and controlled enterprises (SOEs)\u201d. At a Washington hearing, a representative of the US pharmaceutical industry body told the US trade representative they wanted \u201cfull market access for US products\u201d including \u201ccompetitive market-derived pricing\u201d. Labour\u2019s figure of \u00a3500m a week appears to be taken from Andrew Hill, a drug pricing expert who told Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches the NHS could end up paying \u00a327bn more on drugs each year, or some \u00a3500m a week in a post-Brexit US trade deal. Of course, the British government is not obliged to make an agreement with the US on these terms, so such an outcome may not transpire. The Johnson government\u2019s objectives have not been published. But despite Trump\u2019s protestations, American negotiators have been clear that they would seek substantially higher prices for drugs as part of any deal. Sajid Javid\u2019s promise of a Brexit deal dividend: lack of figures make it hard to scrutinise, but most mainstream economists disagree Claim The chancellor, Sajid Javid, launched the Conservative pitch on the economy with a claim that passing the government\u2019s Brexit deal would deliver a \u201cdeal dividend\u201d that could benefit the whole nation. Background A look at GDP figures shows a slowdown in growth over the three years since the Brexit vote.According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Citibank, the economy is 2.5% to 3% (\u00a355-66bn) smaller than it would have been under remain. Javid argues that passing the Brexit deal would give companies the clarity they crave to start investing again, leading to higher economic growth that would form his \u201cdeal dividend\u201d. Reality Javid did not give a figure for the divided, and the government has refused to publish a thorough impact assessment of the deal, making it tougher to scrutinise the chancellor on his claim. The chancellor is right to say that Mark Carney believes a deal would benefit the economy. But that is not the full story. The Bank of England\u2019s governor has said the deal would lift some of the uncertainty facing businesses, and that growth would accelerate in 2020. However, the Bank expects growth in later years to be lower than under Theresa May\u2019s deal. Even if the government deal were passed, many economists say uncertainty would linger for many years. Over the longer-term, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research says Johnson\u2019s deal would shave up to 4% (\u00a370bn) from the size of the economy by the end of the 2020s, equivalent to \u00a370bn. It also said continued uncertainty would do less damage than Johnson\u2019s deal. Brexit forecasts for the economy are tough to make given the range of potential outcomes. Removing some uncertainty might push up growth. But mainstream economists suggest the long-term impact could leave the economy smaller than alternative Brexit deals or Remain. Lib Dems commit to making 26m homes more energy efficient: specialists say target is not realistic Claim Jo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats have committed to \u201cinvesting \u00a315bn over the next parliament to retrofit 26m homes. This would save the average household \u00a3550 a year on energy bills.\u201d Background As part of a package of measures to tackle the climate emergency, the Lib Dems announced plans to upgrade every house in the UK to an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of band B by 2030. Half of UK homes are rated D and the \u00a3550 figure is the potential saving if these homes are improved. Reality Hitting the 26m figure would involve retrofitting the entire housing stock of the UK \u2013 an ambitious project (and not entirely necessary, as about 1% are already up at band A or B). But even getting 13m from band D to band B is going to be a struggle, according to people working in the field. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to happen,\u201d said Mark Henderson of Leeds-based Brewster Bye Architects. \u201cThere are some quick fixes and I think they could achieve that on maybe 20% of homes, but then it starts getting harder.\u201d Jon Clayton, an architectural technologist who specialises in home renovations, says: \u201cSome of the quick wins are adding loft insulation and upgrading the boiler. Loft insulation can be done for a few hundred pounds, but the average cost of upgrading a boiler even without going to town could easily be \u00a32,000.\u201d This may be enough to raise some properties to band B, but many homes will need bigger, more disruptive and more expensive work to make a big impact. Listed building and back-to-back terraces also come with significant challenges. \u201cI commend the Lib Dems for setting high standards and having a sense of urgency,\u201d said Natalie Rush, the director of insulation specialists Six Star Group. \u201cWhile we\u2019re living in Victorian properties and homes from the 1930s I really don\u2019t think it is realistic that you can move so many to band B.\u201d",

At that point, the site was predicting a Tory majority of 76. And the current prediction still allows for the Scottish National party to increase its position in Scotland, taking 48 seats, up from the 35 it achieved in 2017.</p> <h2>What about the dynamics of the campaign?</h2> <p>Pundits argue endlessly about which events in a campaign cut through to voters, although the traditional view had largely been that election campaigns make surprisingly little difference to the final outcome.</p> <p>That theory was shattered by the 2017 campaign, when Corbyn\u2019s Labour came from 21 points behind to finish with a deficit of just 2.4%. That gap, of course, produced the hung parliament.</p> <p>It is debatable too, who has had the worst start this time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\">Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s callous initial remarks about the Grenfell Tower victims</a> and the enforced resignation of Alun Cairns as Welsh secretary have been cancelled out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\">Tom Watson\u2019s departure</a> and the sight of former Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/former-labour-mp-ian-austin-urges-voters-back-boris-johnson\">Ian Austin urging voters to back Boris Johnson</a>.</p> <p>Polling averages also lag events by a couple of weeks, so any genuine movement in sentiment takes a while to show. So in this campaign, the trend lines have been a little different: the Conservatives are up three points, Labour up two. Losing out are the Lib Dems, down two and the Brexit party, down one. Other movements and roundings account for the remaining differences.</p> <p>So a little over a week into the campaign, there is one tentative trend: a shift in support towards the two big parties, which is yet to be sustained for long enough to count as a consequential shift. Above all, at least at this point, there is an election-winning Tory lead.</p> <h2>What about constituency polls \u2013 is there not a different story?</h2> <p>Although theoretically attractive, polling in individual constituencies is not only expensive to conduct but notoriously unreliable. Nonetheless, the Lib Dems commissioned a string of polls from Survation in an attempt to show their position as positively as possible.</p> <p>They purport to show the Lib Dems leading in Labour held <a href=\"https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/lib-dems-could-steal-cambridge-17174230\">Cambridge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-polling-puts-liberal-democrats-beating-labour-mp-stephen-morgan-in-portsmouth-south-1-9129758\">Portsmouth South</a> \u2013 with a 15- or 16-point swing from Corbyn\u2019s party \u2013 and taking a seat from the Tories in <a href=\"https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/general-election-2019-shock-poll-puts-liberal-democrats-ahead-of-tories-in-south-cambridgeshire-9088627/\">South Cambridgeshire</a>, although that was where Heidi Allen had been expected to stand for the party.</p> <p>But pollsters such as Martin Boon, who founded Deltapoll, warn that there is a \u201cdisconnect between these results and the national picture\u201d because they suggest the Lib Dems doing far better locally that national projections suggest.</p> <h2>What about regional polls \u2013 can they be more revealing?</h2> <p>Regional polls can be particularly helpful in capturing variations at an easily understood level and are worth keeping an eye on. Two interesting regional polls from YouGov (a firm that is showing a big Tory lead nationally) have already emerged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-10T16:24:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"London voting intentions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-10T16:24:10/embed.html\">London voting intentions</a> </figure>  <p>The first, in London, records that <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/05/labours-london-lead-slimmer-2017\">Labour still leads with 39%</a>, but down 16 points on the 2017 general election; the Conservatives are at 29%, down four points, and the Lib Dems up 10 points to 19%, potentially helping Jo Swinson\u2019s party take seats in south-west London.

But what does that mean for the actual election result? Translating poll figures into how many parliamentary seats will be won is notoriously tricky, and polling firms are wary of taking that task on themselves. Psephologists, arguably braver individuals, do, however, try. One of the better known publicly available models, Electoral Calculus, estimates that on current averages, the Conservatives will win 370 seats, and a sweeping majority of 90, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour a distant second on 186. It is a Tory lead that has increased from 30 October, when it was clear that an election was taking place. At that point, the site was predicting a Tory majority of 76. And the current prediction still allows for the Scottish National party to increase its position in Scotland, taking 48 seats, up from the 35 it achieved in 2017. What about the dynamics of the campaign? Pundits argue endlessly about which events in a campaign cut through to voters, although the traditional view had largely been that election campaigns make surprisingly little difference to the final outcome. That theory was shattered by the 2017 campaign, when Corbyn\u2019s Labour came from 21 points behind to finish with a deficit of just 2.4%. That gap, of course, produced the hung parliament. It is debatable too, who has had the worst start this time. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s callous initial remarks about the Grenfell Tower victims and the enforced resignation of Alun Cairns as Welsh secretary have been cancelled out by Tom Watson\u2019s departure and the sight of former Labour MP Ian Austin urging voters to back Boris Johnson. Polling averages also lag events by a couple of weeks, so any genuine movement in sentiment takes a while to show. So in this campaign, the trend lines have been a little different: the Conservatives are up three points, Labour up two. Losing out are the Lib Dems, down two and the Brexit party, down one. Other movements and roundings account for the remaining differences. So a little over a week into the campaign, there is one tentative trend: a shift in support towards the two big parties, which is yet to be sustained for long enough to count as a consequential shift. Above all, at least at this point, there is an election-winning Tory lead. What about constituency polls \u2013 is there not a different story? Although theoretically attractive, polling in individual constituencies is not only expensive to conduct but notoriously unreliable. Nonetheless, the Lib Dems commissioned a string of polls from Survation in an attempt to show their position as positively as possible. They purport to show the Lib Dems leading in Labour held Cambridge and Portsmouth South \u2013 with a 15- or 16-point swing from Corbyn\u2019s party \u2013 and taking a seat from the Tories in South Cambridgeshire, although that was where Heidi Allen had been expected to stand for the party. But pollsters such as Martin Boon, who founded Deltapoll, warn that there is a \u201cdisconnect between these results and the national picture\u201d because they suggest the Lib Dems doing far better locally that national projections suggest. What about regional polls \u2013 can they be more revealing? Regional polls can be particularly helpful in capturing variations at an easily understood level and are worth keeping an eye on. Two interesting regional polls from YouGov (a firm that is showing a big Tory lead nationally) have already emerged. The first, in London, records that Labour still leads with 39%, but down 16 points on the 2017 general election; the Conservatives are at 29%, down four points, and the Lib Dems up 10 points to 19%, potentially helping Jo Swinson\u2019s party take seats in south-west London. Labour gains in 2017 such as Battersea and Kensington are at risk, and the party misses out on key seats it will have hoped to gain. Finally, a poll in Wales for ITV showed that Labour had staged a mini-recovery to retake the lead, at 29%, making a gain of four points from mid-October. But Corbyn\u2019s party is still 20 points down from its 2017 general election result there, and Prof Roger Awan-Scully has forecast that Labour would lose 10 seats out of 28 held, with the Conservatives picking up nine and the Lib Dems one. So far, the regional picture mirrors the national one.",

In 2002, Q magazine named it the greatest rock\u2019n\u2019roll photo of all time, capturing the ultimate moment: total loss of control. Yet at the time, Smith had railed against it. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s completely out of focus, it won\u2019t work!\u2019 But Joe wouldn\u2019t have it. He said, \u2018That one <em>is</em> the photo.\u2019 So I thought, \u2018OK, I\u2019m not going to argue. It\u2019s your bloody album, get on with it.\u201d</p> <p>Smith thinks its enduring appeal is down to the feeling of \u201cadolescent angst\u201d it captured. \u201cIt could be anybody when they lose their rag,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m pleased I took it, but it\u2019s a bit of a weight around my neck. It keeps coming back to whack me on the back of the head \u2013 nicely in some instances, but aggravatingly in others.\u201d</p> <p>Smith is in her London office, which doubles as a secondhand bookstore. It\u2019s part of an old converted railway station, the now defunct Osterley and Spring Grove tube stop on the Piccadilly line. Downstairs, you can still see the deserted platform. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for ever,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just really nice and quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Smith isn\u2019t a fan of interviews but she\u2019s speaking because it is now 40 years since the Clash released London Calling, and the Museum of London is hosting an exhibition, centred on Smith\u2019s photos. One of the most prolific rock photographers of the past half-century, Smith has shot everyone from Bowie to Blondie, the Rolling Stones to the Stone Roses, but she rarely exhibits her work. She doesn\u2019t see the point. \u201cThey\u2019re a faff to do,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019s too much ego involved.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c53d8db4e5f7202032607eaca0670bd7976f32a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c53d8db4e5f7202032607eaca0670bd7976f32a0/55_61_2821_4150/680.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Just a quiet day\u2019 \u2026 guitarist Mick Jones in New York, 1979.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Just a quiet day\u2019 \u2026 guitarist Mick Jones in New York, 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pennie Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But she made an exception for the Clash. \u201cPaul, Mick, Tops and me are all big history nuts,\u201d she says. Tops is drummer Topper Headon, who was given that first name by the band due to his resemblance to Mickey the Monkey in the Topper comic. In fact, Smith talks about the Clash as if they\u2019re her brothers: for a rollercoaster seven years, that\u2019s how it felt. \u201cWe had the same brain set,\u201d she says. When Strummer died suddenly in 2002, Smith was one of the first people to be called. \u201cIt was just horrible,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>Smith doesn\u2019t want to talk about that and discussing her work isn\u2019t something she feels comfortable with either. One of the reasons she\u2019s got on so well with bands, she says, is because she doesn\u2019t talk much. She doesn\u2019t tell tales. But she does take me back to the beginning: the Clash playing the Royal College of Art in London.</p> <p>It was November 1976 and Smith was 27. As a freelance photographer working for the NME, she\u2019d been asked to cover the gig. She remembers having flu and not feeling up to it. Something made her change her mind, she says \u2013 instinct perhaps. So she turned up \u2013 snivelling \u2013 at the band\u2019s dressing room, took photos for 10 minutes, then beat it. She didn\u2019t bother with the gig.</p> <p>Flu or no flu, that was Smith\u2019s trademark. She was never particularly into rock music, still isn\u2019t. What she liked to capture \u2013 ironically, when you think of her most famous shot \u2013 were \u201cthe quiet moments away from the stage\u201d.

Smith always used black and white but, at the singer\u2019s request, shot a roll of colour. Morrissey complained he didn\u2019t like the images because \u201cit looked like he was wearing too much make up\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Pennie Smith was standing less than six feet away when Paul Simonon, bass-player with the Clash, smashed his guitar to pieces on stage at the Palladium in New York. She\u2019d been on the road with the band for two weeks, photographing their first US tour, but she\u2019d always stayed on the other side of the stage, next to lead guitarist Mick Jones. That night, to mix it up, she switched sides and remembers Simonon suddenly spinning toward her. \u201cHe was in a really bad mood,\u201d she says, \u201cand that wasn\u2019t like him.\u201d She took a step back to get a better focus with her 35mm Pentax \u2013 and then all hell broke loose. Simonon, seething, raised his Fender Precision like an axe, turned his back to singer Joe Strummer, and brought it crashing down. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a choice to take the shot,\u201d Smith says. \u201cMy finger just went off.\u201d The photograph immortalised Simonon\u2019s rage in grainy black and white. It was an emotional response, he later said, to a stiff New York audience that sat all night in their seats and didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou can\u2019t really tell it\u2019s Paul,\u201d says Smith. \u201cBut I guess that\u2019s the point.\u201d On the tour bus the next day, Strummer chose the image for the cover of London Calling, the 1979 album that was to prove the Clash\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 an exuberant outcry that is still regarded as one of the greatest, most influential albums of all time. Its slick mix of punk, reggae, blues and rockabilly \u2013 with lyrics Strummer rarely bettered \u2013 has been cited by everyone from U2 to Springsteen, Nirvana to the Beastie Boys, as a seminal moment. \u201cThey\u2019re the band that changed everything,\u201d Chuck D recently said, revealing that Public Enemy set out to be a rap equivalent of the Clash. Smith\u2019s image became an iconic snapshot of the era \u2013 and of something larger. In 2002, Q magazine named it the greatest rock\u2019n\u2019roll photo of all time, capturing the ultimate moment: total loss of control. Yet at the time, Smith had railed against it. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s completely out of focus, it won\u2019t work!\u2019 But Joe wouldn\u2019t have it. He said, \u2018That one is the photo.\u2019 So I thought, \u2018OK, I\u2019m not going to argue. It\u2019s your bloody album, get on with it.\u201d Smith thinks its enduring appeal is down to the feeling of \u201cadolescent angst\u201d it captured. \u201cIt could be anybody when they lose their rag,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m pleased I took it, but it\u2019s a bit of a weight around my neck. It keeps coming back to whack me on the back of the head \u2013 nicely in some instances, but aggravatingly in others.\u201d Smith is in her London office, which doubles as a secondhand bookstore. It\u2019s part of an old converted railway station, the now defunct Osterley and Spring Grove tube stop on the Piccadilly line. Downstairs, you can still see the deserted platform. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for ever,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just really nice and quiet.\u201d Smith isn\u2019t a fan of interviews but she\u2019s speaking because it is now 40 years since the Clash released London Calling, and the Museum of London is hosting an exhibition, centred on Smith\u2019s photos. One of the most prolific rock photographers of the past half-century, Smith has shot everyone from Bowie to Blondie, the Rolling Stones to the Stone Roses, but she rarely exhibits her work. She doesn\u2019t see the point. \u201cThey\u2019re a faff to do,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019s too much ego involved.\u201d But she made an exception for the Clash. \u201cPaul, Mick, Tops and me are all big history nuts,\u201d she says. Tops is drummer Topper Headon, who was given that first name by the band due to his resemblance to Mickey the Monkey in the Topper comic. In fact, Smith talks about the Clash as if they\u2019re her brothers: for a rollercoaster seven years, that\u2019s how it felt. \u201cWe had the same brain set,\u201d she says. When Strummer died suddenly in 2002, Smith was one of the first people to be called. \u201cIt was just horrible,\u201d she recalls. Smith doesn\u2019t want to talk about that and discussing her work isn\u2019t something she feels comfortable with either. One of the reasons she\u2019s got on so well with bands, she says, is because she doesn\u2019t talk much. She doesn\u2019t tell tales. But she does take me back to the beginning: the Clash playing the Royal College of Art in London. It was November 1976 and Smith was 27. As a freelance photographer working for the NME, she\u2019d been asked to cover the gig. She remembers having flu and not feeling up to it. Something made her change her mind, she says \u2013 instinct perhaps. So she turned up \u2013 snivelling \u2013 at the band\u2019s dressing room, took photos for 10 minutes, then beat it. She didn\u2019t bother with the gig. Flu or no flu, that was Smith\u2019s trademark. She was never particularly into rock music, still isn\u2019t. What she liked to capture \u2013 ironically, when you think of her most famous shot \u2013 were \u201cthe quiet moments away from the stage\u201d. Her first job at the NME was a photoshoot of Alice Cooper. Not only did she know nothing about \u201cthe godfather of shock rock\u201d, she had never even opened a music paper. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that bands did formal lineups like football teams,\u201d she says. Instead, she shot Cooper drinking a cup of tea and the NME loved it, printing the pictures in full, uncropped. It chimed with a new era in the paper\u2019s history and Smith was at its heart. \u201cEveryone was told to go out on the streets, hunt down what moved them, and write about it, take pictures of it. It didn\u2019t pay very well, but we loved it. Everybody was getting a buzz off everything.\u201d She was soon doing the cover shots almost every week. The Clash wanted to meet her: she thinks the Royal College of Art gig was a sort of test. Straight after it, Strummer rang and asked if she\u2019d take more pictures. \u201cI\u2019d passed,\u201d she says. Smith photographed the band regularly after that, and they gelled in a way she had never experienced with other groups. She was also working with the Jam and, at one point, they asked her to go full-time. But Smith found Paul Weller and his band too self-conscious in front of a camera. They were like stiff cardboard cutouts posing at a wedding. \u201cThey stood like Englishmen,\u201d she says, \u201cshoulder to shoulder in every photo.\u201d The Clash, by contrast, were \u201ctactile\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Food is at the heart of Spanish culture. From social life to business deals, everything revolves around food \u2013 above all, lunch. How did Mariano Rajoy, then prime minister, react last year when faced with an unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/spanish-socialists-file-no-confidence-motion-against-mariano-rajoy-gurtel\">vote of no confidence</a>? He went to lunch. For eight hours. </p> <p>The three-course <em>men\u00fa del d\u00eda</em> has been the cornerstone of Spanish cuisine and social life for generations. Consequently, the restaurants serving these men\u00fas \u2013 generally low on aesthetics and high on value for money \u2013 have been a feature of the urban landscape. Now, though, their existence is threatened by a combination of rising rents, changing tastes and working hours, tourism and gentrification.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People see a place being fixed up and they think, ah, globalisation, the enemy</p> <footer> <cite>Mart\u00edn Presumido</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fixed-price <em>men\u00fa del d\u00eda</em> (menu of the day) as we know it was introduced in the mid-1960s as the <em>men\u00fa tur\u00edstico</em> (tourist menu) to ensure an affordable meal was within reach of all Spaniards. All of these restaurants had to offer one until the law changed in 2010.</p> <p>These family-run establishments soon became a fixture for millions of Spaniards who had long days, typically working from 9am to 2pm and 4pm to 7.30pm, but who couldn\u2019t go home for lunch.</p> <p>But now working life has changed. Fewer people split the work day with a two-hour break for lunch. \u201cPeople are realising that an hour is long enough for lunch,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Luis Casero, president of the National Commission for the Rationalisation of Spanish Schedules, which campaigns against the long working day, seen by many as outmoded and inimical to work-family balance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa42938dc9488d9bf028955cd0529f7e15117dd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa42938dc9488d9bf028955cd0529f7e15117dd6/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Esteve sisters, Cristina, Gloria and Gemma, who run Bar Cervantes, which has survived by not changing at all.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Esteve sisters, Cristina, Gloria and Gemma, who run Bar Cervantes, which has survived by not changing at all.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Burgen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Furthermore, a decreasing percentage of Spaniards have full-time jobs, or any job at all. <a href=\"https://www.ccoo.es//11aacaa1507b3d2dedb16621fe6d872a000001.pdf\">Trade unions estimate that</a> 33% of jobs created since 2012 have been temporary, and a high proportion are also part-time.

      "bodyText": "Food is at the heart of Spanish culture. From social life to business deals, everything revolves around food \u2013 above all, lunch. How did Mariano Rajoy, then prime minister, react last year when faced with an unprecedented vote of no confidence? He went to lunch. For eight hours. The three-course men\u00fa del d\u00eda has been the cornerstone of Spanish cuisine and social life for generations. Consequently, the restaurants serving these men\u00fas \u2013 generally low on aesthetics and high on value for money \u2013 have been a feature of the urban landscape. Now, though, their existence is threatened by a combination of rising rents, changing tastes and working hours, tourism and gentrification. The fixed-price men\u00fa del d\u00eda (menu of the day) as we know it was introduced in the mid-1960s as the men\u00fa tur\u00edstico (tourist menu) to ensure an affordable meal was within reach of all Spaniards. All of these restaurants had to offer one until the law changed in 2010. These family-run establishments soon became a fixture for millions of Spaniards who had long days, typically working from 9am to 2pm and 4pm to 7.30pm, but who couldn\u2019t go home for lunch. But now working life has changed. Fewer people split the work day with a two-hour break for lunch. \u201cPeople are realising that an hour is long enough for lunch,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Luis Casero, president of the National Commission for the Rationalisation of Spanish Schedules, which campaigns against the long working day, seen by many as outmoded and inimical to work-family balance. Furthermore, a decreasing percentage of Spaniards have full-time jobs, or any job at all. Trade unions estimate that 33% of jobs created since 2012 have been temporary, and a high proportion are also part-time. Deliveroo riders and others in the gig economy do not get paid lunch breaks. And then there\u2019s the price. When the euro was introduced in 2002 a typical men\u00fa cost 1,000 pesetas, or \u20ac6. This quickly rose to \u20ac10 and now stands at \u20ac12-14, a rise of 100%. Fighting back Restaurants serving men\u00fas del d\u00eda often make just enough to maintain the families that run them \u2013 the catering equivalent of subsistence farming. When owners retire the next generation can be reluctant to take over. All over Spanish cities, what was once a Casa Pedro or Restaurante Carmen might be reborn as a kebab shop or, in tourist areas, a tapas bar. \u201cThere are certainly fewer men\u00fas del d\u00eda in major Spanish cities than there were 15 years ago, but then again there are fewer Spanish and Catalan restaurants,\u201d says Sally Davies, author of the Time Out guides to Madrid and Barcelona. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge proliferation of Asian and South American restaurants, in particular, and those are less likely to honour the men\u00fa tradition.\u201d Twenty years ago a vegetarian risked dying of hunger in Spain; now many restaurants offer vegetarian or even vegan options. Sushi and kebabs arrived about 15 years ago, ramen within the last five and poke bol less than two years ago. While Michelin-starred chefs such as Ferran Adri\u00e0 and the Roca brothers have thrust Spain into the gastronomic limelight, it is competition from below that threatens the men\u00fa. Some are fighting back. When the owner of El Palentino, a classic bar de comidas in the Madrid barrio of Malasa\u00f1a, retired, no one in the family wanted to take it on. Restaurateur Mart\u00edn Presumido took over and refurbished the bar-restaurant to offer more upmarket food and its own line of liqueurs. The clientele has changed, with the previous mix of workers and those on their way out clubbing replaced by a more hip crowd. While some complain it has lost its charm, Presumido insists its spirit remains intact. \u201cPeople see changes in a place like this as an attack on their lifestyle,\u201d he says. \u201cEl Palentino hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 what\u2019s changed is people\u2019s perception. People see a place being fixed up and they think, ah, globalisation, the enemy.\u201d While Presumido insists the restaurant business in Madrid is resisting globalisation, Narciso Bermejo, who designed El Palentino\u2019s liqueurs and has many years of experience in the business in Madrid and Barcelona, says that money rules.

I\u2019ve never seen so many long shots of a man rubbing his temples with a look of horror on his face set to eerie music. Their film is a moody plunge into the anguish of the artistic process.</p> <p>One might read that and think, hey, come on, there are people out there in the world with <em>real</em> problems, why should I care that a septuagenarian film director is losing his mojo? By the end of this movie you\u2019ll realize that Gilliam\u2019s struggles are humanity\u2019s struggles. One doesn\u2019t need to have familiarity with motion picture production to understand the fears and frustration of trying to <em>accomplish </em>something. His momentary giggles of glee are bursts of oxygen. His (many) hurled F-bombs, growls and facepalms are the terror we all want to deny.</p> <p>For someone who works in fantasy, Gilliam has his feet surprisingly on the ground. He is extremely self-aware of how he is perceived, and is marinated in self-doubt. He must make this movie if he is to keep his sanity, but he knows that he will never make it as good as it is in his mind. No matter what he does, he says, it will be a disappointment.</p> <p>It\u2019s rather tragic because, let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s right. This is one of those curious examples of the movie <em>about</em> the movie is more dramatic and more gripping than the movie itself. It hurts me to say that; I already had tremendous respect for Gilliam watching this. After watching him fight for his passions, I absolutely love him.</p> <p>There are, of course, a handful of critics who really love The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. If nothing else, this film has inspired me to see it a second time. Never stop dreaming.</p> <ul> <li><p>He Dreams of Giants is showing at the DOC NYC festival and will be released in 2020</p></li> </ul>",

One might read that and think, hey, come on, there are people out there in the world with real problems, why should I care that a septuagenarian film director is losing his mojo? By the end of this movie you\u2019ll realize that Gilliam\u2019s struggles are humanity\u2019s struggles. One doesn\u2019t need to have familiarity with motion picture production to understand the fears and frustration of trying to accomplish something. His momentary giggles of glee are bursts of oxygen. His (many) hurled F-bombs, growls and facepalms are the terror we all want to deny. For someone who works in fantasy, Gilliam has his feet surprisingly on the ground. He is extremely self-aware of how he is perceived, and is marinated in self-doubt. He must make this movie if he is to keep his sanity, but he knows that he will never make it as good as it is in his mind. No matter what he does, he says, it will be a disappointment. It\u2019s rather tragic because, let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s right. This is one of those curious examples of the movie about the movie is more dramatic and more gripping than the movie itself. It hurts me to say that; I already had tremendous respect for Gilliam watching this. After watching him fight for his passions, I absolutely love him. There are, of course, a handful of critics who really love The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. If nothing else, this film has inspired me to see it a second time. Never stop dreaming. He Dreams of Giants is showing at the DOC NYC festival and will be released in 2020",

      "body": "<p>Eva Longoria is almost certainly not who you think she is. Like many actors, she is known for one particular role \u2013 in her case, the flighty, fabulous former model Gabrielle Solis, the character she played in the TV comedy-drama Desperate Housewives. Filthy rich, with a penchant for topless gardeners and designer labels, Gaby filled the void left by Sex and the City in the early 2000s.</p> <p>While playing her, Longoria was busy studying for her masters, writing a thesis about the necessity of having more Latinas \u2013 women of Latin American descent \u2013 in careers in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) in the US. She is deeply political, outspoken and now successful behind the camera, scheduled to direct two feature films next year. This is the first time a Latina will be the director of two major studio films, and she fought off stiff competition from almost 30 other directors to make one of them, Flamin\u2019 Hot, a biopic of the Mexican businessman behind Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos. \u201cYou have to go in the room triple prepared,\u201d she says, \u201cmore educated on the subject, and with more bells and whistles than any man.\u201d</p> <p>We meet at the Beverly Hills mansion that Longoria, 44, shares with her third husband, the Mexican media mogul Jos\u00e9 Bast\u00f3n and their one-year-old son, Santiago. Aside from Desperate Housewives, Longoria is known for starring in a handful of unremarkable films such as the romcoms Over Her Dead Body (2008) and Overboard (2018) and adverts for L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Sheba. But she says her life\u2019s work revolves around some of the themes she explored in her masters.</p> <p>Longoria\u2019s mother was a special education teacher, her sister has special needs, and her earliest memory is of volunteering, aged four, at the Special Olympics. \u201cI remember being a \u2018hugger\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was a job \u2013 and I was like: \u2018This is the best job in the world.\u2019\u201d She traces her interest in philanthropy to her family background and, in 2012, the year Desperate Housewives finished, launched a foundation that offers mentoring, scholarships and business training to Latinas.</p> <p>As a Mexican-American, growing up in Texas, Longoria faced specific barriers. \u201cColourism is in a lot of cultures,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, this myth that the lighter you are, the better you are.\u201d As a child, she was significantly darker than her three sisters. \u201cI had dark hair, dark skin and dark eyes. I didn\u2019t look like anybody in my family.\u201d</p> <p>Did she feel discriminated against? \u201cI remember climbing on the school bus and seeing a sea of blond people and somebody whispering: \u2018She\u2019s Mexican.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Well, I\u2019m American, I don\u2019t know what that means,\u2019 but I knew it was intended to be negative. I was almost leaning into my heritage after that, because I wanted to be proud of it and everything that my culture represents.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder whether she thinks the situation in the US is better or worse today. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was progress and change in our country and then all of that was dismantled with the current administration. I feel like every time you have two steps forward, you have two steps back. There is not a lot of opportunity for disenfranchised communities today.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c70b9c2520eb77543811b01bf77cca6367e55644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c70b9c2520eb77543811b01bf77cca6367e55644/0_0_3000_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Longoria at the Climate Change and Economic Opportunity panel at Florida University in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Longoria at the Climate Change and Economic Opportunity panel at Florida University in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In August, 22 people were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso \u2013 the deadliest attack on Latinos in recent US history. Longoria was part of the You Are Not Alone campaign, a love letter to the Latino community signed by 250 entertainment and industry leaders, including Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin. When she was given an award for this work, she quipped: \u201cAs a ninth generation \u2018Texican\u2019, I\u2019m more American than Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scary time for Latinos in the United States because we\u2019re being villainised,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of my philanthropic efforts are at the border, trying to make sure families are not separated, babies are reunited with their mothers and children aren\u2019t put in cages. The family separation policies are horrendous, so that\u2019s where I want to put more focus.\u201d</p> <p>Longoria says she went into a \u201cdepression\u201d when Trump was first elected in 2016. \u201cI did put my head in the sand. I took a break for about two years. But you can\u2019t give up. So when the mid-terms came along, I participated in helping people get elected to change the way our government looks. It should reflect reality, which is people of colour and women. Making sure it reflects society is going to be my lifelong struggle.\u201d</p> <p>She is worried about next year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cThe stakes are really high. Globally, the level of intolerance has risen everywhere \u2026 I think the most powerful part of our democracy is the citizen. If we can aggregate enough citizens who love as strongly as those who are spewing hate, we have a chance.\u201d</p> <p>Who is she backing? \u201cNobody yet, because we\u2019re in the primaries and there are 180 people in the primaries right now,\u201d she says, exaggerating just a little. \u201cBut I will back whoever the Democratic nominee is, for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Longoria\u2019s time is so taken up with politics, I wonder if she has considered getting more involved. She looks at me blankly. \u201cI am involved.\u201d What about running for Congress? \u201cPeople think that in order to create change, you have to be a politician,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s a myth. You can be anybody. You can be a concerned mother and create significant change. Politicians get their hands tied with the bureaucracy of what comes with being a politician as opposed to speaking their truth and their mind and not being beholden to special interests.\u201d</p> <p>When she was working as an actor, she says, she realised she was not reaching her full potential. \u201cI would say my lines and leave. I didn\u2019t get a say in who my co-star was, pick the words coming out of my mouth or what take they were going to use. That\u2019s why I became a producer \u2013 to have control of the final product.\u201d</p> <p>She notes that her acting experience was pretty typical \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not like anybody was abusive\u201d \u2013 and says she still loves being an actor. But over the past decade, her attention has turned increasingly towards directing and producing. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m an actor-turned-director and producer, but I think I was always a director/producer who happened to fall into acting. I\u2019ve been directing TV for 10 years.\u201d Her work includes episodes of the hit comedies Jane the Virgin and Black-ish, and she has produced two documentaries about agricultural labour, The Harvest (2010) and Food Chains (2014).</p> <p>In Desperate Housewives, Longoria starred alongside Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman and Marcia Cross, and when the show was at the height of its success, rumours abounded of behind-the-scenes rivalry and bullying. Longoria recently referred to an unnamed co-worker in a letter of support she wrote for Huffman when Huffman became embroiled in the college admissions scandal in the US, eventually convicted for paying thousands of dollars to boost her daughter\u2019s university admission score.</p> <p>\u201cI dreaded the days I had to work with that person because it was pure torture,\u201d wrote Longoria, \u201cuntil one day, Felicity told the bully \u2018enough\u2019 and it all stopped. Felicity could feel that I was riddled with anxiety even though I never complained or mentioned the abuse to anyone.\u201d The day we meet, Huffman has been released from prison after serving 11 days of her 14-day sentence, but Longoria won\u2019t be pressed on the matter. \u201cYou can ask,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I won\u2019t answer.\u201d</p> <p>Longoria is a founding member of Time\u2019s Up, formed in January 2018 in response to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the growing strength of the #MeToo movement; more than $22m (\u00a317m) has been raised for its legal defence fund. \u201cThe greatest success of Time\u2019s Up is creating a global conversation about inequality in the workplace,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big accomplishment to bring it out of the shadows and have somebody in France go: \u2018I thought that was just here. That\u2019s happening in Brazil?\u2019 And someone in Brazil going: \u2018That\u2019s happening in the United States?\u2019\u201d Longoria is due to produce, direct and star in the film 24/7 alongside Kerry Washington next year, a workplace comedy set in a post-Time\u2019s Up world, \u201cmaking fun at the expense of men, finally,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc807fa8dbc1422b46cc24ca26c46a0002e1cbc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc807fa8dbc1422b46cc24ca26c46a0002e1cbc9/0_91_3184_1910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Longoria with Natalie Portman at the Women\u2019s March in Los Angeles in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Longoria with Natalie Portman at the Women\u2019s March in Los Angeles in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask if she feels there has been significant change when it comes to sexual harassment and discrimination in the past few years. \u201cIn the US, we have a case against McDonald\u2019s, a case against the FBI, we just changed the state laws in New York City ... so, yeah, we have so many accomplishments to applaud and it\u2019s due to the work of so many women and all of the survivors who were brave enough to come forward.\u201d</p> <p>Women face a lot of unconscious bias in Hollywood, she says. \u201cThere are so many talented females, but when looking [to fill] positions, studios will give you Tom, Dick and Harry.

They\u2019re not the first names they serve up.\u201d She hopes to make a difference as a producer and director. \u201cI always start filling up slots with women and people of colour first, then if anything\u2019s left, we will look elsewhere,\u201d she says. \u201cSo instead of unconsciously ignoring women or people of colour, I\u2019m consciously hiring them.\u201d She says she pitched and pitched for the job directing Flamin\u2019 Hot, \u201cand after the fifth callback they were going to make their decision and my agent says: \u2018What are you most nervous about?\u2019 I said: \u2018That I\u2019m going to get it, and then I\u2019m going to have to do everything I promised, because I promised a lot of things in that room.\u201d Eva Longoria will be hosting her annual Eva Longoria Foundation dinner gala honouring American Ferrera and Howard G.

Launching the 2018 index at the Heritage Foundation, Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, <a href=\"https://www.myheritage.org/news/secretary-of-commerce-visits-heritage/\" title=\"\">Wilbur Ross, expressed hope</a> that environmental deregulation and corporate tax cuts would reverse America\u2019s decline in the ranking. Where did this way of framing the world come from?</p> <p>The idea for the economic freedom index was born in 1984, after a discussion of Orwell\u2019s 1984 at a meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society \u2013 an exclusive debating club of academics, policymakers, thinktankers and business leaders formed by Friedrich Hayek in 1947 to oppose the rise of communism in the east and social democracy in the west. The historian Paul Johnson argued that Orwell\u2019s predictions had not come true; Michael Walker of the Vancouver-based Fraser Institute countered that perhaps they had. High taxes, obligatory social security numbers and public transparency about political contributions suggested we might be closer to Orwellian dystopia than we thought.</p> <p>Walker saw this debate as the unfinished business of Milton Friedman\u2019s 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, which had suggested that political liberty relied on market freedom but had not proved it scientifically. Friedman was at the meeting, and, with his wife and co-author, Rose, agreed to help host a series of workshops on the challenge of measuring economic freedom.</p> <p>The Friedmans gathered a crowd of luminaries, including Nobel prize winner Douglass North and The Bell Curve co-author Charles Murray, to figure out whether something as nebulous as freedom could be quantified and ranked. They ended up with a series of indicators, measuring the stability of currency; the right of citizens to own bank accounts in foreign countries and foreign currencies; the level of government spending and government-owned enterprise; and, crucially, the rate of individual and corporate taxation.</p> <p>When Walker\u2019s Fraser Institute published its first index in 1996 with a foreword from Friedman, there were some surprises. According to its historical overview, the second freest economy in the world in 1975 was Honduras, a military dictatorship. For the next year, another dictatorship, Guatemala, was in the top five. These were no anomalies. They expressed a basic truth about the indexes. The definition of freedom they used meant that democracy was a moot point, monetary stability was paramount and any expansion of social services would lead to a fall in the rankings. Taxation was theft, pure and simple, and austerity was the only path to the top.</p> <p>\u201cThe \u2018right\u2019 to food, clothing, medical services, housing or a minimal income level,\u201d the authors wrote, was nothing less than \u201c\u2018forced labor\u2019 requirements [imposed] on others.\u201d The director of the index translated the vision into policy advice a few years later, writing in a public memo to the Canadian prime minister that poverty could be eliminated through a simple solution: \u201cEnd welfare. Reinstitute poorhouses and homes for unwed mothers.\u201d</p> <p>Not content with mere economics, the Fraser Institute joined up with the Cato Institute in 2015 to publish the first global index of \u201chuman freedom\u201d. They included all of the earlier economic indicators and supplemented them with measurements of civil liberty, rights to association and free expression, alongside dozens of others \u2013 but left out multiparty elections and universal suffrage. The authors noted specifically that they excluded political freedom and democracy from the index \u2013 and Hong Kong topped the list again.</p> <p>What was going on? One answer is that the project of measuring economic freedom had made some of its authors question their prior assumptions about the natural relationship between capitalism and democracy. By the 1990s, Friedman, who had previously seen the two as mutually reinforcing, was singing a different tune. As he said in an interview in 1988: \u201cI believe a relatively free economy is a necessary condition for freedom. But there is evidence that a democratic society, once established, destroys a free economy.\u201d An enfranchised people tended to use their votes to pressure politicians into more social spending, clogging the arteries of free exchange.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/neoliberalism-is-killing-our-love-lives\">Neoliberalism is killing our love lives | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the workshops devoted to creating the indexes, Friedman cited the example of Hong Kong as evidence for the truth of this proposition, saying: \u201cThere is almost no doubt that if you had political freedom in Hong Kong you would have much less economic and civil freedom than you do as a result of an authoritarian government.\u201d</p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s former chief executive, CY Leung, agreed. During the \u201cumbrella revolution\u201d protests of 2014 he was asked why suffrage could not be expanded. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/world/asia/leung-chun-ying-hong-kong-china-protests.html\" title=\"\">His matter-of-fact response</a> was that this would increase the power of the poor and lead to \u201cthe kind of politics\u201d that favour the expansion of the welfare state instead of business-friendly policies. For him, the tradeoff between economic and political freedom was not buried in an index. It was as clear as day.</p> <p>Economic freedom rankings exist inside nations, too. Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer, two of Trump\u2019s economic advisers, created comparable league tables for American states \u2013 which have <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-laffer-rich-states-20190424-story.html\" title=\"\">proved drastically unhelpful</a> in predicting economic success. The system has been rolled out by the Cato Institute <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/economic-freedom-states-india\" title=\"\">in India, too</a>, encouraging a deregulatory race to the bottom within national borders as well as across them. One of the authors of the report, Bibek Debroy, now chairs the Economic Advisory Council to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi.</p> <p>Pinochet, Thatcher and Reagan may be dead. But economic freedom indexes carry the neoliberal banner by deeming the goals of social justice forever illegitimate and pushing states to regard themselves solely as guardians of economic power. Stephen Moore, who was a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/business/stephen-moore-fed.html\" title=\"\">favourite earlier this year</a> for Trump\u2019s appointment to the Federal Reserve Board, put the matter simply. \u201cCapitalism is a lot more important than democracy,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not even a big believer in democracy.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary made much the same argument two weeks ago in London, when he cited the city\u2019s top economic freedom ranking and <a href=\"https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201910/30/P2019103000117.htm\" title=\"\">reassured his audience</a> that \u201calongside the protests, the business of business rolls on, unabated\u201d.</p> <p>By colour-coding nations, celebrating victors on glossy paper stock and giving high-ranking countries a reason to celebrate at banquets and balls, the indexes help perpetuate the idea that economics must be protected from the excesses of politics \u2013 to the point that an authoritarian government that protects free markets is preferable to a democratic one that redesigns them. At a time when the casting of ballots may lead to changes that threaten the freedom that capital has long enjoyed, the disposability of democracy in the vision of the index is what haunts us, from Santiago to the South China Sea to Washington DC.</p> <p>\u2022 Quinn Slobodian is a historian and author of Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism </p>",

They ended up with a series of indicators, measuring the stability of currency; the right of citizens to own bank accounts in foreign countries and foreign currencies; the level of government spending and government-owned enterprise; and, crucially, the rate of individual and corporate taxation. When Walker\u2019s Fraser Institute published its first index in 1996 with a foreword from Friedman, there were some surprises. According to its historical overview, the second freest economy in the world in 1975 was Honduras, a military dictatorship. For the next year, another dictatorship, Guatemala, was in the top five. These were no anomalies. They expressed a basic truth about the indexes. The definition of freedom they used meant that democracy was a moot point, monetary stability was paramount and any expansion of social services would lead to a fall in the rankings. Taxation was theft, pure and simple, and austerity was the only path to the top. \u201cThe \u2018right\u2019 to food, clothing, medical services, housing or a minimal income level,\u201d the authors wrote, was nothing less than \u201c\u2018forced labor\u2019 requirements [imposed] on others.\u201d The director of the index translated the vision into policy advice a few years later, writing in a public memo to the Canadian prime minister that poverty could be eliminated through a simple solution: \u201cEnd welfare. Reinstitute poorhouses and homes for unwed mothers.\u201d Not content with mere economics, the Fraser Institute joined up with the Cato Institute in 2015 to publish the first global index of \u201chuman freedom\u201d. They included all of the earlier economic indicators and supplemented them with measurements of civil liberty, rights to association and free expression, alongside dozens of others \u2013 but left out multiparty elections and universal suffrage. The authors noted specifically that they excluded political freedom and democracy from the index \u2013 and Hong Kong topped the list again. What was going on? One answer is that the project of measuring economic freedom had made some of its authors question their prior assumptions about the natural relationship between capitalism and democracy. By the 1990s, Friedman, who had previously seen the two as mutually reinforcing, was singing a different tune. As he said in an interview in 1988: \u201cI believe a relatively free economy is a necessary condition for freedom. But there is evidence that a democratic society, once established, destroys a free economy.\u201d An enfranchised people tended to use their votes to pressure politicians into more social spending, clogging the arteries of free exchange. In the workshops devoted to creating the indexes, Friedman cited the example of Hong Kong as evidence for the truth of this proposition, saying: \u201cThere is almost no doubt that if you had political freedom in Hong Kong you would have much less economic and civil freedom than you do as a result of an authoritarian government.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s former chief executive, CY Leung, agreed. During the \u201cumbrella revolution\u201d protests of 2014 he was asked why suffrage could not be expanded. His matter-of-fact response was that this would increase the power of the poor and lead to \u201cthe kind of politics\u201d that favour the expansion of the welfare state instead of business-friendly policies. For him, the tradeoff between economic and political freedom was not buried in an index. It was as clear as day. Economic freedom rankings exist inside nations, too. Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer, two of Trump\u2019s economic advisers, created comparable league tables for American states \u2013 which have proved drastically unhelpful in predicting economic success. The system has been rolled out by the Cato Institute in India, too, encouraging a deregulatory race to the bottom within national borders as well as across them. One of the authors of the report, Bibek Debroy, now chairs the Economic Advisory Council to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. Pinochet, Thatcher and Reagan may be dead. But economic freedom indexes carry the neoliberal banner by deeming the goals of social justice forever illegitimate and pushing states to regard themselves solely as guardians of economic power. Stephen Moore, who was a favourite earlier this year for Trump\u2019s appointment to the Federal Reserve Board, put the matter simply. \u201cCapitalism is a lot more important than democracy,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not even a big believer in democracy.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary made much the same argument two weeks ago in London, when he cited the city\u2019s top economic freedom ranking and reassured his audience that \u201calongside the protests, the business of business rolls on, unabated\u201d. By colour-coding nations, celebrating victors on glossy paper stock and giving high-ranking countries a reason to celebrate at banquets and balls, the indexes help perpetuate the idea that economics must be protected from the excesses of politics \u2013 to the point that an authoritarian government that protects free markets is preferable to a democratic one that redesigns them. At a time when the casting of ballots may lead to changes that threaten the freedom that capital has long enjoyed, the disposability of democracy in the vision of the index is what haunts us, from Santiago to the South China Sea to Washington DC. \u2022 Quinn Slobodian is a historian and author of Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism",

During sunny spells when homes generate more than enough electricity from solar panels they can store the power to use later, or supply the energy system with clean extra power. The homes took part in the trial alongside 150 local businesses, which were prepared to adjust how much energy they used depending on the balance of energy supply and demand on the grid. If wind and solar power output dropped the companies could choose to use less electricity in exchange for a payment from National Grid, or if the local grid had more electricity than it needed the companies could ramp up their energy demand. National Grid already offers to pay firms that own utility-scale batteries to provide a similar service, but the trial is the first time that companies can take part in the same \u201clocal energy market\u201d as the network operator. The market was designed by energy giant Centrica and modelled on the same system used to balance energy markets across Europe. The energy companies believe the trial could help create a nationwide chain of flexible smart grids built around clean energy. Pieter-Jan Mermans, a director at Centrica Business Solutions, described the trial as \u201ca milestone moment for the energy network\u201d after years of research. \u201cImproving grid flexibility benefits everyone from generators to consumers, and these trials represent a major step forward. We are hugely grateful to the householders and businesses across Cornwall who have embraced this trial with open arms,\u201d he said. One local business, The Cornish Ice Company, is using its industrial freezers to act as a battery for the grid. The company can easily cut electricity to its freezers for short periods without affecting temperatures, meaning it can offer spare electricity to either the local grid or the national system operator. \u201cExploring the provision of flexibility through a local energy market is a first for us.\u201d Colm Murphy, a senior manager at National Grid, said. \u201cThe potential is really exciting as we look to unlock more flexible energy resources in the market, and greater cost benefits to consumers,\u201d he added.",

Sovereignty exempts them from a law that restricts marijuana consumption to private residences until 1 July 2021.</p> <p>On that date, Sin City will no doubt host the kitschiest, most glammed-out cannabis party scene in the world. A dispensary with \u201cgalactic scale\u201d, Planet 13, already has a restaurant and cafe space inside its 112,000-sq-ft marijuana superstore near the Las Vegas Strip. But for the next 21 months, this 55-member Southern Paiute band has the pot lounge business all to itself.</p> <p>\u201cWe laughed at first about it. Like, \u2018oh crap, we\u2019re going to be weed dealers?\u2019\u201d said Tso, who served as the tribal council chair for over 10 years. \u201cAfter we got the jokes aside, we started digging into the numbers. It was just a different way to generate revenue for the tribe when we realized we needed to do something to put our people in better situations.</p> <p>\u201cWithin a year and half this is going to compete with our other businesses,\u201d Tso said of NuWu Cannabis Marketplace. \u201cI think we\u2019ve prolonged our tribe by three to four more generations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbf114bfcce887c0a2d02bfc29ad5ae7ec9b379f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf114bfcce887c0a2d02bfc29ad5ae7ec9b379f/0_0_3150_2223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers gather at the NUWU Tasting Room on Saturday 5 October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers gather at the NuWu Tasting Room on Saturday 5 October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Scheid</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He noted that federal assistance for healthcare, education and law enforcement services has \u201cdwindled\u201d since the recession. In fact, a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2018/12-20-Broken-Promises.pdf\">report</a> by the US Commission on Civil Rights titled Broken Promises called the funding status for Indian country \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 560 some odd treaties between the US government and tribes, and none of them have been honored,\u201d Tso said. \u201cBut with this business we\u2019ve created, we\u2019ll balance out some of those shortfalls.\u201d</p> <p>Located in a neighborhood with multiple cemeteries, tow yards and homeless shelters, the Southern Paiutes\u2019 cannabis lounge is off the beaten path. But one afternoon last month, Jessica, a Las Vegas local, celebrated her 26th birthday by inhaling smoke from a dab rig that the bartender lit for her.</p> <p>Dan, an accountant from Denver, ordered a bong hit. \u201cThis would be a great place to bring my folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey love to come to Vegas and throw convention out the window.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally, NuWu has to cut people off. But overall the experiment has gone so well that two to three other Native American tribes visit each week to learn about the industry some are calling \u201cthe new new buffalo\u201d, a reference to the term used for casinos when the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act passed in 1988.</p> <p>In a city saturated with gambling, where even laundromats and grocery stores have slot machines, the Las Vegas Paiutes never saw the casino business as a viable economic driver. Their main revenue source since 1970 has been a tobacco store that sells tax-free cigarettes.</p> <p>\u201cThe Paiute in an interesting way took advantage of this community that grew around them,\u201d said Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cWhen you go to Las Vegas, you don\u2019t take care of yourself, and casino culture, for locals who worked there, had a similar impact. You\u2019re working all day with people smoking, drinking and sometimes making considerable money. That became hard to resist, and the Paiutes did well financially knowing there were plenty of smokers in this area.\u201d</p> <p>The strength and ingenuity they have used to survive centuries of marginalization has parallels to the Las Vegas Paiutes\u2019 creation story, which states that their ancestors roamed the desert as ants until a great flood forced them to crawl up a mountain and ascend trees. When the water receded, they returned to the ground and became \u201ctwo legs\u201d \u2013 human beings \u2013 and an especially communal, hardworking sort.</p> <p>\u201cWe do get teased because we\u2019re city Indians, but a majority of us know our culture and that\u2019s the point,\u201d said Tso, whose arms are covered in tattoos of traditional Paiute symbols and tools. His community may need NuWu to be that mountain they climb in the event of a perfect storm, since the tobacco shop revenue plateaued years ago, right as healthcare costs rose to levels unmet by federal support.</p> <p>Another challenge they face is a corporate invasion.</p> <p>MedMen and other companies listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange now operate cannabis dispensaries near the Las Vegas strip. According to Dayvid Figler, an attorney who practices cannabis law in Nevada, \u201cThe old school Vegas people, the local cultivators, the mom and pops, etc, who were the sole people in the industry are either all gone or have changed their roles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"272ac362d99a41a780c0caa9bb0644dceb6ebc34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/272ac362d99a41a780c0caa9bb0644dceb6ebc34/0_72_5076_3046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the welcome sign on the Las Vegas Strip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of the welcome sign on the Las Vegas Strip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom a business standpoint it\u2019s a very volatile terrain,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re getting reports of $30m, $45m, $100m for the transfers of marijuana licenses from establishments within Nevada to these corporate entities that have ownership outside the state.\u201d</p> <p>The potential for crony capitalism in the Nevada cannabis industry was highlighted last month with the <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/eastern-european-businessmen-indicted-for-campaign-finance-violations-donated-to-laxalt-sought-nevada-marijuana-licenses\">revelation</a> that associates of Rudy Giuliani arrested in Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine imbroglio unsuccessfully tried to enter the Las Vegas cannabis market through max donations to Republican candidates for governor and attorney general.</p> <p>The Las Vegas resorts, too, have a stake in the future of the cannabis industry. Acting as the ultimate power broker, the resorts killed a cannabis lounge licensing bill in the 2017 legislature arguing that any marijuana use drifting on to their properties might lead federal regulators to revoke their gaming licenses. This year, the resorts convinced the governor to impose a three-year moratorium on cannabis lounges, and the Las Vegas city council banned such businesses from operating within 1,000ft of any casino.</p> <p>\u201cIn reality, [the resorts] didn\u2019t want the competition. They\u2019re hoping in two years marijuana will go legal federally, and then they can bring it inside the hotels,\u201d said the former state senator Tick Segerblom, who wrote the failed cannabis lounge bill.</p> <p>Having co-authored the agreement that allowed the Las Vegas Paiutes into Nevada\u2019s cannabis industry, Segerblom (the rare politician with a pot strain <a href=\"https://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/apr/07/segerblom-haze-new-medical-marijuana-strain-named/\">named after him</a>), took solace in their success. \u201cThe marijuana industry is dominated by white people, but along comes this tribe and just takes over. Of all the things I\u2019ve done, this is the one I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have outdoor grows taking place in northern Nevada on reservations where hundreds of people haven\u2019t had jobs in forever,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a true minority group that\u2019s been screwed over since Christopher Columbus, and it\u2019s just fitting justice. I sleep well at night.\u201d</p>",

A dispensary with \u201cgalactic scale\u201d, Planet 13, already has a restaurant and cafe space inside its 112,000-sq-ft marijuana superstore near the Las Vegas Strip. But for the next 21 months, this 55-member Southern Paiute band has the pot lounge business all to itself. \u201cWe laughed at first about it. Like, \u2018oh crap, we\u2019re going to be weed dealers?\u2019\u201d said Tso, who served as the tribal council chair for over 10 years. \u201cAfter we got the jokes aside, we started digging into the numbers. It was just a different way to generate revenue for the tribe when we realized we needed to do something to put our people in better situations. \u201cWithin a year and half this is going to compete with our other businesses,\u201d Tso said of NuWu Cannabis Marketplace. \u201cI think we\u2019ve prolonged our tribe by three to four more generations.\u201d He noted that federal assistance for healthcare, education and law enforcement services has \u201cdwindled\u201d since the recession. In fact, a 2018 report by the US Commission on Civil Rights titled Broken Promises called the funding status for Indian country \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d. \u201cThere are 560 some odd treaties between the US government and tribes, and none of them have been honored,\u201d Tso said. \u201cBut with this business we\u2019ve created, we\u2019ll balance out some of those shortfalls.\u201d Located in a neighborhood with multiple cemeteries, tow yards and homeless shelters, the Southern Paiutes\u2019 cannabis lounge is off the beaten path. But one afternoon last month, Jessica, a Las Vegas local, celebrated her 26th birthday by inhaling smoke from a dab rig that the bartender lit for her. Dan, an accountant from Denver, ordered a bong hit. \u201cThis would be a great place to bring my folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey love to come to Vegas and throw convention out the window.\u201d Occasionally, NuWu has to cut people off. But overall the experiment has gone so well that two to three other Native American tribes visit each week to learn about the industry some are calling \u201cthe new new buffalo\u201d, a reference to the term used for casinos when the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act passed in 1988. In a city saturated with gambling, where even laundromats and grocery stores have slot machines, the Las Vegas Paiutes never saw the casino business as a viable economic driver. Their main revenue source since 1970 has been a tobacco store that sells tax-free cigarettes. \u201cThe Paiute in an interesting way took advantage of this community that grew around them,\u201d said Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cWhen you go to Las Vegas, you don\u2019t take care of yourself, and casino culture, for locals who worked there, had a similar impact. You\u2019re working all day with people smoking, drinking and sometimes making considerable money. That became hard to resist, and the Paiutes did well financially knowing there were plenty of smokers in this area.\u201d The strength and ingenuity they have used to survive centuries of marginalization has parallels to the Las Vegas Paiutes\u2019 creation story, which states that their ancestors roamed the desert as ants until a great flood forced them to crawl up a mountain and ascend trees. When the water receded, they returned to the ground and became \u201ctwo legs\u201d \u2013 human beings \u2013 and an especially communal, hardworking sort. \u201cWe do get teased because we\u2019re city Indians, but a majority of us know our culture and that\u2019s the point,\u201d said Tso, whose arms are covered in tattoos of traditional Paiute symbols and tools. His community may need NuWu to be that mountain they climb in the event of a perfect storm, since the tobacco shop revenue plateaued years ago, right as healthcare costs rose to levels unmet by federal support. Another challenge they face is a corporate invasion. MedMen and other companies listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange now operate cannabis dispensaries near the Las Vegas strip. According to Dayvid Figler, an attorney who practices cannabis law in Nevada, \u201cThe old school Vegas people, the local cultivators, the mom and pops, etc, who were the sole people in the industry are either all gone or have changed their roles. \u201cFrom a business standpoint it\u2019s a very volatile terrain,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re getting reports of $30m, $45m, $100m for the transfers of marijuana licenses from establishments within Nevada to these corporate entities that have ownership outside the state.\u201d The potential for crony capitalism in the Nevada cannabis industry was highlighted last month with the revelation that associates of Rudy Giuliani arrested in Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine imbroglio unsuccessfully tried to enter the Las Vegas cannabis market through max donations to Republican candidates for governor and attorney general. The Las Vegas resorts, too, have a stake in the future of the cannabis industry. Acting as the ultimate power broker, the resorts killed a cannabis lounge licensing bill in the 2017 legislature arguing that any marijuana use drifting on to their properties might lead federal regulators to revoke their gaming licenses. This year, the resorts convinced the governor to impose a three-year moratorium on cannabis lounges, and the Las Vegas city council banned such businesses from operating within 1,000ft of any casino. \u201cIn reality, [the resorts] didn\u2019t want the competition. They\u2019re hoping in two years marijuana will go legal federally, and then they can bring it inside the hotels,\u201d said the former state senator Tick Segerblom, who wrote the failed cannabis lounge bill. Having co-authored the agreement that allowed the Las Vegas Paiutes into Nevada\u2019s cannabis industry, Segerblom (the rare politician with a pot strain named after him), took solace in their success. \u201cThe marijuana industry is dominated by white people, but along comes this tribe and just takes over. Of all the things I\u2019ve done, this is the one I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d \u201cThey have outdoor grows taking place in northern Nevada on reservations where hundreds of people haven\u2019t had jobs in forever,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a true minority group that\u2019s been screwed over since Christopher Columbus, and it\u2019s just fitting justice. I sleep well at night.\u201d",

Australia\u2019s progress to meeting its already \u201cunambitious\u201d Paris climate targets was third worst, fossil fuel energy was on the rise and policies to tackle high transport emissions and deforestation were also among the worst across the G20 countries. The Brown to Green report, now in its fifth year, takes stock of the performance of G20 countries on climate change adaptation and mitigation across key sectors, and in the finance sector. The chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, an Australian co-author of the report, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAustralia is behind [on] climate action in nearly every dimension. Australia\u2019s emissions are increasing and there\u2019s virtually no policy in place to reduce them.\u201d Some 14 non-governmental groups, thinktanks and research institutes compile the report, funded by the World Bank, the US-based ClimateWorks Foundation and Germany\u2019s environment ministry.

Currently, extreme weather events were costing G20 countries about US$142bn annually. While the report doesn\u2019t provide an overall ranking, Australia appears consistently among the worst performers in the report\u2019s analysis. India and Australia were the only two G20 countries that had not introduced, or were not considering, policies to price greenhouse gas emissions, the report said. Only South Korea and Canada were further away than Australia from meeting the pledges that formed their Paris climate commitments. On deforestation, the report said Australia was the only developed country that was a \u201cdeforestation hotspot\u201d, but had no policies to tackle it. Australia was ranked third worst for transport emissions per capita, and the report found \u201cAustralia, in particular, lacking significant policy\u201d in the transport sector. Per capita emissions from aviation were 53 times higher than India\u2019s. Australia, along with Russia, had no policies to move away from petrol-powered cars, no policies to decarbonise the heavy-duty vehicle sector and no policies to shift people onto public transport, the report said.

When it comes to the medevac laws, minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, the prime minister and others are simply not telling the truth. They continue to misrepresent, and frankly lie, about what this law does. If you listen to minister Dutton, you would believe that he is powerless when it comes to who he can let into the country.</p> <p><strong>Attendee:</strong> Bullshit!</p> <p><strong>KK:</strong> I won\u2019t use the word the gentleman just used because there\u2019s a camera and a microphone in front of me but let me say, loosely translated, he called time; he called that out in a more colourful bit of the language. It is not the case. It is not the case. Of course the minister still has that power. The minister has used that power himself to deny somebody entry into the country based on whether or not they are a security risk.</p> <p><strong>Attendee:</strong> Or au pairs!</p> <p><strong>KK: </strong>The minister does like to let au pairs in as the lady says. However, the minister continues to repeat these lies that somehow medevac is letting people into the country that are a risk. Somehow he is powerless. Somehow doctors, any two doctors anywhere are just going to say anything or do anything and let people come in. Let us be clear about this \u2013 the minister has the power to stop anybody he wants based on security concerns. </p> <p>The doctors who allow people to come to this country because they need medical help are doctors appointed by minister Dutton and what we have seen under medevac is well over 100 people who have been able to get the medical care they needed because doctors appointed by minister Dutton have said these people are sick and they need to come to Australia to get health treatment. That\u2019s what is happening when it comes to medevac \u2013 people who are sick who need help are getting the help that they need. Now, I stand with you. The Australian Labor party stands with you. A huge sway of the crossbench in the Senate stands with you. And we will not stand by quietly; we will stand with you. We will stand up for people who are sick to get the healthcare they need. We will not stand by and watch this government just wave through a repeal of medevac. We will oppose the repeal of medevac. We will oppose it on the floor of the parliament and in every other forum that we can and I am so delighted to be here in this forum, this morning, with all of you who are bearing witness. Thank you for what you\u2019re doing.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T23:31:33.883Z\">at 11.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dc897508f08be4a102e6a9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T23:04:19.016Z\">11.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>(We are still working on a moderator.

I think her language is far worse than calling some of the metropolitan people latte-sippers. They\u2019re drinking milk, comes from a country cow, they\u2019re having coffee beans which no doubt comes from a regional centre. The fact is we need to be more respectful in our dialogue. One thing I will say about Kevin Rudd is that when he retired he talked about the politeness that is in politics and the need for more of it. And he was probably right, he was right. And he\u2019s probably still to this day correct.<br><br> But the fact is, Twitter, there\u2019s a lot of people, and particularly the left side of politics, which use Twitter as a weapon against people, who stand more and represent regional Australians. The Great Dividing Range is not just a geographical barrier, sadly these days it\u2019s also a metaphor for the differences between metropolitan cities and the great sprawl that is regional Australia. <strong>Warren Truss</strong> said to me one day that back in his day, when he was a young fella, a lot of people would come and visit the country farmer, country cousins. That doesn\u2019t happen these days, we\u2019re so busy! We\u2019re so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that city people forget where their food and fibre comes from.<br><br> And that\u2019s why I was delighted to stand beside Scott Morrison, last week and announced a new arrangement by which country kids and city kids are going to be drawn closer together because metropolitan kids are going to know where their food comes from. It just doesn\u2019t come from a fridge, it just doesn\u2019t come from a supermarket, it actually comes from a farm. And we will always stand up for farmers, we will always make sure that their hard work and their endeavours are respected, and we\u2019ll get on with doing that. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t tweet about latte-sippers in the next few weeks, hey?</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T23:15:14.020Z\">at 11.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dc894408f0867dcebfd25e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T22:51:11.324Z\">10.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Michael McCormack\u2019</strong>s first speech included this line:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Politics is not about power; it is about people representing those people and speaking up for them loudly, often and passionately.

What do you make of that language? <br></p> <p><strong>David Littleproud:</strong> Look, I think the frustrating thing is there are a number of people out there that have been impacted by this fire that are very fragile and those that are traumatised and those that have a lot of anxiety at the moment worrying over the next couple of days worrying about what might happen. This is not the time by these people that want to weaponise climate change ... <br></p> <p><strong>MR:</strong> Minister, excuse the interruption. We\u2019re not talking about politicians. We\u2019re talking about residents here, with no political axe to grind, saying climate change is a concern, something\u2019s new, something\u2019s changed, these fires are unprecedented. They\u2019re not talking politics. <br></p> <p><strong>DL</strong>: Well, and when we do talk about that we can say that we are leading the world but we need the world to lead with us. We need other international communities to come with us. We expect that. We put our hand up as a federal government and said we\u2019ll do our bit of the heavy lifting with respect to emissions reductions. We\u2019ll do that because that\u2019s what scientists tell us is the best way to address it but we need other nations to lead with us. Australia can\u2019t do it all by ourselves and it is unrealistic to think we can do it by ourselves. That\u2019s why we need to be the global leader that we are and expect other nations to come with us. <br></p> <p><strong>MR: </strong>Are people concerned with climate change, again, \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d? <br></p> <p><strong>DL:</strong> Obviously these types of events bring emotions out and everybody needs to be focus just on the here and now at the moment and those conversations will continue but we have a strong ... <br></p> <p><strong>MR:</strong> Was Michael McCormack wrong to say that? Was Michael McCormack being too emotional? <br></p> <p><strong>DL:</strong> No, I mean, Michael McCormack has been out talking to the people that have been impacted. He\u2019s trying to get results for those people, those people that have had their homes lost, those people that are concerned today and tomorrow that will lose their homes, he\u2019s concerned about making sure that our focus, our primary focus, from state, federal government and local state, federal government and local government is all about them. That\u2019s the responsible thing to do. Let\u2019s have those conversations in the cold, hard light of day after the event. But our focus and energy should be on the men and women fighting these fires and also the men and women, and children who are at risk. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T21:52:15.880Z\">at 9.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dc883768f0867dcebfd258f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T21:40:09.395Z\">9.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I am not sure if <strong>Carol Sparks </strong>qualifies as one of the \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d or \u201cinner-city lefties\u201d raising concerns about climate change in <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> land, but who knows.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T21:40:44.782Z\">at 9.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dc8827b8f08c2d1f80dd528\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T21:37:45.701Z\">9.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Glen Innes mayor Carol Sparks: 'To deny climate change is, to me, very ill-informed.'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Carol Sparks</strong>, the mayor of Glen Innes Severn council, which had an absolute horror weekend dealing with the fires, spoke to ABC TV this morning about <strong>Michael McCormack\u2019s</strong> interview, where he said he found it \u201cgalling\u201d to have climate change raised as the cause of worsening fires:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I probably couldn\u2019t respond how I really feel on television but I think that Michael McCormack needs to read the science, and that is what I am going by, is the science. <br></p> <p>It is not a political thing.

No doubt we will still be talking about whether or not we are allowed to discuss causes for worsening natural disasters tomorrow, because this is after all, Australian politics. For those in the fire zone, please stay safe. For those fighting those fires, thank you. In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. Someone is having fun. Rachel Siewert is asking Michaelia Cash what happened to the 104,480 who have dropped out of income support \u2013 and whether or not she can confirm they have jobs, or any form of income. Cash says there were many reasons, but doesn\u2019t give an answer. Senate question time ends, and so does my will to keep standing. Bridget McKenzie REALLY likes the line \u201cwe are standing with you\u201d when it comes to farmers. Really, really likes it. Apologies for the dairy/diary typos. But you try listening to this guff without your entire being glazing over. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Senator Hanson, I forgot you were actually new to this issue, so let me walk you through it,\u201d Bridget McKenzie says. Someone get the aloe vera. Pauline Hanson is now asking Bridget McKenzie about the exposure draft for the dairy code. This would be the issue that One Nation has seemingly taken over from the Nationals, leaving the Nationals rather annoyed. Hanson put through a bill today for regulation of the industry, which was lost after the Nationals voted against it (Centre Alliance was absent from the vote) so she lost it by one. Hanson is very much enjoying how discomforted this is leaving McKenzie. This is becoming the Bridget McKenzie hour, which is wayyyyy too much Bridget McKenzie. She is basically taking every single question on notice. Which includes why Moira council found out from the media it was no longer getting the $1m drought funding it thought it was, after a miscommunication between Damian Drum and the water minister. McKenzie can\u2019t tell you much about that. But she can tell you that it is a \u201cgreat program\u201d. Can you be a raving inner city greenie lunatic, if you are from Michael McCormack\u2019s electorate? Asking for a friend. Honestly, I would prefer to eat a bunch of bananas then sit through this. Bridget McKenzie just had a bit of a fraudian slip with the term \u201cclimate reduction fund\u201d instead of emissions reduction fund as she answers a question from Larissa Waters. I mean, at least it is honest. McKenzie now accuses Waters of using the \u201cmisery of those in regional NSW and Queensland for your political advantage.\u201d Oh that\u2019ll fix it. We are now hearing a dixer on how the parliament and government will be acknowledging Remembrance Day. Which occurred at 10.30am. Asked more questions on the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages issues, Bridget McKenzie says she will take the questions on notice \u201cand that is all I can really do\u201d. Even Penny Wong cracks a smile at that one. Strangely, McKenzie doesn\u2019t seem to have anything prepared on this, despite the auditor-general report basically calling it a trash fire, meaning her staff are now madly sending her sheets of information via the Senate clerks. Bridget McKenzie says \u201cwe are the first government to put real money on the table\u201d to help prepare for the next drought. \u201cThat is how you [deal] for a drought, you plan for the next one now ... we are the first government in history to do that.\u201d Nita Green gets the first question \u2013 on the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages program that Sarah Martin and Paul Karp have been writing about. Bridget McKenzie is taking all the questions on notice. You can find some of the problems with that scheme here: And here Bridget McKenzie says her \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d are with the communities facing the fire emergency. Larissa Waters says on the fires that \u201cwe cannot say that we weren\u2019t warned this was going to happen\u201d and mentions a 2006 CSIRO report handed to the John Howard government, talking about the danger of fires becoming worse by 2020 because of a changing climate. \u201cWe need more than thoughts and prayers to keep Australian communities safe,\u201d Waters says. Penny Wong says that individual weather events can\u2019t be linked to the fires, but trends can, and Australia needs a plan to deal with what is coming in the future. The defence minister has authorised all local base commanders for the armed forces to respond where they can during the fire emergencies. Senate question time begins with an acknowledgement of the fires and a thank you to fire fighters. We are just a few minutes away from Senate question time. I am finding it very hard to contain my excitement. On another note, I hate bananas (it\u2019s a consistency thing) but I still force myself to eat them, because they are so good for you and I kinda feel like I have to. Senate question time is a lot like eating a banana. There is a cross-parliamentary working group, which includes George Christensen and Andrew Wilkie, looking to see Julian Assange before his extradition hearing. They are still waiting on permission from the UK government. The final division on Pauline Hanson\u2019s dairy bill was just held \u2013 she lost Ayes 30 Noes 31 That Senate chamber light. Labor is supporting this, but the government is not. Katharine Murphy has written on Michael McCormack\u2019s Michael McCormacking this morning: Let me say this next bit very clearly. The best way to decline Michael\u2019s now rolling invitation to be tribal is to respond with reason, not with emotion. With that basic objective in mind a couple of things can be noted. Dear Michael. It is possible to do more than one thing at once. Perhaps multitasking has never been a particularly strength of the deputy prime minister\u2019s, and that\u2019s fine, because juggling is certainly not for everyone, but I\u2019ll venture it is possible for emergency services to extinguish fires and for politicians and various experts to speak informatively about the underlying causes of fires so catastrophic that they have been designated a state of emergency in the middle of November, not in mid-to-late summer. I reckon those things can happen simultaneously \u2013 both the analysing and the doing \u2013 without anything terrible happening or without anything fundamental being compromised. I think we are that clever. Truly, I do. You\u2019ll find the whole piece here: Noted raving inner-city greenie lunatic Margaret Thatcher: The bells have rung for the beginning of Senate-palooza, which means I am about to enter the little known ninth circle of hell \u2013 Senate QT supplementary questions. Cory Bernardi has told Chris Kenny on Sky News he will be quitting the Senate some time in 2020. That is not a surprise \u2013 he has all but announced he is out of here, and said he wanted to leave when he was 50 (this year). Plus, there was the whole political-party-didn\u2019t-quite-work-out thing. Elected as a Liberal for a six-year term in 2016, his seat will revert back to the Liberals when he officially pulls the pin. This is the big bill in the Senate today Neither medevac nor ensuring integrity is listed as yet (which means the government doesn\u2019t have the numbers). Penny Wong was also asked about Jim Molan\u2019s return to the Senate this morning, while chatting to ABC radio: I sat on the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security with Jim Molan, and it might surprise people but we actually got on quite well. We obviously have different views but I always found him good to deal with. I hope that he could encourage perhaps the foreign minister to engage members of parliament and senators more on our relationship with China. I think he\u2019s certainly got a focus in that area and I certainly hope he will join me in encouraging foreign minister Payne to engage the parliament a little more. I know a few hours have gone by since that interview with Michael McCormack, but I am still flabbergasted. What an absolute parsnip of a political mind. Michael McCormack may have actually started a movement \u2013 energising people about politics. So he\u2019s proven useful in one way at least. Mike Bowers has been out and about this morning: And of course, recognising the service and sacrifice of Indigenous Australians, who served during the Great War, but returned to the same prejudices they left. Another group of raving inner city lunatics \u2013 because what else would former fire and emergency leaders warning about longer and more devastating fire seasons be, other than off their tree? Have they considered to sticking to their knitting? Adam Bandt responded to Michael McCormack this morning: Thoughts and prayers are not enough, we need science and action too,\u201d he said. They\u2019ve done everything in their power to make these catastrophic fires more likely. When you cuddle coal in Canberra, the rest of the country burns. The call to ceremony has just gone out across the Parliament House speakers, to commemorate the anniversary of the armistice of 11 November 1918. Remembrance Day ceremonies have officially begun. Scott Morrison is in Sydney, Anthony Albanese is at the War Memorial. The governor general has just arrived to officially begin the proceedings in Canberra. ICYMI it late last Friday (and it was late last Friday, so you very well may have), a reminder that Chris Kenny (yes, that one) will be advising Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt on how best to move forward with an Indigenous voice to parliament (which is now being referred to as the Indigenous voice to government). Comments are on \u2013 thank you for your patience and welcome back btl. Penny Wong was climate change minister 12 years ago. Here she was speaking to the ABC this morning: We need to stand with those who are battling fires and grieving and at risk. I understand why people are anxious about this. What I would say is when we get through this, it is a responsible thing for us to focus on, how we plan to keep Australians safe. You\u2019re right, I am a former climate minister, warnings about a longer bushfire season and more intense fires have been on the table for a long time. Rural Australians for Refugees held an overnight vigil on the Parliament House lawns last night, protesting against the move to scrap medevac. Kristina Keneally addressed the group this morning, which included this exchange: KK: I just want to be very clear about a couple things, especially while our friends from the media are here because I don\u2019t think I can say this often enough. When it comes to the medevac laws, minister Peter Dutton, the prime minister and others are simply not telling the truth. They continue to misrepresent, and frankly lie, about what this law does. If you listen to minister Dutton, you would believe that he is powerless when it comes to who he can let into the country. Attendee: Bullshit! KK: I won\u2019t use the word the gentleman just used because there\u2019s a camera and a microphone in front of me but let me say, loosely translated, he called time; he called that out in a more colourful bit of the language. It is not the case. It is not the case. Of course the minister still has that power. The minister has used that power himself to deny somebody entry into the country based on whether or not they are a security risk. Attendee: Or au pairs! KK: The minister does like to let au pairs in as the lady says. However, the minister continues to repeat these lies that somehow medevac is letting people into the country that are a risk. Somehow he is powerless. Somehow doctors, any two doctors anywhere are just going to say anything or do anything and let people come in. Let us be clear about this \u2013 the minister has the power to stop anybody he wants based on security concerns. The doctors who allow people to come to this country because they need medical help are doctors appointed by minister Dutton and what we have seen under medevac is well over 100 people who have been able to get the medical care they needed because doctors appointed by minister Dutton have said these people are sick and they need to come to Australia to get health treatment. That\u2019s what is happening when it comes to medevac \u2013 people who are sick who need help are getting the help that they need. Now, I stand with you. The Australian Labor party stands with you. A huge sway of the crossbench in the Senate stands with you. And we will not stand by quietly; we will stand with you. We will stand up for people who are sick to get the healthcare they need. We will not stand by and watch this government just wave through a repeal of medevac. We will oppose the repeal of medevac. We will oppose it on the floor of the parliament and in every other forum that we can and I am so delighted to be here in this forum, this morning, with all of you who are bearing witness. Thank you for what you\u2019re doing. (We are still working on a moderator. Hold tight \u2013 in the mean time, you can always catch me on Twitter.) And Michael McCormack ahead of the May election on how we need to be more respectful of each other in political debate: I think everybody should actually be a little bit more respectful of each other, and I think we were talking yesterday about Van Badham, and the language that she uses and yet, Tanya Plibersek and Bill Shorten are happy to be situated beside her and pose for photos. I think her language is far worse than calling some of the metropolitan people latte-sippers. They\u2019re drinking milk, comes from a country cow, they\u2019re having coffee beans which no doubt comes from a regional centre. The fact is we need to be more respectful in our dialogue. One thing I will say about Kevin Rudd is that when he retired he talked about the politeness that is in politics and the need for more of it. And he was probably right, he was right. And he\u2019s probably still to this day correct. But the fact is, Twitter, there\u2019s a lot of people, and particularly the left side of politics, which use Twitter as a weapon against people, who stand more and represent regional Australians. The Great Dividing Range is not just a geographical barrier, sadly these days it\u2019s also a metaphor for the differences between metropolitan cities and the great sprawl that is regional Australia. Warren Truss said to me one day that back in his day, when he was a young fella, a lot of people would come and visit the country farmer, country cousins. That doesn\u2019t happen these days, we\u2019re so busy! We\u2019re so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that city people forget where their food and fibre comes from. And that\u2019s why I was delighted to stand beside Scott Morrison, last week and announced a new arrangement by which country kids and city kids are going to be drawn closer together because metropolitan kids are going to know where their food comes from. It just doesn\u2019t come from a fridge, it just doesn\u2019t come from a supermarket, it actually comes from a farm. And we will always stand up for farmers, we will always make sure that their hard work and their endeavours are respected, and we\u2019ll get on with doing that. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t tweet about latte-sippers in the next few weeks, hey? Michael McCormack\u2019s first speech included this line: Politics is not about power; it is about people representing those people and speaking up for them loudly, often and passionately. I have lived my life by this motto: I promise not to be silent when I ought to speak. That is my commitment to the people of the Riverina and to this parliament. How quickly we forget. Welcome back to the Senate, Jim Molan AAP is reporting that Labor is continuing the fight against the government\u2019s unions bill. Labor is ratcheting up its lobbying of the Senate crossbench to block the Morrison government\u2019s proposed union-busting laws. Legislation making it easier to deregister unions and ban officials is due to be debated in the Senate this week. The government is expected to tweak the bill after negotiations with minor party Centre Alliance, which should be enough to get the laws over the line. \u201cThis is a bill which is about destroying the right of trade unions to organise,\u201d Labor senator Penny Wong told ABC radio on Monday. \u201cIt is about undermining the capacity of trade unions and their members to advocate for better wages and conditions and better safety.\u201d The legislation makes it easier to deregister unions for improper conduct and repeated breaches of the law and allows for the automatic disqualification of union officials charged with serious crimes. It also places public interest tests on union mergers. Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus made a direct appeal to the crossbench senators. \u201cUnions will be threatened with being shut down for late paperwork. This is a sledgehammer, don\u2019t let it happen,\u201d McManus said. Our leaders just covering themselves in glory and leadership, this morning: Also a reminder, because it didn\u2019t get a hell of a lot of attention late last week, released as it was at the same time as the latest drought response, but the government-appointed drought coordinator general, Major Gen Stephen Day, was also pretty emphatic about climate change\u2019s impact on our environment. Hopefully, Michael McCormack has the opportunity to call him a \u201craving inner-city lunatic\u201d to his face. Also a reminder that it is a politician\u2019s job to look at overarching policy to help those on the ground. #thoughtsandprayers don\u2019t stop catastrophic fires. Given Michael McCormack\u2019s line of thinking, backed up by David Littleproud, from now on, no one is allowed to mention speeding or other driver-caused factors in road crashes, drug use in overdoses, or alcohol in \u201cfuelled\u201d violence. Discussing contributing factors is cancelled. Also: don\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t forgotten you in the comments. We just have to wait until there is a moderator available to turn them on \u2013 there is a bit going on in the world at the moment, but we will have you below the line very soon. Another \u201craving inner city lunatic\u201d, obviously: LNP MP and minister for water resources, drought, rural finance, natural disaster and emergency management David Littleproud was also on ABC TV this morning and was asked about Michael McCormack\u2019s comments by host Michael Rowland. Michael Rowland: Your boss, Michael McCormack, says it galls him when people blame climate change on these bushfires and he says \u201cit is raving inner-city lunatics\u201d. What do you make of that language? David Littleproud: Look, I think the frustrating thing is there are a number of people out there that have been impacted by this fire that are very fragile and those that are traumatised and those that have a lot of anxiety at the moment worrying over the next couple of days worrying about what might happen. This is not the time by these people that want to weaponise climate change ... MR: Minister, excuse the interruption. We\u2019re not talking about politicians. We\u2019re talking about residents here, with no political axe to grind, saying climate change is a concern, something\u2019s new, something\u2019s changed, these fires are unprecedented. They\u2019re not talking politics. DL: Well, and when we do talk about that we can say that we are leading the world but we need the world to lead with us. We need other international communities to come with us. We expect that. We put our hand up as a federal government and said we\u2019ll do our bit of the heavy lifting with respect to emissions reductions. We\u2019ll do that because that\u2019s what scientists tell us is the best way to address it but we need other nations to lead with us. Australia can\u2019t do it all by ourselves and it is unrealistic to think we can do it by ourselves. That\u2019s why we need to be the global leader that we are and expect other nations to come with us. MR: Are people concerned with climate change, again, \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d? DL: Obviously these types of events bring emotions out and everybody needs to be focus just on the here and now at the moment and those conversations will continue but we have a strong ... MR: Was Michael McCormack wrong to say that? Was Michael McCormack being too emotional? DL: No, I mean, Michael McCormack has been out talking to the people that have been impacted. He\u2019s trying to get results for those people, those people that have had their homes lost, those people that are concerned today and tomorrow that will lose their homes, he\u2019s concerned about making sure that our focus, our primary focus, from state, federal government and local state, federal government and local government is all about them. That\u2019s the responsible thing to do. Let\u2019s have those conversations in the cold, hard light of day after the event. But our focus and energy should be on the men and women fighting these fires and also the men and women, and children who are at risk. I am not sure if Carol Sparks qualifies as one of the \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d or \u201cinner-city lefties\u201d raising concerns about climate change in Michael McCormack land, but who knows. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes Severn council, which had an absolute horror weekend dealing with the fires, spoke to ABC TV this morning about Michael McCormack\u2019s interview, where he said he found it \u201cgalling\u201d to have climate change raised as the cause of worsening fires: Well, I probably couldn\u2019t respond how I really feel on television but I think that Michael McCormack needs to read the science, and that is what I am going by, is the science. It is not a political thing. It is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change. Of course it\u2019s not relevant at the moment when people\u2019s houses are burning and you\u2019ve lost lives, and you\u2019ve lost friends, and you\u2019ve lost family. You don\u2019t think, \u201cOh, this is climate change.\u201d You think, \u201cWhat am I going to do next and how will I save myself?\u201d But the overall thing is we are so dry in this country \u2013 we haven\u2019t had rain for years in some places. All the dams and creeks and rivers are dry, and we need to look at what we\u2019re going to do about that in the future. To deny climate change is, to me, a very ill-informed and uneducated way of looking at things. Meanwhile, the latest Newspoll is out, and with all the usual caveats about polling, it shows the Coalition and Labor on 50/50 for the first time since the election, in terms of two-party-preferred. The Australian put that down to the drought and the softening economy. On the leaders front, Scott Morrison will attend a Remembrance Day ceremony in Sydney, while I believe Anthony Albanese will attend the War Memorial service with Linda Reynolds. Three people have been confirmed as dead, another five are unaccounted for and 40 people have been injured in the latest fire emergency which has also taken scores of homes and property. The NSW Rural Fire Service has also placed the greater Sydney region under a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire risk for the first time since the ratings system began about a decade ago. You can hear Michael McCormack talk about the very \u201cconcerning\u201d early start to the bushfire season, without mentioning any of the reasons why, here. We start the Senate-only sitting week in the midst of an argument over whether or not Australia can manage to have a climate change discussion in the midst of an event made worse by climate change. Despite fire-fighting bosses, scientists and even the drought coordinator-general saying that climate change is going to make events which have always occurred in this nation \u2013 bushfires, drought, etc \u2013 worse, (which we can all see), no one is allowed to mention the giant burning elephant in the room. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, summed up this argument on ABC RN radio this morning: \u201cWe\u2019ve had fires in Australia since time began, and what people need now is sympathy, understanding, help and shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies at this time.\u201d #thoughtsandprayers We\u2019ll have the continued \u201cdiscussion\u201d around that, as well as what happens in the Senate. The big bills \u2013 medevac among them \u2013 are not on the list as yet, so you all know what that means. The Senate won\u2019t sit until 12.30pm because of Rememberance Day, so we have some time to get into the nitty gritty of what has happened over the last couple of weeks. For that, you have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp at your disposal. Plus, a slightly fluey, but still standing me. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

With the same energy and enthusiasm she used while hosting Iftar dinners to help community members better understand Islam, Mohamed began knocking on doors, asking people what they wanted from their city council. \u201cIt really gave me a sense of home,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cI have pretty much knocked on every door in the city.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Malika looked out of her window on the tenth floor of a run-down tower-block in northern Marseille across at the Mediterranean Sea. \u201cThere are good things about living here, despite the bad reputation,\u201d said the 43-year-old mother of four. \u201cWhen I was down, when I had no food, my neighbours always helped. We\u2019re one big family here.\u201d</p> <p>On a nearby estate, visible from the window, a 29-year-old was recently shot dead with a Kalashnikov machine-gun in a criminal turf-war. It was the tenth criminal gang death in the Marseille area this year. Military weapons are sometimes fired in broad daylight and can sell for as little as \u20ac500.</p> <p>But at a table under the bird cages on Malika\u2019s balcony, a group of local women are planning a \u201crevolution\u201d in France\u2019s second city. Hundreds of women from the Marseille estates \u2013 including mothers who have lost family members in violent criminal disputes \u2013 have launched an <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/julien-denormandie-les-biens-confisqu%C3%A9s-au-crime-organis%C3%A9-affect%C3%A9s-%C3%A0-l-%C3%A9conomie-solidaire-de-nos-quartiers\">appeal to the government</a> to plough back the millions of euros confiscated each year from organised crime across the country into small local associations on impoverished housing estates.</p> <p>Inspired by anti-mafia laws in Italy, where recovered assets are given back to local communities, the women argue that channeling the proceeds of white-collar corruption and crime back into educational projects run by local groups would help keep teenagers away from organised crime. But the struggle comes with personal risk in neighbourhoods where arms and drugs have filled a void left by the state.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the women, the mums, who keep things together round here \u2013 we\u2019re stronger than the men,\u201d Malika said. The women are used to gently keeping the peace in neighbourhoods where school dropout rates are high and transport and public services are seen as lacking.</p> <p>Malika\u2019s immaculately decorated apartment is the last lived-in flat on her floor of a block on the Flamants estate in Marseille\u2019s Northern Quarters. Other homes in the block are boarded up, and some have been squatted as this tower is marked for imminent demolition. The state is renovating what has become one of the poorest and most stigmatised neighbourhoods in France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0ca2932e59210ab033d66758c8fa4a508e0fd4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0ca2932e59210ab033d66758c8fa4a508e0fd4e/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from an apartment in the Flamants estate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from an apartment in the Flamants estate</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Th\u00e9o Giacometti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the women sipped coffee, the silence was suddenly broken by the sound of piercing howls from the street as teenagers shout \u201cAha, aha!\u201d \u2013 the code word for drug-dealers to run for cover. Local boys, some younger than 15, sit all day on plastic chairs manning entrances to certain blocks to warn drug-dealers of police or rival gangs. Children, some as young as nine, are co-opted in to working as \u201clookouts\u201d for low wages as a way to pay for trainers or food. But once they are in the \u201cnetwork\u201d it is virtually impossible to get out.</p> <p>The Mediterranean port, which is thriving as a major tourist destination, has been desperate to shake off its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/13/marseille-crime\">old stereotypes of drug-smuggling and gang wars</a> as seen in the 1971 film, The French Connection. From the 1930s to the 1970s, the city was a centre for heroine processing factories, exporting the lucrative drug to the US. But in the past decade, the local drug trade of hashish has focused on local consumption, recruiting local children and filling an economic void in the de-industrialised city, where some northern tower blocks have 70% youth unemployment. Some Marseille estates are among the poorest in France, where half of residents living below the poverty lines and school dropout rates are high. In such a climate, the trade for lookouts \u2013 poor people \u201cwho aren\u2019t dealers but who need that money to live\u201d \u2013 is able to thrive, said <a href=\"https://www.fayard.fr/documents-temoignages/les-nouveaux-parrains-de-marseille-9782213687155\">Xavier Monnier</a>, author of a book on Marseille\u2019s criminal gang system, Les Nouveaux Parrains de Marseille.</p> <p>Marseille\u2019s Northern Quarters have become a new frontline in how the centrist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\">Emmanuel Macron</a> deals with France\u2019s fractured society. The area is home to 250,000 people and covers one third of the city\u2019s surface area. Perched high on hills overlooking the city, the area is green, has stunning views and should be prime real estate. But instead it has become a a political faultline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"929e0b32ee15b2db9dcf446d3e9ca4e2213fa166\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/929e0b32ee15b2db9dcf446d3e9ca4e2213fa166/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mothers in the Flamants estate in Marseille\u2019s Northern Quarters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re stronger than the men\u2019: The women of the Flamants estates are used to keeping the peace in neighbourhoods where school dropout rates are high and transport and public services are seen as lacking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Th\u00e9o Giacometti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are clusters of high-rise estates built hastily in the 1960s and 70s to house Marseille\u2019s post-war rising demographic, many from former colonies in north and west Africa. Then there are neighbouring residential streets of low-rises, increasingly shutting themselves off behind fences and gated communities, where the vote for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far right has boomed. Voter abstention on housing estates has reached record levels as people fear politicians make little difference to the discrimination faced in their daily lives. The area is increasingly segregated and divided. When Macron visited a local unemployment office this year, one onlooker shouted: \u201cMore jobs, less racism!\u201d The president didn\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cI agree on both points,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has expressed interest in the Marseille women\u2019s appeal to direct funds from criminal activity back into local projects. A centrist MP has tried to push for a change in the law, and the women \u2013 who said they were inspired by the bravery of women\u2019s movements in Northern Ireland and support from mothers on estates in northern England \u2013 are standing firm.

      "bodyText": "Malika looked out of her window on the tenth floor of a run-down tower-block in northern Marseille across at the Mediterranean Sea. \u201cThere are good things about living here, despite the bad reputation,\u201d said the 43-year-old mother of four. \u201cWhen I was down, when I had no food, my neighbours always helped. We\u2019re one big family here.\u201d On a nearby estate, visible from the window, a 29-year-old was recently shot dead with a Kalashnikov machine-gun in a criminal turf-war. It was the tenth criminal gang death in the Marseille area this year. Military weapons are sometimes fired in broad daylight and can sell for as little as \u20ac500. But at a table under the bird cages on Malika\u2019s balcony, a group of local women are planning a \u201crevolution\u201d in France\u2019s second city. Hundreds of women from the Marseille estates \u2013 including mothers who have lost family members in violent criminal disputes \u2013 have launched an appeal to the government to plough back the millions of euros confiscated each year from organised crime across the country into small local associations on impoverished housing estates. Inspired by anti-mafia laws in Italy, where recovered assets are given back to local communities, the women argue that channeling the proceeds of white-collar corruption and crime back into educational projects run by local groups would help keep teenagers away from organised crime. But the struggle comes with personal risk in neighbourhoods where arms and drugs have filled a void left by the state. \u201cIt\u2019s the women, the mums, who keep things together round here \u2013 we\u2019re stronger than the men,\u201d Malika said. The women are used to gently keeping the peace in neighbourhoods where school dropout rates are high and transport and public services are seen as lacking. Malika\u2019s immaculately decorated apartment is the last lived-in flat on her floor of a block on the Flamants estate in Marseille\u2019s Northern Quarters. Other homes in the block are boarded up, and some have been squatted as this tower is marked for imminent demolition. The state is renovating what has become one of the poorest and most stigmatised neighbourhoods in France. As the women sipped coffee, the silence was suddenly broken by the sound of piercing howls from the street as teenagers shout \u201cAha, aha!\u201d \u2013 the code word for drug-dealers to run for cover. Local boys, some younger than 15, sit all day on plastic chairs manning entrances to certain blocks to warn drug-dealers of police or rival gangs. Children, some as young as nine, are co-opted in to working as \u201clookouts\u201d for low wages as a way to pay for trainers or food. But once they are in the \u201cnetwork\u201d it is virtually impossible to get out. The Mediterranean port, which is thriving as a major tourist destination, has been desperate to shake off its old stereotypes of drug-smuggling and gang wars as seen in the 1971 film, The French Connection. From the 1930s to the 1970s, the city was a centre for heroine processing factories, exporting the lucrative drug to the US. But in the past decade, the local drug trade of hashish has focused on local consumption, recruiting local children and filling an economic void in the de-industrialised city, where some northern tower blocks have 70% youth unemployment. Some Marseille estates are among the poorest in France, where half of residents living below the poverty lines and school dropout rates are high. In such a climate, the trade for lookouts \u2013 poor people \u201cwho aren\u2019t dealers but who need that money to live\u201d \u2013 is able to thrive, said Xavier Monnier, author of a book on Marseille\u2019s criminal gang system, Les Nouveaux Parrains de Marseille. Marseille\u2019s Northern Quarters have become a new frontline in how the centrist Emmanuel Macron deals with France\u2019s fractured society. The area is home to 250,000 people and covers one third of the city\u2019s surface area. Perched high on hills overlooking the city, the area is green, has stunning views and should be prime real estate. But instead it has become a a political faultline. There are clusters of high-rise estates built hastily in the 1960s and 70s to house Marseille\u2019s post-war rising demographic, many from former colonies in north and west Africa. Then there are neighbouring residential streets of low-rises, increasingly shutting themselves off behind fences and gated communities, where the vote for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far right has boomed. Voter abstention on housing estates has reached record levels as people fear politicians make little difference to the discrimination faced in their daily lives. The area is increasingly segregated and divided. When Macron visited a local unemployment office this year, one onlooker shouted: \u201cMore jobs, less racism!\u201d The president didn\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cI agree on both points,\u201d he said. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has expressed interest in the Marseille women\u2019s appeal to direct funds from criminal activity back into local projects. A centrist MP has tried to push for a change in the law, and the women \u2013 who said they were inspired by the bravery of women\u2019s movements in Northern Ireland and support from mothers on estates in northern England \u2013 are standing firm. But where in Italy, there was wide-scale public outrage against the mafia and support of the law, in France, there is less public awareness. Over \u20ac920m of criminal assets have been seized by the French state over the past 10 years, but the recovered apartments, cars and other saleable objects are sold off anonymously so as not to make waves. The profits go into state coffers. A mother from one Marseille estate, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s about creating local opportunity.

The calls came as community members and supporters protested outside Alice Springs police station for a second day to demand answers about the shooting. Another rally is scheduled for tomorrow. Congress, the central Australian Aboriginal health service, said there were so many unanswered questions around the shooting that the inquest into Walker\u2019s death in the town of Yuendumu should be given priority over all others and report within three months. The Congress CEO, Donna Ah Chee, told the rally the NT Health department should also investigate why the Yuendumu medical clinic was closed and \u201cwhy it has not been immediately reopened with full services, given increase of police in the community\u201d since the shooting. \u201cClinic closures are a disturbing trend with life-threatening consequences \u2013 as we have seen this weekend,\u201d Ah Chee said. The Central Land Council has called for police to release the body camera footage. \u201cWe want full transparency, we want to see the body camera evidence, we want it out in the open,\u201d CEO, Joe Martin-Jard said. \u201cI call on the coroner to have this inquiry at Yuendumu and give families the chance to talk to him,\u201d he said.

The independent member for Stuart, Scott McConnell, told ABC Radio on Monday it \u201cwould be helpful with the healing process\u201d for Michael Gunner to sit down at Yuendumu with elders to explain how the inquiry into Walker\u2019s death will involve them. Organisers of Monday\u2019s rally said they were concerned the increase in police presence in the community would only upset people further. Walker was shot by police when they attempted to arrest him for an outstanding warrant. They took him to the police station, where he died while waiting for medical assistance to arrive. His family were not told of his death on Saturday night. Senior police officers visited the community on Sunday to speak to residents, who had been remarkably calm, McConnell said, despite their distress. \u201cThere has been incredibly good leadership from elders who kept people calm in an absolute vacuum of information [from police],\u201d McConnell said. He said the government and the NT police needed to \u201cexplain and justify the inquiry\u201d they were undertaking because \u201cthe community don\u2019t believe it is independent enough and I support them in that\u201d.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning.

      "bodyText": "Catastrophic fire danger has been forecast for the greater Sydney, greater Hunter and Illawarra/Shoalhaven regions on Tuesday 12 November. This includes the central coast and the Blue Mountains. It\u2019s the first time since the new fire ratings were introduced in 2009 that catastrophic conditions have been forecast for Sydney. Here\u2019s what it means. What is catastrophic fire danger? Catastrophic is the highest fire danger rating. High temperatures, strong winds and low humidity are forecast, making conditions dangerous. If a fire starts during catastrophic conditions, lives and homes will be at risk. Fire danger ratings are based on the latest forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology. When calculating fire danger, authorities look at the temperature, wind speeds, humidity and the \u201cdrought factor\u201d, that is, measures of how much moisture is in the ground already. Temperatures in the Sydney and Hunter regions on Tuesday are forecast to reach the high 30s. Winds from the north-west are expected to be particularly dry, particularly hot and very gusty. If fire breaks out, it can spread out of control quickly. The NSW Rural Fire Service is also forecasting extreme fire conditions for the north coast, central ranges, northern slopes and north-western regions. Current forecasts are for severe fire danger for the far north coast, New England, the far south coast, the southern ranges, and the lower central west plains. A statewide total fire ban has been declared for all areas of NSW for all of Monday and Tuesday. What should I do in catastrophic fire conditions? In catastrophic conditions, the message from the Rural Fire Service is simple: For your survival, leaving early is the only option. They give the following advice: Leave bushfire-prone areas the night before or early in the day \u2013 do not just wait and see what happens. Make a decision about when you will leave, where you will go, how you will get there and when you will return. Homes are not designed to withstand fires in catastrophic conditions so you should leave early. Avoid bushfire-prone areas. A safer area may be a large town or city, shopping centres or facilities well away from bushland areas. Schools in identified high-risk areas will be closed. Schools will notify affected students. Start making arrangements now. If you are unable to leave, identify a safe location which may be nearby. This may include a Neighbourhood Safer Place. The RFS provides a clear breakdown of what each of the fire ratings means for you on its website. The web page also includes advice on what people in areas where extreme and severe fire danger is forecast should do.",

It said major construction works at its Mitchell storage facility had been completed and would provide long-term storage of large technology objects and other national collection items. \u201cWork has now commenced on the logistics phases of the project, to move collection items into the purpose-built facility.\u201d The annual report shows that Brendan Nelson, the director of the War Memorial, earned a total remuneration of $470,000, consisting of $375,000 in base salary, $60,000 in bonuses, $20,000 for superannuation and $15,000 for long service leave. In the same decision, the remuneration tribunal also ordered an additional $166,260 loading for Martin Hoffman, the chief executive officer of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, from November 2019 to 2022.",

Instead, \u201cI learned to survive by simply watching her\u201d. Bhenji Ra is now a mother herself, to a group of young trans women she has come to count as family. She says, \u201cthe biggest lesson I can teach them is through actions, the spirit and the body\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The ABC has blamed budget cuts among the reasons Australian audiences will not be able to listen to the Tokyo Olympics live on ABC radio next year, ending a 67-year-old sports broadcasting tradition. The public broadcaster has declined to buy the non-commercial broadcast rights from rights-holder Seven this year due to the cost of covering the games as well as budget pressures and the \u201cchanging broadcast environment\u201d. It\u2019s understood the ABC pulled the plug on negotiations with Seven late on Friday after six months of consideration. The sticking point is the cost of staging the broadcast rather than the fee for the rights, sources said. The ABC is trying to fill an $84m hole in the budget from a Coalition cut in May 2018. The rights would have given ABC listeners a dedicated digital radio station to listen to the Tokyo games in 2020 as well as live commentary from ABC Grandstand and coverage of every Australian medal. At Rio in 2016 and London in 2012, Grandstand broadcast all Australia\u2019s achievements in the pool and the track as well as major sports such as cycling, hockey, basketball and Rugby Sevens. With the non-commercial rights the ABC has been able to broadcast on ABC local radio, Grandstand digital radio and on the ABC radio app. The Australian Olympic Committee has called on the ABC to reverse its decision. Chief executive officer Matt Carroll said the decision was short-sighted and runs contrary to the ABC charter. \u201cThe ABC should reconsider this decision,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThe AOC is prepared to put this case to the chair of the ABC directly, on behalf of the 8 million Australians who participate in Olympic sports. \u201cNot to mention the millions more who follow, support and celebrate those athletes. \u201cThe AOC believes the decision is monumentally short-sighted and a great let down to Australians who rely on their national broadcaster \u2013 from the smallest of communities to our suburbs. Carroll said the Olympics helped to counter scourges like obesity and mental illness. \u201cTokyo 2020 presents such an opportunity to do that, given the timezone, in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Olympics can inspire Australians to embrace something valuable and as the ABC\u2019s charter indicates \u2013 to contribute to a sense of national identity. There\u2019s no bigger event in the world to fulfil this ambition. \u201cThere is no sporting movement in Australia that covers the multi-cultural and geographical diversity of our country as the Olympic movement \u2013 we will be sending athletes to compete in some 42 disciplines in Tokyo.\u201d The ABC\u2019s first Olympics as an official rights holder was Helsinki in 1952, and the ABC had full television and radio rights from the Melbourne Olympics until Montreal in 1976, when the television rights moved to a commercial station. \u201cThis is an incredibly tough decision, especially given our 67-year run as the official non-commercial Olympic Games radio broadcaster,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cDue to competing budget priorities coupled with the fact that Australians can access Olympic Games coverage in many other ways, we have chosen not to pursue rights in 2020.\u201d No Grandstand staff would be going to Tokyo next year, the spokesman said. While the ABC will not provide live commentary for the Olympics on radio, ABC News and ABC Grandstand will provide daily Olympic updates across all platforms. The ABC has been identified with the Olympics since it covered its first games in 1932, and ABC TV screened the first Olympic footage seen on television by Australians in 1956. The dramatic \u201cGold! Gold to Australia! Gold!\u201d call by ABC commentator Norman May was broadcast in 1980 \u2013 although it was not heard first on the ABC but on commercial radio station 2UE because it was in the middle of the night when the ABC was off air.

No less, it also makes it easier to shirk responsibility for combat survivors and their families, those who are bequeathed the drug addiction, the terrible domestic violence and suicide that played out in plague proportions behind tens of thousands of bolted-shut suburban front doors in the decades after the first world war.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The returned services officials were never much good at dealing with all of that; much effort was made to sanctify the dead, while keeping the limbless soldiers and the facially disfigured off the streets. And the suicide, vagrancy and addiction was never talked about. Instructively, there is now overdue debate about the obvious, undeniable need for a royal commission into the scourge of veterans\u2019 suicide.</p> <p>Impetus for a commission has gathered momentum on the back of a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/a-royal-commission-into-the-veteran-suicide-rate-in-australia\">Change.org petition</a> from Julie-Ann Finney, whose serviceman son David took his own life after being afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder due to his Royal Australian Navy service.

He signed up for the first world war, gave away his possessions and took with him an acolyte \u2013 15-year-old Jack Harris from Sydney, who\u2019d enlisted after lying about his age. Both arrived on Gallipoli in August 1915, just in time for the battle of Lone Pine. La Touche, an officer with no experience, begged to be allowed to fight. He and Harris died soon after the battle began. He got his wish. He is one soldier who did sacrifice himself \u2013 and the boy, Harris, at the same time. There are many memorials to La Touche. For Harris, never found, there\u2019s but one.</p> <p>Spare a thought too for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/11/soldiers-real-stories-are-the-best-defence-against-remembrance-day-conditioning\">John Francis Naughton</a> of Charters Towers.

Before Australia\u2019s $600m, four-year festival of first world war commemoration (Australia spent more than any other country on remembering each of its 60,000 dead first world war soldiers), a Vietnam veteran, Jim Robertson, wrote a submission to the federal government about the tone of the remembrance. He urged government to \u201ctry to avoid the utterly demeaning term \u2018fallen\u2019 when speaking of war dead \u2013 they did not trip over a stick or garden hose, they were drowned, burned, shot, gassed and eviscerated to lie face down in mud or sand or at the bottom of the ocean\u201d. He was ignored. But the point he was making is clear: do not sugar-coat the realities of remembering war with beatific language. Any notion that most soldiers willingly sacrifice themselves en masse (as opposed to knowingly putting themselves in harm\u2019s way to do an important job), also tends to abrogate political and command responsibility for their deaths. No less, it also makes it easier to shirk responsibility for combat survivors and their families, those who are bequeathed the drug addiction, the terrible domestic violence and suicide that played out in plague proportions behind tens of thousands of bolted-shut suburban front doors in the decades after the first world war. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The returned services officials were never much good at dealing with all of that; much effort was made to sanctify the dead, while keeping the limbless soldiers and the facially disfigured off the streets. And the suicide, vagrancy and addiction was never talked about. Instructively, there is now overdue debate about the obvious, undeniable need for a royal commission into the scourge of veterans\u2019 suicide. Impetus for a commission has gathered momentum on the back of a Change.org petition from Julie-Ann Finney, whose serviceman son David took his own life after being afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder due to his Royal Australian Navy service. Today she is behind a \u201cVets We Forget\u201d rally opposite the Australian war memorial, the focus of national official remembrance activities. Instructively, the Returned and Services League national president, Greg Melick, opposed the idea of a royal commission, saying it would cost \u201can enormous amount of money\u201d that might be better spent. Inquiring into the causes of veterans\u2019 suicide will save lives. So, how might the money (the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse cost some $370m) be better spent? On more commemoration perhaps? No such debate accompanied the announcement that the federal government would profligately spend $500m on expanding the war memorial, apparently so that it might display more machinery of war, commemorate Australian participation in existing conflicts, and because of the questionable claim that the institution has a therapeutic role to play for veterans (which is not, incidentally, part of the AWM mandate). Here\u2019s an idea: how about allocating $370 million for a royal commission into veterans\u2019 suicides from the $500m gifted, without question, to the war memorial expansion. That would really help the living. If you can escape the politicians for some quiet, dignified reflection on the true human cost of war today, a haunting new book by Paul Byrnes, The Lost Boys \u2013 The untold stories of the under-age soldiers who fought in the First world War, is a good place to start. It is one of the most poignant books I\u2019ve read in recent years about Australia\u2019s first world war experience. Byrnes tells the story of Sydney clergyman Everard Digges La Touche, who\u2019d decided that the best way he could serve his God was to die in war. He signed up for the first world war, gave away his possessions and took with him an acolyte \u2013 15-year-old Jack Harris from Sydney, who\u2019d enlisted after lying about his age. Both arrived on Gallipoli in August 1915, just in time for the battle of Lone Pine. La Touche, an officer with no experience, begged to be allowed to fight. He and Harris died soon after the battle began. He got his wish. He is one soldier who did sacrifice himself \u2013 and the boy, Harris, at the same time. There are many memorials to La Touche. For Harris, never found, there\u2019s but one. Spare a thought too for John Francis Naughton of Charters Towers. A bomb exploded in his hands during that same August offensive. He arrived in England, his hands fly-blown, with a note attached to his file reading, \u201cBomb exploded in his hands necessitating immediate amputation of both hands.\u201d He died 15 months later. Historians Bruce Scates, Frank Bongiorno and Rebecca Wheatley write, \u201cDeath did not end his indignities. Naughton\u2019s body was left in an open grave in [London\u2019s] Kensal Green cemetery; exposure to the elements led to \u2018consequences\u2019, as one anxious report put it, \u2018better imagined than described\u2019.\u201d That is the sort of thing that happens in war. Today, when we remember, we shouldn\u2019t turn away from the dreadful, unpalatable truth of it, no matter what our lead commemorators say. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "A woman who went on a Tinder date with the man accused of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane has told an Auckland court of how she struggled to breathe during their sexual encounter and feared she would die. The woman, whose name is suppressed, said the suspect, a 27-year-old New Zealand man, changed position so he was kneeling above her, and then, unexpectedly, sat on her. \u201cHe had grabbed my forearms and put all the pressure on my arms so I couldn\u2019t breathe and I couldn\u2019t move my arms. I started kicking, trying to indicate I couldn\u2019t breathe. I was kicking violently. He would have felt me fighting,\u201d the woman said, crying. \u201cI was terrified.\u201d The woman said she pretended she had passed out in an attempt to make the accused get off her. He remained in place, but she managed to turn her head to breathe. She estimated the ordeal lasted one or two minutes, and that she was fearful her friends and family would learn of her death. \u201cThis can\u2019t be the way I die,\u201d the woman said she remembered thinking. The accused is on trial for the murder of Millane, a 21-year-old British backpacker who was on a round-the-world trip when she disappeared on 2 December in New Zealand\u2019s largest city during a date with the man, whose name has been suppressed. Millane\u2019s body was found inside a suitcase buried in dense bushland west of the city a week later. The 27-year-old man has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the jury heard how the woman whose name is suppressed was first matched with the accused in March 2018 when they went on a date in the Auckland suburb of Newmarket and then had consensual sex. She went on another date with the accused in November 2018. She said she had thought the two would have a drink in Auckland\u2019s city centre but when they met, the accused said he needed to change his clothes and they went back to his room at the CityLife hotel instead. Once there, the plans changed again, and the two bought alcohol from a nearby shop and drank it in his hotel room. She said the accused then pushed her for sex, during which she was pinned to the bed and struggling to breathe. She told the court that he told her in an accusing and cold tone: \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t think I did that on purpose did you?\u2019 \u201cI was still trying to catch my breath. I was just in disbelief and shock.\u201d The woman continued messaging with the accused for a number of months, telling the court she was concerned she had given him too much information about her life and that he would stalk her if she cut off contact. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to aggravate him \u2026 I was scared.\u201d the woman said. During cross-examination, the woman repeatedly broke down in tears when questioned about the validity of her accusation that the accused had hurt her during their sexual encounter in November. Over three hours, the defence questioned why the woman had continued messaging the accused \u2013 at one point more than 700 in a month \u2013 to which she repeatedly replied that she had been scared of him, and was trying to keep him on side so he wouldn\u2019t approach her at work or her sporting activities. The woman said the accused told her he had gang connections and had \u201cbeat-up\u201d people at local bars. On 1 December \u2013 the day of the Millane date \u2013 the accused again pressed the woman for a date. She declined, making excuses. The accused\u2019s last message to her was half an hour before he first met Millane. Early the next morning, on 2 December, the accused messaged the woman again, chatting about cricket in between Google searches for \u201crigor mortis\u201d, and \u201cwaitakere ranges\u201d \u2013 where Millane\u2019s body was eventually found. He tried unsuccessfully for a date again, on 4 December. Earlier on Monday, the court heard from a second woman who had exchanged messages with the accused since February after meeting on Tinder. She described how she turned down his offers of a date because some of his sexual requests \u2013 which included strangulation \u2013 made her feel uncomfortable. The woman, whose identity was suppressed said the accused told her he liked rough sex, domination and strangulation \u201cbecause it made him feel more superior, and in control\u201d. The woman gave evidence that on 1 December the accused tried to make a date with her \u2013 hours before he met Millane at Sky City \u2013 but she declined, because she didn\u2019t want to do some of the things he liked sexually and felt uncomfortable. Under questioning from defence counsel Ron Mansfield, the woman was pressed on whether the police had specifically asked her about strangulation, or whether she had volunteered the information herself. The woman insisted she had produced the information unprompted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have made up that he asked to strangle me \u2026 if it wasn\u2019t real\u201d she said. A third woman gave evidence on Monday about a consensual sexual encounter that she had with the man that involved choking nine days before he met Millane. The two met through Tinder and had drinks in his CityLife hotel room on 22 November. \u201cMy breath was a bit restricted but it was something that gave me pleasure.\u201d the witness said. \u201cIt was a mutual agreement that \u2026 restriction and then let go.\u201d The murder trial is set down for four weeks and is expected to conclude in early December.",

      "bodyText": "An antisocial penguin that communicates by screaming has won New Zealand\u2019s hotly contested bird of the year poll. But the victory of the hoiho, or yellow-eyed penguin, has served to underscore the threat to its existence: it received more votes than there are hoiho remaining on the planet. The birds are charismatic and gorgeous, \u201ca magnificent version of a penguin\u201d, said Yolanda van Heezik, an associate professor of zoology at the University of Otago. She added that the penguins \u2013 the world\u2019s rarest \u2013 could become extinct on mainland New Zealand within 30 years without drastic action by conservation authorities. Monday\u2019s result was the first time a seabird has won the title since the competition began 14 years ago, and it was something of an underdog victory: the hoiho placed 12th in 2018. At final count, the hoiho won 12,022 out of 43,460 verified votes, said Forest and Bird, the independent conservation group that runs the poll. Only 225 pairs of hoiho remain on mainland New Zealand, with 1,700 pairs left when populations on the sub-Antarctic islands are included. The annual poll is taken so seriously in New Zealand that full-size billboards were commissioned by rival campaigns in the major cities, and voters were forced to validate their identities for the first time. Past voting scandals have involved foreign actors \u2013 in 2018, Australians \u2013 attempting to hack the election (in the Australians\u2019 case, to favour the shag). Unlike the huddled penguins of wildlife documentaries, yellow-eyed penguins are reclusive, said Thor Elley, a campaign spokesman and a zoology student. \u201cThey\u2019re a very antisocial species,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t nest within sight of other penguins.\u201d But when mates do return home to each other, they stand upright, flipper to flipper, and begin what Dr van Heezik called \u201can ecstatic ceremony\u201d. \u201cThey are screamingly happy to see each other again,\u201d she said. The hoiho is just one of many endangered New Zealand species with bleak prospects, said Dr van Heezik, and were under threat from climate change, fisheries, and disease. She said government had conservation plans in place for the birds but could be doing more, and she hoped the publicity generated by the bird of the year win would spur greater action.",

The new collective bargaining agreement has base wages built in that provide pay parity with the team\u2019s male counterparts, the Socceroos, in many areas.

Both teams will also have access to 24% of national team-generated revenue, which rises by 1% each year to 2023; 5% of this will be put back into youth and development programs. Both teams will also receive 40% of the prize money paid to Football Federation Australia for World Cup performances. Currently this is where the major disparity sits, as this money is set by Fifa and more money is provided for men\u2019s teams than women\u2019s; for example, the Socceroos received an $8m bonus for exiting the World Cup in the group stages, while the Matildas received $1m after progressing to the knockout stage. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/matildas-equal-pay-deal-is-part-of-a-global-shift-recognising-value-of-women-in-sport\">Matildas\u2019 equal pay deal is part of a global shift recognising value of women in sport | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other major disparities will come from domestic league salaries and sponsorship.

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s announcement of the new Matildas pay deal was a landmark for football in Australia. The new collective bargaining agreement has base wages built in that provide pay parity with the team\u2019s male counterparts, the Socceroos, in many areas. With women\u2019s sport across Australia reaching greater heights than ever before, it is worth comparing how this deal stacks up against some other women\u2019s sports. Football The new deal has guaranteed the Matildas a tiered payment system with minimum wages set at $40,000 and going up to $83,000 for top tier players \u2013 in line with what the Socceroos players will receive. Both teams will also have access to 24% of national team-generated revenue, which rises by 1% each year to 2023; 5% of this will be put back into youth and development programs. Both teams will also receive 40% of the prize money paid to Football Federation Australia for World Cup performances. Currently this is where the major disparity sits, as this money is set by Fifa and more money is provided for men\u2019s teams than women\u2019s; for example, the Socceroos received an $8m bonus for exiting the World Cup in the group stages, while the Matildas received $1m after progressing to the knockout stage. The other major disparities will come from domestic league salaries and sponsorship. While the new deal has set W-League salaries at the same minimum hourly rate as the A-League, the contracted hours for the women\u2019s teams are much shorter, meaning the minimum wage for the W-League is $16,344 while the A-League sits at $64,100. Sam Kerr will net over $1m this year thanks to sponsorship and her new contract with Chelsea, but most Matildas will not be earning equally with their Socceroos counterparts, due to fewer sponsorship opportunities and fewer domestic league opportunities. The Matildas\u2019 high-performance environment will also be improved to bring it in line with the Socceroos, which will include guaranteed business class flights for international travel, improved coaching structures, better operations support and access to wellbeing, education and transition services. The new pregnancy policy provides support for athletes during pregnancy and assistance to returning to the national team after childbirth. Cricket Cricket Australia has sat at the forefront of equality between their men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams for some time now. Their revenue-sharing model was the result of a tricky negotiation and currently sits at 29% for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. The minimum international wage for an Australian women\u2019s cricketer currently sits at approximately $75,000, increasing each year up to $87,609 by the end of the deal in 2022. While this is the highest international minimum wage among women\u2019s team sports in Australia, the men\u2019s cricket team\u2019s annual salaries start from $295,000. Men are also bolstered by their ability to play in cricket\u2019s richest league, the Indian Premier League, while Australia\u2019s women play mostly at home in their domestic competitions, with wages starting from around $26,000. With the introduction of The Hundred in England, there are now further opportunities internationally. Meg Lanning, Alyssa Healy and Sophie Molineux have all been picked up as marquee players in the draft. Cricket\u2019s newly announced maternity and pregnancy provisions are second to none in Australian sport, with players given 12 months paid maternity leave and a guaranteed contract extension the following season, as well as travel support for children up to four years old and a carer. Netball With no equivalent men\u2019s team to draw comparisons with, women have always been at the top of the pecking order for netball. When considering the landscape of inequality in Australian sport as a whole, the focus on women for netball is essential. While Australia\u2019s netballers aren\u2019t the highest earners on the international stage, with the Diamonds each pulling in approximately $30,000 if they take part in all international games in a season, they are part of Australia\u2019s highest-paying domestic competition for women. The minimum wage in Suncorp Super Netball is $30,000 and the average player earns around $67,000. Sponsorship opportunities also allow for greater earning capacity and selected players act as ambassadors for national league and Diamonds\u2019 sponsors. Diamonds players also receive small bonus payments for gold medals at the Netball World Cup or Commonwealth Games. Netball also led the charge in establishing a pregnancy and maternity leave policy, with players entitled to 12 months\u2019 paid maternity leave for players in contract and travel support for a child up to 12 months and a carer. Netballers also receive $1,635 per year in private health insurance and income protection for up to two years in the case of injury and pregnancy. The high-performance environment is at the leading edge for women\u2019s team sports with wellbeing, education, nutrition, strength and conditioning and performance analysis all built into the programs. AFLW A relative new kid on the block, the AFLW has just completed its own negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. The new deal sees the minimum wage increase to $16,623 for Tier 4 players through to $29,856 for a Tier 1 player. However it pales in comparison with their male counterparts \u2013 a first-year rookie in the AFL has a minimum wage of $71,500. With international matches not on the agenda, the earning capacity is limited to the short season in late summer and early autumn each year. While there are arguments that this short season is the reason for the significantly smaller salaries, players have continually pushed for longer seasons. The regular season will increase to 10 matches by 2022, with minimum wage increasing to $20,239 in that final year of the agreement. The AFLW\u2019s maternity and pregnancy policy allows for travel support for an infant and carer up to 12 months, or longer if a child is still breastfeeding, with the current contract to be paid in full during pregnancy. Rugby union and rugby sevens Australia\u2019s women\u2019s rugby sevens team made history in Rio, winning the first Olympic gold medal in the sport. They later made history when Rugby Australia made them full-time athletes, setting their minimum wage at $44,500 \u2013 equal to their male counterparts. Players are also entitled to 29% of national team generated revenue. However in the longer version of the game, Super W players are covered for travel costs only, with no payment on the table. Wallaroos players receive a $1,000 match payment for each game they are named in the 23-player squad, as well as a $500 training payment. Super Rugby players, on the other hand, are guaranteed a minimum wage of $44,500 with the average earnings reported at around $218,000. Wallabies players receive between $10,000 and $12,000 per match and are entitled to bonus payments for reaching the final of a Rugby World Cup. NRLW The recently established competition is still a small player compared to most other women\u2019s sports. The contracting is more complicated, with 19 players granted elite contracts across the competition. These players are entitled to a significant share of the $750,000 pool for player wages. Players outside this group would likely earn approximately $8,500 per season. In comparison, the minimum wage for an NRL player in a club\u2019s top 30 in 2020 is $110,000. The recent World Cup Nines was a step towards equality, with all players at the tournament \u2013 male and female \u2013 taking home equal payments of $2,000. Jillaroos players receive a $3,000 match payment for each Test and took home a $4,000 bonus for winning the 2017 World Cup. The Kangaroos, meanwhile, take home a $20,000 match fee for each Test and received a $20,000 bonus for winning the World Cup in the same year.",

Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, admitted that using the method \u2013 called \u201cfuel tankering\u201d within the industry \u2013 was \u201cmaybe the wrong thing to do\u201d despite the financial incentive behind the practice, because of its environmental impact. Critics said the widespread use of fuel tankering called into question airlines\u2019 commitment to reducing their impact on the environment. The information of excess fuel carriage came from a BA insider during a BBC Panorama investigation. IAG recently tried to burnish its environmental credentials with a commitment to become the first airline group worldwide to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. However, documents seen by the BBC showed a recent BA flight to Italy took on board nearly three tonnes of extra fuel: a cost saving of just \u00a340 but which meant an additional 600kg of CO2 was emitted. Speaking to analysts last week, Walsh said BA often did fuel tankering in order to save money, citing the example of Glasgow airport where jet fuel is 25% more expensive than at Heathrow. However, Walsh said BA was now considering its position on the practice. \u201cWe continue to do tankering today. We\u2019re challenging that, we\u2019re asking ourselves whether this is sustainable, and whether we should be pricing in the environmental impact of that. \u201cClearly the financial savings incentivise us to do tankering.

A report from Eurocontrol, which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, estimated that airlines save a total \u20ac265m (\u00a3229m) a year through using the practice within Europe \u2013 but at the cost of an additional 901,000 tonnes of CO2.

The Living Wage Foundation, which sets the voluntary measure, said London workers\u2019 basic hourly rate will also rise, by 20p to \u00a310.75, compared with the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a38.21 for workers aged 25 years or older. The charity said the difference between its own living wage and the government minimum will be more than \u00a32,000 a year nationally and almost \u00a35,000 a year in London. This year, the Living Wage Foundation has accredited about 1,500 employers, taking the overall total to just under 6,000. Employers that have joined the initiative include the FTSE 100 insurer Hiscox, Crystal Palace football club, Leeds Building Society, City airport in London and Newcastle University. In September, Capita, the outsourcing company that operates the London congestion charge and collects the BBC licence fee, became the latest to gain accreditation.

According to Justice, there are \u201cserious weaknesses\u201d in a system that excludes, sometimes unlawfully, a disproportionate numbers of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) and those from a minority background. One of the problems, its report said, is that schools often do not understand their duties under the Equality Act 2010 which require them to make reasonable adjustments to school policies \u2013 including zero tolerance behaviour policies \u2013 that may put Send children at a disadvantage. Justice called for mandatory training on the law related to exclusions for school leaders and recommended the establishment of a new independent reviewer with powers to investigate individual exclusions. It also wants dissatisfied parents to have the option of appealing to a judge-led tribunal. The report comes as concern mounts about the number of permanent exclusions in England which has been rising year-on-year since 2012 and far outstrips Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. According to the latest available figures, there were 7,905 permanent exclusions in England in 2017-18, with estimates of thousands more informally excluded either through managed moves to alternative schools or \u201coff-rolled\u201d, often into home education. The Challenging School Exclusions report highlighted how a permanent exclusion can have a devastating impact on a pupil\u2019s life, in some cases more than a criminal conviction, yet the process for challenging an exclusion is less robust than that in the youth justice system. Under the current system the school\u2019s governing body will review a decision by the headteacher to permanently exclude. But, according to Justice, governors lack independence and too often simply rubber-stamp those decisions. Parents can then take the matter to an independent review panel, but its powers are limited.

Barton said schools needed more flexibility in the curriculum and qualifications to ensure that more young people remain motivated by learning.

      "bodyText": "Councils will need billions of pounds in funding increases over the course of the next parliament to finance adult social care, an economic thinktank has found. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said a hike in costs was mainly the result of an ageing population, growing numbers of disabled adults and rising wages. Local authorities depend primarily on council tax and business rates to fund their spending, and a growing gap is likely to emerge between revenue raised and the rising cost of service provision, the IFS reported. Its analysis suggested that if council tax rises in line with inflation, local authorities will need an extra \u00a34bn a year from central government between now and 2024-25 and \u00a318bn a year by the mid-2030s to maintain social care services at their current level. If council tax were to rise by 4% a year, twice the rate of inflation, local authorities are likely to need an additional \u00a31.6bn a year in real-terms funding in five years\u2019 time.
