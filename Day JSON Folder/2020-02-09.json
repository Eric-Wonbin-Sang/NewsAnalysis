The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) seized the contraceptives in 2018 and 2019. They were found to have passed their expiry date, not been safety tested for the EU market or did not meet laws regarding the display of safety symbols. About 87,500 of the condoms were from a single raid carried out by UK Border Force officials in 2018. Health experts have urged people to check packaging carefully before buying contraception, as products sold illegally could potentially fail to protect against pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. Eliza Bell, spokeswoman for Brook, the young people\u2019s sexual health and wellbeing charity, said: \u201cWhen using condoms it is essential to check the expiry date: if it\u2019s out of date, don\u2019t use it. \u201cEqually, always make sure you\u2019re using a product you can trust by looking out for the BSI kitemark or CE mark on the packaging.

Some 539,000 people experienced a power cut on Sunday with 118,000 left without power by 4pm across the whole of the UK, according to Energy Networks. Flights, ferries and trains all saw cancellations and delays, while drivers faced treacherous conditions with floodwater, fallen trees and other debris closing roads. Train passengers are being advised to check with operators before travelling as there are likely to be some cancellations to early trains as Network Rail engineers work through the night to assess the damage. Motorists are also warned to take care with continued disruption to the road network and tricky driving conditions likely to continue into rush hour. British Airways said there will be a \u201cminor knock-on effect\u201d to Monday\u2019s schedule. Sporting fixtures were postponed including Manchester City\u2019s Premier League game against West Ham and England\u2019s women\u2019s Six Nations match against Scotland in Glasgow. More than 200 flood warnings were issued across England on Sunday, with the town of Appleby-in-Westmorland, in Cumbria, severely hit. The River Irwell burst its banks at Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, while areas including Blackpool, Whalley, Longton and Rossendale, were affected by flooding in Lancashire. The fastest gusts of 97 miles per hour were recorded on the Isle of Wight on Sunday, with 93 miles per hour winds hitting Aberdaron, a village at the tip of the Llyn Peninsula. Inland, Manchester Airport recorded gusts of 86 miles per hour, while 178mm of rain fell in Honister Pass, in Cumbria, in the 24 hours to 4pm on Sunday - around one-and-a-half times the average February rainfall of 112mm. British Airways said in a statement there will be a \u201cminor knock-on effect\u201d to Monday\u2019s schedule. \u201cWe\u2019re getting in touch with those affected, and have brought in extra customer teams to help them with a range of options including a full refund or an alternative flight between now and Thursday,\u201d the airline said. \u201cAny customer flying short-haul to or from Heathrow or Gatwick, can also choose to make changes to their travel plans if they would prefer to fly another time.\u201d Monday\u2019s Guardian front page - Newhaven Harbour features again on the Times front page - Monday\u2019s Mirror front page - The Express\u2019s front - The Telegraph\u2019s splash - Monday\u2019s City AM front - The Independent\u2019s front page - Images from Storm Ciara dominate the majority of Monday\u2019s front pages.

By 7.30pm on Sunday Northern PowerGrid, the energy supplier, had restored power to around 55,600 customers. The majority of disruption was due to the wind and associated debris impacting its overhead network, the firm said. The latest flood warnings for south-west England. Best to have an umbrella and a heavily insulated coat with you this evening.. The Environment Agency has issued the following advice: Services west of Swansea and west Wales are likely to be disrupted on Monday. Charity fund-raiser \u2018Speedo Mick\u2019 has braved the storm and freezing temperatures to continue his walk across the country. The amber warning for wind in places across much of England and Wales until 9pm means that damage to buildings, travel disruption and power cuts are expected. Yellow weather warnings cover the whole of the UK until midnight. The Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said the size of the amber warning was very unusual, and showed how widespread the impact of Storm Ciara would be. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just coastal parts which are likely to see gusts of 70-80mph, but even inland areas, which don\u2019t usually see those strengths of wind.\u201d Burkill added the winds, combined with heavy rain would cause significant problems around the country. More than 100mm of rain has fallen in some parts of northern England and north Wales. Strong winds forced a British Airways flight at Heathrow to abort its landing seconds after touching down on the runway. A video posted on social media showed the BA plane struggling to land during Storm Ciara. The airline said the aircraft went on to land safely after circling the airport. The public has been asked to report any precarious trees, garden furniture or trampolines that could be blown away on to the railway. A Network Rail spokesman said: \u201cIn particularly windy weather, our lineside neighbours are asked to help keep the railway free of any unexpected debris by tying down or clearing away garden furniture such as trampolines.\u201d A high-speed train collided with a tree in Scotland. Storm Ciara is expected to clear by tonight but it will remain wet and windy across the UK tomorrow, the Met Office said. Water levels now falling in Pateley Bridge, Yorkshire. Western Power Distribution says 12,779 of its customers in the East and West Midlands, the south-west and south Wales do not have any electricity. In the UK, about 118,000 people overall were without power as of 4pm, according to Energy Networks. Energy companies said they had reconnected 421,000 customers since the storm hit and work was continuing to restore electricity to the remaining homes. A number of schools in north Wales will be closed on Monday after being damaged in the storm. Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy in Llanrwst will be shut following flooding, while Ysgol y Creuddyn in Conwy will be closed due to a \u201csignificant risk that more slates will fall\u201d, with school officials saying they will re-assess the situation in the morning. Footage of a RNLI lifeboat veering through the storm off the coast of Hastings. A train has been sent to rescue stranded passengers in south-east England. Southeastern have just tweeted that \u201cthe rescue train will be alongside in the next few minutes and passengers will be able to transfer across, and the train will return to Rochester and Faversham. \u201cA connection will be available at Rochester for St Pancras.\u201d The shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, has thanked emergency services, the Environment Agency and communities who he said had worked tirelessly to protect homes and businesses, rescue people and animals from rising waters and reinforce flood defences. He said: \u201cThe reality of the climate crisis is that more extreme weather will happen more often and with devastating consequences. Insufficient funds are being spent on protecting the most vulnerable communities from flooding and the consequences of extreme weather. \u201cMinisters must urgently fund the schemes that these communities say they need as well as put in place longer-term flood prevention strategies with appropriate bodies to prevent flooding and protect homes. The government must act now to protect those communities who are currently underwater, unlike its previous woefully slow response we saw last year.\u201d A British Airways plane is believed to have made the fastest ever flight by a conventional airliner from New York to London. The Boeing 747-436 made the 3,500-mile journey in 4 hours and 56 minutes, helped by strong tailwinds as Storm Ciara blew in. The BA112 flight, which took off from John F Kennedy airport, was scheduled to land at Heathrow at 6.25am on Sunday but arrived 102 minutes early at 4.43am. According to flight tracking website Flightradar24, the plane was one minute faster than Virgin Atlantic\u2019s flight VS4 which was due to land around the same time. The Virgin Airbus A350-1041 made the same flight in four hours and 57 minutes. BA said: \u201cWe always prioritise safety over speed records, but our highly trained pilots made the most of the conditions to get customers back to London well ahead of time.\u201d Advice from John Curtin, executive director of Flood &amp; Coastal Risk Management at the Environment Agency. A school in East Sussex has announced it will be closed on Monday after Storm Ciara caused \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the school building. King\u2019s school in Hove will aim to reopen on Tuesday. A message on its website said: \u201cThe high winds from Storm Ciara have caused significant damage to the school building which needs to be made safe by contractors before the school can safely open to students and staff.\u201d Platforms 1-6 at London Victoria station are closed due to structural damage. London Euston station has now reopened after earlier overcrowding. Part of a cafe and guest house has collapsed into a river due to high winds and heavy rain in Scotland. Police were called to Bridge House guest house and Sonia\u2019s Bistro in Hawick in the Borders at around 9.30am to reports of structural damage. Footage posted on social media showed a wall of the building collapsing into the fast-flowing River Teviot leaving the rooms inside exposed. Emergency services said the building on Sandbed had been evacuated and there were no reports of any injuries. A police spokesman said: \u201cAt around 9.30am on Sunday police in Hawick were made aware of structural damage to the Bridge House guest house. Officers attended and helped the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service at the scene. The building has been evacuated and there are no injuries.\u201d The Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued 15 flood alerts and 64 flood warnings including several in the Borders. The highest wind speed of the day has been recorded at The Needles off the Isle of Wight with gusts of 97mph, the Met Office said. The Yorkshire Evening Post has tracked down a canoeist spotted paddling down a flooded residential street in Leeds. Tony Hargreaves, 45, said he had got the dinghy out to \u201cbrighten up\u201d his afternoon during the floods. Footage of him running onto the flooded Gelderd Road before jumping in the dinghy and beginning to row has gone viral. Gatwick airport warning of flight delays and cancellations: In Wales, a beautiful wooden bridge beloved of walkers has been washed away by the storm. The Miners\u2019 Bridge in Betws-y-Coed, which runs over a tributary of the River Conwy, is no more. The river is almost at an all-time high. In West Yorkshire, the fire service said it attended 106 incidents between 8am and 2.15pm and received 671 emergency calls about flooding in the Calder Valley, Kirklees, Bradford and Leeds. \u201cThe main issues have been around localised flash flooding of small streams and becks, but we have also seen rivers breech in both Calderdale and Bradford districts. There have been some cases of internal domestic properties flooding and there has also been some instances of unsafe structures due to strong winds,\u201d a spokesperson said. They added: \u201cWhilst the rainfall is now easing, river levels remain extremely high in many areas. We are also expecting another band of rain to move across the county early this evening. Our focus is to continue to protect the community and we ask the public to help us in this by not taking any unnecessary journeys and certainly not attempt driving through floodwater.\u201d A crane has been bent over by winds in London \u201clike it\u2019s made of spaghetti\u201d, according to one witness. Lindsey Wells took a picture of the crane by Stanmore tube station at just after 11am and said two fire engines were in attendance. The 36-year-old local resident told the Press Association: \u201c[It] looks like it\u2019s made of spaghetti. It\u2019s lucky it wasn\u2019t during the week, as it\u2019s a very busy, big development.\u201d Police have cordoned off a part of Woking town centre after reports of debris falling from a building. A Surrey police spokesman said members of the public were being asked to avoid the area around Enterprise Place while the building is secured. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve cordoned off an area near Enterprise Place in Woking following reports of debris falling from a building due to the high wind this morning.\u201d This just in from the Cumberland &amp; Westmorland Herald, one of the country\u2019s last remaining independent newspapers, which reports that firefighters have rescued a man from a steep riverbank above the flooded River Eden in Appleby, east Cumbria. The man was rescued from banking opposite the Riverside medical centre and is believed to be uninjured. Cumbria county council says the bridge over the River Eden in Appleby itself is still closed due to the high water levels. Bridge engineers will carry out a detailed inspection tomorrow once the water levels have dropped. In Ramsbottom and Bury in Greater Manchester, residents were evacuated from their homes after the River Irwell burst its banks. Castle Leisure centre is operating as a rest centre for anyone needing a place to stay. Pets are welcome, the council says. In Birmingham, the Sea Life Centre was closed on Sunday afternoon due to a \u201cforeign object\u201d hitting the roof. \u201cAll of our creatures, staff and guests are unharmed and safe,\u201d the centre said. Tickets will be refunded or accepted on another day. The storm made a different sort of impact on air traffic as it helped flights set records over the course of Saturday night by propelling aircraft across the Atlantic on the back of a jet stream. A BA Boeing 747 was believed to have set a new subsonic transatlantic flight record after it landed Heathrow in four hours and 56 minutes on Sunday morning. A Virgin Airlines flight operating on the same route made the crossing a little earlier in four hours and 58 minutes, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. BA said in a statement: \u201cWe always prioritise safety over speed records, but our highly trained pilots made the most of the conditions to get customers back to London well ahead of time.\u201d Plane spotters and others have been chronicling aborted landing attempts at airports, amid multiple flight cancellations. If you have the nerve for it, this is from a livestream earlier today of planes landing - or attempting to land - at Heathrow: Heathrow airport has said it had agreed earlier today with airlines to \u201cconsolidate\u201d the flight schedule in an effort to minimise the number of cancelled flights. British Airways was offering rebooking options for customers on domestic and European flights flying to and from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City, while Virgin Atlantic posted a list of cancelled flights on its website. Rail companies that have issued warnings against travel today included Gatwick Express, Great Northern, LNER, Northern, Southeastern, Southern, Thameslink, Grand Central Hull Trains and TransPennine Express. Avanti West Coast, which runs rail services between London and Scotland, took the decision not to run trains north of Preston. Trampolines are a *thing* meanwhille, with service engineers reporting having found no less than two today This is quite astonishing footage from Scotland meanwhile, where the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) currently have some 63 flood warnings and 15 flood alerts in place. Scotland\u2019s transport secretary, Michael Matheson, said: \u201cThe Met Office is telling us that we are facing a prolonged period of adverse weather, with Storm Ciara bringing strong winds and rain to most of Scotland this weekend. We\u2019re also being told to expect snow and high winds throughout Monday and on Tuesday morning, so there is the potential for significant disruption on the trunk road network, as well as other modes of transport.\u201d The emergency services have already been busy and seem set to have a busy evening ahead. A driver was rescued after their car became stuck in deep floodwater in Blackpool, where the emergency services said they had spent a busy night responding to incidents. In Perth, three people were injured after part of a pub roof collapsed on Saturday evening. Amanda Owen, a farmer and shepherd in Swaledale, one of the highest and most remote hill farms in England, has posted footage that showed a livestock trailer being swept along by what she described as \u201ca flood of biblical proportions\u201d. Images and footage being shared by local people and others give a sense of what only be the beginning of the problems being caused as flood waters over top defences that have been built up in recent years. This was the sound of morning flood warning sirens being sounded in Hebden Bridge. Since then, we\u2019ve spoken to local people in the Calder Valley, who told of watching cars being swept away and water engulfing flood defences that have been built up over the past four years to the tune of tens of millions of pounds since major flooding in Christmas 2015 \u201cWhen we got up this morning it was evidently flooding form 8 to 9am but within an hour or two the river was about to breach its banks and abandoned cars were being swept away,\u201d I was told by Ben Myers, an author in the town who has written about the impact of flooding. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite bad now and it looks certain that scores of businesses will have to shut here and in Hebden. So much was spent and so many promises were made in the past but it feels like there will have to be another rethink.\u201d This is the Guardian\u2019s liveblog coverage of the hurricane-force winds and rain which have rocked Britain\u2019s transport network and caused widespread flooding that is being categorised in some areas as presenting a threat to life. Storm Ciara is bringing fresh misery to communities that have suffered particularly badly in the past in the north of England, such as Yorkshire\u2019s Calder Valley. The Environment Agency has issued a severe flood warning, meaning there is a danger to life, for the River Nidd at Pateley Bridge and Bewerley, in North Yorkshire. There are also currently 214 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action is required, and 177 alerts, indicating flooding is possible. Amid heavy rain and winds of more than 80mph, transport links are also being disrupted amid multiple cancellations to flights, ferry crossings and train services.",

Add to that mix the reduced quarters and it\u2019s a double whammy that stands directly in the path of the development of the league and the players. While aggressive expansion should be celebrated \u2013 and fans of the Tigers, Suns, Eagles and Saints will be celebrating their entry to the competition no matter the result \u2013 what must come with that expansion is a plan to create the kind of environment, and the time, that fosters player and team development. Right now, that environment does not exist.",

In fact, one of the museum\u2019s standout exhibits, named Frontier Violence, is dedicated to the Myall Creek Massacre, in which 11 serving and former convicts and one free settler murdered a group of Aboriginal people \u2013 eventually being brought to trial and found guilty in a landmark case. \u201cThe effect of the barracks and colonisation generally on Aboriginal populations was profound,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe cost of building this nation was Aboriginal land and culture.\u201d In fact, in uncovering stories of loss and dispossession, the new stories in the barracks also reveal Aboriginal resistance and ongoing cultural resilience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ca84b50e33478959ab8525fc284712227aab6a50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca84b50e33478959ab8525fc284712227aab6a50/0_0_4000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HPBM UpdatedRenderings FrontierViolence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HPBM UpdatedRenderings FrontierViolence</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sydney Living Museums</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Frontier Violence exhibit, is dedicated to the Myall Creek Massacre.</p></li> </ul> <p>Visitors will also get to learn about what life was like for the 50,000 convicts who came through the barracks from 1819, just a few decades after the start of colonisation.

When a ball deflected perfectly for Brozovic to volley in, and then Vecino\u2019s shot bounced somehow through Kjaer\u2019s legs two minutes later, they perhaps concluded that fate had decided to kick them somewhere nasty.

      "bodyText": "Right then, I\u2019ll be off. That was an absolute treat from first to last. Bye! That was superb entertainment. Milan played superbly in the first half, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the heart of everything, but after the break it all fell apart for them. When a ball deflected perfectly for Brozovic to volley in, and then Vecino\u2019s shot bounced somehow through Kjaer\u2019s legs two minutes later, they perhaps concluded that fate had decided to kick them somewhere nasty. They tried their best to recover equilibrium, but other than one late Ibrahimovic header they rarely threatened - they ended the game with just two shots on target - while Inter\u2019s confidence rocketed. De Vrij scored with a magnificent header, Eriksen nearly scored with a ludicrous free-kick, Barella fluffed a one-on-one, and then Lukaku applied the coup de grace. It was all spectacularly good fun (if you\u2019re not a Milan fan). 90+6 mins: It\u2019s over! Inter, two goals down at half-time, have stormed back to claim an emphatic victory and join Juventus at the top of the table on 54 points. Lazio are a point behind, and Italy have a proper three-way title fight on their hands. 90+4 mins: Inter break, but as they get towards the edge of the Milan area they stop and head for the corner flag. They nurse the ball there for a while, but then it\u2019s played infield to Moses, who crosses to the far post, and Lukaku emphatically outjumps Kjaer! And that\u2019s sealed it! What a game! 90+2 mins: Milan are pushing for an equaliser, but Inter defend in numbers and Milan can\u2019t get into the penalty area. 90+1 mins: There will be about four minutes of stoppage time. 90 mins: Ibrahimovic hits the post! Paqueta crosses from the left and Ibrahimovic outjumps Skriniar, wins the header and sends it bouncing into the back stick! 89 mins: What a chance for a fourth! Inter clear, and Milan\u2019s defenders all leave the bouncing ball to each other on the halfway line allowing Barella to burst onto it and streak through! He sprints into the area, sprints a little further, sprints until Donnarumma is a couple of feet away and then shoots into him! 86 mins: A Milan attack peters out and Inter break through Lukaku, at least until he is punished for, well, your guess is as good as mine but Simon Kjaer fell over so it was probably something to do with that. 84 mins: A final throw of the dice for Milan sees Giacomo Bonaventura replace Rebic. 81 mins: Milan bring on Lucas Paqueta, who replaces Kessie. 80 mins: Eriksen hits the bar! That\u2019s a fantastic free-kick from the Dane, from 35 yards if it\u2019s an inch, which speeds and dips and beats Donnarumma, but comes off the underside of the bar and bounces away! 80 mins: A couple of substitutions, as Inter bring Moses on for Candreva and Milan bring Rafael Leao on for Castillejo. 79 mins: Andrea Conti is booked for bringing down Eriksen (it looked to me like the Swede accidentally clipped his own heel). 78 mins: Brozovic\u2019s shot from 25 yards or so takes a deflection and bounces harmlessly through to Donnarumma. 75 mins: Milan are now engulfed in a full-blown crisis of the soul. They\u2019ve played phenomenally well, outplayed their great rivals for much of the match, scored a couple of fine goals and still they trail. They appear to have undergone a selfbeliefectomy. 71 mins: The game\u2019s first substitution sees Eriksen replace Sanchez for Inter. And now Inter lead! From the corner De Vrij, diving forward and meeting the ball a little over chest height, sends a header flying across goal and in at the far post! What a header that is! 70 mins: Brozovic\u2019s chip into the area falls for Lukaku, whose shot deflects just wide! 69 mins: Rebic\u2019s lovely turn buys him some space on the edge of the Inter penalty area, but his shot hits Candreva. The ball rebounds to Brozovic, who is dispossessed in a ludicrously dangerous area by Kessie, so he falls over and the referee gives him a free-kick. 67 mins: Milan have a free-kick, 35 yards out, which Ibrahimovic smashes round the wall, but not quite with enough curl to threaten the goal. 64 mins: Not surprisingly, those two goals have taken much of the wind out of Milan\u2019s sails. They\u2019re still just about on top, but they are now finding Inter\u2019s penalty area rather hard to penetrate. 62 mins: Kessie is booked for \u201cfouling\u201d Barella, who really is incredibly tiresome with his constant self-flinging free-kick-seeking madness. 60 mins: This game is absolutely wild. The scoreline massively flatters Inter, but anything can happen from here and that\u2019s just fine with me. 57 mins: That foul wasn\u2019t really worth one yellow card, let alone two and a red. Young clears the free-kick. 56 mins: And a red card for a coach! Christian Stellini, Inter\u2019s assistant coach, has been sent to the stands! 55 mins: Barella and Skriniar are both booked, the latter for pushing Castillejo to the ground, and the former presumably for saying something untoward. 53 mins: Sanchez is played through, pass and run timed perfectly, and Donnarumma comes out of goal to close him down, so the Chilean spins and plays back to Vecino, whose first-time shot goes through Kjaer\u2019s legs on its way into the net! Milan\u2019s lead evaporates in two minutes! Inter are back in it! Candreva\u2019s attempted cross hits a defender and loops into the air, landing on the left foot of Brozovic, 20 yards out and central, who sends a controlled volley past Donnarumma! 51 mins: Good work from Sanchez on the left, who eventually switches to Candreva on the other flank. His cross causes some panic, but Milan hack clear. 50 mins: Barella loses the ball by throwing himself to the floor in search of a free-kick that was never there, and Milan are on the attack again. 48 mins: A bit of a break, after Theo Hernandez goes down and stays there for a while. I have no doubt that he\u2019s completely fine. 47 mins: No changes at the break, either to the teams or, it seems, to the momentum, with Milan back on the front foot. 46 mins: Peeeep! Inter get the second half started! The players are on their way back out. Milan have only lost one game in the last three months (well, three months tomorrow), and as things stand that run is in no danger of ending tonight. He really is extraordinary. His anticipation for his goal, while his notional marker - Skriniar I think - headed off somewhere completely irrelevant, was really very good (though the defender\u2019s haplessness amplified it). He, Calhanoglu and Rebic have been the key players of the first half. Milan have been extremely good, and deservedly lead at the break. Inter have had one good chance, which Vecino sent too close to the keeper, but have been on the back foot for most of what has been an excellent game so far. More (not) soon (enough). Another goal! The corner is swung in, Kessie totally miscues his attempt to volley it in and instead it bounces through to Ibrahimovic at the far post, who heads back across goal and in! 45 mins: Excellent clearance! De Vrij flings out a foot to stop Rebic tapping in Calhanoglu\u2019s cross from the left! 44 mins: Inter have a free-kick from deep on the left, which is hoisted into the box and would quite possibly have dipped under the bar had Donnarumma not tipped it over! 42 mins: Meanwhile in Spain, Betis have just taken the lead against Barcelona for the second time. It\u2019s 2-1 there, Nabil Fekir with the home side\u2019s second. Milan deservedly lead! It\u2019s a long ball into the box, which Ibrahimovic heads down excellently towards Rebic. Padelli launches himself at it in an attempt to stop it reaching the Croatian, but all he achieves is leaving Rebic with an empty net to tap into! 39 mins: Calhanoglu, with a chance to play Rebic in on goal, massively overhits his pass. 37 mins: Ibrahimovic gets into space on the left of the area, but his pull-back is intercepted. Then Barella wins a free-kick with a ludicrous overreaction to Kessie\u2019s foot nudging his own, giving Inter a chance to regroup. 36 mins: Kessie\u2019s shot is charged down. Really there was no chance at all of it failing to hit the defender standing half a yard away, and there wasn\u2019t much point in having the shot in the first place. 33 mins: Chance for Milan! Calhanoglu gets down the right side of the area, and cuts onto his left foot. To their credit, Inter\u2019s centre-backs keep getting themselves in the way of everything, leaving Padelli with very little to do, and this time it\u2019s Godin who blocks the shot. 31 mins: Having said that, there have been no shots for several minutes now. The game still has a whiff of goal-inevitable-and-quite-soon-probably about it. 27 mins: This is such a fun game, high-paced, loud-atmosphered, full of goalmouth action. Milan are knocking on the door again as I type, winning another corner. 24 mins: What a chance for Inter! Lukaku screams past Romagnoli on the right and pulls back for Vecino, whose first time shot goes straight to the keeper! 22 mins: Milan are back on the goal hunt, zipping the ball about from left to right before Samu Castillejo attempts a couple of crosses. One is a little overstrong, the other hits Young and rebounds for a corner, which Padelli claims. 20 mins: The referee gives Inter a free kick, after one of Rebic\u2019s fingers gently flicks Vecino in the upper chest/lower neck area, sending the Uruguayan to the turf clutching his face. It is one of the least free-kicky free kicks I\u2019ve ever seen. 18 mins: A long-range shot deflects to Alexis, whose shot deflects for a corner, which deflects for another corner. This one is headed just wide of the far post by Godin, rising highest in the middle. 16 mins: Milan continue to look most likely. Rebic has a shot from the edge of the area that hits Vecino and rebounds back to him, and his second effort goes wide. 12 mins: A bit of attacking action from Inter, as Ashley Young wins a corner on the left. It\u2019s sent into the area where half a dozen people throw limbs at it, but it ends up in the arms of Gianluigi Donnarumma. 9 mins: Now Milan hit the post! Barella gives the ball away when trying to beat three men inside his own half and Calhanoglu hammers a low shot from 25 yards that screams past Padelli and thumps the meat of the far post! From there it rebounds into a defender and rolls conveniently to Padelli. 7 mins: Another chance for Milan! This time Calhanoglu\u2019s low centre runs to Rebic, who thumps it into a defender when very well placed. 5 mins: Ibrahimovic has the ball, about 30 yards from goal. Two runners sprint past him on the right, and really the pass to release Kessie was an easy one. But the Swede fluffs it, and Padelli collects. 3 mins: I assume that when Milan worked on that corner on the training ground it did not turn out quite so hopelessly. 2 mins: A really bright start from Milan. Now Rebic bursts into the penalty area and wins a corner. 1 min: The first shot of the night comes from the left boot of Franck Kessie, just outside the area, but it hits a defender. A few seconds later, Ibrahimovic miscues a ludicrously difficult volley over the bar. 1 min: Peeeeeeeep! Kick off has now taken place. The players are in the tunnel, and kick off his now imminent. This has taken some serious coordination. It is 61 years since Inter won more than eight consecutive home derbies, which is the number they\u2019re currently on. They managed nine in a row ending in 1959, and 10 in a row ending in 1938. In other news, tonight\u2019s referee is Fabio Maresca. It is his fourth Inter game of the season (they\u2019ve won the other three) and his second Milan match (they lost the other one). While we wait for today\u2019s game to kick off, here are highlights of Inter\u2019s 2-0 derby win in September: Christian Eriksen, you\u2019ll notice, is not in the Inter line-up. He\u2019s on the bench along with Victor Moses and Samir Handanovic, Inter\u2019s not-quite-fit-enough captain and first-choice goalkeeper. The team sheets are in, and today\u2019s starting line-ups look like this: Internazionale: Padelli, Godin, De Vrij, Skriniar, Candreva, Vecino, Brozovic, Barella, Young, Sanchez, Lukaku. Milan: Donnarumma, Conti, Kj\u00e6r, Romagnoli, Hernandez, Castillejo, Kessi\u00e8, Bennacer, Rebic, Hakan; Ibrahimovic. Hello world! Well here\u2019s a treat! Instead of an afternoon watching Manchester City and West Ham battle against Storm Ciara, I get an evening with the Milan derby. Thanks Ciara! Inter will join Juventus on 54 points after 23 games if they win, while victory would take Milan from a slightly embarrassing level-with-Cagliari 32 points to 35, enough for sixth place. There will be plenty of familiar faces for those anglophiles whose attention rarely wanders as far as Italy: Zlatan Ibahimovic is in the Milan squad (as is Asmir Begovic, though he has less chance of actually playing), while Inter have a squad stuffed with Premier League outcasts, including Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez, Christian Eriksen, Victor Moses and Ashley Young, all of whom played in last week\u2019s 2-0 win at Udinese (Sanchez off the bench). This fixture has a pretty one-sided recent history: of the 18 matches since Milan won the 2011 Supercoppa Inter have won nine and lost two (plus a third after extra time, which either counts or doesn\u2019t depending on the rules you\u2019re playing by). When they last met in September Inter won 2-0. Can Milan put up more of a fight playing away from home (kind of)? We\u2019re about to find out!",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes the most forgettable of games leave the most indelible of impressions. Not for 20 years has a Calcutta Cup fixture been played in more atrocious conditions and seldom have so many travelling fans experienced so many problems getting home afterwards. For those left stranded by cancelled trains and planes, flying to Kolkata for the weekend would have involved slightly less hassle. In one case an easyJet plane which had flown from Edinburgh to Stansted was forced to abort its landing at the last moment and return to Scotland. Bemused passengers were subsequently informed their next available flight would depart on Tuesday. With flooding close to the airport having also left car rental firms unable to release most of their vehicles, only a fortunate few made it back on schedule. England\u2019s players and management were among the luckier ones, having dodged the chaos by taking a prompt flight south on Saturday night. Rugby-wise, they also managed to emerge shaken but, ultimately, not stirred. Victory has breathed fresh life into their championship prospects and amid the swirling wind and rain there were enough flickers of improvement to offset the disappointment of their chastening defeat in Paris. Further improvement will be required to win the title but two successive home games against Ireland and Wales now represent an opportunity as much as anything else. England\u2019s pack were good enough in the wet, for the most part, to neutralise Scotland, who should probably have won in Dublin. With home advantage also to be factored in, Eddie Jones will be disappointed if they fail to rise to the Irish challenge.

Jansson, who turns 29 on Thursday, is determined to lead a vibrant Brentford side into the Premier League but when time permits he returns to his Swedish roots, making use of his season ticket by joining the ultras on the terraces. \u201cI always travelled to away games and at home would stand with the fans that sing but when I signed for Malm\u00f6 I needed to be in the VIP section with the Under-17s and Under-19s, but I didn\u2019t really like that.

But it has changed a little bit, I mean with what happened with Malm\u00f6 and when he invested in a rival to us. But still, that is how he is as a businessman and as a footballer I still adore him.\u201d</p> <p>Ibrahimovic\u2019s involvement with Hammarby has left Jansson torn and supporters sore since November, when the striker declared Malm\u00f6\u2019s top-flight rivals could become \u201cthe biggest club in Scandinavia\u201d, prompting angry fans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/08/zlatan-ibrahimovic-statue-vandalised\" title=\"\">decapitate a 500kg bronze statue</a> depicting their former striker, which had been unveiled outside the Malm\u00f6 Stadion to much fanfare a month earlier.</p> <p>\u201cThe son of Malm\u00f6, Zlatan, going to invest in another club and saying I want to make them the biggest in Scandinavia, I think it hurts in the hearts of the Malm\u00f6 fans.

It was the same against QPR, when they lost 1-0. They were good enough to win so sometimes it is just small things.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not so much in this time of year \u2013 I think this time of year I was flying, playing really good \u2013 but around March and the beginning of April, especially after the international break, I felt really tired.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe that was because I became a father and maybe I was not sleeping as well, but you would have to ask every individual to get a true answer. Towards the end of last season I felt more mentally tired than physically tired. Maybe it is a common thing and this year it is happening the same as last year for them, but it is difficult to say.\u201d</p> <p>Jansson insists his reluctance to allow Aston Villa to score an equaliser at Elland Road in April at Bielsa\u2019s request did not blemish his relationship with the Argentinian, despite being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/09/pontus-jansson-leeds-needed-money-brentford-bielsa-language\" title=\"\">allowed to join Brentford</a> on a three-year contract three months later.</p> <p>Leeds had taken the lead when Villa had a player down injured and asked for the game to be stopped. Bielsa then instructed his players to allow Villa to score but Jansson was not happy with this and attempted an unsuccessful one-man mission to prevent the goal.</p> <p>\u201cI grew a lot last season, the things that I learned from him and we learned as a team, they are things I will take with me for the rest of my life. I learned so much: how to take care of your body; how well-trained you have to be to play in such a good team; how you have to be on the pitch both physically and mentally; how to learn to read the game, so many things that you could learn from. He also had bad sides \u2013 every person has a bad side \u2013 but there are so many things I learned from Bielsa.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f33d239832ccef738f9dfc150f1dde392b040ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f33d239832ccef738f9dfc150f1dde392b040ab/0_135_2758_1917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pontus Jansson (left) in discussion with Marcelo Bielsa (fourth from the left) during the game against Aston Villa in April, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pontus Jansson (left) in discussion with Marcelo Bielsa (fourth from the left) during the game against Aston Villa in April, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jansson is holding court in an unpretentious portable building on a crisp day at Brentford\u2019s training ground, where planes on the final descent into Heathrow hang overhead. He is a towering figure but a gentle giant, warm company and after this interview he gives a thumbs-up to an autograph hunter cradling a Brentford shirt. Asked if he feels misunderstood, Jansson pauses for thought. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s an easy thing to do, especially nowadays with social media because it is so easy to find one bad thing about a player and you can spread it around the country and around the world.</p> <p>\u201cI have done some bad things on the pitch, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/28/leeds-aston-villa-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">the Aston Villa incident</a>, but that is just how I am. On the pitch maybe I am not the best person but off the pitch I am always respectful. Maybe it has changed a little bit over the years. When I came three years ago, I needed to come into the league and make myself a name but now, four years later, I am more taking care of my teammates as a captain and trying to help them perform well than looking to myself.\u201d</p> <p>His impact at Brentford is clear \u2013 they boast the Championship\u2019s best defensive record \u2013 and he has big hopes for this season. \u201cIf I could choose the top two teams to go up, I\u2019d choose us and them [Leeds], of course,\u201d Jansson says. \u201cI still have Leeds on my heart \u2013 that does not change just because I left. I will love Leeds until I die, and the same with Brentford. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I don\u2019t want Leeds to lose every game now, because I want us to pass them in the table.</p> <p>\u201cI still have a lot of friends in the team, I talk to the owner and some of the staff, so I want the best for them, but it is difficult when you are fighting against them for the top two spots.\u201d</p>",

But it has changed a little bit, I mean with what happened with Malm\u00f6 and when he invested in a rival to us. But still, that is how he is as a businessman and as a footballer I still adore him.\u201d Ibrahimovic\u2019s involvement with Hammarby has left Jansson torn and supporters sore since November, when the striker declared Malm\u00f6\u2019s top-flight rivals could become \u201cthe biggest club in Scandinavia\u201d, prompting angry fans to decapitate a 500kg bronze statue depicting their former striker, which had been unveiled outside the Malm\u00f6 Stadion to much fanfare a month earlier. \u201cThe son of Malm\u00f6, Zlatan, going to invest in another club and saying I want to make them the biggest in Scandinavia, I think it hurts in the hearts of the Malm\u00f6 fans. And even me \u2013 I don\u2019t want to see him do that. He is not as big in Malm\u00f6 as he was before, that\u2019s just a fact, that\u2019s how it is. He has so much money already, it is not as though he needs to invest, so I understand why Malm\u00f6 fans are angry but vandalism and racism are not acceptable.\u201d There is so much to talk to Jansson about: from how to stop Brentford\u2019s BMW frontline of Sa\u00efd Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins in training to laughing about being outnumbered in the dressing room by several Danes, including the head coach, Thomas Frank \u2013 \u201cI am on my own against seven or eight Danish players\u201d \u2013 but with his former club Leeds at Griffin Park on Tuesday and Jansson set to return from a hip injury, conversation sticks on those recurring accusations of burnout under Marcelo Bielsa. After a 2-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Saturday Leeds have won two of their past 11 matches. \u201cIf you look at the Arsenal game [in the FA Cup], I was there at the Emirates and Leeds played fantastic. It was the same against QPR, when they lost 1-0. They were good enough to win so sometimes it is just small things. \u201cMaybe not so much in this time of year \u2013 I think this time of year I was flying, playing really good \u2013 but around March and the beginning of April, especially after the international break, I felt really tired. \u201cMaybe that was because I became a father and maybe I was not sleeping as well, but you would have to ask every individual to get a true answer. Towards the end of last season I felt more mentally tired than physically tired. Maybe it is a common thing and this year it is happening the same as last year for them, but it is difficult to say.\u201d Jansson insists his reluctance to allow Aston Villa to score an equaliser at Elland Road in April at Bielsa\u2019s request did not blemish his relationship with the Argentinian, despite being allowed to join Brentford on a three-year contract three months later. Leeds had taken the lead when Villa had a player down injured and asked for the game to be stopped. Bielsa then instructed his players to allow Villa to score but Jansson was not happy with this and attempted an unsuccessful one-man mission to prevent the goal. \u201cI grew a lot last season, the things that I learned from him and we learned as a team, they are things I will take with me for the rest of my life. I learned so much: how to take care of your body; how well-trained you have to be to play in such a good team; how you have to be on the pitch both physically and mentally; how to learn to read the game, so many things that you could learn from. He also had bad sides \u2013 every person has a bad side \u2013 but there are so many things I learned from Bielsa.\u201d Jansson is holding court in an unpretentious portable building on a crisp day at Brentford\u2019s training ground, where planes on the final descent into Heathrow hang overhead. He is a towering figure but a gentle giant, warm company and after this interview he gives a thumbs-up to an autograph hunter cradling a Brentford shirt. Asked if he feels misunderstood, Jansson pauses for thought. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s an easy thing to do, especially nowadays with social media because it is so easy to find one bad thing about a player and you can spread it around the country and around the world. \u201cI have done some bad things on the pitch, like the Aston Villa incident, but that is just how I am. On the pitch maybe I am not the best person but off the pitch I am always respectful. Maybe it has changed a little bit over the years. When I came three years ago, I needed to come into the league and make myself a name but now, four years later, I am more taking care of my teammates as a captain and trying to help them perform well than looking to myself.\u201d His impact at Brentford is clear \u2013 they boast the Championship\u2019s best defensive record \u2013 and he has big hopes for this season. \u201cIf I could choose the top two teams to go up, I\u2019d choose us and them [Leeds], of course,\u201d Jansson says. \u201cI still have Leeds on my heart \u2013 that does not change just because I left. I will love Leeds until I die, and the same with Brentford. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I don\u2019t want Leeds to lose every game now, because I want us to pass them in the table. \u201cI still have a lot of friends in the team, I talk to the owner and some of the staff, so I want the best for them, but it is difficult when you are fighting against them for the top two spots.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The government has launched a consultation on creating up to 10 freeports with special tariff and duty status \u2013 an idea ministers argue will fuel growth but critics say could encourage money laundering and other crimes.</p> <p>The government said it was firmly committed to announcing locations this year so that the first could open in 2021. The idea was first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/02/boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-accused-of-trying-to-turn-uk-into-tax-haven-freeports\">raised by Boris Johnson</a> during his campaign to become Conservative leader.</p> <p>It is proposing zones \u2013 which do not necessarily have to be located in a port \u2013 where no duty is paid on goods until they enter the full UK market, meaning none at all is paid if they are re-exported from the port.</p> <p>Other extra freedoms include duties only being paid on final goods, not on any raw materials that are imported into the area and then processed. Businesses would be exempt from filling out full customs declarations on imported goods.</p> <p>The government has argued that these zones could bring thousands of new jobs and significant investment, notably to deprived coastal areas.</p> <p>There could be measures to \u201creduce the costs of hiring workers working in Freeport sites\u201d, the government said, not specifying how this could be done. The ports could also trial ideas in areas such as customs and transport before they are rolled out across the country. </p> <p>After the 10-week consultation, areas will be invited to bid to become one of the zones.</p> <p>Among half a dozen ministerial quotes sent out to talk up the idea, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: \u201cFreeports represent a fantastic opportunity for our businesses to increase their trade with companies from all over the world. Not only will they help create jobs and level up the UK but they underscore our commitment to championing global free trade, unleashing our country\u2019s potential.\u201d</p> <p>There is, however, some caution about the risk of freeports being used as a base for money laundering or other organised crime.

      "bodyText": "The government has launched a consultation on creating up to 10 freeports with special tariff and duty status \u2013 an idea ministers argue will fuel growth but critics say could encourage money laundering and other crimes. The government said it was firmly committed to announcing locations this year so that the first could open in 2021. The idea was first raised by Boris Johnson during his campaign to become Conservative leader. It is proposing zones \u2013 which do not necessarily have to be located in a port \u2013 where no duty is paid on goods until they enter the full UK market, meaning none at all is paid if they are re-exported from the port. Other extra freedoms include duties only being paid on final goods, not on any raw materials that are imported into the area and then processed. Businesses would be exempt from filling out full customs declarations on imported goods. The government has argued that these zones could bring thousands of new jobs and significant investment, notably to deprived coastal areas. There could be measures to \u201creduce the costs of hiring workers working in Freeport sites\u201d, the government said, not specifying how this could be done. The ports could also trial ideas in areas such as customs and transport before they are rolled out across the country. After the 10-week consultation, areas will be invited to bid to become one of the zones. Among half a dozen ministerial quotes sent out to talk up the idea, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: \u201cFreeports represent a fantastic opportunity for our businesses to increase their trade with companies from all over the world. Not only will they help create jobs and level up the UK but they underscore our commitment to championing global free trade, unleashing our country\u2019s potential.\u201d There is, however, some caution about the risk of freeports being used as a base for money laundering or other organised crime. In a report on illicit financing last year, the European commission said freeports could be \u201cpotentially vulnerable to money laundering or terrorism financing\u201d in the European single market. The European justice commissioner, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, said freeports were \u201cthe new emerging threat\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is something we want to focus more on.\u201d Labour has condemned the idea. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called freeports a \u201crevival of a failed Thatcherite plan from the 1980s designed to cut away at regulation and our tax base\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is very little solid evidence that so-called freeports create jobs or boost economic growth, showing this up as another ideological move from a far-right government.

But fans of either or both writers should understand that change is not the same as abandonment; staying true to the spirit is what matters and Phelps, for my money at least, always cleaves tightly to it.</p> <p>Never more so than here, in fact. The Pale Horse is a Dennis Wheatley-inflected offering from 1961. The woman staggering towards the police station, who collapses and dies just before she reaches it, is Jessie Davies (Madeleine Bowyer). She is found to have a list of names hidden in her shoe, and to have worked for the three women (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/28/rita-tushingham-interview-taste-of-honey-shock-60s\" title=\"\">Rita Tushingham</a>, Sheila Atim and Kathy Kiera Clarke) who live in the pickled snake house in the village of Much Deeping and make their living through palm readings and the like.</p> <p>One of those names belongs to the recently widowed (wife, bath, electrical fault) and even more recently remarried Mark Easterbrook (played by Rufus Sewell, whose face is now so striking that when you see it full on you almost flinch as if hit). And one belongs to the nightclub hostess with whom he is having an affair and whose corpse he wakes up beside one morning. He elects to say nothing of this to Inspector Lejeune (Sean Pertwee, whose voice could now plane doorframes and who may need to be sponsored by Strepsils in years to come) when he is called in by the police to account for his name on the dead woman\u2019s list and to start his own investigations instead.</p> <p>As the mass of connections grows, so does the body count and that miasma of doom. Dead rats in sinks; corn dollies anonymously affixed to Easterbrook\u2019s car and delivered at home to the nervy shopkeeper Zachariah Osborne (Bertie Carvel) \u2013 another name on the list; unsettling rural rituals in the village. You will need a scrubdown yourself by the end of the opening hour.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the suspicions of Easterbrook\u2019s new wife, Hermia (Kaya Scodelario) \u2013 furiously pill-popping and piping vol-au-vents \u2013 are growing, along with her general frustration. By the end of the first half of this two-parter, she has taken to venting them on her soft furnishings with a big knife. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/06/guardianobituaries.gender\" title=\"\">Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique</a> is out in two years\u2019 time and will answer a lot of questions for her, if anybody lives that long.</p> <p>If Hermia is the figure who most obviously encapsulates Friedan\u2019s The Problem That Has No Name that pulsed so strongly at a time \u2013 the adaptation is set the year Christie\u2019s original was published \u2013 when change was in the air, but not yet being felt on the ground, the rest of The Pale Horse lays the scene. The three women of Much Deeping are widely suspected of being witches with much deeper connections to the dark arts than mere palmistry, as women living without men have always been. Easterbrook and his friend Ardingly \u2013 also on the list \u2013 stride through life impregnably sure that no harm can come to them, no matter how many people named alongside them are found mysteriously shuffled off this mortal coil. Misogyny and the power of male entitlement thread their way unobtrusively but consistently through, binding all close.</p> <p>Which is not to say it derails or distorts the plot in any way. That unfolds at a steady, confident pace, with the director, Leonora Lonsdale, as surefooted as her writer, parcelling out twists and treats and fine performances as it goes. Phelps has said that she originally envisaged doing a quintet of Christie adaptations covering half a century of the author\u2019s output, from the 1920s (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/27/witness-for-the-prosecution-review-kim-cattrall\" title=\"\">Bafta-nominated Witness for the Prosecution</a>) to the 60s. The Pale Horse is her fifth and supposedly final outing. But that idea should be slapped on the rump and sent straight back to be stabled for the duration. More, again, soon \u2013 please.</p>",

She is found to have a list of names hidden in her shoe, and to have worked for the three women (played by Rita Tushingham, Sheila Atim and Kathy Kiera Clarke) who live in the pickled snake house in the village of Much Deeping and make their living through palm readings and the like. One of those names belongs to the recently widowed (wife, bath, electrical fault) and even more recently remarried Mark Easterbrook (played by Rufus Sewell, whose face is now so striking that when you see it full on you almost flinch as if hit). And one belongs to the nightclub hostess with whom he is having an affair and whose corpse he wakes up beside one morning. He elects to say nothing of this to Inspector Lejeune (Sean Pertwee, whose voice could now plane doorframes and who may need to be sponsored by Strepsils in years to come) when he is called in by the police to account for his name on the dead woman\u2019s list and to start his own investigations instead. As the mass of connections grows, so does the body count and that miasma of doom. Dead rats in sinks; corn dollies anonymously affixed to Easterbrook\u2019s car and delivered at home to the nervy shopkeeper Zachariah Osborne (Bertie Carvel) \u2013 another name on the list; unsettling rural rituals in the village. You will need a scrubdown yourself by the end of the opening hour. Meanwhile, the suspicions of Easterbrook\u2019s new wife, Hermia (Kaya Scodelario) \u2013 furiously pill-popping and piping vol-au-vents \u2013 are growing, along with her general frustration. By the end of the first half of this two-parter, she has taken to venting them on her soft furnishings with a big knife. Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique is out in two years\u2019 time and will answer a lot of questions for her, if anybody lives that long. If Hermia is the figure who most obviously encapsulates Friedan\u2019s The Problem That Has No Name that pulsed so strongly at a time \u2013 the adaptation is set the year Christie\u2019s original was published \u2013 when change was in the air, but not yet being felt on the ground, the rest of The Pale Horse lays the scene. The three women of Much Deeping are widely suspected of being witches with much deeper connections to the dark arts than mere palmistry, as women living without men have always been. Easterbrook and his friend Ardingly \u2013 also on the list \u2013 stride through life impregnably sure that no harm can come to them, no matter how many people named alongside them are found mysteriously shuffled off this mortal coil. Misogyny and the power of male entitlement thread their way unobtrusively but consistently through, binding all close. Which is not to say it derails or distorts the plot in any way. That unfolds at a steady, confident pace, with the director, Leonora Lonsdale, as surefooted as her writer, parcelling out twists and treats and fine performances as it goes. Phelps has said that she originally envisaged doing a quintet of Christie adaptations covering half a century of the author\u2019s output, from the 1920s (the Bafta-nominated Witness for the Prosecution) to the 60s. The Pale Horse is her fifth and supposedly final outing. But that idea should be slapped on the rump and sent straight back to be stabled for the duration. More, again, soon \u2013 please.",

As well as contract killings, it ran construction rackets in west Rio. \u201cThe question we have to ask is: in whose interest does it serve that Adriano has been killed?\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Alves, a professor of social science at the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro who has studied the state\u2019s paramilitary gangs. \u201cHe could have taken the investigation of the death of Marielle to a new level.\u201d Marcelo Friexo, a leftist congressman who was very close to Franco, said: \u201cAdriano was a very violent person and it is possible he did not want to give himself up alive, just as it is also possible he was executed\u2026 He had a lot of involvement with the Bolsonaro family.\u201d N\u00f3brega, his wife and his mother are named in a criminal investigation into allegations of embezzlement, money laundering and racketeering involving Bolsonaro\u2019s son Fl\u00e1vio, ex-police officer Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz and others. N\u00f3brega and Queiroz had previously served in the same police battalion. Prosecutors believe that Queiroz collected some of the salaries of staff employed in Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet when he was a representative at Rio\u2019s state legislature and paid the money back to him which he laundered through a chocolate shop and properties. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro and Queiroz have denied the allegations. \u201cI always did everything correctly within the law,\u201d Fl\u00e1vio said in December, arguing he is being persecuted. In written testimony last year, Queiroz said he chose cabinet aides and \u201cmanaged\u201d their salaries to \u201cintensify political performance\u201d without telling his superiors, the O Globo newspaper reported. N\u00f3brega\u2019s wife, Danielle Costa, and mother, Raimunda Magalh\u00e3es, were both employed in Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s office. Prosecutors described them as \u201c\u2018ghost employees\u2019\u2026 who transferred resources back to the operator Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz.\u201d N\u00f3brega \u201cwas also benefited by some of the resources,\u201d prosecutors said in court documents seen by the Guardian. In December a Rio court authorised searches of properties \u2013 including the chocolate shop. But this month, a separate investigation by federal police concluded there was no evidence of money laundering in Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s property deals. As a state deputy, the president\u2019s son was instrumental in N\u00f3brega being given a medal by the assembly while he was imprisoned under suspicion of homicide. N\u00f3brega was later cleared.",

Top stories Devastating storms have swept through eastern New South Wales, forcing flood evacuations and leaving more than 100,000 people without power. Residents in low-lying areas near the Narrabeen Lagoon in northern Sydney, and the south-west Sydney suburbs of Moorebank, Chipping Norton and Milperra were ordered to evacuate by the NSW State Emergency Service. Emergency services have been swamped with calls since the deluge set in on Friday, while the extreme weather has caused transport chaos across Sydney. A severe weather warning was issued on Sunday for the entire NSW coast and will remain in place on Monday. Survivors of a Thai mall shooting have spoken of their ordeal. The gunman, a soldier identified as Jakrapanth Thomma, arrived at the mall in Nakhon Ratchasima at about 6pm on Saturday. Driving a Humvee-type military vehicle and carrying weapons and ammunition stolen from an army base, Jakrapanth fired at drivers and pedestrians in the area. Inside the mall, shoppers took cover behind counters and inside bathrooms and stockrooms. Thailand\u2019s prime minister has denied suggestions that arms were not properly secured at the military base where the rogue soldier stole multiple weapons before killing 26 people. Disability support pension recipients were increasingly forced to pay back alleged welfare overpayments as the Coalition government\u2019s botched robodebt scheme progressed, despite repeated claims that the program did not target the vulnerable. As the government faces increased pressure over emails showing it received legal advice the scheme was unlawful, it can be revealed that at least 11,000 disability support pensioners have paid back robodebts in full since 2016, and the value of debts settled in full by these recipients increased by 230% between 2017-18 and 2018-19. Australia Warringah MP Zali Steggall will today release the climate change national framework for adaption and mitigation bill, ahead of its introduction to the parliament in March. Labor deputy leader Richard Marles has not ruled out the party supporting new coal developments, saying it would be a decision for the markets despite previously declaring it would be a \u201cgood thing\u201d if the thermal coal market collapsed. A flight carrying more than 200 Australian evacuees from Wuhan landed in Darwin on Sunday, after being granted delayed clearance to fly from Chinese authorities. All passengers on the Qantas flight carrying 266 people, including 92 children, were assessed as \u201cclinically well\u201d. Australian Bali Nine member, Renae Lawrence, has pleaded for clemency for the remaining five members of the group still in prison, as Joko Widodo arrives in Australia. Lawrence served 13 years in an Indonesian prison for drug smuggling. Thousands in Western Australia have spent the night sheltering from tropical cyclone Damien, which caused significant damage when it made landfall near Karratha in Western Australia on Saturday night. Damien was downgraded to a category two storm on Sunday morning. The world Dr Jiang Yanyong, the Chinese surgeon who exposed the government\u2019s Sars cover-up in 2003, has been under de facto house arrest since last year, according to his friends and family. Leading Democratic presidential candidates have stepped up attacks against each other ahead of the New Hampshire primary, with Joe Biden saying Bernie Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism would turn off voters in moderate states in a general election against Donald Trump. The UK Labour leadership contest has erupted into a bitter row after frontrunner Keir Starmer\u2019s campaign team were forced to vehemently deny claims they had hacked into party membership data. Pressure from a new influx of refugees and migrants on Greek islands has reached a critical point. Unable to leave because of a containment policy determined by the EU, more than 42,000 men, women and children are forced to remain on the islands until their asylum requests are processed by a system both understaffed and overstretched. Facebook and Twitter have refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to remove a video posted by Donald Trump that was misleadingly edited to show her repeatedly tearing a paper copy of his State of the Union address while he was honouring a Tuskegee Airman and other attendees.

Ryan also can\u2019t shake the feeling that his new freewheeling intergalactic lifestyle has plunged his abandoned best mate Tibo deep into depression. And Graham has a more acute form of survivor\u2019s guilt, haunted by dreams of Grace, the wife he was unable to save (a welcome return cameo from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/13/sharon-d-clarke-interview-death-of-a-salesman-blues-in-the-night\">Sharon D Clarke</a>), and paranoia about his cancer returning. Not even the Doctor is safe, plagued in her own dreams and visions by clues about the prophecy of the Timeless Child.</p> <p>Certainly, this show has rarely felt further away from the jolly adventures of a Silurian detective, her lesbian lover and their Sontaran butler. However, what it does do is allow Jodie Whittaker\u2019s Doctor another one of her trademark empowering speeches, forcefully warning Zellin and Akara that humanity\u2019s ability to carry on through whatever challenges the mind may throw at us is a unique example of our strength and resilience. And Tibo ends up getting the help he needs. All we need now is a helpline.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Try not freak out, yeah, but you\u2019re on a floating space platform trapped in a gravitational pull between two colliding planets</strong><strong> </strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>As has often been the case this year, the adventure itself is somewhat secondary to the theme here. Aside from the fact that you do actually <em>need</em> a plot, the whole business with Akara being imprisoned between planets, orbs, quantum fluctuation locks and whatnot was the least engaging element of Can You Hear Me? The Aleppo subplot also felt a little random. Certainly, it allowed for bonus wokeness. The plight of Tahira points out that atrocities in Syria are nothing new, and the Doctor gets to offer another history lesson, telling us: \u201cIslamic hospitals were known for the enlightened way they treated mental health problems.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Life aboard the Tardis</strong></h2> <p>The Doctor is demonstrably lonely at being without her \u201cfam\u201d, even for 24 hours. But it\u2019s something she might have to get used to. This episode dropped the strongest hint yet that Team Tardis might be about to disband. Ryan in particular is unsettled by not being there for Tibo through his depression. \u201cIs this our life now,\u201d he wonders to Yaz, perhaps learning true responsibility, \u201ctravelling with the Doctor?\u201d Yaz points out that she told them they wouldn\u2019t return from their adventures the same, but the idea of developing at a different rate to that of his loved ones and inevitably growing apart is starting to sit uneasily. <br><br>At any rate, Chris Chibnall has hinted at doom on the way. He said t<a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-02-06/doctor-who-finale-cybermen-timeless-child/\">his week</a>: \u201cIn Spyfall Part One, [the Doctor and the team] are buoyant and they\u2019re having fun. Where we leave them at the end of episode 10 is an entirely different place.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fear factor</strong></h2> <p>A story based around nightmares would do well to deliver some proper nightmare fuel. And Can You Hear Me? does not disappoint, the claw-around-the-face moment proving a particular standout, while Zellin\u2019s creepy detachable fingers persistently unsettle. It\u2019s a fact that probably the most marked improvement this year from Whittaker\u2019s debut series is that Doctor Who is scary again. Amen to that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64bc17129696d73a7e7287c3d44c1a2862752217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64bc17129696d73a7e7287c3d44c1a2862752217/0_0_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zellin (Ian Gelder)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zellin (Ian Gelder): go and do that trick with the fingers again, will you?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Mysteries and questions</strong></h2> <p>Meanwhile, details are emerging about the imminent two-part finale. With the episodes now named as Ascension of the Cybermen and The Timeless Children, it will come as no surprise that the Doctor\u2019s second-deadliest enemies will take centre stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big Cyberman story, that last two-parter. There are a lot of Cybermen coming in this series,\u201d Chibnall told the Mirror. \u201cIt might start with one Cyberman, but you\u2019ll see a lot. It\u2019s as epic and emotional as the opening two-parter. I know it takes place across a big distance from space, there\u2019s fantastic spaceships, there\u2019s Cybermen.\u201d</p> <p>But is that really there all is to their return? Next week\u2019s episode is a historical one, featuring Mary Shelley and Lord Byron, and reveals that it was an encounter with the Cybermen that inspired the former to write Frankenstein. Or possibly just the one? Could Captain Jack\u2019s warning \u201cbeware the lone Cyberman\u201d be a reference to Frankenstein\u2019s actual monster \u2013 an abomination arising from the actions of those who would seek to amend humanity? Space and time will tell.</p> <h2><strong>Deeper into the vortex</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad92e4c8adf95e32c34a99317feb44c232a6f20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad92e4c8adf95e32c34a99317feb44c232a6f20/0_0_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yaz (Mandip Gill)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yaz (Mandip Gill): what was all the celebrating for?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Pardon/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Good to know that the Doctor is an excellent tap dancer in a crisis.

Excitingly, he\u2019s being paired up with Alex Kingston\u2019s River Song, and Camille Coduri\u2019s Jackie Tyler to boot. Which is surely the very ultimate in fan service. \u201cIt\u2019s like Jack is the male River and River is the female Jack,\u201d said the actor.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Next time</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s time to visit Mary Shelley and Lord Byron as the series careers towards a conclusion.

The Aleppo subplot also felt a little random. Certainly, it allowed for bonus wokeness. The plight of Tahira points out that atrocities in Syria are nothing new, and the Doctor gets to offer another history lesson, telling us: \u201cIslamic hospitals were known for the enlightened way they treated mental health problems.\u201d Life aboard the Tardis The Doctor is demonstrably lonely at being without her \u201cfam\u201d, even for 24 hours. But it\u2019s something she might have to get used to. This episode dropped the strongest hint yet that Team Tardis might be about to disband. Ryan in particular is unsettled by not being there for Tibo through his depression. \u201cIs this our life now,\u201d he wonders to Yaz, perhaps learning true responsibility, \u201ctravelling with the Doctor?\u201d Yaz points out that she told them they wouldn\u2019t return from their adventures the same, but the idea of developing at a different rate to that of his loved ones and inevitably growing apart is starting to sit uneasily. At any rate, Chris Chibnall has hinted at doom on the way. He said this week: \u201cIn Spyfall Part One, [the Doctor and the team] are buoyant and they\u2019re having fun. Where we leave them at the end of episode 10 is an entirely different place.\u201d Fear factor A story based around nightmares would do well to deliver some proper nightmare fuel. And Can You Hear Me? does not disappoint, the claw-around-the-face moment proving a particular standout, while Zellin\u2019s creepy detachable fingers persistently unsettle. It\u2019s a fact that probably the most marked improvement this year from Whittaker\u2019s debut series is that Doctor Who is scary again. Amen to that. Mysteries and questions Meanwhile, details are emerging about the imminent two-part finale. With the episodes now named as Ascension of the Cybermen and The Timeless Children, it will come as no surprise that the Doctor\u2019s second-deadliest enemies will take centre stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big Cyberman story, that last two-parter. There are a lot of Cybermen coming in this series,\u201d Chibnall told the Mirror. \u201cIt might start with one Cyberman, but you\u2019ll see a lot. It\u2019s as epic and emotional as the opening two-parter. I know it takes place across a big distance from space, there\u2019s fantastic spaceships, there\u2019s Cybermen.\u201d But is that really there all is to their return? Next week\u2019s episode is a historical one, featuring Mary Shelley and Lord Byron, and reveals that it was an encounter with the Cybermen that inspired the former to write Frankenstein. Or possibly just the one? Could Captain Jack\u2019s warning \u201cbeware the lone Cyberman\u201d be a reference to Frankenstein\u2019s actual monster \u2013 an abomination arising from the actions of those who would seek to amend humanity? Space and time will tell. Deeper into the vortex Good to know that the Doctor is an excellent tap dancer in a crisis. You never know when you might need that. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what big anniversary Yaz and her sister Sonia were marking? Was it just the day that Yaz didn\u2019t run away and got her confidence? Slightly odd ritual. Speaking of which, as we were following Yaz through a home visit, it was a shame not to see another appearance from Shobna Gultai as her mum. Meanwhile, exciting news from a different corner of the Whoniverse. John Barrowman may not be coming back on TV this year, but Captain Jack will be returning in a new series of the excellent Big Finish audio plays. Excitingly, he\u2019s being paired up with Alex Kingston\u2019s River Song, and Camille Coduri\u2019s Jackie Tyler to boot. Which is surely the very ultimate in fan service. \u201cIt\u2019s like Jack is the male River and River is the female Jack,\u201d said the actor. Next time It\u2019s time to visit Mary Shelley and Lord Byron as the series careers towards a conclusion. Get ready for The Haunting of Villa Diodati.",

After leaving his job in 2014, he applied for a new one but prospective employers would not take him on because he had no British passport. He had arrived in Britain at the age of five from Jamaica in 1965. \u201cThey kept asking if I have the right to stay in this country, but I couldn\u2019t prove it.\u201d His partner who also works for the council took on a second job as a cleaner to pay the mounting bills, and they rented a room out to a student. \u201cDonald couldn\u2019t work and we had a mortgage to pay, so there was no choice,\u201d she said. When Donald was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016, he had to pay a \u00a3500 NHS immigration health surcharge in order to receive treatment. He applied for a British passport and citizenship but his applications were rejected. \u201cI knew I was here legally but I was very frightened. I tried to stay under the radar. I daren\u2019t go anywhere or do anything \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to be stopped and told I was an illegal immigrant. A solicitor told me: Immigration could knock on your door any time and you could be taken into detention if you don\u2019t get this sorted. It frightened the living daylights out of us.

Pauline arrived here in 1960 as an 11-year-old and has six children in the UK, all of whom are British. She thought the airport official was joking when he told her she couldn\u2019t get on the flight; later she thought she would be able to sort out the problem in a day or so with a quick visit to the British high commission, but it was 18 months before she was allowed to return home, during which time she lost her job, and her 14-year-old daughter had faced eviction from the family home in Manchester. She had very little money to survive, and had to rent a cockroach-infested room with no windows; kind neighbours gave her food. Phoning her children was very expensive. Pauline was unable to get the correct medication for her diabetes in Jamaica, and was twice hospitalised; on the second occasion medical staff did not think she would live. \u201cI came back in a wheelchair,\u201d she says. Initially she just wanted an apology, but now she is planning to apply for compensation so she can pay her family back for everything they spent on trying to bring her home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/06/windrush-victims-still-waiting-for-payments\">Only 3% of Windrush claimants have so far received compensation</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Herman Campbell</strong>, 53, did not seek help from anyone to fill in his form and believes this may be why he was offered just \u00a3250 in compensation. He arrived in the UK from Jamaica at the age of eight in 1975, and went to primary and secondary school in Britain. When he applied for a British passport in the 1990s, he was told the Home Office had no record of him. As a result of having no documentation he had problems securing housing; later he was refused re-entry into the UK in 2017 after a holiday in Turkey (travelling on his Jamaican passport). He was alarmed to be told by Turkish border officials that he could face deportation to Jamaica, a country he has not visited since he was a child. \u201cI was properly distressed.\u201d After a week his family were able to send documents proving that Britain had been his home for 42 years, and he was able to return to the UK. A letter from the compensation scheme notes: \u201cWe acknowledge the stress, frustration and worry you experienced during this period. Therefore ... you are eligible for an award of \u00a3250.\u201d He described the payment offered as \u201coffensive\u201d, given his decades-long struggle to prove his status. He wonders if he should have sought help to demonstrate how seriously his life has been affected. \u201cThey said they are going to right the wrongs done to the Windrush people, but this is an insult,\u201d he said. The letter describes this as a \u201cfinal award\u201d but the Home Office said that he could ask for a review of the sum allocated.</p>",

Her daughter sent a letter to David Cameron asking for assistance, but was referred back to the Home Office, which would not help. \u201cI was six months out of my home. I suffered a lot while I was there \u2013 not knowing if I was ever going to be able to come back. It was hell.\u201d She has begun to put together evidence for a compensation claim, but is finding it difficult to compile all the necessary documentation. Donald Biggs, 59, worked as a social worker for Manchester city council for 25 years. After leaving his job in 2014, he applied for a new one but prospective employers would not take him on because he had no British passport. He had arrived in Britain at the age of five from Jamaica in 1965. \u201cThey kept asking if I have the right to stay in this country, but I couldn\u2019t prove it.\u201d His partner who also works for the council took on a second job as a cleaner to pay the mounting bills, and they rented a room out to a student. \u201cDonald couldn\u2019t work and we had a mortgage to pay, so there was no choice,\u201d she said. When Donald was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016, he had to pay a \u00a3500 NHS immigration health surcharge in order to receive treatment. He applied for a British passport and citizenship but his applications were rejected. \u201cI knew I was here legally but I was very frightened. I tried to stay under the radar. I daren\u2019t go anywhere or do anything \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to be stopped and told I was an illegal immigrant. A solicitor told me: Immigration could knock on your door any time and you could be taken into detention if you don\u2019t get this sorted. It frightened the living daylights out of us. I\u2019d paid taxes here for decades. The more I think about it the more it makes me angry.\u201d He is in the process of applying for compensation. \u201cI kept it from my children, I felt so ashamed. It\u2019s hard to put a figure on that. I just want justice.\u201d Pauline Clear, 69, a social worker who specialises in mental health, almost died when she was prevented from returning to the UK after a holiday in Jamaica in 2004. Pauline arrived here in 1960 as an 11-year-old and has six children in the UK, all of whom are British. She thought the airport official was joking when he told her she couldn\u2019t get on the flight; later she thought she would be able to sort out the problem in a day or so with a quick visit to the British high commission, but it was 18 months before she was allowed to return home, during which time she lost her job, and her 14-year-old daughter had faced eviction from the family home in Manchester. She had very little money to survive, and had to rent a cockroach-infested room with no windows; kind neighbours gave her food. Phoning her children was very expensive. Pauline was unable to get the correct medication for her diabetes in Jamaica, and was twice hospitalised; on the second occasion medical staff did not think she would live. \u201cI came back in a wheelchair,\u201d she says. Initially she just wanted an apology, but now she is planning to apply for compensation so she can pay her family back for everything they spent on trying to bring her home. Herman Campbell, 53, did not seek help from anyone to fill in his form and believes this may be why he was offered just \u00a3250 in compensation. He arrived in the UK from Jamaica at the age of eight in 1975, and went to primary and secondary school in Britain. When he applied for a British passport in the 1990s, he was told the Home Office had no record of him. As a result of having no documentation he had problems securing housing; later he was refused re-entry into the UK in 2017 after a holiday in Turkey (travelling on his Jamaican passport). He was alarmed to be told by Turkish border officials that he could face deportation to Jamaica, a country he has not visited since he was a child. \u201cI was properly distressed.\u201d After a week his family were able to send documents proving that Britain had been his home for 42 years, and he was able to return to the UK. A letter from the compensation scheme notes: \u201cWe acknowledge the stress, frustration and worry you experienced during this period. Therefore ... you are eligible for an award of \u00a3250.\u201d He described the payment offered as \u201coffensive\u201d, given his decades-long struggle to prove his status. He wonders if he should have sought help to demonstrate how seriously his life has been affected. \u201cThey said they are going to right the wrongs done to the Windrush people, but this is an insult,\u201d he said. The letter describes this as a \u201cfinal award\u201d but the Home Office said that he could ask for a review of the sum allocated.",

      "bodyText": "Disability support pension recipients were increasingly forced to pay back alleged welfare overpayments as the government\u2019s botched robodebt scheme progressed, despite repeated claims that the program did not target the vulnerable. As the government faces increased pressure over emails showing it received legal advice the scheme was unlawful, it can be revealed that at least 11,000 disability support pensioners have paid back robodebts in full since 2016, and the value of debts settled in full by these recipients increased by 230% between 2017-18 and 2018-19. The legality of the scheme was already under scrutiny \u2013 with the government facing a federal court challenge \u2013 as more money was extracted from disability support pensioners, who were on track to give up a record amount in the six months to December. The government settled the case in November. Now, many of the 600,000 debts issued are under a legal cloud, as the government faces the prospect of being forced to refund thousands of welfare recipients issued debts solely based on the flawed \u201cincome averaging\u201d methodology. Bill Shorten, Labor\u2019s government services spokesman, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAssurances by the government that they have not been using robodebt on vulnerable people have been revealed to be plainly false.\u201d Individual robodebt cases against the vulnerable \u2013 including a $14,500 debt against a disability support pensioner \u2013 have previously been reported, but the government has always played down the number of vulnerable people captured by the scheme. When the Guardian in August revealed a secret proposal to significantly expand the program to target people aged over 65 and other \u201csensitive groups\u201d, which would include people with disabilities, the government said it was not \u201cconsidering any proposal to commence online compliance for vulnerable Australians\u201d. The new figures, provided to the Senate in response to questions from Labor, add to the evidence that people who the public would consider vulnerable have increasingly been drawn into the scheme. They show disability support pensioners paid back $7.7m in robodebts throughout 2018-19, up from $2.3m in 2017-18. In the six months to 31 December 2019, they had already paid back $7.2m. Among those receiving Sickness Allowance \u2013 paid at the Newstart rate for people unable to work due to a medical condition \u2013 Centrelink raked in $2.8m in 2018-19, an increase from $1.6m over the previous 12 months. Again, 2019-20 was set to be the most lucrative year for Centrelink among this group, with $2.2m already paid back in just six months. However, the data only covers debts paid back in full, meaning it is likely that the total number of debts issued and the value of those alleged overpayments would be much larger. The government has previously said it issued about 600,000 debts worth about $1.9bn as part of the scheme, though most of that money has not yet been paid back. In general, the scheme has focused on alleged overpayments from Newstart, Youth Allowance and parenting payment. A spokesman for Services Australia, Hank Jongen, told the Canberra Times in November that an \u201cearly change to the program\u201d made by the agency was that it would not conduct income compliance reviews for people with vulnerability indicators. But under Centrelink\u2019s processes, disability support pension recipients are not automatically given a vulnerability indicator on their file. Shorten said: \u201cServices Australia touted improvements to the system to spare the vulnerable, but these figures obtained by Labor in the Senate show the opposite.\u201d The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said she was also deeply concerned the data appeared to show the government had been \u201csignificantly targeting people on disability support pension\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re on disability support pension, you already have a whole range of issues you are dealing with, and I would suggest that they are more vulnerable to the pressure of getting a notice,\u201d she said. The government said in November it had raised more than $15m through the robodebt program from 9,149 people with a vulnerability indicator. The Department of Human Services, now Services Australia, has also previously said only a \u201csmall number\u201d of pensioners were targeted in online compliance reviews. Within its submission to the Senate inquiry into the robodebt program, it said 4% of all income reviews were targeted at disability pensioners. This would equate to 34,000 robodebt reviews of disability pensioners, according to a total of 850,000 reviews recorded by the agency between 2016-2019. The data published in the Senate showed that in 2018-19, Centrelink seized $182,292 from tax returns over disability support pension debts, an increase of 1,897% from the previous year. Jongen said the data \u201cdoes not represent an increase in review activity\u201d. He said there had been no increased focus on disability pensioners but would not say why the value of debts paid back in full among disability support pensioners had dramatically increased. Addressing increase in tax refund garnishees, he added: \u201cThe statistics reflect an overall trend in the number of former customers meeting the criteria for tax refund garnisheeing which occurred across all payment types during the 2018-19 financial year. \u201cTax refund garnisheeing for 2018-19 mostly reflects the finalisation of older reviews initiated up to three years earlier.\u201d The government is under pressure to reveal when it received legal advice that the robodebt scheme was unlawful. It has so far refused, citing an ongoing class action launched by Gordon Legal late last year. Do you have a story? luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "All the action from around Europe. A stalemate between the top two in the Bundesliga, though that point will surely be better received by Julian Nagelsmann and co, even if they failed to put away a flurry of second-half chances. Marcel Sabitzer and Timo Werner passed up the best openings, while Dayot Upamecano, who does not turn 22 until October, was outstanding in defender. For Bayern, Alphonso Davies was electric, Manuel Neuer erratic in front of the watching Joachim L\u00f6w and Leon Goretzka guilty of squandering a golden chance to win it. 90+2 min: Pavard is booked for upending Werner. That is soft. 90+1 min: Leipzig counter at speed but Lookman delays his cross for Werner, who is bouncing up and down at the back post crying out for the ball. In the end Kimmich intercepts and Leipzig\u2019s late charge quickly dissipates. 90 min: There will be three added minutes. 88 min: Pavard is inches away from connecting with a dangerous quick free-kick \u2013 but in the end Bayern\u2019s brilliant delivery goes begging. Leipzig had totally switched off. 85 min: That Goretzka effort is the midfielder\u2019s last meaningful contribution, with Kingsley Coman summoned as Hansi Flick makes his final change. Coman makes an immediate impact too, releasing Bayern on a counterattack which fizzles out when Lewandowski failed to trap a cross from the right. 82 min: Ademola Lookman jumps off the bench to replace Nkunku. 79 min: Goretzka goes close! Gulacsi pulls off a fine save down to his right to prevent Bayern from opening the scoring. It was a neat move, with Goretzka playing a nonchalant give-and-go with Lewandowski on the edge of the box. Having peeled off his marker, Goretzka then zoomed into the box and took aim, but Gulacsi dived down to get a strong right hand to the midfielder\u2019s side-footed effort. If anything, Goretzka\u2019s failure to generate much power allowed the Leipzig goalkeeper to get to grips with his strike. 76 min: Neuer comes zooming out of goal to head the ball away from Werner, but this time his intervention is far more measured and composed. The sweeper-keeper has lived up to his name this evening in Munich, but not always for the right reasons. A cent for Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s thoughts when Neuer came recklessly dashing out of goal earlier on, presenting Werner with a chance. 74 min: An overzealous Angelino goes in a bit rash on Alaba but the Bayern defender gets on with things. As it happens, Leipzig carve out another opening, with an inviting ball flashing across goal before Bayern can help it to safety. 71 min: Werner slides the ball into Schick and Hernandez does well to get across and make the block. Leipzig have definitely upped the ante this half. 69 min: And now Leipzig and Julian Nagelsmann roll the dice. Patrik Schick replaces Dani Olmo. 68 min: Lucas Hernandez replaces Boateng. 66 min: Dayot Upamecano makes a monstrous block to deny Davies a clean shot at goal inside the box after repelling Coutinho\u2019s initial cross. The ball in from Coutinho was dangerous and the defender\u2019s clearance unconvincing but he made amends by getting in the way of Davies\u2019 strike. Bayern are being made to dig deep. 63 min: Another huge chance goes begging for Leipzig. Nkunku drives into acres of space vacated by Boateng before unselfishly laying the ball on a plate for Timo Werner to finish, but the striker gets his bearings all wrong. Werner\u2019s connection with the cross is sound but his direction way off target. Head-in-hands stuff. Despite enjoying the better of the first half, Bayern can count themselves very lucky. 60 min: Coutinho replaces Gnabry. No time like the present, and all that. 56 min: It comes to nothing and, soon after, Bayern end up giving another sloppy foul away as Kimmich catches Timo Werner 30 yards from goal. Angelino clips it in towards the back post but it\u2019s aimless and Bayern gobble it up. 55 min: Bayern have to settle for a corner instead. 54 min: VAR has its say: no penalty. 53 min: Dayot Upamecano undoubtedly fouls the striker, but Lewandowski appeared to be offside upon collecting the ball in the box. VAR is checking it ... 53 min: Penalty to Bayern Munich ... ! 52 min: Serge Gnabry tries to surge beyond his marker but ... oh no you don\u2019t, says Lukas Klostermann. The Leipzig defender does superbly, not only shutting off the avenue but coming away with the ball, too. Bayern have been a bit out of sorts in this second half, which has given much encouragement to Leipzig. 49 min: Leipzig go close again! Neuer is a very lucky boy. A moment of madness from the Bayern goalkeeper, who wildly charges out of goal to meet Timo Werner and ends up in no man\u2019s land. Werner cannot believe his luck, shoots at an empty goal from an acute angle but David Alaba slings himself to ground and gets a block in. The shot smacks his arm but he can do nothing about it. 46 min: What. A. Chance! Adams miskicks his shot after latching on to a cross from the right, fluffing his lines by swiping at the ball but then Leipzig get a second bite. But the skipper Marcel Sabitzer gets underneath the rebound and sends the ball sailing over Manuel Neuer\u2019s crossbar. Bayern get away with one. 46 min: Bayern get us back under way at the Allianz Arena. Bayern have dominated but have nothing to show for it. 44 min: Davies wins another free-kick, this time off Adams. The Bayern full-back has been exceptional and, while not truly tested defensively, he has not given Leipzig a moment\u2019s rest. 43 min: Leipzig could do with the half-time whistle. 39 min: Lewandowski has an effort cleared off the line! The striker very nearly started and finished a fine move, with Lewandowski freeing M\u00fcller down the right flank before charging towards the back post to meet his team-mate\u2019s hanging cross. Lewandowski does everything right but Dayot Upamecano dangles a leg at it and that intervention is enough to prevent it from nestling in the net and, instead, Bayern garner a corner. Somehow Bayern are without a goal. Up in the stands even Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, whose Tottenham side take on Leipzig in the Champions League, cannot believe it. 37 min: Gnabry curls handsomely wide! 36 min: Laimer is booked for a crude tug at the shirt of Davies. Klostermann then showed good awareness to eat back at Gnabry but the referee pulls the Leipzig midfielder up on his challenge, as Bayern get another opportunity to kickstart an attack. 35 min: Angelino upends Pavard and Bayern earn a chance to build from the back. The Manchester City loanee has had his hands full so far. Bayern have quite simply been on top in every department. 33 min: Bayern are knocking on the door, with Pavard and M\u00fcller combining down the right flank to almost devastating effect. Pavard, in particular, has had a brilliant game so far, marauding forward from right-back. Among those in the stands to watch this one: the Germany coach, Joachim L\u00f6w. 30 min: Klostermann crosses for Nkunku, but Boateng does brilliantly to nod the ball to safety. That was Leipzig\u2019s best opening to date. Bayern soon break up the other end but a mixup puts paid to their latest dart upfield. 26 min: Thiago smacks the ball into the box, it strikes Halstenberg on the torso and drops kindly for Lewandowski. The Bayern striker powers an effort goalwards but it deflects narrowly past Gulacsi\u2019s left post. More of the same from Bayern, who have absolutely bossed this opening half an hour. 24 min: Pavard surrenders possession as Bayern pour forward in numbers. Leipzig win it back, but then Nkunku is flagged offside and it is back to business for Bayern. 20 min: Leipzig again look for Nkunku over the top, but Davies is quick to snuff it out. The visitors\u2019 game-plan seemingly rests on locating Nkunku, who is yet to have too much joy. Bayern are loving this \u2013 they are hogging the ball and every player except Neuer is camped inside the Leipzig half. 18 min: Alphonso Davies has started like a train down the left, surging forward to the byline before pulling the ball back in search of a team-mate. Julian Nagelsmann needs to do something to stop Bayern flooding forward in wide areas. 16 min: Angelino is fouled by Pavard on halfway and Leipzig earn a little respite, and a chance to pump the ball into the box or similar. They waste it, though, and back come Bayern, bouncing upfield. Thomas M\u00fcller is almost played in but Leipzig survive. 13 min: Leipzig win the ball on halfway, wallop a hopeful pass towards Nkunku and, despite a whiff of encouragement, the move promptly fades out. Timo Werner has cut a very isolated figure up front. He\u2019s barely had a touch. 10 min: Leipzig are clinging on! Davies bombs down the left flank, slides a wonderful ball across goal but Thomas M\u00fcller cannot reach it. Bayern have Leipzig exactly where they want them. It has been a thunderous start by the hosts, which leads me on nicely. \u201cAs \u2018Storm Ciara\u2019 rumbles its way across the UK, can Leipzig cause a storm in Munich and knock Bayern off the top? The way it\u2019s started, I have my doubts,\u201d emails Alex from Dunfermline. 9 min: Laimer is pulled up for a foul and Bayern earn another chance to load the ball into the box. Kimmich sends it on from the left, from about 35 yards out and it drops in a dangerous area. Lewandowski is alert to it but is crowded out before he can get a look in. It is one-way traffic at the moment. Bayern in cruise control. It has been a very impressive, business-as-usual start. 7 min: Kimmich heads at goal at the near post but Christopher Nkunku does well to get across his man and make life difficult. Bayern get a second bite of the cherry \u2013 another corner \u2013 but it comes to nothing. Leipzig will try to calm things down. 7 min: Pavard wins front-foot Bayern another corner ... 5 min: Thiago curls an effort at goal ... Gulacsi saves! It was a wonderful effort from the edge of the box by the Bayern midfielder but the Leipzig goalkeeper is equal to it. Bayern fail to carve out anything of note from the resulting corner but they have settled the better of the teams. Leipzig look a little startled. 4 min: Alphonso Davies does superbly to eat back at Dani Olmo, using his searing pace to race back and keep the Leipzig forward in check. For a moment it seemed Olmo would charge through in goal after finding a pocket of space on the right but the Bayern left-back was having none of it. 2 min: An early sight of goal for Bayern, as Benjamin Pavard\u2019s cross causes panic in the Leipzig box. Gnabry spread possession wide, Pavard whipped in a cross and the ball bounced dangerously. Lewandowski was inevitably lurking but Leipzig clear their lines. Angelino, the Manchester City loanee, is making his Leipzig debut at left-back. Lookman and Ampadu are on the bench. Dani Olmo, RB Leipzig\u2019s marquee signing last month, gets the ball rolling between the Bundesliga\u2019s top two at the Allianz Arena. Here we go! We\u2019ve had the pre-match formalities ... Dortmund\u2019s defeat at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, it is fair to say, will have been warmly received in Munich and Leipzig. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach remain in the race for the Bundesliga title though, as Hansi Flick alluded, this game is being viewed as a straight shootout between the two most likely contenders. Phillipe Coutinho is on the bench again for Bayern, but Flick is confident the Brazilian can have a big say between now and the end of the season. \u201cHe\u2019s been training really well of late,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his best game against Hoffenheim, but it wasn\u2019t his worst either. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s 100% happy with his performances right now, but he\u2019s one of ours and we have to help him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll help us a lot, but we have to be patient. Every player experiences dips in form, and it\u2019s not easy to integrate into such a consistent team \u2013 but he\u2019s fit and I\u2019m positive about the situation.\u201d Bayern Munich (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Pavard, Boateng, Alaba, Davies; Kimmich, Thiago; M\u00fcller, Goretzka, Gnabry; Lewandowski Subs: Odriozola, Coutinho, Cuisance, Hern\u00e1ndez, Tolisso, Ulreich, Coman, Zirkzee RB Leipzig (4-2-2-2): Gulacsi; Klostermann, Upamecano, Halstenberg, Angeli\u00f1o; Laimer, Adams; Sabitzer, Olmo; Nkunku, Werner Subs: Haidara, Poulsen, Forsberg, Lookman, Wolf, Schick, Mukiele, Ampadu, Mvogo Referee: Marco Fritz The young pretenders, RB Leipzig, travel to the beast that is Bayern Munich with everything to play for. Victory for the visitors at the Allianz Arena would cut short the reigning champions\u2019 stay at the top of the Bundesliga. Leipzig trail leaders Bayern by a point but are not exactly bouncing into this fixture, having not tasted victory in any of their past three matches. Timo Werner is promoted to the starting lineup for Leipzig after stepping off the bench against Frankfurt in midweek, while Ademola Lookman and Ethan Ampadu are back among the substitutes. \u201cFor many, Sunday\u2019s game is a final, but I do not want to hear any such talk,\u201d said the Bayern interim coach, Hansi Flick. \u201cThere are another 13 games after this so a lot can still happen.\u201d Kick-off: 5pm (GMT)",

If the government genuinely wants to \u201clevel up\u201d rather than \u201csidestep the thorny issue of gaping economic inequalities\u201d, it could make a start by raising working-age and children\u2019s social security benefits by more than inflation this year following the four-year freeze.</p> <p>You also report (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/06/economists-warning-boris-johnson-election-pledge-output\" title=\"\">6 February</a>) the National Institute of Economic Research\u2019s warning that it would take Boris Johnson more than two full terms to level up the economy. Important as investment in disadvantaged areas is, it will take time for their inhabitants to feel the benefits. An above-inflation benefits increase would have an immediate effect and, as the money is likely to be spent quickly and locally, would boost those same local economies. At the same time, it would help the many on low incomes living elsewhere.</p> <p>Rejection of the widespread calls for an above-inflation increase would mean that a loss of over 6% in real terms would be baked into already low benefit rates in perpetuity, leaving the millions who have borne the main burden of austerity through a raft of social security cuts struggling to get by.

The report\u2019s analysis of disabled people in work is bleak \u2013 disabled people are more likely to be low paid, and are even paid less than non-disabled people with the same qualification level, including a degree. In 2017-18, some 50% of working-age disabled people were not working, compared with 18% of non-disabled people.</p> <p>We know from research done in 2016 by the housing association Habinteg and the Papworth Trust that disabled people living in inaccessible homes are four times more likely to be unemployed than those in suitable housing, therefore access to better housing is vital. The government must ensure that all new homes are built to accessible and adaptable standards, and must instruct local authorities to set ambitious targets for the homes disabled people need.</p> <p>If the government is serious about supporting more disabled people into work, then this is the crucial first step.<br><strong>Celia Thomas</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat spokesperson on disability, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/06/tory-level-up-north-regional-inequality\" title=\"\">Tory plans to \u2018level up\u2019 the north are laughably inadequate</a>, 7 February) demonstrates the inadequacy of Tory plans to \u201clevel up\u201d the extensive damage their policies have inflicted on the poorest areas in country. One of the most shocking and disturbing consequences of the \u00a312bn cuts in benefits is the rise in infant mortality in the most deprived fifth of English local authorities between 2014 and 2017 reported in a <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/10/e029424.full.pdf\" title=\"\">study published in BMJ Open in 2019</a>. Overall, from 2014 to 2017 there were a total of 572 excess infant deaths compared with what would have been expected based on historical trends. The authors estimate that each 1% increase in child poverty was associated with an extra 5.8 infant deaths per 100,000.

      "bodyText": "Imogen West-Knights is rightly sceptical of the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d mantra (Johnson\u2019s vow to \u2018level up\u2019 is as meaningless as it sounds, Journal, 6 February). If the government genuinely wants to \u201clevel up\u201d rather than \u201csidestep the thorny issue of gaping economic inequalities\u201d, it could make a start by raising working-age and children\u2019s social security benefits by more than inflation this year following the four-year freeze. You also report (6 February) the National Institute of Economic Research\u2019s warning that it would take Boris Johnson more than two full terms to level up the economy. Important as investment in disadvantaged areas is, it will take time for their inhabitants to feel the benefits. An above-inflation benefits increase would have an immediate effect and, as the money is likely to be spent quickly and locally, would boost those same local economies. At the same time, it would help the many on low incomes living elsewhere. Rejection of the widespread calls for an above-inflation increase would mean that a loss of over 6% in real terms would be baked into already low benefit rates in perpetuity, leaving the millions who have borne the main burden of austerity through a raft of social security cuts struggling to get by. Yet so far there has been no hint that the promise to \u201clevel up\u201d has any implications for social security policy. Ruth Lister Labour, House of Lords \u2022 Your article (Number of people who work but are living in poverty hits record high, 7 February) highlights some deeply worrying statistics published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The report\u2019s analysis of disabled people in work is bleak \u2013 disabled people are more likely to be low paid, and are even paid less than non-disabled people with the same qualification level, including a degree. In 2017-18, some 50% of working-age disabled people were not working, compared with 18% of non-disabled people. We know from research done in 2016 by the housing association Habinteg and the Papworth Trust that disabled people living in inaccessible homes are four times more likely to be unemployed than those in suitable housing, therefore access to better housing is vital. The government must ensure that all new homes are built to accessible and adaptable standards, and must instruct local authorities to set ambitious targets for the homes disabled people need. If the government is serious about supporting more disabled people into work, then this is the crucial first step. Celia Thomas Liberal Democrat spokesperson on disability, House of Lords \u2022 Polly Toynbee (Tory plans to \u2018level up\u2019 the north are laughably inadequate, 7 February) demonstrates the inadequacy of Tory plans to \u201clevel up\u201d the extensive damage their policies have inflicted on the poorest areas in country. One of the most shocking and disturbing consequences of the \u00a312bn cuts in benefits is the rise in infant mortality in the most deprived fifth of English local authorities between 2014 and 2017 reported in a study published in BMJ Open in 2019. Overall, from 2014 to 2017 there were a total of 572 excess infant deaths compared with what would have been expected based on historical trends. The authors estimate that each 1% increase in child poverty was associated with an extra 5.8 infant deaths per 100,000. There was no significant change in the pre-existing trend in the most affluent areas.

      "bodyText": "Leading Democratic presidential candidates have stepped up attacks against each other ahead of the New Hampshire primary, with Joe Biden saying Bernie Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism would turn off voters in moderate states in a general election against Donald Trump. Sanders has maintained his lead over the other 10 candidates going into Tuesday\u2019s vote, according to a CNN poll released on Sunday, with former mayor Pete Buttigieg in second, Biden in third and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren in fourth. Biden, who has long been seen as a frontrunner in the race, is particularly under pressure to revive his campaign after suffering what he called a \u201cgut punch\u201d result in the Iowa caucuses last week, which saw him come in fourth. Both Sanders and Buttigieg declared victory in a race that was marred by chaotic results, and ended up too close to call. On ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Biden was asked if he thought Democrats can\u2019t defeat the president if they have to defend socialism. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be incredibly more difficult. I\u2019m not going to say \u2013 look, if I don\u2019t get the nomination and Bernie gets it, I\u2019m going to work like hell for him,\u201d the former vice-president said of the Vermont senator. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s a bigger uphill climb running as a senator or a congressperson or as a governor on a ticket that calls itself a democratic socialist ticket.\u201d Trump has already begun waging a negative campaign against the spectre of socialism ahead of November\u2019s election, often singling out Sanders, 78, a self-declared democratic socialist with climate, education and healthcare plans costing trillions of dollars. Biden also called out Buttigieg during an event on Saturday, saying the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city of 100,000 people, lacked experience. \u201cI do not believe we\u2019re a party at risk if they nominate me, and I do believe we\u2019re a party at risk if we nominate someone who\u2019s never held a higher office than mayor,\u201d Biden said at a rally in Manchester. \u201cThis guy\u2019s not a Barack Obama!\u201d he added, dismissing comparisons with Obama during the presidential campaign in 2008, when Biden said he also lacked experience. \u201cWell, he\u2019s right, I\u2019m not. And neither is he. Neither is any of us running for president,\u201d Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on State of the Union on Sunday. He added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t 2008 \u2013 it\u2019s 2020, and we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.\u201d Asked whether \u201cthe Democrats can defeat Donald Trump if they have to defend socialism\u201d, Buttigieg told Stephanopoulos on ABC that it would be \u201charder\u201d. \u201cI think it will be a lot harder. But the bigger concern that I have is further dividing the country. You know, when the campaign says that either you\u2019re for a revolution or you must be for the status quo \u2013 most of us don\u2019t see where we fit in that picture,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd the irony is at this moment, we actually have a historic American majority, not just the line around what we\u2019re against, we need to get rid of Donald Trump, but what we\u2019re for,\u201d he continued. \u201cLet\u2019s hold together and not blow up that American majority.\u201d Appearing on CNN, Sanders was asked about Biden\u2019s criticism that the democratic socialist label would hurt candidates in other races. Sanders said that his agenda \u2013 a higher minimum wage and healthcare system for all \u2013 had \u201coverwhelming\u201d support. \u201cOur agenda is the agenda of working-class and middle-class Americans,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders also addressed criticism of socialism on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, including Trump\u2019s past allegations that Sanders is a \u201ccommunist\u201d. \u201cNo 1, in many respects \u2013 in many respects, we are a socialist society today. We have a huge budget. It puts money into all areas,\u201d Sanders responded, saying that Trump received hundreds of millions in subsidies and tax breaks for his businesses. \u201cThe difference between my socialism and Trump\u2019s socialism is, I believe the government should help working families, not billionaires,\u201d he said. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Buttigieg also addressed criticism that he wasn\u2019t experienced. One Biden attack ad, for example, states that Biden \u201chelped save the auto industry, which revitalized the economy of the midwest and led the passage and implementation of the Recovery Act, saving our economy from a depression. Pete Buttigieg revitalized the sidewalks of downtown South Bend by laying out decorative brick.\u201d Chris Meagher, Buttigieg\u2019s national press secretary, said: \u201cWhile Washington politics trivializes what goes on in communities like South Bend, South Bend residents who now have better jobs, rising income and new life in their city don\u2019t think their lives are a Washington politician\u2019s punchline.\u201d Elaborating on Sunday, Buttigieg said: \u201cMaybe my community does look good from \u2013 does look small from the perspective of Washington. But to us, a lot of times, it\u2019s the infighting in the Washington establishment \u2026 that looks small.\u201d Stephanopoulos asked Warren why she did not raise her hand when asked whether she was concerned about having a Democratic socialist on the ballot during the televised New Hampshire debate on Friday night.

But the fact that a leading financial institution would hire a corporate espionage firm to track senior figures will underscore the image of banking as a rogue sector that operates outside conventional norms.</p> <p>There are even more sinister undertones to the story: Thiam\u2019s most influential supporter \u2013 the bank\u2019s largest shareholder, Harris Associates \u2013 hinted that racism might have played a role in the ousting the Ivory Coast-born executive. Credit Suisse\u2019s chairman, Urs Rohner, said the appointment of a Swiss national \u2013 Thomas Gottstein \u2013 to succeed Thiam had nothing to do with \u201cthe colour of his passport\u201d.

The Credit Suisse affair adds another chapter to the industry\u2019s shameful history.</p> <p>And despite the headlines, the one figure likely to dust himself down and walk into another good job is Thiam. Credit Suisse, on the other hand, might take longer to recover.</p> <h2>Few Super Bowl Sundays for an embattled TV industry<br></h2> <p>The week started well for the embattled TV industry, as the Super Bowl provided its annual super-sized reminder of the power of must-watch TV.</p> <p>Almost 100 million American football fans tuned in, with 30-second commercials going for $5.6m (\u00a34.3m) apiece \u2013 a reminder that the Netflix effect is far from terminal for traditional broadcasters. Appointment-to-view TV, from live sport to hit shows such as <em>Love Island</em> and <em>Bodyguard</em>, continue to pull in audiences and create the kind of shared moments that are lost in an on-demand world.</p> <p>Nevertheless, traditional \u201clinear\u201d viewing is in decline overall, especially among younger audiences, and competition for attention has never been greater. A quarter of British children watched no broadcast TV last year, while twice as many watched streaming content compared with five years ago, according to a new Ofcom report.</p> <p>Last week Disney+, touting its hit Star Wars spinoff <em>The Mandalorian,</em> revealed it had amassed 28.6 million subscribers in just three months \u2013 a new superpower in the streaming wars (Netflix took six years to reach 30 million). And Disney has yet to roll out the service to most of the world \u2013 including the UK, where it launches on 24 March.</p> <p>Google also revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/03/youtube-ad-revenue-google-alphabet-shares\" title=\"\">YouTube\u2019s annual global ad revenues for the first time</a>\u2013 $15bn, having grown 36% year-on-year, and 86% on 2017, highlighting the increased focus of ad budgets on digital media. Children spend more time watching YouTube videos than they spend with Netflix, Amazon, the BBC or ITV, according to Ofcom.</p> <p>Broadcasters\u2019 catch-up TV services are doing a good job of bolstering viewing, but they are still struggling to keep up with the pace of change. ITV saw total viewing hours fall by half a billion in the first half of last year, while watching on its online service grew by just 27 million hours. Netflix, Disney and YouTube aren\u2019t out to supplant broadcasters as the home of \u201clive\u201d TV, but the lure of on-demand is making it that much harder to deliver the mass audiences that were once taken for granted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "During the election campaign, Boris Johnson promised ambitious plans for an infrastructure boom to rebalance the economy. Yet since his landslide victory, the prime minister could be accused of dither and delay. Uncertainty about major projects such as HS2 remains, as a battle rages at the heart of government about how the prime minister might fulfil his levelling-up agenda, and how much money he might spend. A decision on the project, which could cost as much as \u00a3106bn, is expected to arrive as early as this week, in an opportunity for Johnson to underscore the extent of his ambition. Is the levelling-up prime minister serious about closing regional productivity gaps? Will the funds be made available to ensure the promises he made at the election are more than just soundbites? If Johnson is serious about narrowing the divide between London and the rest of the country, he must invest with a regional focus. The north of England has spent too long as the poor relation to London in terms of infrastructure investment. The Conservative-led austerity agenda since 2010 only compounded the problem, in a bitter irony that ought not be forgotten as Johnson parades a renewed zeal for infrastructure spending. According to the IPPR North thinktank, the transport spending divide between north and south has widened over the past 10 years of Tory rule. Average annual spending on transport projects rose by about \u00a3409 per person in London, where Crossrail is slowly being built at great expense, compared with a rise of just \u00a3162 per head in the north, where Pacer trains from the 80s still rattle along the rails. If northern England had received the same amount as London, then \u00a366bn more would have been spent: a damning shortfall that goes some way to explaining the regional divisions in modern Britain. Transport investment is crucial for economic prosperity. Regional mayors across the north and Midlands estimate HS2 could generate 500,000 additional jobs. The National Audit Office believes all phases of HS2 would create around \u00a31.40 in benefits for every \u00a31 invested. The use of UK steel would support more than 2,000 jobs in an industry struggling for good news. Better infrastructure can drive up the productivity of the economy. According to economic historians, the Victorian railway boom fuelled growth in the population and economy of Britain, with most benefits felt immediately next to stations and in medium-sized towns. There will be costs for natural habitats along the routes of major railway projects, but rail infrastructure will also play a major role in shifting freight and passenger travel from road to rail and cutting the UK\u2019s carbon emissions. In the past week, the government has tried to underscore its green credentials by sounding serious about decarbonising transport, bringing forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035. The prime minister is also looking for the first town with an all-electric bus network. But that rhetoric must be matched by a detailed roadmap and money to spend.

Credit Suisse scandal disgraces banking again The departure of Tidjane Thiam as chief executive of Credit Suisse is another reputational blow to a banking industry seemingly unable to escape from the cloud of the 2008 financial crisis. Thiam departed following a scandal that involved the bank spying on two former members of staff, which revealed the secretive world of Swiss banking to be a transparently hostile place for some executives.

Credit Suisse\u2019s chairman, Urs Rohner, said the appointment of a Swiss national \u2013 Thomas Gottstein \u2013 to succeed Thiam had nothing to do with \u201cthe colour of his passport\u201d. Even so, appointing an insider is a stark and symbolic contrast with the international perspective that Thiam brought. Only last week, a senior Goldman Sachs employee was barred from working in the banking industry for failing to raise red flags over the 1MDB scandal, where billions of dollars were looted from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. The Credit Suisse affair adds another chapter to the industry\u2019s shameful history. And despite the headlines, the one figure likely to dust himself down and walk into another good job is Thiam. Credit Suisse, on the other hand, might take longer to recover. Few Super Bowl Sundays for an embattled TV industry The week started well for the embattled TV industry, as the Super Bowl provided its annual super-sized reminder of the power of must-watch TV. Almost 100 million American football fans tuned in, with 30-second commercials going for $5.6m (\u00a34.3m) apiece \u2013 a reminder that the Netflix effect is far from terminal for traditional broadcasters. Appointment-to-view TV, from live sport to hit shows such as Love Island and Bodyguard, continue to pull in audiences and create the kind of shared moments that are lost in an on-demand world. Nevertheless, traditional \u201clinear\u201d viewing is in decline overall, especially among younger audiences, and competition for attention has never been greater. A quarter of British children watched no broadcast TV last year, while twice as many watched streaming content compared with five years ago, according to a new Ofcom report. Last week Disney+, touting its hit Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian, revealed it had amassed 28.6 million subscribers in just three months \u2013 a new superpower in the streaming wars (Netflix took six years to reach 30 million). And Disney has yet to roll out the service to most of the world \u2013 including the UK, where it launches on 24 March. Google also revealed YouTube\u2019s annual global ad revenues for the first time\u2013 $15bn, having grown 36% year-on-year, and 86% on 2017, highlighting the increased focus of ad budgets on digital media. Children spend more time watching YouTube videos than they spend with Netflix, Amazon, the BBC or ITV, according to Ofcom. Broadcasters\u2019 catch-up TV services are doing a good job of bolstering viewing, but they are still struggling to keep up with the pace of change. ITV saw total viewing hours fall by half a billion in the first half of last year, while watching on its online service grew by just 27 million hours. Netflix, Disney and YouTube aren\u2019t out to supplant broadcasters as the home of \u201clive\u201d TV, but the lure of on-demand is making it that much harder to deliver the mass audiences that were once taken for granted.",

He suggested the HS2 team currently working on the two northern spurs (phase 2b) should be reassigned to work on NPR within Transport for the North (TfN), a statutory body which advises government on the north of England\u2019s transport needs.</p> <p>They should then build NPR along with \u201ca new, modern, underground station at Manchester Piccadilly\u201d which could accept through trains going from north to south as well as east to west, Burnham said. Only when that is finished, \u201cin the 2030s\u201d, should government continue building the Manchester leg of HS2, digging south from the north to Birmingham, he added.</p> <p>The current cost estimate for NPR is \u00a339bn, but that would be likely to rise significantly if it were built before HS2\u2019s Manchester-Birmingham leg \u2014 not least because the current NPR designs use 80km of HS2 track, including an expensive tunnel from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly.</p> <p>A report by consultants Bechtel, commissioned by Manchester city council, suggested Burnham\u2019s vision of Piccadilly would be \u201cbroadly comparable\u201d to the estimated \u00a31bn-1.3bn earmarked by HS2 for Old Oak Common station, the new \u201csuper hub\u201d planned for west London.</p> <p>Last year Jake Berry, the northern powerhouse minister, <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/northern-transport-crap-admits-northern-16999872\">said he would rather build a new central station in Bradford instead</a>. Since then, the government has suggested NPR should bypass Bradford and go via Huddersfield, according to Burnham. He and other northern leaders oppose that idea on the grounds that Huddersfield already has reasonable rail links, whereas the much bigger Bradford has two dead-end stations.</p> <p>Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, said: \u201cWe need HS2 (both legs) fully integrated with NPR \u2013 including a new line through Bradford. We would very much welcome a proposal to put HS2b and NPR into one project so we can fully integrate and plan delivery in the most effective way.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, environmental protests against the high-speed rail link continue to grow, with six camps currently set up along the route.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/02/fears-grow-over-hs2s-potential-impact-on-biodiversity\">Fears grow over HS2's potential impact on biodiversity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Demonstrators celebrated a victory after they halted the planned destruction of woodland along the HS2 route at the Colne Valley regional park on Saturday.

By the end of Saturday the HS2 operatives abandoned their plans for the weekend tree cutting.</p> <p>A HS2 Ltd spokesman said it was delivering an unprecedented programme of tree planting and habitat creation alongside the new railway and added: \u201cProtests such as this are costly to the taxpayer, cause unnecessary delays and are a threat to the safety of the public and our workers.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson should prioritise a new Transpennine railway line before the Manchester section of HS2, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has said. Following media reports that the prime minister is set to approve the London to Birmingham phase of HS2, Burnham called on Johnson to simultaneously build Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), a new line connecting Liverpool to Leeds. In a noticeable change of tack, Burnham said he wants NPR to take priority over the western spur of HS2, which on the current timetable would not see high-speed trains running from Birmingham to Manchester until the 2040s. The eastern HS2 spur, from Birmingham to Leeds, need not be affected, he said. A number of new Tory MPs in the so-called \u201cred wall\u201d areas of the north of England and Midlands oppose HS2, saying they would rather see NPR built. \u201cGetting from Manchester to Leeds, getting from Warrington to Liverpool, is a priority for people living in the north of England and I suspect that priority is far ahead of getting down to London,\u201d Andy Carter, the new MP for Warrington South, told the BBC last month. Burnham said work on NPR had \u201cstalled\u201d because all of the engineers were preoccupied with HS2. He suggested the HS2 team currently working on the two northern spurs (phase 2b) should be reassigned to work on NPR within Transport for the North (TfN), a statutory body which advises government on the north of England\u2019s transport needs. They should then build NPR along with \u201ca new, modern, underground station at Manchester Piccadilly\u201d which could accept through trains going from north to south as well as east to west, Burnham said. Only when that is finished, \u201cin the 2030s\u201d, should government continue building the Manchester leg of HS2, digging south from the north to Birmingham, he added. The current cost estimate for NPR is \u00a339bn, but that would be likely to rise significantly if it were built before HS2\u2019s Manchester-Birmingham leg \u2014 not least because the current NPR designs use 80km of HS2 track, including an expensive tunnel from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly. A report by consultants Bechtel, commissioned by Manchester city council, suggested Burnham\u2019s vision of Piccadilly would be \u201cbroadly comparable\u201d to the estimated \u00a31bn-1.3bn earmarked by HS2 for Old Oak Common station, the new \u201csuper hub\u201d planned for west London. Last year Jake Berry, the northern powerhouse minister, said he would rather build a new central station in Bradford instead. Since then, the government has suggested NPR should bypass Bradford and go via Huddersfield, according to Burnham. He and other northern leaders oppose that idea on the grounds that Huddersfield already has reasonable rail links, whereas the much bigger Bradford has two dead-end stations. Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, said: \u201cWe need HS2 (both legs) fully integrated with NPR \u2013 including a new line through Bradford. We would very much welcome a proposal to put HS2b and NPR into one project so we can fully integrate and plan delivery in the most effective way.\u201d Meanwhile, environmental protests against the high-speed rail link continue to grow, with six camps currently set up along the route. Demonstrators celebrated a victory after they halted the planned destruction of woodland along the HS2 route at the Colne Valley regional park on Saturday. The park in Hillingdon, on the western edge of London, is home to over 2,400 species of flora and fauna including otters, water voles and tawny owls. HS2 had been granted permission to close the main road running through part of the Colne Valley site this weekend in order to carry out the tree felling. Dozens of HS2 contractors arrived at the site on Saturday morning armed with chainsaws and strimmers. But similar numbers of protesters from Extinction Rebelllion, the Green party and other groups locked themselves on to trees and jumped into hedgerows, preventing any work being carried out. By the end of Saturday the HS2 operatives abandoned their plans for the weekend tree cutting. A HS2 Ltd spokesman said it was delivering an unprecedented programme of tree planting and habitat creation alongside the new railway and added: \u201cProtests such as this are costly to the taxpayer, cause unnecessary delays and are a threat to the safety of the public and our workers.\u201d",

Neither side played particularly well but England took their chance and Scotland didn\u2019t. Scotland had their opportunities but again, as in the Ireland game, they struggled to get over the line five metres out.

They looked more fluent in attack than in their first match against Scotland and seemed far more threatening.

That is probably what told in the end \u2013 England\u2019s ability to keep the suffocating stranglehold on the breakdown and control that better. Yes, they kicked the ball out on the full a lot but, when the crucial moments came, they executed when they needed to. I thought England on the whole got the win they deserved. Neither side played particularly well but England took their chance and Scotland didn\u2019t. Scotland had their opportunities but again, as in the Ireland game, they struggled to get over the line five metres out. England waited for that one opportunity - it was a great kick in behind by George Ford to put the pressure on. They had the set-piece dominance and two phases later they got the try. And that was it \u2013 a one-score game. England fought and ground out the victory and that\u2019s what you have to do sometimes, especially away from home. They\u2019ll acknowledge they weren\u2019t really able to get into their shape on the pitch due to the weather but they did win the territorial battle. If they looked a bit vulnerable anywhere, it was in the set piece. It didn\u2019t function as well as it could early on but it did towards the end. It was a good old-fashioned Six Nations match and both teams will try to move on from it as soon as possible. The great thing is that England have two weeks now to prepare for Ireland. They can hone what they want to do in attack. They will have to be much more accurate and clinical against a confident Ireland side. But I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see a lot more understanding of the shape they want. Ireland impressed me against Wales. They looked more fluent in attack than in their first match against Scotland and seemed far more threatening. One does not expect Wales to get overrun like that in terms of physicality but CJ Stander and Tadhg Furlong led the charge in that regard. It was a bit of a statement really, they won the physical battle and scored four tries and they\u2019ll be off to Twickenham with their tails up.",

      "body": "<p>My friend David Smeeton, who has died of cancer aged 83, was a brilliant and pioneering BBC reporter from 1962 to 1994.</p> <p>He was the BBC\u2019s first Tokyo correspondent from 1973 to 1978. As part of this assignment in Japan he covered stories in China, North Korea, the Philippines and south-east Asia. David later became the BBC\u2019s correspondent in Bonn, West Germany, from 1981 to 1986.</p> <p>He memorably covered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s visit in October 1982 to the Berlin Wall, which she described as a gross monument to a cruel and desolate creed. In 1986 David returned to Britain as the west of England correspondent based in Plymouth.</p> <p>He was born in Gillingham, Kent, the only son of Mona (nee Brockman), a school matron, and Donald Smeeton. His father, a naval officer, was killed in the second world war while serving on HMS Glorious.</p> <p>One of David\u2019s grandfathers was a rear-admiral and two uncles were vice-admirals. He was fortunate to emerge unscathed from the German bombing in 1940 of Devonport dockyard, Plymouth, where David, his mother and sister, Jane, lived with his grandparents during the second world war years. After an education at Malvern college, he joined the Western Morning News in the city as a reporter before becoming a regional reporter for BBC South West.</p> <p>In 1965, he was promoted to BBC News London as an education reporter then education correspondent. There followed a period as home affairs correspondent before he went to Tokyo.</p> <p>Throughout his time with the BBC David could be described as an old-fashioned professional who always met his deadlines, researched thoroughly, made copious notes and was determined to get the story right. Speaking to camera or into a microphone he was word perfect, with clear diction, his smiling face topped by a mass of crinkly hair.</p> <p>In 1959 David married Diana Pitts. Their son, Jonathan, died in 1987 in a climbing accident in Glencoe, Scotland. Thirteen years later they decided to move to Western Australia to be closer to their daughter, Rachel, and grandchildren. Diana died in 2014.</p> <p>In latter years, David used his rich BBC voice to spellbind local audiences in the city of Mandurah with histories of settlements by Indigenous Australians and later Europeans. He spoke at length, including verse recited from memory. He was also involved in the palliative care movement in Western Australia, helping people think about what they want for themselves in old age.</p> <p>David is survived by his partner, Sheila Twine, Rachel, two grandchildren, Jo and Matt, and Jane.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend David Smeeton, who has died of cancer aged 83, was a brilliant and pioneering BBC reporter from 1962 to 1994. He was the BBC\u2019s first Tokyo correspondent from 1973 to 1978. As part of this assignment in Japan he covered stories in China, North Korea, the Philippines and south-east Asia. David later became the BBC\u2019s correspondent in Bonn, West Germany, from 1981 to 1986. He memorably covered Margaret Thatcher\u2019s visit in October 1982 to the Berlin Wall, which she described as a gross monument to a cruel and desolate creed. In 1986 David returned to Britain as the west of England correspondent based in Plymouth. He was born in Gillingham, Kent, the only son of Mona (nee Brockman), a school matron, and Donald Smeeton. His father, a naval officer, was killed in the second world war while serving on HMS Glorious. One of David\u2019s grandfathers was a rear-admiral and two uncles were vice-admirals. He was fortunate to emerge unscathed from the German bombing in 1940 of Devonport dockyard, Plymouth, where David, his mother and sister, Jane, lived with his grandparents during the second world war years. After an education at Malvern college, he joined the Western Morning News in the city as a reporter before becoming a regional reporter for BBC South West. In 1965, he was promoted to BBC News London as an education reporter then education correspondent. There followed a period as home affairs correspondent before he went to Tokyo. Throughout his time with the BBC David could be described as an old-fashioned professional who always met his deadlines, researched thoroughly, made copious notes and was determined to get the story right. Speaking to camera or into a microphone he was word perfect, with clear diction, his smiling face topped by a mass of crinkly hair. In 1959 David married Diana Pitts. Their son, Jonathan, died in 1987 in a climbing accident in Glencoe, Scotland. Thirteen years later they decided to move to Western Australia to be closer to their daughter, Rachel, and grandchildren. Diana died in 2014. In latter years, David used his rich BBC voice to spellbind local audiences in the city of Mandurah with histories of settlements by Indigenous Australians and later Europeans. He spoke at length, including verse recited from memory. He was also involved in the palliative care movement in Western Australia, helping people think about what they want for themselves in old age. David is survived by his partner, Sheila Twine, Rachel, two grandchildren, Jo and Matt, and Jane.",

However, as both Hood and Cooley note, anyone who\u2019s been following their career should have known where they were coming from. The politics this time weren\u2019t simply the result of anger, but of family life \u2013 often, says Hood, drawn from \u201cconversations I had with my kids about some bullshit that was going on. When my son comes home scared saying, \u2018Daddy, is someone going to take me away from you and Mommy and put me in a cage?\u2019 \u2018No, son, they\u2019re not going to do that.\u2019 \u2018Well, why not?\u2019 Well, because you\u2019re a white kid and they\u2019re not putting white kids in cages.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The lead single from The Unraveling was Thoughts and Prayers, a bitter tirade about the inadequacy of politicians sending their well wishes after yet more kids have been gunned down in schools. \u201cMy daughter was in a lockdown drill at her school last week,\u201d Hood says. \u201cShe was locked in a closet with 27 other kids for over 20 minutes, not knowing if it was a drill or not. It\u2019s to prepare for if someone comes and starts shooting up their school.\u201d I can\u2019t conceal my astonishment. Cooley notices. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to ask questions now, \u2018Are we inflicting trauma on these kids, on the off chance this could happen?\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkD4xSqNVII\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tkD4xSqNVII?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkD4xSqNVII\">Watch the video for Thoughts and Prayers</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>They may be from Alabama, where it is legal to carry a gun into a bar, but neither has a great deal of admiration for the second amendment, granting Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gun-control\">the right \u201cto keep and bear arms\u201d</a> in order to form a \u201cwell-regulated militia\u201d. Says Cooley: \u201cIf things get to a point where I have a need to be armed when I\u2019m out and about, whether it\u2019s legal is going to be the least of my worries. Law and order is gone at that point.</p> <p>\u201cThere probably should be a legal way for a person to be able to defend themselves with a weapon. But the second amendment was in no way intended for every Tom, Dick and Yahoo to be as heavily armed as he damn well pleases anywhere he wants. The second amendment \u2013 and the electoral college \u2013 became irrelevant almost as soon as the ink dried on the paper they were written on. And they\u2019re the two biggest pains in our ass.

But what\u2019s important now, they say, is not any divide between north and south, but the yawning chasm between urban and rural.</p> <p>\u201cCooley lives in Birmingham, Alabama,\u201d says Hood, explaining that it\u2019s a blue city (meaning Democrat) in a red state (Republican). \u201cAlabama\u2019s considered one of the reddest states of all \u2013 they voted for Trump by 60%. But Birmingham didn\u2019t. I live in Portland, Oregon, which is considered one of the most liberal cities in America. We\u2019re the population centre for Oregon, therefore Oregon\u2019s a blue state. But you see as many Trump signs, maybe more, in rural Oregon as in rural Alabama. Oregon\u2019s rightwingers are extra pissed because they know they\u2019re in the minority and they feel like their votes don\u2019t count.

      "bodyText": "Sunday\u2019s postponement of Manchester City\u2019s match against West Ham may have an undesired corollary for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side: they now risk being undercooked for the Champions League last-16 first leg against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u on 26 February. Factor in doubt over Raheem Sterling\u2019s availability because of a hamstring injury and similar uncertainty over Aymeric Laporte\u2019s fitness after a near season-long layoff with a knee problem and the storm-induced abandonment of the Hammers\u2019 visit was not what Guardiola required before taking on Real. By the time of that game in Madrid, City will have had only 90 minutes of football in more than three weeks to prepare: the Premier League game against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium four days before. It is an odd situation for Guardiola because a prevailing mantra of his since taking over at City in the summer of 2016 has been how the volume of matches footballers play exhausts them. The current winter break was welcome, then, as Guardiola said on Friday. \u201cWe have one more game [West Ham] then we have days off and we prepare for the next games, I think a break is good for everyone,\u201d he said. However, this was before the game with West Ham at the Etihad was called off, because of travel issues specific to the Manchester area \u2013 trams, trains and roads all being affected. Now, the relief of a fortnight break becomes a too-long three-week cessation before a crucial tie in a competition which is City\u2019s prime focus given they are 22 points behind Liverpool in their title defence. The Champions League is the trophy Guardiola has yet to claim for City, a glaring hole that leaves a question mark over a glittering managerial CV. After failing to achieve Champions League glory since Barcelona won it in 2011, with a glittering side including Lionel Messi, the question is: has Guardiola got the smarts to triumph over the continent\u2019s heavyweights without a five-times Ballon d\u2019Or winner in his ranks? In contrast to City, Real are going head to head with Barcelona in La Liga and are the nonpareil of Europe\u2019s aristocrats in the business of winning European Cups. Los Blancos have a record 13 \u2013 three of which were claimed in consecutive seasons under Zinedine Zidane, who is again in charge at the Bernab\u00e9u. Real may no longer have Cristiano Ronaldo but it is only two years since their last triumph \u2013 the 3-1 win over Liverpool \u2013 while City\u2019s record under Guardiola is underwhelming. His \u201cbest\u201d return is guiding City to the quarter-finals \u2013 twice \u2013 where English opposition in Liverpool and Tottenham proved too good, while there was also their 2016-17 elimination that remains the oddest under him. Leading 5-3 after the home leg against Monaco the manager made the odd claim before the return that City would be \u201ckilled\u201d if they did not score at the Stade Louis II. They subsequently froze, lost 3-1, and were dumped out on away goals at the last-16 stage. What is not required, then, is to be ring-rusty before a first leg at a venue that will be a cauldron, especially as City have lost their past two matches \u2013 to Manchester United in the Carabao Cup and Tottenham in the league \u2013 and who in their next will not relish facing Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Leicester, whose slick style is bound to trouble Guardiola\u2019s creaking team. In Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who is 31, David Silva (34) and Fernandinho (34) are three mainstays who are feeling the demands of Guardiola\u2019s constant-pressing play. The defence \u2013 as it was at Monaco in 2017 and continues to be \u2013 is not the best advertisement for the manager\u2019s abilities. John Stones is lacking confidence, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi might have been sold last summer and Kyle Walker\u2019s erratic defensive qualities have led to him losing his place on occasion. Then, there is the Laporte conundrum. The silver lining of Guardiola having to operate without him for nearly five months was supposed to be the Frenchman returning in early 2020 fit and fresh for the tilt at the Champions League. Instead, after 78 minutes of the 1-0 win at Sheffield United on 21 January, the centre-back has not featured since. The manager says this is due only to managing Laporte\u2019s return with caution and nothing else. Yet the bottom line is that even if he comes through the full match at Leicester and can face Real, the 25-year-old will struggle even more for rhythm than teammates that evening. Guardiola will also want Sterling\u2019s goal threat (he is the club\u2019s second-highest scorer this season) and pace as weapons to trouble Real but there is no guarantee the player will be fit and even if he is the forward is sure to lack sharpness, too. There is an irony in Guardiola believing a break is needed for players and this then backfiring because of Sunday\u2019s inclement weather. Especially as a fixture pile-up beckons.

Now that you are cut off from this invisible referral platform, you become that person on Facebook who is \u201clooking for a really good myotherapist who dry-needles \u2026\u201d You start talking to yourself. I have always walked around the house mumbling to myself but after I went freelance, the verbal monologues went up a notch. Partner not home? No problem. You will talk to your dog, your cat, the plants, the mail \u2013 you\u2019re not fussy. Is it loneliness? No, nothing that serious. And yet \u2026 You will try a number of co-working spaces/entrepreneurial \u201cincubator hubs\u201d for some like-minded company. Most are full of lovely people but some are stacked with tech bros and narcissists droning on about apps that you never asked them about. Other spaces seem infected with an inner-city groupthink that you find genuinely perplexing. The women all wear Gorman jumpsuits and will only \u201ctake on ethical clients\u201d; men run their own design studios and strictly drink craft beer. They all celebrate diversity and yet everyone looks the same and holds the exact same opinions. You don\u2019t go back. You will become obsessed with LinkedIn as it represents material proof that you are an ambitious professional and not, in fact, technically unemployed. Of course, logically you know that you are not unemployed because \u2013 look \u2013 your inbox is full and your bank balance is healthy. And yet there you are, in your pyjamas at 10am, wondering whether it\u2019s too early for lunch. When this feeling hits, head over to LinkedIn and add a couple of skills. You\u2019ve earned it! People will approach you for advice on quitting to become self-employed, take up vast amounts of your time, and then never do it. You will spend a lot of time at Officeworks buying pointless stationery and storage tubs because you\u2019re a serious professional. You buy a printer you never use; you have a highlighter in every colour. You also spend an unhealthy amount of time on your email signature (to bold or not to bold, and when?) You realise you exist in sort of existential self-employed bind: somewhat liberated but not wholly free. At first, you love the feeling of making your own money from scratch, and you wonder how you would ever take orders again. Then you realise you do take orders \u2013 it\u2019s just that now your bosses are farther away and have multiplied. You save a fortune on clothes, and you get to say it\u2019s because you\u2019re shunning fast fashion. You are projected upon more times than a multiplex. Nothing reveals a person\u2019s risk profile quite like their reaction to you going out on your own. Some friends won\u2019t bat an eyelid. Other people will be horrified, ask how you are going to survive, what will you do for money? This will happen many, many times and what you begin to realise is that the biggest risk you face working for yourself isn\u2019t the provenance of your next pay cheque. It\u2019s taking on other people\u2019s fears to such a degree that it hobbles you, rattles your confidence and throws you into a panic about the fact that you\u2019re not panicking. Should you be panicking? Everyone else is. But everyone else isn\u2019t you, and it will take you years to realise that most people, even the well-intentioned ones, areprojecting their own anxieties. They don\u2019t belong to you and most things aren\u2019t about you. Once you realise this, nothing will hold you back.",

Steggall has previously warned of voter backlash if moderate Liberals ignore their wishes on climate action. \u201cI think they have to be mindful of their electorates feeling disenfranchised if they aren\u2019t voting in accordance with their majority wishes,\u201d Steggall told the Guardian last month. \u201cThe Liberal party is the party of the free vote \u2013 I am not asking them to do something they have never done before, and I think crossing the floor to vote for a climate act is something they need to do to represent their constituents. \u201cIf you choose to ignore the amount of people in your electorate [who want stronger climate action] \u2026 you do so at your peril.\u201d Steggall and the crossbench have kept much of the bill under wraps, but have said they are aiming for a statutory long-term target of net zero emissions by 2050, as well as a climate change risk assessment for all sectors. The group wants the government to focus on a national adaption schedule for Australia\u2019s industries, based on what the science has revealed in regards to impacts of climate change. To ensure accountability, the group wants to follow the UK\u2019s lead and establish some sort of climate change authority, which would act independently of the government, and report back on the progress each year. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, said the opposition was looking to work with the government on a bipartisan climate policy. \u201cWe have been seeking bipartisanship for a long time in relation to this,\u201d he told the ABC on Sunday. \u201cBut to get bipartisanship, we actually need to have a side that we can talk to. Right now, we\u2019re watching a whole lot of people having a war with each other inside their party room \u2026 and that\u2019s preventing the conservatives in this country even coming to the table to have a discussion about this.\u201d",

He received the ball with his back to goal and shielded it long enough to lure his marker out of position and buy time for the onrushing Joel Chianese. He then spun through 180 degrees and ghosted into space before presenting for the return pass. The Shed was soon bouncing its way through another chorus of Chelsea Dagger following a shot delivered with a gratifyingly brawny thump executed with dead-eye precision.</p> <p>It was a rare moment of joy near the end of a difficult week for the A-League. There were <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/major-sponsor-hyundai-set-to-cut-ties-with-ffa-20200203-p53xcc.html\">reports</a> Hyundai was preparing its exit strategy as naming-rights sponsor. Broadcast partner Fox Sports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/rugby-australia-fox-sport-broadcast-deal\">discontinued its support of domestic rugby</a>, sending the latest in a series of ominous warnings football\u2019s way. Then on Saturday one of the marquee nights on the Australian football calendar, the Sydney derby, was postponed due to heavy rain.</p> <p>Weeks like this are despairingly common in Australian football. They\u2019re accompanied by uncomfortable introspection within the game and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonhill1894/status/1226293681134530562\">death-riding</a> from outside. But there are counterpoints. It might be the blur of a boot in Perth or the unpoetic intensity of a collision-heavy derby in Melbourne; glimpses of something beyond code wars and existential crises, something potent. Happiness.</p> <p>There\u2019s a quiet revolution taking place around the world to recognise the importance of happiness, and it could do wonders for Australian football.</p> <p>On a macro level there is a push to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/uk-obsessing-gdp-wellbeing-new-zealand\">reframe how governments measure success</a>. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has for decades acted as shorthand for a nation\u2019s prosperity, but it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/i-feel-hopeful-new-zealanders-cautiously-welcome-wellbeing-budget\">increasingly considered too crude</a> to accommodate the myriad factors that encompass a country\u2019s overall wellbeing. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/03/gdp-wellbeing-health-education-environment-joseph-stiglitz\">Joseph Stiglitz puts it</a>, \u201cwhat we measure affects what we do: if we measure the wrong thing, we will do the wrong thing.\u201d</p> <p>The happiness of Australia\u2019s football community - fans especially - has rarely appeared a priority. The members of clubs marginalised by a closed league system; active supporters disincentivised by fearful administrators failing to recognise they were smothering their competition\u2019s unique selling point; anyone considering sitting in an unshaded ground in midsummer heat, the list goes on. And yet we wonder why attendances have plateaued and viewing figures have nosedived. Stiglitz\u2019s maxim applies.</p> <p>VAR is a useful case study. Lawmakers may point to an increase in correct decisions, but at what cost? <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51375410\">A recent poll of fans</a> in the English Premier League revealed 67% felt matches were now less enjoyable since the introduction of VAR. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daisychristo/status/1223648167385796611\">Daisy Christodoulou argues</a> persuasively, \u201cVAR succeeds not if it gets \u2018more right decisions\u2019, but if fans &amp; players think it improves the game. Like most governance, it\u2019s about consensus.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a comparison to be made with the establishment of the Big Bash League. Cricket Australia understood from the outset that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/big-bash-league-and-the-importance-of-putting-on-a-damn-good-show\">there had to be more than just the cricket</a> as a means of attracting and retaining fans. Further, they recognised the zero-sum game at play if clubs prioritised winning as the focus of their crowd-building. That\u2019s not to say the solution for the A-League is to replicate the BBL\u2019s in-game entertainment approach, (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/06/the-joy-of-six-football-chants\">football\u2019s terraces have long had that covered)</a> but that fans have to be incentivised to turn up come rain or shine. For a competition still not far from a start-up, devotion cannot be taken for granted.</p> <p>At an individual level too there are gains to be made prioritising happiness and wellbeing. Australian football is plagued by \u201ccompare and despair\u201d culture, a mental health bear trap. It benefits nobody to continually measure the condition of the game against other sports in Australia, or against football overseas. Likewise, forever casting forward to an imagined optimal future based on the game\u2019s massive participation base only sets unrealistic expectations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/06/david-squires-on-an-easy-start-to-life-for-the-ffas-new-chief-executive\">David Squires on ... an easy start to life for the FFA's new chief executive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is more merit applying the mindfulness principle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/22/three-parts-of-meditation-headspace\">living in the present</a>. Melbourne City\u2019s surging breakaway that ended with Florin Berenguer backheeling exquisitely to Jamie Maclaren was objectively brilliant. It can (and should) be enjoyed for what it is, without layers of whataboutery taking it down a peg or ten.</p> <p>The sight of City fans embracing Tom Glover, despite his earlier howler gifting Ola Toivonen a goal (and nominative determinism an assist), was also terrific. Simon Hill made a note-perfect <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo\">Dead Parrot Sketch</a> gag during Brisbane Roar\u2019s victory over Adelaide United - the same match in which 15-year-old Mohamed Toure became the competition\u2019s third-youngest ever player.</p> <p>There are reasons to be cheerful, lots of them. And they could provide the foundations for a healthy sustainable professional football community.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIf I only came tonight just to watch that goal, it was worth it,\u201d remarked commentator Stan Lazaridis following Bruno Fornaroli\u2019s superb finish for Perth Glory against Wellington Phoenix on Friday night. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to see goals like that in the A-League are you?\u201d he added, tongue-in-cheek. It was a strike that showcased the Uruguayan\u2019s singular brilliance as a No 9 in this competition. He received the ball with his back to goal and shielded it long enough to lure his marker out of position and buy time for the onrushing Joel Chianese. He then spun through 180 degrees and ghosted into space before presenting for the return pass. The Shed was soon bouncing its way through another chorus of Chelsea Dagger following a shot delivered with a gratifyingly brawny thump executed with dead-eye precision. It was a rare moment of joy near the end of a difficult week for the A-League. There were reports Hyundai was preparing its exit strategy as naming-rights sponsor. Broadcast partner Fox Sports discontinued its support of domestic rugby, sending the latest in a series of ominous warnings football\u2019s way. Then on Saturday one of the marquee nights on the Australian football calendar, the Sydney derby, was postponed due to heavy rain. Weeks like this are despairingly common in Australian football. They\u2019re accompanied by uncomfortable introspection within the game and death-riding from outside. But there are counterpoints. It might be the blur of a boot in Perth or the unpoetic intensity of a collision-heavy derby in Melbourne; glimpses of something beyond code wars and existential crises, something potent. Happiness. There\u2019s a quiet revolution taking place around the world to recognise the importance of happiness, and it could do wonders for Australian football. On a macro level there is a push to reframe how governments measure success. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has for decades acted as shorthand for a nation\u2019s prosperity, but it is increasingly considered too crude to accommodate the myriad factors that encompass a country\u2019s overall wellbeing. As Joseph Stiglitz puts it, \u201cwhat we measure affects what we do: if we measure the wrong thing, we will do the wrong thing.\u201d The happiness of Australia\u2019s football community - fans especially - has rarely appeared a priority. The members of clubs marginalised by a closed league system; active supporters disincentivised by fearful administrators failing to recognise they were smothering their competition\u2019s unique selling point; anyone considering sitting in an unshaded ground in midsummer heat, the list goes on. And yet we wonder why attendances have plateaued and viewing figures have nosedived. Stiglitz\u2019s maxim applies. VAR is a useful case study. Lawmakers may point to an increase in correct decisions, but at what cost? A recent poll of fans in the English Premier League revealed 67% felt matches were now less enjoyable since the introduction of VAR. As Daisy Christodoulou argues persuasively, \u201cVAR succeeds not if it gets \u2018more right decisions\u2019, but if fans &amp; players think it improves the game. Like most governance, it\u2019s about consensus.\u201d There\u2019s a comparison to be made with the establishment of the Big Bash League. Cricket Australia understood from the outset that there had to be more than just the cricket as a means of attracting and retaining fans. Further, they recognised the zero-sum game at play if clubs prioritised winning as the focus of their crowd-building. That\u2019s not to say the solution for the A-League is to replicate the BBL\u2019s in-game entertainment approach, (football\u2019s terraces have long had that covered) but that fans have to be incentivised to turn up come rain or shine. For a competition still not far from a start-up, devotion cannot be taken for granted. At an individual level too there are gains to be made prioritising happiness and wellbeing. Australian football is plagued by \u201ccompare and despair\u201d culture, a mental health bear trap. It benefits nobody to continually measure the condition of the game against other sports in Australia, or against football overseas. Likewise, forever casting forward to an imagined optimal future based on the game\u2019s massive participation base only sets unrealistic expectations. There is more merit applying the mindfulness principle of living in the present. Melbourne City\u2019s surging breakaway that ended with Florin Berenguer backheeling exquisitely to Jamie Maclaren was objectively brilliant. It can (and should) be enjoyed for what it is, without layers of whataboutery taking it down a peg or ten. The sight of City fans embracing Tom Glover, despite his earlier howler gifting Ola Toivonen a goal (and nominative determinism an assist), was also terrific. Simon Hill made a note-perfect Dead Parrot Sketch gag during Brisbane Roar\u2019s victory over Adelaide United - the same match in which 15-year-old Mohamed Toure became the competition\u2019s third-youngest ever player. There are reasons to be cheerful, lots of them. And they could provide the foundations for a healthy sustainable professional football community.",

Jingyi Qian, 24, a student at the University of York, said she felt uncomfortable wearing her mask in public \u201cbecause people stare at me.\u201d Hearing about the incident in Sheffield had put her off wearing one. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get attacked, I just want to protect myself.\u201d The abuse is not confined to big cities. Waiting for a train in Edale, Derbyshire, Alice, a charity worker, overheard a woman saying she didn\u2019t want a group who appeared to be east Asian to get on the train. She said the woman\u2019s friend must have tried to reason with her because she then said: \u201cI\u2019m looking out for myself!\u201d The deeper prejudices exposed by the coronavirus are symptomatic of a long history of demonising Chinese people, according to Jex Wang, a Chinese-Australian DJ and writer, who was sent threatening, racist abuse after writing about the coronavirus on Instagram. \u201cStereotypes of Asians as submissive and non-aggressive make them a target that people think they can make fun of and laugh at. I\u2019ve seen posts saying Chinese people are dirty, disgusting, uneducated, we \u2018deserved\u2019 the virus because of our \u2018weird\u2019 food habits,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept seeing memes and jokes being shared which really upset me. There was even a coronavirus-themed club night in Sheffield that got shut down \u2013 they were offering \u2018traditional Chinese hats\u2019 to the first 100 people. What is a traditional Chinese hat??\u201d After calling out the problematic behaviour and language surrounding the coronavirus on Instagram, her inbox was soon flooded with such \u201chateful\u201d messages that she had to turn comments off on the post. \u201cPeople accused me of eating bats, told me to go back to China, that I had betrayed the west, I was even accused of fraternising with the Chinese Communist party.\u201d One message said: \u201cChina needs to be cancelled. Period.\u201d",

Harry Maguire lined up in defence and Ryan Flynn scored twice before Nick Blackman, who joined Maccabi Tel Aviv last summer, put the icing on the cake, stretching Bournemouth\u2019s winless start to the season to five matches. But, a month later, Eddie Howe returned from Burnley, Bournemouth began part two of their extraordinary rise and the rest, as they say, is history.</p> <p>Chris Wilder has had a similarly monstrous impact since taking over the reins at his boyhood club four years ago. With 13 league games to play this season, sixth-placed Sheffield United are firmly in the conversation when it comes to snatching fourth or fifth spot. After this, the Blades will jet off to Dubai but Europe remains a palpable possibility. The addition of \u00a322m club-record signing Sander Berge only further whets the appetite for what is to come, even if Wilder is staying predictably grounded. \u201cForty [points] has always been a big number for a newly-promoted side,\u201d said Wilder, whose team are four points shy of reaching that total. <br></p> <p>Bournemouth are in a different place but the mood is rather more buoyant on the Dorset coast following successive league wins against fellow strugglers Aston Villa and Brighton. But, as Eddie Howe has stressed, the important thing for his team is to back up those performances. \u201cI am very calm at this moment to say \u2018great result, really pleasing\u2019 but am cautious at the same time to not build it up too much and then go flat again,\u201d he said after the latter. \u201cWe really want to kick on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>2pm (GMT)</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Get the lowdown from Bramall Lane: A deflated Eddie Howe speaks. \u201cHugely frustrating, the two goals we conceded were hugely disappointing,\u201d says the Bournemouth boss. \u201cWe maybe lost that concentration for a split second. Both halves we sat in, were good in our structures and broke very well. We had a number of counterattack opportunities but we need to defend better in those two moments. It takes all of the polish off [recent progress]. We are going to need to try and dig out results.\u201d Chris Wilder, the Sheffield United manager, speaks. \u201cThey [Bournemouth] deservedly went in front, we never really got ourselves into the game but we gradually grew into it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no let-up from us, there are no comfortable footballers in our changing room \u2013 they have always got something to prove. The skip [captain Billy Sharp] has come back in \u2013 it has been difficult for him \u2013 but his leadership speaks volumes of his character. I wish we had a game next week, but we\u2019ll come back [from a winter break in Dubai] refreshed for the next part of the season.\u201d Sheffield United goalscorers Billy Sharp and John Lundstram speak. \u201cWe are doing fantastically well and now we are trying to look above us and try and catch them [Chelsea] now,\u201d says the Sheffield United skipper. \u201c[Europe] is not in our heads but we have a little bit of time now to regroup. We will keep pushing each other to get results.\u201d Lundstram says: \u201cThere is always a bit of frustration when you are not playing, that is part and parcel of the game, but when you do get your chance all you can do is take it.\u201d Lundstram certainly did that, earning their first win in three league matches. Chris Wilder\u2019s side are up to FIFTH place, two points off fourth-placed Chelsea. Sheffield United took a while to get going but, once they did, Bournemouth struggled to live with their intensity and caved in. Sheffield United will jet off to Dubai for a well-earned winter break in exceedingly good spirits. Bournemouth, for whom Ryan Fraser was revitalised, did not do an awful lot wrong but will be kicking themselves when they watch those Sharp and Lundstram goals back. A big thumbs-up from Wilder at full-time. 90+4 min: Francis is booked for fouling Oli McBurnie. 90+3 min: Baldock calmly nods Adam Smith\u2019s searching cross into the hands of Dean Henderson, the Sheffield United goalkeeper. Chris Wilder\u2019s side are almost there. But Bournemouth are still probing ... 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 90 min: Nathan Ake heads narrowly wide! 90 min: .. Henderson punches clear. Bournemouth get the throw-in and then Mousset swings a wild kick at the ball to clear. Bournemouth corner ... 89 min: Mousset is booked for a clumsy challenge on Billing. Bournemouth will send a ball into the box from 40-odd yards ... 88 min: Dominic Solanke replaces Andrew Surman. 87 min: Bournemouth have been punished for inviting too much pressure. Moments before Lundstram struck, Ryan Fraser was replaced by Junior Stanislas. It is fair to say Fraser was not exactly best pleased as he departed. Is that the winner? Lundstram slots home after Mousset comes alive in the box, collecting a Basham ball before coolly it on for the substitute to do the rest. Lundstram\u2019s first touch is perfect and his finish is cultured and clinical. Wilder bounces down the touchline, Eddie Howe shakes his head in disbelief. 83 min: Sheffield United fizz in a corner. Ake \u2013 again \u2013 clears. 82 min: Ramsdale takes the sting out of another Sheffield United attack, comfortably gathering an aimless Norwood free-kick. 80 min: Fraser floats a wonderful ball towards the back post, but the unmarked Philip Billing elects to try and hook it goalwards, rather than head at goal. And not for the first time this afternoon. Fraser makes it known that the midfielder should have attacked the cross with his head. That was a good chance. 77 min: Sheffield United very nearly take the lead! The marauding Baldock eludes the Bournemouth left-back Diego Rico to collect a brilliant cross-field ball by O\u2019Connell and then slides a pass into Oli McBurnie, who nudges it on to Mousset. It seems inevitable that the Bournemouth goal will ripple, but Adam Smith, Simon Francis and Nathan Ake all go to ground to attempt to block the shot. In the end it is Smith who denies Mousset a goal against his former club. 74 min: Ex-Bournemouth man Mousset replaces Billy Sharp. 74 min: ... they do the exact opposite and try to outwit Bournemouth with a bit of quick-thinking, but Norwood overcooks a pass for Lundstram. 73 min: Gosling is penalised for fouling Oli Norwood 35 yards out and Sheffield United get a chance to float the ball into the box ... 72 min: Joshua King replaces Harry Wilson. 70 min: Dean Henderson makes a quite brilliant two-handed save! The Sheffield United goalkeeper pushes Ryan Fraser\u2019s vicious first-time shot to safety after Callum Wilson flicked a Harry Wilson cross on to the Bournemouth winger. Fraser and the Wilsons have inflicted plenty of damage. 69 min: Norwood releases Sharp but Simon Francis is again alert to it and promptly clears the danger. Francis and Ake have been superb at the back. 68 min: O\u2019Connell fouls Harry Wilson and Bournemouth earn a free-kick a few yards outside of their own 18-yard box. Down in the away dugout, some activity: Joshua King is stripped and ready for a big cameo off the bench. 65 min: John Lundstram fluffs his lines inside the box! Not the midfielder\u2019s finest moment, after meeting a marvellous cutback by Chris Basham. O\u2019Connell fizzes a deep cross towards the overlapping centre-back Basham, who effortlessly keeps the ball in play before turning his marker. Then comes the cross, but the substitute Lundstram cannot apply the finish. 63 min: George Baldock fouls Ryan Fraser and Bournemouth earn some respite after McBurnie twisted Francis inside-out. McBurnie does brilliantly but eventually runs out of steam, unable to pick out Billy Sharp. Sheffield United are upping the ante. 61 min: Lundstram replaces Sander Berge. 60 min: Nathan Ake goes close! Simon Francis does well to keep a Bournemouth attack alive and his centre-back partner coolly collects his header in the box, before trying to hook it goalwards. It darts a yard or two wide. 59 min: Bournemouth win a corner via Fraser. Meanwhile Sheffield United are getting John Lundstram stripped and ready. 58 min: Adam Smith jinks inside John Fleck but the freedom goes to his head as he blasts way over the frame of Henderson\u2019s goal. Bournemouth are at least trying to give Sheffield United something to think about. 57 min: Billing charges down Dean Henderson but the Sheffield United goalkeeper thumps another ball upfield. He can kick, and then some. 55 min: Bournemouth have been blunted by Sheffield United\u2019s resurgence. Eddie Howe is deep in discussion with assistant Jason Tindall. How victory this afternoon would aid their fight for Premier League survival. 52 min: A bit of a flare-up between Chris Wilder and, er, Andrew Surman down on the touchline ... Egan inadvertently catches Dan Gosling on the follow through of a high tackle. Wilder rages in his technical area, protesting that it was nothing to write home about and Surman duly shoves the Sheffield United manager. A little melee breaks out on the touchline, with Jon Moss awarding Wilder and Surman a yellow card. Tensions simmer and it was an entertaining flashpoint, but nothing more. 50 min: Sheffield United have started this half with far greater intent. They are patiently probing, attacking the Kop stand. Surman cuts out a pass to prevent McBurnie picking up the loose ball. But Baldock upends Fraser and Bournemouth earn a chance to take stock. They are yet to get going in this second period. 47 min: Ramsdale saves from Sharp! Henderson leathers the ball 70-odd yards downfield, McBurnie flicks it on and Sharp forces the Bournemouth goalkeeper \u2013 once of Sheffield United \u2013 to save with his legs. Sander Berge heads wide from the resulting corner. A much better start by Chris Wilder\u2019s side this half, if nothing else. 46 min: Bournemouth get us back under way at Bramall Lane. Essential half-time Billy Sharp reading: How about this for a half-time stat? Each of Billy Sharp\u2019s last 34 league goals have been scored from inside the box, in a run dating back to October 2017. Both of his league goals this season have come against Bournemouth. Of course. Elsewhere, Filip Krovinovic has fired a faltering West Brom into the lead at Millwall with an hour played at the New Den: Some (light) half-time reading: Billy Sharp\u2019s second goal of the season cancels out Callum Wilson\u2019s opener to send Sheffield United in level at the break. Sharp\u2019s last league goal this season? At Bournemouth on the opening day. Sharp, as he always is, was in the right place at the right time to convert from close range after Chris Wilder\u2019s side bombarded Bournemouth\u2019s box approaching the interval. For much of the first half the visitors played like the team pushing for Europe, with Sheffield United off-colour. But then Wilder\u2019s side roused and piled on the pressure. A brilliant game. Billy Sharp levels at Bramall Lane. Enda Stevens recycles the ball after Ramsdale punches a corner half clear and drives a cross into the six-yard box. It pinballs off defender John Egan and then inevitably to Sharp, the skipper who makes no mistake. 45 min: We are into the first of three added minutes. 44 min: Norwood\u2019s deflected strike bounces awkwardly wide of the Bournemouth goal, which is increasingly under siege. A flurry of late chances for Sheffield United. Ake gets in the way of Norwood\u2019s cross and Aaron Ramsdale can only look on as it drops wide of the goalkeeper\u2019s left post. From the resulting corner, Ramsdale saves superbly from a McBurnie header. And then Ake clears another low cross from the left. Backs to the wall stuff for Bournemouth. 42 min: Another exhilarating break by Bournemouth, with Fraser again at the heart of things. Gosling does well to help possession on in the midfield, releasing Callum Wilson, who plays it wide to Fraser. Harry Wilson is lurking unmarked to his right but Fraser pours forward down the left, delaying the cross and, when it eventually drops in the box, Dean Henderson gobbles it up. 40 min: Without wanting to put the kibosh on him, Simon Francis has been brilliant at the back for Bournemouth, leading by example. A real rock in defence. 39 min: Enda Stevens is booked for a full-blooded challenge on Harry Wilson, cleaning out the Bournemouth player in his pursuit for the ball. He wins the ball, but most definitely catches the Wales winger. A bit of a reducer, as they say. 38 min: ... Norwood takes, but it cannons into the Bournemouth wall. 36 min: A bit of desperate defending by Bournemouth and the visitors eventually scramble the ball clear. Simon Francis does brilliantly to prevent a dangerous cross from the right by Oli Norwood dropping inside the six-yard box. Harry Wilson and Callum Wilson then make a mess of clearing it before Surman wallops it clear. But Sheffield United keep coming, and earn a free-kick 20 yards out ... 34 min: Ramsdale takes the sting out of another Sheffield United attack after Surman\u2019s error gifts Oli McBurnie a whiff of goal. Nathan Ake makes life difficult for McBurnie, who swivels to get a shot away. In the end it loops up and Ramsdale calmly collects. Surman failed to trap a routine loose ball into the box and Bournemouth were momentarily plunged into trouble. But they get away with it. 30 min: Bournemouth concede another corner, but it comes to nothing with Philip Billing heading clear. Neat footwork by Sander Berge and an overlapping centre-back created a bit of panic and, despite Dan Gosling\u2019s best efforts to keep the ball in play, Sheffield United yielded another corner. Bournemouth look very nifty on the counter, with Gosling sliding a beautiful pass in for Ryan Fraser, who had worked a nice chunk of space down the left flank. In the end Fraser overthinks things and the Blades get rid. 28 min: ... Fraser whips in a fierce cross but Dean Henderson sees to it with a firm punch. Sheffield United duly clear their lines. Sharp squeezes the ball to Oli McBurnie, who gets to the byline and buys a corner out of Simon Francis. From the resulting ball in, Jack O\u2019Connell heads over. Close! 27 min: Diego Rico is bundled over by Sander Berge after marauding forward on the overlap to reach a cute Ryan Fraser pass. Bournemouth earn another free-kick way out on the left flank, with Rico and Fraser stood over it ... 25 min: Jack O\u2019Connell coolly Cruyff turns away from Harry Wilson with the Bournemouth winger breathing down his neck. 24 min: Bramall Lane is now bathed in sunshine. Funny old game. 21 min: Ramsdale wellies a long ball downfield in search of Callum Wilson, who picks up the ball near a few yards away from the corner flag and smacks a low ball across goal. It zips across the turf but no player in a Bournemouth shirt is there to meet it. It was just waiting for someone to whack it on the edge of the box. 20 min: Chris Wilder has his hands in his pockets. He looks pretty frustrated with his side\u2019s start here. Bournemouth, by contrast, will be feeling happy. 17 min: Ryan Fraser requires some attention after a clash with Sander Berge, but the Bournemouth winger looks to be OK. Fraser has been a menace in this opening period at Bramall Lane, seemingly back to his electric best. 15 min: A sublime cross by Enda Stevens almost ends with the ball in the back of the Bournemouth net \u2013 but Eddie Howe\u2019s side survive. In the end the ball cannons against the side netting. Sheffield United suddenly come to life after an unusually flat start by Chris Wilder\u2019s side at Bramall Lane. 14 min: Bournemouth almost double their advantage! Another brilliant raid down the left flank by Fraser, whose hanging cross evades the unmarked Callum Wilson and Philip Billing, though the latter will feel he should have made contact with it. And now Sheffield United spring forward on the counterattack. It had been coming. Surman seizes possession on the edge of the box after Sander Berge played a blind pass and Harry Wilson plays a lovely ball out wide to Ryan Fraser. Harry Wilson then gets it back in the box but Sheffield United block his seemingly goal-bound shot. Callum Wilson hoovers up the seconds and fires in. Brilliant interplay between Fraser and the Wilsons. 11 min: ... Callum Wilson hooks wide! Simon Francis flicks on the free-kick at the front post and Wilson is the beneficiary at the back stick. Wilson got the better of Berge but could not divert his shot goalwards. He did not have an awful lot of room to manoeuvre \u2013 stabbing a shot at goal more than anything \u2013 but it dashes wide of Dean Henderson\u2019s left post. Encouraging start by Bournemouth. 10 min: Basham fouls Gosling, and Bournemouth have a free-kick way out on the left flank .... 8 min: Philip Billing is guilty of getting sloppy, not playing to the whistle as the ball runs free. Bournemouth then do win it back but Billing\u2019s pass out to Harry Wilson is not the best and it goes out for a Sheffield United throw-in. The Bournemouth assistant manager Jason Tindall makes it known he is not happy about something and Jon Moss rushes over to have a word. 7 min: Harry Wilson heads wide! Decent initiative from Ryan Fraser, who stands up a cross for Wilson, who dives low to meet the Scotland winger\u2019s ball from the left. It bobbles wide, but Bournemouth found joy breaking against Sheffield United, with Callum Wilson also surging forward through the middle. 6 min: Bournemouth have had a healthy amount of possession, without doing an awful lot with it. It is seemingly a very heavy surface at Bramall Lane. 5 min: ... Bournemouth play it short, Rico whips a dangerous ball in from the left but the ball bounces off Nathan Ake\u2019s shoulder, with the defender having got the better of Jack O\u2019Connell. It was a neat training-ground move. 4 min: Bournemouth win a corner off Sander Berge. 2 min: Simon Francis, the Bournemouth captain, makes a brilliant block to deny John Fleck. It was a sleek move by Sheffield United, with Jack O\u2019Connell picking out Oli McBurnie in the left channel. The striker cut the ball back for Fleck \u2013 his pass crawled along the turf to the midfielder \u2013 who shot goalwards. But then Francis put his body on the line and intervened. Francis is the only survivor from when these teams last met at Bramall Lane in 2012. 1 min: Harry Wilson nicks the ball from Billy Sharp, tries to race forward with it but loses his footing. It\u2019s going to be one of those afternoons ... We\u2019re under way after a rousing rendition of Greasy Chip Butty. Here we go, then. The teams trudge on to the pitch ... Chris Wilder has been talking pre-match, including how he takes new signings down to Bramall Lane rather than their modest training ground, an old working men\u2019s club. It\u2019s an endearing tale. \u201cWe always meet the players at the ground about 4 o\u2019clock when the sun\u2019s going down, the lights are on and then the players go, whereabouts is the training ground? And I go, \u2018don\u2019t worry about that.\u2019\u201d And here\u2019s another nice little nugget: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the best fridge in the Premier League as well so hopefully we\u2019ll empty that on Sunday afternoon.\u201d His longtime assistant, Alan Knill, adds: \u201cWe have a unique way of playing and it suits this club.\u201d Some pre-match reading. This is a lovely piece by Simon Burnton: More Storm Ciara talk? \u201cAfternoon Ben,\u201d emails Roger Kirkby. \u201cThe best live TV at the moment is a YouTube channel called Big Jet TV. They have a livestream from Heathrow showing the planes landing and many not landing, it\u2019s exciting stuff.\u201d That will hopefully change in approximately 22 minutes time ... Eddie Howe weighs in on Storm Ciara. \u201cOn gameday if the pitch is very wet, which it looks like it is, you have to adapt and you cannot play necessarily the same day you would if it was a perfect surface. The recent six points [after victories over Brighton and Aston Villa] have meant a lot, but now we are fully focused on today. We want to leave everything out on the pitch in order to get another win.\u201d Manchester City v West Ham has been postponed: This conditions will ensure a challenging afternoon, especially for goalkeepers Dean Henderson and Aaron Ramsdale, arguably the most exciting English stoppers in the game. Both have worked their way up through the leagues, with a five-month stint on loan at AFC Wimbledon last season, following a sizeable clanger of a different kind, a defining period in Ramsdale\u2019s career: Team news news: Storm Ciara is in from the off at Bramall Lane, where it is absolutely bucketing it down. The Norway midfielder Sander Berge makes his home debut for an unchanged Sheffield United, with skipper Billy Sharp again leading the line and former Bournemouth striker Lys Mousset on the bench for Chris Wilder\u2019s side. Eddie Howe makes one change from the team that ousted Aston Villa last time out, with Andrew Surman replacing the suspended Jefferson Lerma. And a big boost for Bournemouth is the return of Joshua King from a hamstring injury, with the forward on the bench alongside Jack Stacey. Sheffield United (3-5-2): Henderson; Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell; Baldock, Berge, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens; McBurnie, Sharp Subs: Verrips, Jagielka, Lundstram, Mousset, McGoldrick, Osborn, Retsos Bournemouth (4-3-3): Ramsdale; A Smith, Francis, Ake, Rico; Gosling, Billing, Surman; H Wilson, C Wilson, Fraser Subs: Boruc, Stacey, S Cook, L Cook, Stanislas, King, Solanke Referee: Jon Moss It is eight years since Sheffield United last entertained Bournemouth at Bramall Lane, when the hosts finished up on the right end of an eight-goal thriller in League One. Harry Maguire lined up in defence and Ryan Flynn scored twice before Nick Blackman, who joined Maccabi Tel Aviv last summer, put the icing on the cake, stretching Bournemouth\u2019s winless start to the season to five matches. But, a month later, Eddie Howe returned from Burnley, Bournemouth began part two of their extraordinary rise and the rest, as they say, is history. Chris Wilder has had a similarly monstrous impact since taking over the reins at his boyhood club four years ago. With 13 league games to play this season, sixth-placed Sheffield United are firmly in the conversation when it comes to snatching fourth or fifth spot. After this, the Blades will jet off to Dubai but Europe remains a palpable possibility. The addition of \u00a322m club-record signing Sander Berge only further whets the appetite for what is to come, even if Wilder is staying predictably grounded. \u201cForty [points] has always been a big number for a newly-promoted side,\u201d said Wilder, whose team are four points shy of reaching that total. Bournemouth are in a different place but the mood is rather more buoyant on the Dorset coast following successive league wins against fellow strugglers Aston Villa and Brighton. But, as Eddie Howe has stressed, the important thing for his team is to back up those performances. \u201cI am very calm at this moment to say \u2018great result, really pleasing\u2019 but am cautious at the same time to not build it up too much and then go flat again,\u201d he said after the latter. \u201cWe really want to kick on.\u201d Kick-off: 2pm (GMT)",

      "body": "<p>Jirattikarn Nobthai was riding his bike to the Terminal 21 shopping mall when the shooting began. He got down and tried to help others, said his mother, Sasithorn Suthisook, and he was hit once in the arm and in his side.</p> <p>\u201cHe was conscious even though he was shot. He called and told us \u2018I was shot\u2019 and then my husband rushed to the scene to take him to hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of the area was declared off-limits, with traffic closed, but he couldn\u2019t care less. It was a matter of life and death.\u201d</p> <p>The gunman, a soldier identified as Jakrapanth Thomma, had arrived at the mall in Nakhon<em> </em>Ratchasima at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/rogue-soldier-shot-dead-after-thai-shopping-mall-massacre\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/rogue-soldier-shot-dead-after-thai-shopping-mall-massacre\">bout 6pm on Saturday</a>. Driving a Humvee-type military vehicle and carrying weapons and ammunition stolen from an army base, Jakrapanth fired at drivers and pedestrians in the area. </p> <p>Inside the mall, shoppers took cover behind counters and inside bathrooms and stockrooms. Chanathip Somsakul and his family were among those who barricaded themselves in the women\u2019s toilets on the fourth floor. The 33-year-old music teacher and his wife searched social media for information and rang friends and family as they waited with their three-year-old daughter.</p> <p>\u201cA friend who works at the mall was talking to a guy in the CCTV control room \u2026 he gave us updates on the location of the gunman,\u201d Chanathip told Agence France-Press on Sunday.</p> <p>Others muted their phones and waited in silence to avoid being detected. Aldrin Baliquing, a Filipino teacher in his 40s, meditated inside a H&amp;M stockroom to stay calm. \u201cI was so scared because the shop where we were trapped was just above the establishment where the gunman held his hostages,\u201d he said, referring to unconfirmed reports that the gunman had taken human shields.</p> <p>More than five hours after Jakrapanth entered the mall, security forces confirmed they had managed to secure the ground floor and several higher levels. Outside, motorbike taxis offered free rides to the crowds of panicked people who had been evacuated in groups. At local hospitals, people rushed to donate blood to help the injured.</p> <p>Nobthai\u2019s family received offers of financial help from wellwishers after they posted online that they were unable to find a loan big enough to cover medical bills at the private hospital in which the boy was being treated. He has since been transferred to a state hospital.</p> <p>At least 29 people were killed in the attack. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock and disbelief that this happened in the town I grew up in,\u201d said Kreangsak Suwanpantakul, 41, who is from the city but was not present at the time. \u201cPeople would say [mass shootings are] an American thing, especially school shootings, but in Thailand and especially in Korat one could never imagine things like this would ever happen,\u201d he said, using the common alternative for Nakhon Ratchasima.</p> <p>Soontaree Channuan, who works at Parkviewplace Inn, a hotel near to Terminal 21, said he initially thought the sound of gunfire was a firecracker. Almost all of his guests work at the mall, he said. \u201cThere were only seven or eight guests yesterday. And they were inside the mall. Luckily, they were safe. They came back at night \u2013 some at 9pm and the others at 11pm,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis kind of thing has never happened to us.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday the city was visited by the prime minister and other officials, but Soontaree said the streets were quiet. Volunteers came to the area to give food to emergency responders who worked throughout the night on an operation that lasted 16 hours.</p> <p>The final group of people to be rescued from the mall left just before 9am on Sunday. Some were reportedly injured. In the evening, crowds of people wearing black gathered at the city\u2019s Thao Suranaree monument to pray.</p> <p>Nobthai has undergone two operations, including surgery to remove his kidney, and remains in intensive care. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday. We just couldn\u2019t eat anything and didn\u2019t feel like it. We haven\u2019t slept either,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWe just hope for his recovery.\u201d</p>",

It was a matter of life and death.\u201d The gunman, a soldier identified as Jakrapanth Thomma, had arrived at the mall in Nakhon Ratchasima at about 6pm on Saturday. Driving a Humvee-type military vehicle and carrying weapons and ammunition stolen from an army base, Jakrapanth fired at drivers and pedestrians in the area. Inside the mall, shoppers took cover behind counters and inside bathrooms and stockrooms. Chanathip Somsakul and his family were among those who barricaded themselves in the women\u2019s toilets on the fourth floor. The 33-year-old music teacher and his wife searched social media for information and rang friends and family as they waited with their three-year-old daughter. \u201cA friend who works at the mall was talking to a guy in the CCTV control room \u2026 he gave us updates on the location of the gunman,\u201d Chanathip told Agence France-Press on Sunday. Others muted their phones and waited in silence to avoid being detected. Aldrin Baliquing, a Filipino teacher in his 40s, meditated inside a H&amp;M stockroom to stay calm. \u201cI was so scared because the shop where we were trapped was just above the establishment where the gunman held his hostages,\u201d he said, referring to unconfirmed reports that the gunman had taken human shields. More than five hours after Jakrapanth entered the mall, security forces confirmed they had managed to secure the ground floor and several higher levels. Outside, motorbike taxis offered free rides to the crowds of panicked people who had been evacuated in groups. At local hospitals, people rushed to donate blood to help the injured. Nobthai\u2019s family received offers of financial help from wellwishers after they posted online that they were unable to find a loan big enough to cover medical bills at the private hospital in which the boy was being treated. He has since been transferred to a state hospital. At least 29 people were killed in the attack. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock and disbelief that this happened in the town I grew up in,\u201d said Kreangsak Suwanpantakul, 41, who is from the city but was not present at the time. \u201cPeople would say [mass shootings are] an American thing, especially school shootings, but in Thailand and especially in Korat one could never imagine things like this would ever happen,\u201d he said, using the common alternative for Nakhon Ratchasima. Soontaree Channuan, who works at Parkviewplace Inn, a hotel near to Terminal 21, said he initially thought the sound of gunfire was a firecracker. Almost all of his guests work at the mall, he said. \u201cThere were only seven or eight guests yesterday. And they were inside the mall. Luckily, they were safe. They came back at night \u2013 some at 9pm and the others at 11pm,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis kind of thing has never happened to us.\u201d On Sunday the city was visited by the prime minister and other officials, but Soontaree said the streets were quiet. Volunteers came to the area to give food to emergency responders who worked throughout the night on an operation that lasted 16 hours. The final group of people to be rescued from the mall left just before 9am on Sunday. Some were reportedly injured. In the evening, crowds of people wearing black gathered at the city\u2019s Thao Suranaree monument to pray. Nobthai has undergone two operations, including surgery to remove his kidney, and remains in intensive care. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday. We just couldn\u2019t eat anything and didn\u2019t feel like it. We haven\u2019t slept either,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWe just hope for his recovery.\u201d",

An <a href=\"https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/thai-banks-dont-accept-valuation-16086546\">independent valuation</a> estimated the contested 352 hectares at just under \u00a320m, but the banks \u2013 which lent SSI \u00a3800m in the year before it went into liquidation \u2013 claim it is worth \u201ctens of millions of pounds more\u201d, according to Houchen.</p> <p>It currently costs UK taxpayers \u00a320m a year just to keep the mothballed site safe, by Houchen\u2019s calculation. About 300 people still work there as engineers, technicians and security guards.</p> <p>Demolishing and decontaminating the site would cost about \u00a3190m, said Houchen. He leads a new body, the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC), that wants to redevelop the whole site, which is \u2013 as Houchen likes to point out \u2013 \u201cthree times the size of Gibraltar, six times the size of the City of London and 1.5 times the footprint of Heathrow.\u201d</p> <p>STDC has already acquired 575 hectares of land on the site but a 12-day public inquiry begins on Tuesday to decide whether the government can grant the STDC a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the SSI land.</p> <p>Redcar voted in its first Conservative MP in December, and in January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/government-pledges-71m-revamp-site-ex-labour-seat-redcar-ssi-steelworks\">the government committed \u00a371m</a> to pay for the CPO and future decontamination work.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/05/mayoral-elections-who-holds-the-new-seats-around-the-country\">his surprise election</a> as mayor in May 2017, Houchen began negotiations to secure the former SSI land with the three banks in Thailand who hold a charge over the SSI UK\u2019s assets \u2013 Tisco, the Siam Commercial Bank and the state-owned Krung Thai bank.</p> <p>In May 2018 Houchen flew to Thailand to try to persuade the banks to sell up. He returned home with what he thought was an agreement, only for the Thai bankers, led by Krung Thai, to change their minds over what the site was worth and play what he calls \u201ca load of silly games\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is an absolute travesty that the UK taxpayer has to pay a penny for any of this, all because there was a bad business deal done by SSI UK, which went bust, and three Thai banks who can\u2019t get their money back.</p> <p>\u201cThere absolutely needs to be a review of what mechanism is in place for large industrial complexes and businesses if a company goes bust.\u201d </p> <p>Houchen noted that Teesside was also home to the largest chemical works in western Europe. He said: \u201cGod forbid any of that goes bust because we will be in the same position.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://redcar.gateleyhamer-pi.com/objs\">The banks all object</a> to the CPO, saying \u201ca gross lack of transparency exists due to STDC\u2019s near total failure to publish its relevant meeting agendas, reports and minutes\u201d. They also accuse the Tees Valley combined authority, led by Houchen, of hiding behind confidentiality clauses to avoid handing over \u201ckey documentation\u201d.</p> <p>Houchen said the Thai banks did not understand the importance of the site for Teesside, which produced steel for landmarks like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Canary Wharf in London and the new World Trade Center in New York.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI met the Thai ambassador to the UK in London to impress on him the importance of it, and he seemed completely disengaged. He said he would follow up with me on a number of points and I never heard from him again.\u201d</p>",

An independent valuation estimated the contested 352 hectares at just under \u00a320m, but the banks \u2013 which lent SSI \u00a3800m in the year before it went into liquidation \u2013 claim it is worth \u201ctens of millions of pounds more\u201d, according to Houchen. It currently costs UK taxpayers \u00a320m a year just to keep the mothballed site safe, by Houchen\u2019s calculation. About 300 people still work there as engineers, technicians and security guards. Demolishing and decontaminating the site would cost about \u00a3190m, said Houchen. He leads a new body, the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC), that wants to redevelop the whole site, which is \u2013 as Houchen likes to point out \u2013 \u201cthree times the size of Gibraltar, six times the size of the City of London and 1.5 times the footprint of Heathrow.\u201d STDC has already acquired 575 hectares of land on the site but a 12-day public inquiry begins on Tuesday to decide whether the government can grant the STDC a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the SSI land. Redcar voted in its first Conservative MP in December, and in January the government committed \u00a371m to pay for the CPO and future decontamination work. After his surprise election as mayor in May 2017, Houchen began negotiations to secure the former SSI land with the three banks in Thailand who hold a charge over the SSI UK\u2019s assets \u2013 Tisco, the Siam Commercial Bank and the state-owned Krung Thai bank. In May 2018 Houchen flew to Thailand to try to persuade the banks to sell up. He returned home with what he thought was an agreement, only for the Thai bankers, led by Krung Thai, to change their minds over what the site was worth and play what he calls \u201ca load of silly games\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is an absolute travesty that the UK taxpayer has to pay a penny for any of this, all because there was a bad business deal done by SSI UK, which went bust, and three Thai banks who can\u2019t get their money back. \u201cThere absolutely needs to be a review of what mechanism is in place for large industrial complexes and businesses if a company goes bust.\u201d Houchen noted that Teesside was also home to the largest chemical works in western Europe. He said: \u201cGod forbid any of that goes bust because we will be in the same position.\u201d The banks all object to the CPO, saying \u201ca gross lack of transparency exists due to STDC\u2019s near total failure to publish its relevant meeting agendas, reports and minutes\u201d. They also accuse the Tees Valley combined authority, led by Houchen, of hiding behind confidentiality clauses to avoid handing over \u201ckey documentation\u201d. Houchen said the Thai banks did not understand the importance of the site for Teesside, which produced steel for landmarks like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Canary Wharf in London and the new World Trade Center in New York. He said: \u201cI met the Thai ambassador to the UK in London to impress on him the importance of it, and he seemed completely disengaged. He said he would follow up with me on a number of points and I never heard from him again.\u201d",

It looked like they might run out of wickets at one point, but Moeen Ali calmly guided them over the line. 43.2 overs: England 257-8 (Ali 17, Jordan 0) That\u2019ll do! Moeen Ali drives Sipamla for four to bring the scores level, then pulls a single to complete a laboured but ultimately deserved victory for England. 43rd over: England 252-8 (Ali 12, Jordan 0) Jordan survives the last four balls of Ngidi\u2019s over. That\u2019s another wicket maiden, Ngidi\u2019s second of this spell; it\u2019s been quite the turnaround. England still need five to win. England are doing their best to mess this up. Rashid has gone, caught behind as he tried to turn to leg. England need five to win. 42nd over: England 252-7 (Ali 12, Rashid 2) Nearly done. 41st over: England 251-7 (Ali 12, Rashid 1) A wide yorker from Ngidi is penalised, perhaps a little harshly, by the umpire. Moeen gets two more with an unconvincing heave over midwicket - but then he pulls confidently through mid-on for four. Six to win. \u201cOi, McMahon! says Mac Millings. \u201cThe This is Your First and Only Warning XI: Cyril Watchout Menace Compton Mark Rampracaution Colin Cow-drey Admonish Prabhakar Dean Horse-Headley Warning Morkel Kumar Strongarmasena Stinkhaya Ntini Intimidate Alam Threat Lee GBH Willis.\u201d 40th over: England 244-7 (Ali 6, Rashid 1) Adil Rashid is beaten, trying to uppercut a ball from Hendricks that follows him from around the wicket. Three singles from the over; England need 13 to win. 39th over: England 241-7 (Ali 4, Rashid 0) A wicket maiden from Ngidi, who has taken two for nought in his last nine deliveries. Before that he had figures of 5.3-0-56-0. A marvellous over from Ngidi ends with a deserved wicket. Curran, who was worked over throughout, lifted the last delivery of the over miles in the air and was calmly taken by Temba Bavuma. 38th over: England 241-6 (Ali 4, Curran 5) Tom Curran thumps his second ball through the covers for four. Shot! Moeen also gets off the mark with a boundary, in his case a gorgeous push-drive through cover point. Sixteen to win. Jofra Archer will bowl to Jimmy Neesham. England have lost another one! Banton snicks an excellent, lifting leg cutter from Hendricks through to the keeper to end a promising innings of 32 from 32 balls. England still need 25 to win. 37th over: England 232-5 (Banton 32, Ali 0) Assuming they don\u2019t make complete fools of themselves in the next hour, a 1-1 draw will extend England\u2019s unbeaten run in bilateral series (of two matches or more) to 12. Lungi Ngidi gets a consolation wicket. Denly drives high towards deep cover, where Phehlukwayo takes a nice running catch. It was a soft dismissal, and Denly was filthy as he walked off. 36th over: England 228-4 (Denly 62, Banton 32) Denly decides to have a bit of fun during Shamsi\u2019s last over, slog-sweeping consecutive sixes in an over that costs 19. The first six brought up his second fifty of the series, another immaculately judged innings. 35th over: England 209-4 (Denly 47, Banton 27) This hasn\u2019t been the most memorable one-day series. England have at least had the chance to look at a few young players like Banton and Saqib Mahmood. I suspect the T20 series will be a little livelier. 34th over: England 206-4 (Denly 46, Banton 26) England have played Shamsi pretty well, Denly in particular. Shamsi was South Africa\u2019s likeliest matchwinner and England decided from the start that they would not take many risks against him. He has figures of 9-0-39-1. 33rd over: England 205-4 (Denly 45, Banton 26) Banton is beaten by a jaffa from Beuran Hendricks that lifts and straightens from around the wicket. 32nd over: England 201-4 (Denly 43, Banton 25) Ngidi\u2019s desperate day continues when he drops Banton. It was a straightforward chance when Banton reverse swept Shamsi, but it went through Ngidi\u2019s hands and ran away for four. Two dropped catches, five overs for 52: the poor bloke has had a beast. 31st over: England 195-4 (Denly 43, Banton 19) Banton flicks Sipamla through midwicket for four, a superbly timed stroke. He has raced to 19 from 16 balls. 30th over: England 189-4 (Denly 42, Banton 14) \u201cPermission to get a bit of dust in my eye about Naseem Shah,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cSIXTEEN. It beggars belief. I don\u2019t know what you were all up to when you were that age, but I wasn\u2019t taking hat tricks in Test cricket. I think I was staggering through my GSCEs, listening to music my parents didn\u2019t approve of.\u201d 29th over: England 187-4 (Denly 41, Banton 13) A rare poor ball from Sipamla is clipped crisply for four by Denly, who is playing another beautifully judged innings. England need 70 from 21 overs. 28th over: England 182-4 (Denly 37, Banton 13) A long hop from Shamsi is pulled into the crowd by Tom Banton. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cNot sure why there is all this fuss about Naseem Shah. I got my first (and only) hat trick at the age of 13, for the Bluebirds Cricket Club U/14s against Ferntree Gully - taking 7/29 with my soon to deteriorate leg spin. I was awarded a McDonald\u2019s voucher as Knox-Sherbrooke Cricketer of the Week, and, as a special highlight, was presented the mounted ball at season\u2019s end by The Bearded Wonder, Bill Frindall, who was on a speaking tour of Australia. Stuff that young Shah can only dream about. Still, it\u2019s nice to welcome him to the club, albeit a little later than me.\u201d 27th over: England 173-4 (Denly 35, Banton 6) Banton, surprised by some extra bounce from Sipamla, edges just wide of the diving Reeza Hendricks at slip. The ball runs away for four. Another quick wicket would make this very interesting. 26th over: England 167-4 (Denly 34, Banton 1) That was a stunning catch from Bavuma, who was going the wrong way and then changed direction to reach down by his right ankle and grab the ball. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cGood to see Ali and Rashid back in the the England team, and Mahmood getting a game too. They seem like nice lads, as do most England cricketers. Most cricketers, in fact. So, with apologies to Mac Millings, here\u2019s a \u2018nice\u2019 XI. Well, XII actually. W. G. Gracious Dennis Amiable AB de Civil-liers Neil Fair-brother Glenn Max-swell MS Dainty Dominic Cordial Sim-Pat-ico Pocock Ishant Charming Devon Welcome Demure-ali Muralitharan Courteous Ambrose.\u201d You\u2019re a brave man, moving in on Millings\u2019 turf like that. If I were you, I\u2019d start getting my affairs in order. Joe Root has been caught at leg slip. He turned Shamsi round the corner and was beautifully caught, just above the ground, by Temba Bavuma. South Africa really needed that. 25th over: England 162-3 (Root 49, Denly 30) Sipamla replaces Phehlukwayo, whose two overs went for 23, and almost gets the breakthrough when Denly drives just short of extra cover. 24th over: England 162-3 (Root 49, Denly 30) Root sweeps Smuts flat and hard to the midwicket boundary. England are strolling to victory; they need 95 from 26 overs. 23rd over: England 154-3 (Root 42, Denly 29) Denly hooks Phehlukwayo towards deep square leg, where the backpedalling Ngidi palms the ball over the boundary for six! He came in too far; had he stayed on the rope it would have been a comfortable catch. 22nd over: England 140-3 (Root 36, Denly 22) This has been an eminently sensible partnership, just what England needed after that skittish spell when they lost three wickets in five overs. South Africa urgently need a wicket or four. 21st over: England 137-3 (Root 35, Denly 20) Shamsi is replaced by Andile Phehlukwayo, whose collection of slower balls might grip on this pitch. If he manages to land them on the relevant part of the pitch, that is: his first over includes four wides. Doofus. 20th over: England 128-3 (Root 31, Denly 20) The left-arm spinner JJ Smuts comes into the attack. He looks harmless but can be tricky to get away, as England found in the first ODI. His opening over costs just one. England need 129 from 30 overs, and should win comfortably. 19th over: England 127-3 (Root 30, Denly 20) Root and Denly have brought some sobriety to England\u2019s batting. Denly blasts a half-volley from Shamsi through extra cover for four, a good example of this pair waiting for the bad ball rather than forcing things. 18th over: England 122-3 (Root 29, Denly 16) A short ball from Ngidi is swivel-pulled elegantly for four by Denly. Another expensive over from Ngidi, who is having a miserable day: 5-0-52-0. Here\u2019s more on the news that the Pakistan cricket team remains the greatest thing in the history of the world. 17th over: England 113-3 (Root 25, Denly 11) England continue to treat Shamsi with respect, dealing almost exclusively in low-risk singles. They will be very happy if he finishes with figures of 10-0-40-0. 16th over: England 110-3 (Root 23, Denly 10) Root opens the face to steer Ngidi for four. He has raced to 23 from 24 balls with the usual unobtrusive excellence, though he survives a possible run-out chance when Bavuma\u2019s throw hits him as he scampers to the non-striker\u2019s end. 15th over: England 103-3 (Root 17, Denly 9) Five from Shamsi\u2019s over, all in ones and twos. That\u2019s drinks. 14th over: England 98-3 (Root 13, Denly 8) Ngidi, whose first two overs disappeared to all parts, returns to the attack. He\u2019s a touch too straight to Denly, who flicks behind square for four. England need 159 from 36 overs. 13th over: England 91-3 (Root 11, Denly 3) \u201cThe left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi comes into the attack. He should be a threat on this pitch, and England might decide to sit on him for a while rather than take any risks. That\u2019s what they do in his first over, which brings three singles. 12th over: England 88-3 (Root 9, Denly 2) \u201cPink Day is always a wonderful occasion, and I am so pleased that we have a great atmosphere here at the Wanderers yet again - for the first time this series (including the Tests), the South African fans seem to be in the majority,\u201d says Eva Maaten. \u201cThe pink ODI is also very fitting occasion for my last OBO contribution from South Africa - we\u2019ll be moving on again soon, this time to a less cricket-mad country where, as in the past, I shall definitely have to rely on the OBO for my cricket fix! I shall miss the Bullring.\u201d Safe travels! We\u2019ll be waiting to provide a cricket fix once you\u2019ve moved. England are officially embroiled. Morgan charges Hendricks, is surprised by a bit of extra bounce and pops the ball back to the bowler. 11th over: England 86-2 (Root 9, Morgan 9) Morgan pulls Sipamla just short of the diving Phehlukwayo at deep midwicket. England\u2019s innings has been a peculiar mix of frantic risk-taking and clinical strokeplay. Root demonstrates the latter with a delightful straight drive for four later in the over. 10th over: England 77-2 (Root 2, Morgan 7) Morgan is not out! It was umpire\u2019s call, so South Africa retain their review. It was a good delivery from Hendricks, which came back off the seam to hit Morgan on the pad. South Africa review for LBW against Morgan! It looked a bit high to me - I think it will be umpire\u2019s call at best for South Africa. 9th over: England 76-2 (Root 2, Morgan 6) Morgan gets off the mark with a confident clip off the pads for four. 8th over: England 69-2 (Root 1, Morgan 0) \u201cLanguage is an organic, ever-changing entity,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cBut, according to the Guardian Style Guide (which I assume you are forced to commit to memory on Day One), \u2018brutalise - render brutal, not treat brutally; so soldiers may be brutalised by the experience of war\u2019. Storm Ciara might be ruining my day, but it can\u2019t dampen my pedantry.\u201d Yes, but you haven\u2019t seen Ngidi\u2019s behaviour since that Bairstow assault. Jason Roy has gone for a run-a-ball 21. The ball after driving a sweet six, he top-edged a wide short ball straight to Ngidi at fine leg. England need to be a bit careful, or they could become embroiled. 7th over: England 63-1 (Roy 15, Root 1) Bairstow\u2019s decision to go off like a pacemaker means that England should - should - be able to control this run-chase. They need 194 from 43 overs. \u201cSurely England\u2019s approach is traditionally the reverse of the sub-ontinental teams (4th over),\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cWe do try youngsters but discard them pretty soon (or overwork them to destruction), as hauling in people on the verge of retirement instead is practiced. Ironically, Brian Close fits the latter pattern too, being the only guy tough and experienced enough to stand up to the West Indies speed merchants in 1976.\u201d We never try them at 16 and 17, though, which I think is the point Ian was making. Bairstow\u2019s savage cameo comes to an end when he drags Sipamla straight to midwicket. It was a memorable assault: 43 from 23 balls with six fours and three sixes. 6th over: England 61-0 (Roy 14, Bairstow 43) This is astonishing hitting from Bairstow, who has made 39 from his last 14 balls. He smears Hendricks over midwicket for six more to bring up the fifty partnership - that ball wasn\u2019t even that short - before chipping the next ball down the ground for four. He\u2019s batting like it\u2019s a T10 game. And now Roy has decided to join in: he charges the last delivery of the over and clubs it down the ground for six. 5th over: England 43-0 (Roy 7, Bairstow 32) Ngidi, whose first two overs disappeared for 29, is replaced by Lutho Sipamla. His second ball is a beauty, straightening past Roy\u2019s outside edge, and he concedes only one from a good over. Chris Schofield asks whether Naseem Shah, aged 16, is the youngest to take a Test match hat-trick. He sure is. 4th over: England 42-0 (Roy 6, Bairstow 32) Bairstow is cut in half by a sharp nipbacker from Hendricks. He looks in stunning touch, though, and scrunches the next ball through mid-off for four more. He has 32 from 15 balls. \u201cWhere do Pakistan and India get these great young cricketers from?\u201d asks Ian Wilson. \u201cWhen was the last time England unearthed a teenage cricketer and put him in the Test team. Was it Brian Close in 1949?\u201d It was Sam Curran in 2018. England have picked more young players of late, though as you say the culture is much stronger on the subcontinent. 3rd over: England 37-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 28) Absurd brilliance from Jonny Bairstow, who has just brutalised Ngidi for 16 in three deliveries. He chipped six off the pads, smashed four through extra cover and then pulled flat and hard - viciously hard - for six more. After a bit of a famine, one dot ball, he pings a pull for four more to make it 21 from the over. Awesome stuff from Bairstow, who has 28 from 13 balls. 2nd over: England 16-0 (Roy 4, Bairstow 8) Beuran Hendricks shares the new ball, and generously gives Jonny Bairstow another throwdown: short, wide, larruped through extra cover for four. In other news, Pakistan\u2019s Naseem Shah has taken a Test hat-trick against Bangladesh. He\u2019s 16 years old. Pakistan cricket: the best thing in the world, always and forever. 1st over: England 8-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) Ngidi\u2019s opening over includes three wides and a long hop that Bairstow slaps contemptuously for four. The players are back out on the field. Lungi Ngidi will bowl the first over. Thanks Daniel, hello everyone. \u201cWhat did Mahmood do wrong?\u201d asks Ian Wilson. \u201cJordan\u2019s last three overs were pathetic and Mahmood bowled really well early on. We could have kept the score down by at least a dozen runs.\u201d Well, Jordan\u2019s a specialist at the death, and I didn\u2019t think be bowled particularly badly \u2013 he just got tagged by a very good death hitter. I suspect Morgan didn\u2019t want to expose a debutant to such a dangerous player. I\u2019m sure the plan was for him to bowl during the middle overs, but the spinners were doing well enough that the opportunity didn\u2019t arise. That, then, is the end of me. Thanks all for your company and comments; please bestow both upon Rob Smyth, who\u2019ll narrate the glorious collapse. You can email him on rob.smyth@theguardian.com, or tweet @AsIf. Ta ra. That was a lot of fun. England bowled really well, and would absolutely have taken 257 to win. But the pitch isn\u2019t the belter it looked \u2013 there\u2019s just enough movement for the quicks, and just enough turn for the spinners \u2013 so if South Africa bowl and field well, they\u2019ve a chance. But a sensible batting performance from England \u2013 yes, I lived through the 80, 90s and all the rest, I know exactly what those words mean \u2013 will be enough. 50th over: South Africa 256-7 (Miller 69, Sipamla 10) Jordan begins with a slower ball and miller waits for it, hauling him around from well outside off for six over that short midwicket boundary! Here we go! So Jordan goes again but this time lands it fuller and Miller misses, then can only dig out to point; surprisingly, he takes the single, but he knows more about Sipmala\u2019s batting than I do. So Jordan offers some width outside off and Sipmala slashes over mid off for one; they run one, giving Miller his strike back. And he connects well with the penultimate delivery, but picks out the man at long on; this time he refuses the single ...and rightly so! He sees Jordan\u2019s last ball out of the hand, immediately shuffling across his stumps; he waits, then annihilates another six over midwicket! 49th over: South Africa 242-7 (Miller 56, Sipamla 9) South Africa might just be getting to something defendable here (or might be posting something that looks defendable that England chase in 35 overs ). Anyway, Curran\u2019s first ball is a top-spinner that Sipmala reads like a drunk with a paper bag over his head, knocking it up in the air only for Roy to arrive late for the catch, in a world of his own. He is quickly roused from his reverie by the bowler\u2019s disbursement of choice Anglo-Saxon then, when Sipmala gloves his next ball into the ground, further sentiments follows. Sipmala then takes two over mid off, the throw hitting Miller, and when another single arrives the throw hits Curran, already absolutely loving life. He finishes with 0-38 off nine; Miller has strike for the final over. 48th over: South Africa 238-7 (Miller 55, Sipamla 7) Sipamla gets Jordan\u2019s first ball to midwicket and they run one, then Miller stations himself right in front of the stumps so Jordan targets them, and finds a full toss dug out for four to cow corner. That\u2019s ugly as hell but timed beautifully, and a bunt to cover gives Miller his fifty; he\u2019s batted very well here, tempering his inclination for violence to ensure his team use all available deliveries. Two singles and a wide follow before a high, wide full toss gets almost everything it deserves, clumped to wide long on for a one-bounce four. 47th over: South Africa 225-7 (Miller 44, Sipamla 4) Curran returns to finish off and Miller badly needs to find a way, problem being Curran is bowling so well that he can\u2019t. Right from the first over, he\u2019s been on the money, bowling straight and full, and his variety of slower balls allow for just four singles. 46th over: South Africa 220-7 (Miller 42, Sipamla 2) Back comes Jordan to serve up a diet of slower balls, his first three deliveries yielding three singles. But Miller picks up his fourth perfectly \u2013 it\u2019s short, and he rocks back in the crease to cream over midwicket for six. The next effort goes for two to the cover fence, Denly running round to prevent the boundary, but the charge is on, and a single from the final go allows the retention of strike. 45th over: South Africa 208-7 (Miller 25, Sipamla 0) Miller gets down on one knee to smash Rashid\u2019s final delivery for four at deep backward square. Still, that\u2019s a great morning\u2019s work for yerman, 10-0-52-3. Miller knocks into the leg side and they run one. There\u2019s never a second but they try for it anyway, Rashid chucking to his end where Morgan, in front of the stumps, fields and drags onto them in one movement. South Africa\u2019s running between the wickets has been dismal. 45th over: South Africa 203-6 (Miller 27, Hendricks B 3) Rashid will finish off; Miller will be looking to hit with the spin into the leg side. Four singles follow. 44th over: South Africa 199-6 (Miller 25, Hendricks B 2) Hendricks dabs Root into the off side and pauses before setting off; if morgan hits he\u2019s gone, but he doesn\u2019t. This brings Miller onto strike and he gets down on one knee, right out to the ball, absolutely cleansing Root out of the ground over midwicket; there\u2019s a brief pause while a new ball arrives and Sia belts out the tastiest cheese of the last bit. 43rd over: South Africa 190-6 (Miller 17, Hendricks B 1) That was not a good shot Phehlukwayo played, given the state of the match and the state of his team\u2019s tail. Hendricks gets down the non-striker\u2019s immediately, knocking to long on, and Miller adds one to the same area, but that\u2019s it for the over. Rashid now has 3-43 off 9. Umpire\u2019s call on stump impact; it was clipping leg, says ball-tracking. South Africa have a review left and hardly any batting to come. That\u2019s all I can say for this. Rashid pitches in line as Phehlukwayo mows across the line and misses by plenty. That looked extremely adjacent. 43rd over: South Africa 188-5 (Miller 16, Phehlukwayo 14) Back comes Rashid, and the batsmen have to ask themselves a question: do you knock it about, trying to stay in the match, or do they try to post something competitive? 42nd over: South Africa 187-5 (Miller 15, Phehlukwayo 14) Root has bowled so well here, keeping the ball just outside off with the threat of occasional spin. This over yields just two runs, which means this spell reads 3-0-18-0. He\u2019s bowled 15 dots in his six overs, while Curran has 27 in 7. 41st over: South Africa 185-5 (Miller 14, Phehlukwayo 13) Into the last 10 overs and Phehlukwayo chips T-Cuzz over the infield, just wide of an already wine mid on, for four. Can he build on that? Not really is the answer, Curran keeping his line tight to cede just three singles. \u201cThe best half hour of Test Cricket wasn\u2019t that long!\u201d says Ian Andrew. \u201cFrom Wiki: \u2018Trueman produced a sensational opening spell in the second innings and, after only 14 balls had been bowled, India were reduced to none for four, Trueman taking three of the wickets.\u2019\u201d Presumably he ended his spell chuntering about how lucky the batsmen had been not to score fewer. 40th over: South Africa 178-5 (Miller 13, Phehlukwayo 7) This sounds a strange thing to type, but the last thing South Africa need now is Joe Root rattling through, because they daren\u2019t give him the treatment. An over sent down in roughly 0.0056s yields three singles. 39th over: South Africa 175-5 (Miller 12, Phehlukwayo 5) After some hassles getting in, we\u2019ve now got almost a full house; I daresay it\u2019s a more pleasant place to spend a day than north London, which is proper minging. Anyway, Tom Curran returns for his sixth over and if he can find the line and, most particularly the length he hit in his first spell, these batsmen are in trouble. In the first instance, he can\u2019t, ceding leg bye, wide, single, wide, single; but, as Ryan Giggs would say, he\u2019d\u2019ve took it. Five off the over, and South Africa need to channel Alexander Hamilton, batting like they\u2019re running out of time, because they are. 38th over: South Africa 170-5 (Mille1 10, Phehlukwayo 4) Root returns for a go at the left-handers and rushes through another tight over. I wonder just how good a bowler he could become; he\u2019s got enough on his plate already, but with hard work, I think we\u2019d be looking at a genuine all-rounder. The problem is that his batting is so good, ought he to spare the time? \u201cOne of the best film openings is, in my view, one which lasts over three minutes in a single shot, in Orson Welles\u2019 Touch of Evil (1958),\u201d says Romeo. \u201cThere\u2019s another long single shot later in the film which is 12 minutes long.\u201d Talking of single shots... 37th over: South Africa 167-5 (Miller 10, Phehlukwayo 2) After a wide, Ceej cedes four byes, straying onto Phehlukwayo\u2019s pad, and only a single follows it. Given the batting, or lack of batting to come, chances are that both these two have to come off if South Africa are going to be in any way competitive. \u201cQuick shout out for 2001 Space Odyssey as best first half hour of a film,\u201d emails Peter Salmon. \u201cYou know you\u2019re not going to be watching Flash Gordon, that\u2019s fo shizzle. Can I throw into the mix the best first half hour in cricket - just 14 years after Dave defeated Hal in deep space, Stuart Broad had Australia 7-38 at Trent Bridge.\u201d Fetch that segue! 36th over: South Africa 161-5 (Miller 10, Phehlukwayo 1) Moeen keeps going and after a single apiece, Miller rams a sweep that drops just shy of the rope, earning a much0needed four. From here, six an over gets 247, eight an over 271. Any less than that second total and England should breeze it. Oh dear oh dear! Smuts turns to midwicket and Baton dives to stop, but the batsmen have already gambled on him missing! So when the ball goes keeper\u2019s end, Smuts is stranded and that\u2019s a ridiculous error at a crucial moment. 35th over: South Africa 155-4 (Smuts 31, Miller 5) The last thing South Africa will want to see now is Chris Jordan back into the attack, but here\u2019s CJ; after Smuts takes a single to cover, he forces one through Miller\u2019s gate, narrowly missing the stumps, before another single brings Smuts back onto strike. 34th over: South Africa 153-4 (Smuts 30, Miller 4) Another tidy over from Moeen, two singles from it. It\u2019s hard to see where the big overs are coming from, given how well Curran and Mahmood bowled first up. Drinks. 33rd over: South Africa 151-4 (Smuts 29, Miller 3) A much-needed decent over for South Africa, Smuts taking two over mid on then a single into the off side, before Miller takes one to mid on allowing his partner to slice hard past slip to the fence. \u201cYes, that phone ringing scene is indeed the best one in world cinema history\u201d begins Rob Lewis, \u201cbecause I was in it. I was standing behind de Niro and you can just about catch a glimpse of half of my face. Was living in Montreal at the time and called up to be in the Jewish scenes in the movie. But they were short of bystanders, so off came the long beard and locks, and voila, I was a 1920s dude in a hat. Sergio Leone himself adjusted my hat. I went to see the film with a dozen mates, and the scene comes about five minutes in. Nobody saw me. For the rest of the three hours, all the dozen kept stage whispering, and asking me when I\u2019d appear......\u201d Amazing, that has got to be the greatest call-up of all-time. Ya\u2019amod! 32nd over: South Africa 143-4 (Smuts 22, Miller 2) Moeen rustles through another tight over, two from it; his last ball is a nut, beating Miller who goes back, but missing the stumps by a nasal hair. 31st over: South Africa 141-4 (Smuts 21, Miller 1) Miller plays away three dots before taking a red buller to midwicket; Roy shies and misses ... just. \u201cAs noted by a Guardian reader recently, the Pythons didn\u2019t do the Four Yorkshiremen sketch, except as an occasional live performance,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cIt was in 1969, Do Not Adjust Your Set. Trying to recall older films for best openings too. The Wizard of Oz, Rebecca, the Italian Job, the Pink Panther, Zulu, and several Bond films could all be contenders, chiefly for the ability to establish a tone at the outset. Psycho was the opposite, deliberately, so you also have to think about films with an early twist.\u201d The Wizard of Oz is one of my favourites, though the last time I watched it I wondered if it wasn\u2019t the change into glorious technicolour, rather than the set-up that I loved. There\u2019s a new version of Rebecca coming, directed by Ben Wheatley, which should be brilliant. Three for Rashid, but what was Quinton quontempltying! He has an enormous hoik at a straight one that spins in, misses by a fortnight, and South africa are in all sorts! 30th over: South Africa 139-3 (De Kock 69, Smuts 20) Smuts takes one to mid off and Jordan hits with a shy ... but he was in, just. Then De Kock flicks to midwicket and Curran is there on the fence ... only to field fresh air! The crowd love that and rightly so; who doesn\u2019t love a misfield. Sensational. Curran shakes his head, doubtless pondering Adam Smith\u2019s invisible hand theory. 29th over: South Africa 134-3 (De Kock 65, Smuts 19) South Africa are starting to move, Smuts chasing Rashid outside off to zetz him for six over cow corner. A single follows, then De Kock bangs back over the bowler\u2019s head and they run two; two more singles follow. \u201cThe ODI playing conditions allow for a failure of DRS technology, but read the small print here (section 3.6.8 of Appendix D),\u201d emails Romeo. \u201c\u2018A Player Review categorised as \u2018Unsuccessful\u2019 may be reinstated by the ICC Match Referee at his/her sole discretion (if appropriate after consultation with the ICC Technical Official and/or the television broadcast director) if the Player Review could not properly be concluded due to a failure of the technology. Any such decision shall be final and shall be taken as soon as possible, being communicated to both teams once all the relevant facts have been ascertained by the ICC Match Referee. A Player Review categorised as \u2018Unsuccessful\u2019 shall not be reinstated if, despite any technical failures, the correct decision could still have been made using the other available technology. Similarly, a Player Review categorised as \u2018Unsuccessful\u2019 shall not be reinstated where the technology worked as intended, but the evidence gleaned from its use was inconclusive.\u2019 You could see the gap between bat and ball.\u201d Can\u2019t argue with that. 28th over: South Africa 123-3 (De Kock 62, Smuts 11) De Kock has a massive heave at Moeen and Jordan looks like he\u2019s underneath it, but bails at the last second after deciding he can\u2019t quite get there so should save the boundary. For more singles from the other. 27th over: South Africa 119-3 (De Kock 60, Smuts 9) Shaun Pollock reckons South Africa shouldn\u2019t have got that review back on the basis that Bavuma definitely didn\u2019t edge. I guess the umpire could use discretion in such circumstances, but also understand the need for a standardised approach: if the tech fails, you get another go. Four singles off Rashid\u2019s over. \u201cThis is a great way to follow cricket while worrying about my fences and tiles surviving these Oxfordshire winds,\u201d says Gerry Flynn. \u201cRe beginnings of films, Inglourious Basterds is pretty good. Harrowing, but brilliantly written and acted.\u201d Agreed. I wouldn\u2019t say the first half-hour, but that first scene is an absolute masterclass in sustaining drama. 26th over: South Africa 115-3 (De Kock 58, Smuts 7) After De Kock takes two to point, Moeen drags one down and he doesn\u2019t miss out, using the crease to move backwards and get underneath it, monstering six over midwicket. 25th over: South Africa 107-3 (De Kock 50, Smuts 7) De Kock gets to his 50 with a single, one of three and a bye from the over. South Africa will be happy with 270 here. \u201cI totally agree about \u2018Once ...Hollywood\u2019, boring and self-indulgent in its references,\u201d says David Gaskell, presumably not the former Manchester United goalie. \u201cAs for Brad Pitt as supporting actor, he was no different from every role he ever plays. I think he knows this by a double bluff he employs of self-deprecation about his role. Best intro for me is Gladiator. How refreshing to have a cricket commentator who is a cineaste at the same time. Neville Cardus would be delighted, especially with the Python Yorkshireman discussion of Fiery Fred. These cricketers today don\u2019t know they are born. Brian Statham had to get up early, tailor a pair of flannels, knit a pullover and make the potted meat sandwiches for Old Trafford.\u201d I thought Brad Pitt was still one of the better things about Once Upon A time, which isn\u2019t saying much. He does though, suffer from OBOer\u2019s curse \u2013 also known as being distractingly handsome. 24th over: South Africa 103-3 (De Kock 48, Smuts 6) The Wanderers might have the best track in cricket now, offering something for everyone, though I also like Old Trafford. Four singles off this Moeen over, and predictions of a 320 total \u2013 rife pre-match, with good reason \u2013 look extremely hopeful now. 23rd over: South Africa 99-3 (De Kock 46, Smuts 4) Suddenly De Kock needs to play the anchor, which is not why he\u2019s out there. He needs the lads at the other end to do that, so he can blaze away. But here\u2019s Smuts, getting off the mark by sweeping Rashid to the square leg fence. \u201cI don\u2019t know about half an hour but Rushmore gets my vote for \u2018most amusing opening montage\u2019\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cIn passing, I wish I was as technically flawed as Jonny Bairstow, but I take your point.\u201d Well yes, but I also wish I was as technically flawed as Devon Malcolm. 22nd over: South Africa 94-3 (De Kock 45, Smuts 0) Phew! What a ludicrous passage of play that was; you love to see it. Review that! Moeen pushes one through a bit quicker, diddling Van der Dussen in the flight, and hilarious as it would\u2019ve been for him to go on and score 502*, a hint of turn through the gate sends him on his way. Suddenly England are right back on top, and its the spinners who\u2019ve done it; well done Eoin Morgan. 21st over: South Africa 90-2 (De Kock 45, Van der Dussen 1) Ultra-edge wasn\u2019t working, apparently, so South Africa retained their review. Fair enough, I guess. That is extremely fortunate; that first one was out out out. Er yes, but no one knows why there was a review when South Africa just wasted theirs. The umpire seems to have decided to take another look; I hope they don\u2019t go back to the World Cup final. You what?! The umpire has decided to review, but no one knows why! The wicket-taker is on a hatty! He\u2019s bowling so straight, and this one spins back in \u2013 I\u2019m not sure the batsman picked that \u2013 and Van der Dussen has to go! That might\u2019ve missed leg stump, but there\u2019s no review! That was not a good review at all, though I\u2019d blame De Kock rather than Bavuma. The ball was hitting, but what\u2019s this?! Bavuma has been called back as Aleem Dar thinks there may have been a hint of bat! The ball hit Bairstow in the chest, but I\u2019m not sure where it was going pre-pad, other than into the pegs. The wicket-taker does it again! Bavuma gets a big stride in, but a big stride in for him, and his bat, well away from his body, invites the ball to snake into his pad! Up goes the finger! 21st over: South Africa 89-1 (De Kock 45, Bavuma 29) De Kock takes a single and Bavuma plays all around one, which hits the pad; they appeal but nothing doing and no review. 20th over: South Africa 88-1 (De Kock 44, Bavuma 29) \u201cTop-edge central lads,\u201d says Bairstow as Bavuma misses a mow; I think the 29 goes there after Techniquegone West. And yes, the 29 is the greatest London bus, thank you for playing; Wood Green, Green Lanes for kebabs, Finsbury Park, Holloway Road, Camden, Goodge Street, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square. 19th over: South Africa 85-1 (De Kock 42, Bavuma 28) It\u2019s nice to see Rashid back too, playing his hundredth ODI, and England could use his wicket-taking capacity. De Kock takes his first delivery for a single, then Bavuma cuts; Root flings out a hand and though it\u2019s ultimately a drop, he in fact does really well to slow the ball down enough so that Moeen can do really well to slide on the fence, saving one as they run three. Meanwhile, in Pochefstroom, India are 57-1 off 17, playing Bangladesh in the men\u2019s world under-19 final. 18th over: South Africa 80-1 (De Kock 40, Bavuma 25) Moeen repaces Root \u2013 it\u2019s really great to see him back. A quiet over cedes four singles. \u201cI feel moved to point out, as a fact rather than an opinion,\u201d opines Geoff Wignall, \u201cthat the best opening to an English-language film is that of Once Upon A Time In The West .\u201d That is good, which also reminds me of the phone ringing in Once Upon A Time In America\u201d. There\u2019s a lot once upon a timing going on here, which reminds me how dull, joyless and self-indulgent I found its latest iteration, which I hope wins nothing tonight. Conversely, i hope that Parasite wins everything. 17th over: South Africa 76-1 (De Kock 38, Bavuma 23) You know when it\u2019s well cold, a penny floater hits you on the thigh, and you experience the most severe pain known to mankind? Well Bavuma knocks one to mid on and Curran throws at the stumps, whacking him a right sair yin just below the hip. He\u2019s lucky cricket\u2019s played with a corky. Ceej then offers a wide and four dots before De Kock punishes the error, flicking \u2013 yes, flicking \u2013 the extra delivery over midwicket and into the crowd. That\u2019s drinks, and he looks set. 16th over: South Africa 68-1 (De Kock 32, Bavuma 22) I thought Root\u2019s last over would be the end of his spell but Morgan tries to finagle one more and it doesn\u2019t work out. After a single to each batsman, De Kock waits for him and plays a cut so late it\u2019s almost extinct \u2013 a dodo cut \u2013 for four, before another single apiece. England need a wicket. 15th over: South Africa 60-1 (De Kock 26, Bavuma 20) Just a single, to De Kock, from a useful Jordan over. \u201cBest first half-hour in a film,\u201d says Henri du P\u00e9rier. \u201cThe Pixar film Up wins that contest hands down, surely.\u201d I\u2019ve not seen it, but it occurs to me that I didn\u2019t make my cases either, so: White Men Can\u2019t Jump is all about the dialogue and pace; the Godfather is all about the magnitude, in that you know you\u2019re watching something epic and important; and Pulp Fiction is dialogue, pace and originality. 14th over: South Africa 59-1 (De Kock 25, Bavuma 20) After three singles, Bavuma steps down and into Root, gliding four through cover. That\u2019s a lovely shot, fully deserving the rich reward of early-morning Avicii. 13th over: South Africa 51-1 (De Kock 23, Bavuma 14) Bavuma looks comfortable out there, knocking the ball about \u2013 I was surprised he didn\u2019t start the Test series, given how few South African batsman had proved themselves capable at that level. He takes two singles from this latest Jordan over, De Kock adding one. Suddenly, South Africa are consolidating a promising position. 12th over: South Africa 48-1 (De Kock 22, Bavuma 12) Root comes on for a twirl against his rabbit and De Kock nicks him ... but there\u2019s nee slip! Then, the ball after next, he cuts four more through point, and that\u2019s South Africa\u2019s first big over, nine from it. \u201cSpeaking of burnout,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cpermission to heartily salute Barney Ronay for his excellent article yesterday on Jofra Archer. Aside from the selfish management of his injury, which if it\u2019s been around since the World Cup, is unforgivable, the language used when referring to his work ethic, or character, or application, suggests something far less palatable. Conscious or not, he\u2019s been treated very poorly indeed, while being undermined all along. As it\u2019s been said, if you don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying, you don\u2019t know anything about bowling. I hope they see the error of their ways.\u201d Agreed. Also, fast bowling is hard; finding rhythm is hard; elite sport is hard; Archer is young and inexperienced; people are foolish. 11th over: South Africa 39-1 (De Kock 14, Bavuma 11) Jordan replaces Curran \u2013 who bowled a nifty spell, beating De Kock\u2019s bat as many times as anyone can have done in a similar number of balls bowled. A wide and two singles from the over, the second sprinted as Roy shied at the striker\u2019s; had he hit, De Kock was in trouble. 10th over: South Africa 37-1 (De Kock 13, Bavuma 10) Bumble notes that in Durban, they knew it was going to rain after they started, so why did they not try for a T20 in the time? A good point. Back in the middle, Bavuma drives four down the ground to close the powerplay, which has gone well for England. \u201cTalking of not picking the strongest team,\u201d says Smylers, \u201cEngland have, sadly, often done that against Ireland. That may have seemed the case in those countries\u2019 2009 ODI , when they tried out a couple of uncapped players. But both Adil Rashid and Joe Denly played in the following ODIs against Australia. And here they are 10\u00bd years later, still again in the team together.\u201d It freaks my absolute nut out that England are thinking about binning Denly for Sri Lanka to get Bairstow in. Bairstow isn\u2019t out of form; he needs to solve a technical flaw. They need to help him sort it, which isn\u2019t going to happen out in the middle, nor carrying drinks. 9th over: South Africa 31-1 (De Kock 12, Bavuma 6) How on earth do England go about picking a side for the T20 World Cup? It ain\u2019t easy being this good. Talking of which, is there a better first half-hour or so of any film? Pulp Fiction and the Godfather, maybe \u2013 feel free to send in other selection. In the meantime, after a single to De Kock, Bavuma flicks four to midwicket, following up with a single. 8th over: South Africa 23-1 (De Kock 11, Bavuma 0) Mahmood\u2019s final ball swings well away from Bavuma, who lets it by. \u201cI suspect you\u2019re right about QdK being \u2018one of those boys\u2019,\u201d says David Horn. \u201cI went to school with Rob Henderson (played for the Lionsand Ireland, in rugby). We once opened the batting for our school\u2019s \u2018old boys\u2019. I watched from the non-strikers as he belted 20 odd from the first over, before succumbing to a second-ball duck myself. However, he never once beat me at table tennis. Not sure we ever played, but I was briefly school champion. So.\u201d We\u2019re all feart of something. This has been a dayboo spell from Mahmood, and what a meteorite this is, beating Hendricks with a bit of in-duck off the seam and caressing the top of his off-bail, leaving the other intact! 8th over: South Africa 23-0 (De Kock 11, Hendricks 11) Mahmood donates width, overpitching too, and Hendricks doesn\u2019t need to be asked twice, clouting four through the covers. Incidentally, contrary to information previously supplied, Rob will be with you later. Please send aggravation to daniel.harris.casual@theguardian.com or @DanielHarris. \u201cGiven the introduction of central contracts, isn\u2019t it odd that so many England cricketers suffer burnouts?\u201d asks James Debens. \u201cPlaying for Yorkshire, England, his local pub team and the factory side of his favourite woodbine manufacturer, I am certain that Fiery Fred Trueman sent down 76,000 overs in the 1957/8 season, fuelled by nothing more than stout, pickled eggs and the momentum of his heavily pomaded thatch of hair. People were just tougher in the 50s, marinaded like conkers by their rudimentary diets and toiletries. There\u2019s no real evidence for this, but it is scientific fact.\u201d Eee I\u2019d love a Woodbine. 7th over: South Africa 18-0 (De Kock 11, Hendricks 7) Curran pins De Kock on the crease with length, then slings down a yorker which swings late and diddles him all ends up. Then it\u2019s back to seam, another delivery leaving him as he plays and misses again! But after five dots, the final delivery is too straight and is flicked off the pads for a sprinted two. 6th over: South Africa 16-0 (De Kock 9, Hendricks 7) This is impressive stuff from Mahmood, who\u2019s not threatening especially but who\u2019s line and length are making scoring hard. My guess is that the batsmen are waiting for the spinners, but in the meantime this is a useful maiden. 5th over: South Africa 16-0 (De Kock 9, Hendricks 7) De Kock is warm, moving into another full one for Curran \u2013 it\u2019s ever so slightly overpitched \u2013 and straight-pushing \u2013 straight straight-pushing \u2013 three down the ground. He strikes me as one of those kids who was mortifyingly good at everything \u2013 though pretty sure I\u2019d have had his measure at leyning. 4th over: South Africa 10-0 (De Kock 4, Hendricks 5) Mahmood finds some away movement, but Hendricks plays with soft hands and gets a single to third man. Another follows to De Kock, but that\u2019s it for another quiet over. 3rd over: South Africa 8-0 (De Kock 4, Hendricks 4) Cuzz T is bowling beautifully here, his first ball slanted across De Kock then beating him with bounce and a soupcon of movement. Lovely stuff. De Kock then puts bat on one! What a player! But he gets no run, only for Curran to drop a little shorter; that one, he eases away for four through backward point. He\u2019s quite good. 2nd over: South Africa 4-0 (De Kock 0, Hendricks 4) Here comes Mahmood for his first over in ODI cricket, and he\u2019s into his stride quickly, sending down three dots. But then he strays wide, and Hendricks is onto him immediately, timing a square drive to the fence. That came on very nicely, but this is still a decent start for him and England. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (De Kock 0, Hendricks 0) Curran starts well, his second ball beating De Kock with some away movement, then his third doing likewise off the seam. That\u2019s a lovely length, and in commentary Mark Nicholas notes that Woakes would fancy these conditions. Oh yes! Curran beats the outside edge for the third time in a row, and completes a maiden. Right, here we go! Alastair Cook is, unsurprisingly, really good in the studio. He says that under Eoin Morgan, the principle has been established that if you want to play limited-overs cricket for England, you have to be good enough to win a game on your own. No rain. On Sky, David Lloyd rhapsodises Saqib, who he says is an \u201cinternational cricketer\u201d. He was only ok in New Zealand, but James Anderson also speaks highly of him. Quite how he breaks into the Test side from here, who knows, given England\u2019s sudden strength in depth, but the best players have a way of forcing the issue. The pitch looks a belter, and I kind of wonder why England have played two spinners. Well, I know why they\u2019ve played two spinners because Morgan told us: with the T20 World Cup coming up, the T20 series is the priority, but there\u2019s doesn\u2019t look to be much in the pitch for them, and the short boundary square of the wicket will be testing. South Africa: De Kock, Hendricks, Bavuma, Van der Dussen, Smuts, Miller, Phehlukwayo, Hendricks, Ngidi, Sipamla, Shamsi. England: Roy, Bairstow, Root, Morgan, Denly, Banton, Ali, Curran, Rashid, Jordan, Mahmood. Quinton de Kock would also have fielded, on the basis of overhead conditions, but doesn\u2019t think the pitch will change too much. Lungi Ngidi comes in for Bjorn Fortuin. He says it\u2019s a decision dictated by conditions. It\u2019s cloudy now and there\u2019s one very short boundary, plus it\u2019s hard to break partnerships when they get set. He also think its a privilege to participate in pink day \u2013 South Africa are in all pink, England in oink shoulders, in aid of breast cancer \u2013 and that Saqib, Moeen and Rashid come in, the former making his dayboo and the latter to get some cricket before the T20 series. Dropping out are Sam Curran, Parkinson and Woakes. It\u2019s not raining, but it is cloudy. Which brings us onto an imminent problem: is T20 in the process of becoming close to a separate sport? Which brings us back to the original point, really: it\u2019s great to see young players \u2013 I mean who doesn\u2019t want more Tom Banton \u2013 but the reason we\u2019re seeing England play who they\u2019re playing is because they\u2019re not that bothered whether they win or lose. That doesn\u2019t feel right. State of play: South Africa lead the three-match series 1-0, with this match to play. The chances of rain - and storms \u2013 are less than they were last night, but still well in the game. Like all normal people, I have a preternatural obsession with elite sport that means I can watch as much of it as there is and more \u2013 never mind more elite cricket. But this here series raises a very obvious and significant question: what is the point of it? Obviously it passes the time, and there\u2019s a lot to be said for that. But when one team has deliberately not picked its strongest squad nor its strongest teams, it makes you wonder. England want to win, but they don\u2019t want to win that much. Which is why Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler are absent, having played too much, and why Jofra Archer is absent, having played way too much. Ultimately, for those talented enough, it is no longer possible to play every series in every form of the game, which doesn\u2019t sound right at all. The spectacle is still worth plenty, because nice to see young players given a go, but the point of this whole rigmarole is to identify the better team, not to identify a star of the future. Being really good at something oughtn\u2019t to be punished by burnout, FOMO or the absence of any time at home. Obviously we must still enjoy things for what they are, but I\u2019ve not a clue how we work them out from here. Play: 10am local time, 8am GMT.",

Zaky is a researcher on gender and human rights at the Cairo-based <a href=\"https://eipr.org/en\">Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights</a> (EIPR), which said he was covertly taken from the airport and interrogated at facilities belonging to Egypt\u2019s national security agency in Cairo and Mansoura, his home town.</p> <p>\u201cHe was beaten, subjected to electric shocks, threatened and questioned about various issues related to his work and activism,\u201d <a href=\"https://eipr.org/en/press/2020/02/egyptian-human-rights-defender-disappeared-and-tortured-eipr-gender-rights-0\">EIPR said</a>. The claims concerning his treatment could not be immediately verified independently.</p> <p>Italian authorities quickly raised the alarm about Zaky\u2019s detention. The foreign ministry told the Italian wire service Ansa that the foreign minister, Luigi di Maio, was \u201cfollowing the case closely and has already made contact with the Italian embassy in Cairo in order to obtain information on the arrest of the student.\u201d </p> <p>Regeni disappeared on 25 January 2016, four months after he arrived in Cairo to complete doctoral research on labour unions. His corpse, showing signs of prolonged and brutal torture, was found on an outlying Cairo desert road nine days later. In 2018, Italy\u2019s public prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/29/giulio-regeni-murder-italy-names-egyptian-national-security-agents-suspects\">listed five members</a> of Egypt\u2019s police and national security agency as suspects in his disappearance.</p> <p>EIPR say Zaky faced charges of \u201charming national security,\u201d and others including inciting unlicensed protests, intending to overthrow the state, broadcasting false news and promoting terrorism. Egypt\u2019s State Information Service released a statement citing an unnamed security source, reiterating that Zaky is an Egyptian citizen and that he was arrested at the behest of state security prosecution \u201cwho decided to hold him for 15 days pending investigations\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/why-was-he-killed-brutal-death-of-italian-student-in-egypt-confounds-experts\">Why was he killed? Brutal death of Italian student in Egypt confounds experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite ongoing cooperation over issues such as the civil war in Libya, Regeni\u2019s case remains an obstacle in Italian-Egyptian relations, and this potentially will be worsened by Zaky\u2019s arrest. Italy recalled its ambassador to Cairo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/italy-recalls-ambassador-egypt-talks-death-student-giulio-regeni\">from April 2016</a> until September <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/13/italy-returns-ambassador-egypt-despite-unresolved-regeni-case\">the following year</a>. Italy\u2019s parliament suspended relations with Egypt in November 2018, and an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/giulio-regeni-hopes-rest-on-italian-inquiry-on-fourth-anniversary-of-death\">Italian parliamentary inquiry</a> into Regeni\u2019s case continues to accuse Egyptian authorities and citizens of complicity in his disappearance and murder.</p> <p>Erasmo Palazzotto, president of the parliamentary inquiry into the death of Regeni, tweeted: \u201cHow do you still consider Egypt a safe country? The Italian government cannot continue to bury its head in the sand in relation to a country that continues to violate human rights in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Zaky spoke out about the reprisals against Egyptian activists and civil society in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.dire.it/30-08-2018/229489-egitto-attivista-zaki-macche-stabile-poverta-aumenta/\">telling</a> the Italian news agency Dire: \u201cWe fight for our activists, but also for Giulio Regeni \u2026 institutions try to prevent people from talking about it.

      "bodyText": "An Egyptian researcher who is studying in Italy has been arrested on arrival in Cairo on charges of \u201charming national security\u201d, sparking alarm among Italy\u2019s authorities who fear a repeat of the case of murdered Italian doctoral student Giulio Regeni. Patrick Zaky, a graduate student at the University of Bologna, was arrested at Cairo airport during a visit to see family. Zaky is a researcher on gender and human rights at the Cairo-based Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), which said he was covertly taken from the airport and interrogated at facilities belonging to Egypt\u2019s national security agency in Cairo and Mansoura, his home town. \u201cHe was beaten, subjected to electric shocks, threatened and questioned about various issues related to his work and activism,\u201d EIPR said. The claims concerning his treatment could not be immediately verified independently. Italian authorities quickly raised the alarm about Zaky\u2019s detention. The foreign ministry told the Italian wire service Ansa that the foreign minister, Luigi di Maio, was \u201cfollowing the case closely and has already made contact with the Italian embassy in Cairo in order to obtain information on the arrest of the student.\u201d Regeni disappeared on 25 January 2016, four months after he arrived in Cairo to complete doctoral research on labour unions. His corpse, showing signs of prolonged and brutal torture, was found on an outlying Cairo desert road nine days later. In 2018, Italy\u2019s public prosecutor listed five members of Egypt\u2019s police and national security agency as suspects in his disappearance. EIPR say Zaky faced charges of \u201charming national security,\u201d and others including inciting unlicensed protests, intending to overthrow the state, broadcasting false news and promoting terrorism. Egypt\u2019s State Information Service released a statement citing an unnamed security source, reiterating that Zaky is an Egyptian citizen and that he was arrested at the behest of state security prosecution \u201cwho decided to hold him for 15 days pending investigations\u201d. Despite ongoing cooperation over issues such as the civil war in Libya, Regeni\u2019s case remains an obstacle in Italian-Egyptian relations, and this potentially will be worsened by Zaky\u2019s arrest. Italy recalled its ambassador to Cairo from April 2016 until September the following year. Italy\u2019s parliament suspended relations with Egypt in November 2018, and an ongoing Italian parliamentary inquiry into Regeni\u2019s case continues to accuse Egyptian authorities and citizens of complicity in his disappearance and murder. Erasmo Palazzotto, president of the parliamentary inquiry into the death of Regeni, tweeted: \u201cHow do you still consider Egypt a safe country? The Italian government cannot continue to bury its head in the sand in relation to a country that continues to violate human rights in this way.\u201d Zaky spoke out about the reprisals against Egyptian activists and civil society in 2018, telling the Italian news agency Dire: \u201cWe fight for our activists, but also for Giulio Regeni \u2026 institutions try to prevent people from talking about it. Protests are not allowed. We NGOs face threats.\u2019\u2019 Alessandra Ballerini, the Regeni family\u2019s Italian lawyer, issued a joint statement with the Association of Phd Students and Researchers in Italy, students from the University of Bologna and the student association Link. \u201cWe join our voice with that of the Regeni family in asking the government to include Egypt in the list of unsafe countries and to summon Egypt\u2019s Italian ambassador back to Italy for consultations,\u201d they said. \u201cWith this case, Egypt once again shows the ruthlessness of its dictatorship.\u201d Riccardo Noury, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Italy, said the Italian and university authorities had a duty of care to protect Zaky. \u201cIt is of concern that Zaky was probably spied on in Italy, where he did a master\u2019s in gender studies,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are concerned about these 15 days of imprisonment. It\u2019s a strategy Egypt uses to silence people who then remain in prison for months or years, while the world forgets them.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Be appreciative, daily</strong></h2> <p>Sarah Calvert, a relationship therapist in London, says: \u201cStarting from a place of appreciation is always of benefit, and can help solve more difficult conversations. It\u2019s easy to focus on what is lacking, so I invite people to think about what they appreciate about the other person on a daily basis. Find one thing each day and tell them.\u201d This could be anything from something they do, or a quality that they have to the way they are looking. \u201cActively seeking out things to appreciate helps them feel valued,\u201d says Calvert, and when your partner better understands what you appreciate about them, they\u2019ll probably start doing those things a bit more.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t </strong><strong>try to change your partner</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThis is the person you have chosen, and they are who they are. You can\u2019t change somebody else,\u201d says Dee Holmes, a senior practice consultant for Relate. This can even come down to not sweating the small stuff. \u201cWe all do things that irritate our partners,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cDoes this really need addressing or should you accept that\u2019s just what they do?\u201d Respect and celebrate each other\u2019s individuality. While couple time is important, says Holmes, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to allow someone that space to still see their friends and do their own things\u201d. After all, if you stopped them from pursuing their interests and doing all those things that makes them them, she warns, \u201cthey\u2019re not going to be the person you got together with\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Avoid assumptions</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt can be quite easy to not say the obvious things, because you assume the other person knows,\u201d says Holmes. It can be just as easy to erroneously assume you understand them. If your partner says they don\u2019t want to go out tonight after all, says Holmes, you might feel cheated by their backtracking, without considering what caused their change of heart. Perhaps something is troubling them. Try some active listening, suggests Calvert. \u201cMake an effort to be fully present, and really learn what is going on for that person, rather than just hearing the words.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Brush up your communication skills</strong></h2> <p>This starts with being in touch with your own feelings, says Calvert. \u201cOtherwise, you won\u2019t be able to say what you need and what you want. Good communication fosters emotional intimacy, which can lead to greater feelings of fulfillment, understanding, trust and safety.\u201d She suggests being more mindful of the language and the tone you use. \u201cOften people say things [to their partner] that sound really harsh, not in a way in which they would address anyone else,\u201d she says. When responding defensively, they often don\u2019t even say what they really mean. She suggests asking yourself: \u201cIf you were listening to this conversation, how would it make you feel?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Discover what makes your partner feel loved</strong></h2> <p>\u201cSome people feel loved through their partner\u2019s actions, anything from bringing a cup of tea for them in bed to upgrading their technology,\u201d says Calvert. Some need affirming words, to be told that they\u2019re loved. For others, physical contact is more significant: intimacy, sex, holding hands. Maybe it\u2019s quality time, with your full attention, or perhaps gifts hold greater meaning for your partner. \u201cIf they think that what really matters is holding hands in public,\u201d says Calvert, \u201cand you\u2019re just saying to them, \u2018I love you,\u2019 but not giving them any physical contact, then they\u2019re not going to feel so loved.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Be appreciative, daily Sarah Calvert, a relationship therapist in London, says: \u201cStarting from a place of appreciation is always of benefit, and can help solve more difficult conversations. It\u2019s easy to focus on what is lacking, so I invite people to think about what they appreciate about the other person on a daily basis. Find one thing each day and tell them.\u201d This could be anything from something they do, or a quality that they have to the way they are looking. \u201cActively seeking out things to appreciate helps them feel valued,\u201d says Calvert, and when your partner better understands what you appreciate about them, they\u2019ll probably start doing those things a bit more. Don\u2019t try to change your partner \u201cThis is the person you have chosen, and they are who they are. You can\u2019t change somebody else,\u201d says Dee Holmes, a senior practice consultant for Relate. This can even come down to not sweating the small stuff. \u201cWe all do things that irritate our partners,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cDoes this really need addressing or should you accept that\u2019s just what they do?\u201d Respect and celebrate each other\u2019s individuality. While couple time is important, says Holmes, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to allow someone that space to still see their friends and do their own things\u201d. After all, if you stopped them from pursuing their interests and doing all those things that makes them them, she warns, \u201cthey\u2019re not going to be the person you got together with\u201d. Avoid assumptions \u201cIt can be quite easy to not say the obvious things, because you assume the other person knows,\u201d says Holmes. It can be just as easy to erroneously assume you understand them. If your partner says they don\u2019t want to go out tonight after all, says Holmes, you might feel cheated by their backtracking, without considering what caused their change of heart. Perhaps something is troubling them. Try some active listening, suggests Calvert. \u201cMake an effort to be fully present, and really learn what is going on for that person, rather than just hearing the words.\u201d Brush up your communication skills This starts with being in touch with your own feelings, says Calvert. \u201cOtherwise, you won\u2019t be able to say what you need and what you want. Good communication fosters emotional intimacy, which can lead to greater feelings of fulfillment, understanding, trust and safety.\u201d She suggests being more mindful of the language and the tone you use. \u201cOften people say things [to their partner] that sound really harsh, not in a way in which they would address anyone else,\u201d she says. When responding defensively, they often don\u2019t even say what they really mean. She suggests asking yourself: \u201cIf you were listening to this conversation, how would it make you feel?\u201d Discover what makes your partner feel loved \u201cSome people feel loved through their partner\u2019s actions, anything from bringing a cup of tea for them in bed to upgrading their technology,\u201d says Calvert. Some need affirming words, to be told that they\u2019re loved. For others, physical contact is more significant: intimacy, sex, holding hands. Maybe it\u2019s quality time, with your full attention, or perhaps gifts hold greater meaning for your partner. \u201cIf they think that what really matters is holding hands in public,\u201d says Calvert, \u201cand you\u2019re just saying to them, \u2018I love you,\u2019 but not giving them any physical contact, then they\u2019re not going to feel so loved.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Aimee Lou Wood wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to be in Uncle Vanya, even as she made her way to the audition. Having trained at Rada, she knew the lineage of actors who had played the prized part of Sonya, and what an honour it would be to star in a West End Chekhov at the age of 25. \u201cBut I just thought it was so the opposite of what I would want to do,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She did have a point. Sonya is a church-going, sexually naive teenager from the backwaters of 19th-century Russia. Wood, at the time, was fresh out of filming the Netflix teen drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/sex-education-season-two\">Sex Education</a>. Her character opens the first series with a bout of energetic sex that ends in her boyfriend\u2019s faked orgasm. (Connor Swindells, who played the boyfriend, is her real-life partner of two years.)</p> <p>It\u2019s true that, in this greater context, Sonya might seem a world away. But Wood began to realise Sonya wasn\u2019t such a step, even if the secluded Russian countryside is far removed from the dramas of Moordale, the fictional town in which Sex Education is set. Her character, also called Aimee, goes from being in the \u201cUntouchables\u201d school clique to making discoveries about masturbation. She then becomes the focus of a sexual assault plot line.

      "bodyText": "Aimee Lou Wood wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to be in Uncle Vanya, even as she made her way to the audition. Having trained at Rada, she knew the lineage of actors who had played the prized part of Sonya, and what an honour it would be to star in a West End Chekhov at the age of 25. \u201cBut I just thought it was so the opposite of what I would want to do,\u201d she says. She did have a point. Sonya is a church-going, sexually naive teenager from the backwaters of 19th-century Russia. Wood, at the time, was fresh out of filming the Netflix teen drama Sex Education. Her character opens the first series with a bout of energetic sex that ends in her boyfriend\u2019s faked orgasm. (Connor Swindells, who played the boyfriend, is her real-life partner of two years.) It\u2019s true that, in this greater context, Sonya might seem a world away. But Wood began to realise Sonya wasn\u2019t such a step, even if the secluded Russian countryside is far removed from the dramas of Moordale, the fictional town in which Sex Education is set. Her character, also called Aimee, goes from being in the \u201cUntouchables\u201d school clique to making discoveries about masturbation. She then becomes the focus of a sexual assault plot line. And Sonya is still dealing with the stuff of teenage upset, from unrequited love to the self-loathing that can accompany those years. In person, Wood is full of exuberance and speaks with disarming honesty, saying she related to Aimee right away when she read the script. \u201cI started laughing my head off because it was \u2013 verbatim \u2013 things that I have said.\u201d But she auditioned for Lily, who is played by Tanya Reynolds in the show.

      "body": "<p>In 1992, on the eve of the Barcelona Olympics, the world\u2019s greatest basketball player met track and field\u2019s greatest gravity defier. Michael Jordan, fresh from winning another NBA title, bragged about his high jump and long jump prowess at school. Sergei Bubka, who by then had amassed 30 pole vault world records, attempted a two-handed dunk and failed. Sports Illustrated, there for the ride, billed it as Air Jordan meets Air Bubka.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/09/jemma-reekie-breaks-british-indoor-mile-and-1500m-records-in-new-york\">Jemma Reekie breaks British indoor mile and 1500m records in New York</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And Jordan was clearly impressed. At one point, when it was pointed out that Bubka was about 20 feet high when he started coming down from a vault, he whistled softly. \u201cNo way I\u2019d try that,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou won\u2019t catch me killing myself.\u201d</p> <p>Can you imagine that happening now? LeBron James and, say, the world high jump champion Mutaz Barshim meeting as near equals \u2013 and their achievements being lauded and applauded in a publication read by millions?</p> <p>Perhaps it is not quite so far fetched as it once was. Because on Saturday night at an indoor meeting in Poland, athletics\u2019 latest incredible flying machine, Mondo Duplantis, jumped higher than anyone in history to set a pole vault world record of 6.17m. Imagine soaring over a London double decker bus \u2013 and still having more than a metre to spare. Or being able to jump over a giraffe. That gives some sense of Duplantis\u2019s mindblowing feat.</p> <p>And while the American-born Swede\u2019s name might be unfamiliar to those outside track and field, there is no need to worry: there will be plenty of time to learn it given Duplantis only turned 20 in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ccfc30b90de62c75ac2570345b15eba7c0b4006\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ccfc30b90de62c75ac2570345b15eba7c0b4006/0_85_2551_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Like Mondo Duplantis, the trash-talking 200m star Noah Lyles is another rising talent athletics needs to capitalise on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like Mondo Duplantis, the trash-talking 200m star Noah Lyles is another rising talent athletics needs to capitalise on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Incidentally, back in the 1960s, Sports Illustrated hailed pole vaulters as \u201csupreme among track and field athletes\u201d because in their one event they are \u201cthe synthesis of them all, combining, in relatively moderate supply, of course, the speed of a sprinter with the strength of a javelin thrower and the spring and elasticity of a high jumper \u2013 [while their] 16-ft vaulting pole makes it necessary that they be cunning, too, in order to get it safely from one competition to another\u201d.</p> <p>That last point is often harder than it sounds. One former world record holder, Don Bragg, was almost electrocuted when his pole hit a power line as he tried to board a train at Philadelphia\u2019s 30th Street station.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/world-athletics-foot-down-nike-running-shoe-regulations\">World Athletics denies tipping off Nike over new running-shoe regulations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The magazine also picked on something else too: \u201cAs a breed pole vaulters just naturally seem to be a daring bunch, else they would not be flying around up there on a swizzle stick that weighs only four pounds and is not built to last.\u201d</p> <p>When Bragg was 10 he would \u2013 according to Sports Illustrated \u2013 use ropes to \u201cswoop 60ft through the air from tall oak to tall oak, emitting the soprano bellows of a young ape\u201d. As the magazine also noted: \u201cYoung Bragg aspired to be Tarzan, and in the process he developed a tremendous body frame, the pectoral muscles and arms of a stevedore and a hand grip that would make an oyster wince.\u201d He never did get his wish to be a film star \u2013 although an Olympic title in 1960 was some compensation.</p> <p>Duplantis comes from a similar lineage. His father Greg, an elite pole vaulter in the 1990s, describes his son as a \u201clittle reckless\u201d and remembers him jumping off roofs on his skateboard. And, crucially, Duplantis also has the personality to match his extraordinary ability \u2013 and agility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEver since I started vaulting in my backyard, when I was in diapers, I wanted to be the best that\u2019s ever lived \u2013 to break the world record,\u201d he said after setting his world record. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have been shooting for since I was three.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/03/nike-world-athletics-eluid-kipchoge\">The Great Shoe War has switched lanes to the track but Nike still leads the field</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, you read that right.

      "bodyText": "In 1992, on the eve of the Barcelona Olympics, the world\u2019s greatest basketball player met track and field\u2019s greatest gravity defier. Michael Jordan, fresh from winning another NBA title, bragged about his high jump and long jump prowess at school. Sergei Bubka, who by then had amassed 30 pole vault world records, attempted a two-handed dunk and failed. Sports Illustrated, there for the ride, billed it as Air Jordan meets Air Bubka. And Jordan was clearly impressed. At one point, when it was pointed out that Bubka was about 20 feet high when he started coming down from a vault, he whistled softly. \u201cNo way I\u2019d try that,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou won\u2019t catch me killing myself.\u201d Can you imagine that happening now? LeBron James and, say, the world high jump champion Mutaz Barshim meeting as near equals \u2013 and their achievements being lauded and applauded in a publication read by millions? Perhaps it is not quite so far fetched as it once was. Because on Saturday night at an indoor meeting in Poland, athletics\u2019 latest incredible flying machine, Mondo Duplantis, jumped higher than anyone in history to set a pole vault world record of 6.17m. Imagine soaring over a London double decker bus \u2013 and still having more than a metre to spare. Or being able to jump over a giraffe. That gives some sense of Duplantis\u2019s mindblowing feat. And while the American-born Swede\u2019s name might be unfamiliar to those outside track and field, there is no need to worry: there will be plenty of time to learn it given Duplantis only turned 20 in November. Incidentally, back in the 1960s, Sports Illustrated hailed pole vaulters as \u201csupreme among track and field athletes\u201d because in their one event they are \u201cthe synthesis of them all, combining, in relatively moderate supply, of course, the speed of a sprinter with the strength of a javelin thrower and the spring and elasticity of a high jumper \u2013 [while their] 16-ft vaulting pole makes it necessary that they be cunning, too, in order to get it safely from one competition to another\u201d. That last point is often harder than it sounds. One former world record holder, Don Bragg, was almost electrocuted when his pole hit a power line as he tried to board a train at Philadelphia\u2019s 30th Street station. The magazine also picked on something else too: \u201cAs a breed pole vaulters just naturally seem to be a daring bunch, else they would not be flying around up there on a swizzle stick that weighs only four pounds and is not built to last.\u201d When Bragg was 10 he would \u2013 according to Sports Illustrated \u2013 use ropes to \u201cswoop 60ft through the air from tall oak to tall oak, emitting the soprano bellows of a young ape\u201d. As the magazine also noted: \u201cYoung Bragg aspired to be Tarzan, and in the process he developed a tremendous body frame, the pectoral muscles and arms of a stevedore and a hand grip that would make an oyster wince.\u201d He never did get his wish to be a film star \u2013 although an Olympic title in 1960 was some compensation. Duplantis comes from a similar lineage. His father Greg, an elite pole vaulter in the 1990s, describes his son as a \u201clittle reckless\u201d and remembers him jumping off roofs on his skateboard. And, crucially, Duplantis also has the personality to match his extraordinary ability \u2013 and agility. \u201cEver since I started vaulting in my backyard, when I was in diapers, I wanted to be the best that\u2019s ever lived \u2013 to break the world record,\u201d he said after setting his world record. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have been shooting for since I was three.\u201d Yes, you read that right. Duplantis broke his first age group world record at seven, when he cleared 2.33m, and continued to set world bests right up to his world junior record of 6.05m at 18. That confirmed his special talent to a wider audience. Saturday\u2019s vault only reinforced it. The burning question is whether track and field can capitalise on its new wave of talent. It certainly needs to given it is nearly three years since Usain Bolt departed, leaving a 6ft 5in-sized hole in the sport. In an Olympic year names such as Duplantis, the trash-talking 200m star Noah Lyles and the 20-year-old women\u2019s 400m hurdler Sydney McLaughlin must be propelled from the hardcore to the mainstream. Part of that is down to the sport. But athletes need to step up too. As Seb Coe, the president of World Athletics, put it to me a few years ago: \u201cLook at Conor McGregor, who has got my kids talking about UFC. \u201cI\u2019m not saying people should be like him \u2013 but I want more of them to give a view on things and to show their personality. That will make the media find them more interesting and help the public to become more engaged.\u201d Duplantis certainly did that at the weekend \u2013 diving into the crowd to hug his mother, Helena, a former elite heptathlete, before telling reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think everything has sunk in, I feel like I\u2019m hallucinating. It feels like I\u2019m in a fake world right now, I need to let this sink in.\u201d It will eventually. As will the immutable fact to the wider world: that Duplantis is very much the real deal.",

Brown said the former finance secretary, who resigned in disgrace on Wednesday, was in an extremely serious situation after admitting he had contacted the schoolboy repeatedly on Facebook and Instagram. Mackay, 42, was suspended from the SNP on Thursday by Nicola Sturgeon, the party leader and first minister, but Brown told BBC\u2019s Politics Scotland programme the party could not force Mackay to quit as an MSP. \u201cAs to whether he stays in the parliament, it is entirely his decision,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult to see how he can continue but it\u2019s his decision.\u201d Mackay resigned as finance secretary on Wednesday night on the eve of his annual budget announcement, after the Scottish Sun published the details of 270 unsolicited messages he sent the teenager. They included messages calling the boy \u201creally cute\u201d, saying he was \u201clooking good with that new haircut\u201d, inviting him to dinner and asking him to confirm their messages remained private. Mackay, seen as a future contender for the SNP leadership, also faces a police investigation. Police Scotland said it had since spoken to the 16-year-old but was still assessing the issue, since no formal complaint had been made. The boy told the Sun he felt \u201cgrossed out\u201d by some of Mackay\u2019s messages. Mackay, who has two sons, has also deleted his Facebook and Twitter accounts, and restricted access to his Instagram account, raising concerns that could impede any investigations into his alleged behaviour. Another SNP minister who resigned for allegedly harassing two women, Mark McDonald, was expelled by the party in 2018 but remained at Holyrood as an independent, routinely voting alongside his former party. Unlike Westminster, there is no recall system for MSPs, allowing voters to demand a byelection, but Brown said it would be interesting if that was proposed for Holyrood. Mackay, once one of Scotland\u2019s youngest councillors, held the seat of Renfrewshire North and West with a very comfortable 7,373 (24%) majority in 2016. Brown said the scandal had shocked the party, which had now embarked on an extensive investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely serious situation, serious for the young individual involved, and it\u2019s being treated very seriously by the government and by the first minister,\u201d he added.

Following the Iowa caucuses results disaster and Donald Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal, the Democrats have a lot riding on this event.</p> <p>Unfortunately for them, their presumed frontrunner, Joe Biden (Jason Sudeikis), just suffered a huge electoral \u201ckick in the nuts\u201d, although he promises to do what he does best and \u201ccreep up from behind\u201d. Meanwhile, the current actual frontrunners, \u201cWhite Obama\u201d former mayor Pete Buttigieg (Colin Jost) and \u201cmost popular guy on 4Chan\u201d Bernie Sanders (Larry David) are still duking it out over the Iowa results.</p> <p>Struggling to keep from being totally overshadowed by all the raging male ego, Amy Klobuchar (Rachel Dratch) compares herself and fellow New York Times endorsee Elizabeth Warren (Kate McKinnon) to recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/j-lo-shakira-super-bowl-half-time-show-review\">Super </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/j-lo-shakira-super-bowl-half-time-show-review\">Bowl half-time performers Jennifer Lopez</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/j-lo-shakira-super-bowl-half-time-show-review\"> and Shakira</a> in one of the worst jokes of the season (seriously, it\u2019s so bad you\u2019d think the real Klobuchar came up with it).</p> <p>It\u2019s still only the second most cringeworthy moment in the cold open, the first being the sneering chastisement of Sanders\u2019s \u201carmy of internet trolls\u201d for their annoying behavior.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that the show is wrong about them, it\u2019s just that 1) any show that welcomed Trump on as host has no business moralizing from a centrist standpoint and 2) it\u2019s just gonna cause the Bernie bros to become even more annoying.</p> <p>Anyway, the sheer disgracefulness of this week\u2019s political theater gives this otherwise boilerplate, shrug-worthy cold open an extra-foul aftertaste. Reality TV star and drag icon RuPaul hosts for the first time. Some viewers may be confused as to why he\u2019s not in drag for his monologue, but he assures us \u201cI am wearing my grandmother\u2019s panties\u201d.</p> <p>He then reminisces about his early days in New York and runs down the three rules that have seen him through his various ups and downs: \u201cNo 1: get the money up front. No 2: if they ain\u2019t paying your bills pay them no mind. And finally: don\u2019t take life too seriously.\u201d It\u2019s all very life-affirming and inspirational, but it\u2019s also distinctly lacking in laughs.</p> <p>In Charades, two families \u2013 one white, one black \u2013 take opposing sides in the popular parlor game. The black family flagrantly disregards the rules, such as no talking and no pointing, and eventually steamrolls their competition. It\u2019s never clear whether the joke is that black people don\u2019t know how to play charades or that they\u2019re really good at getting movie clues (this feels like the third or fourth time SNL has referenced Bad Boys for Life this season), though frankly, it\u2019s never interesting or funny enough to matter.</p> <p>RuPaul declares Chad, Pete Davidson\u2019s monosyllabic slacker, to be \u201cthe future of drag\u201d. He\u2019s given RuPaul\u2019s patented makeover of The Tuck, The Look, and The Face, though it doesn\u2019t take in the end. Weighed down by two large \u201cchicken cutlets\u201d and a skintight dress, Chad just flops all over the place. This pre-filmed sketch falls flat, although RuPaul is much more natural here than he is in a live one.</p> <p>Then, in Check-Splitting, Cecily Strong and RuPaul play two sassy office temps decked out in 80s perms and blouses (it\u2019s unclear if this is supposed to be a Designing Women reference, although it feels like it) who attempt to defend the honor of one of their coworkers during a pay dispute at a restaurant. All they end up doing is revealing how much of a pathetic loser she is, loudly exclaiming: \u201cEvery night this woman goes home to nothing \u2013 and NOTHING!\u201d The audience is initially onboard, but the sketch keeps spinning its wheels, running out of steam long before it wraps up.</p> <p>The same is true of Library, in which RuPaul visits children\u2019s reading and teaches them how to \u201cread \u2026 the filth\u201d. According to RuPaul: \u201cReading is throwing shade: a brutal insult wrapped inside a glorious wordplay.\u201d Unfortunately, any such glorious wordplay here is lost to bad timing and interminable bouts of awkward silence.</p> <p>Justin Bieber is the night\u2019s musical guest. Sporting a terrible moustache and accompanied by a string trio, he performs the song Yummy.</p> <p>Weekend Update kicks off with Colin Jost poking fun at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/08/trump-tan-line-picture-forehead-hair\">recent photograph of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/08/trump-tan-line-picture-forehead-hair\"> Trump</a> making the rounds, in which the president\u2019s grotesque tan lines are extra-visible. Per Jost: \u201cIt\u2019s like the day at the nursing home where they let the patients put their own makeup on.\u201d</p> <p>He and Michael Che trade shots at Trump\u2019s rambling acquittal speech; his confusing Kansas City, Kansas, for Kansas City, Missouri; and his penchant for slurring words \u2013 all to the loud, self-satisfied applause of the audience. This material has already been driven into the ground on social media and across late night, and in light of Trump\u2019s recent victories and the Democrats\u2019 recent debacles, it couldn\u2019t feel more pointless.</p> <p>Series newcomer Chloe Fineman gets her first showcase by joining the hosts to discuss her \u201cfavorite holiday\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/09/oscar-predictions-timetable-and-all-you-need-to-know\">the Oscars</a>. It\u2019s really just an excuse for her to do impressions \u2013 some better than others \u2013 of the actors Ana de Armas, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Saoirse Ronan, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Meryl Streep, Scarlett Johansson and Laura Dern.</p> <p>In a new episode of Thirsty Cops, RuPaul and Ego Nwodim\u2019s horny officers take turns harassing a reckless driver. The last time the show used this setup, the Baltimore police department threw a hissy fit, but this one seems too milquetoast (and frankly, forgettable) to cause much of a stir.</p> <p>The Old New York Show is a local-access program hosted by longtime drinking companions and shut-ins Madge and Dickie (Aidy Bryant and McKinnon). They\u2019re joined by their mutual ex-husband, Terry T (\u201cby day an unemployed shoe critic, by night \u2026 an usher on Broadway where I yell at ladies to pee faster!\u201d). They all reminisce about the golden days of \u201cold New York\u201d (or, 1994), sing some quick show tunes and make prank calls/terrorist threats. It\u2019s all very scattershot, but also endearingly grungy and consistently funny.</p> <p>The show obviously ran long, so rather than a closing sketch, things wrap up with Bieber (and guest rapper Quavo) performing Intentions.</p> <p>Talented an overall performer as he is, RuPaul just didn\u2019t seem particularly well-suited to live sketch comedy. But the bigger issue with this episode, and with the show overall now that the primaries are well and truly upon us, is the political material.</p> <p>This past week saw several major political car wrecks play out before our eyes, and yet Saturday Night Live couldn\u2019t craft one memorable sketch \u2013 nor even a single memorable joke \u2013 out of any of it. At this point, if the best it can do is show us an embarrassing picture of Trump that people have already been laughing at for two days, it\u2019s fair to ask: what purpose is the show even serving?</p>",

It\u2019s not that the show is wrong about them, it\u2019s just that 1) any show that welcomed Trump on as host has no business moralizing from a centrist standpoint and 2) it\u2019s just gonna cause the Bernie bros to become even more annoying. Anyway, the sheer disgracefulness of this week\u2019s political theater gives this otherwise boilerplate, shrug-worthy cold open an extra-foul aftertaste. Reality TV star and drag icon RuPaul hosts for the first time. Some viewers may be confused as to why he\u2019s not in drag for his monologue, but he assures us \u201cI am wearing my grandmother\u2019s panties\u201d. He then reminisces about his early days in New York and runs down the three rules that have seen him through his various ups and downs: \u201cNo 1: get the money up front. No 2: if they ain\u2019t paying your bills pay them no mind. And finally: don\u2019t take life too seriously.\u201d It\u2019s all very life-affirming and inspirational, but it\u2019s also distinctly lacking in laughs. In Charades, two families \u2013 one white, one black \u2013 take opposing sides in the popular parlor game. The black family flagrantly disregards the rules, such as no talking and no pointing, and eventually steamrolls their competition. It\u2019s never clear whether the joke is that black people don\u2019t know how to play charades or that they\u2019re really good at getting movie clues (this feels like the third or fourth time SNL has referenced Bad Boys for Life this season), though frankly, it\u2019s never interesting or funny enough to matter. RuPaul declares Chad, Pete Davidson\u2019s monosyllabic slacker, to be \u201cthe future of drag\u201d. He\u2019s given RuPaul\u2019s patented makeover of The Tuck, The Look, and The Face, though it doesn\u2019t take in the end. Weighed down by two large \u201cchicken cutlets\u201d and a skintight dress, Chad just flops all over the place. This pre-filmed sketch falls flat, although RuPaul is much more natural here than he is in a live one. Then, in Check-Splitting, Cecily Strong and RuPaul play two sassy office temps decked out in 80s perms and blouses (it\u2019s unclear if this is supposed to be a Designing Women reference, although it feels like it) who attempt to defend the honor of one of their coworkers during a pay dispute at a restaurant. All they end up doing is revealing how much of a pathetic loser she is, loudly exclaiming: \u201cEvery night this woman goes home to nothing \u2013 and NOTHING!\u201d The audience is initially onboard, but the sketch keeps spinning its wheels, running out of steam long before it wraps up. The same is true of Library, in which RuPaul visits children\u2019s reading and teaches them how to \u201cread \u2026 the filth\u201d. According to RuPaul: \u201cReading is throwing shade: a brutal insult wrapped inside a glorious wordplay.\u201d Unfortunately, any such glorious wordplay here is lost to bad timing and interminable bouts of awkward silence. Justin Bieber is the night\u2019s musical guest. Sporting a terrible moustache and accompanied by a string trio, he performs the song Yummy. Weekend Update kicks off with Colin Jost poking fun at the recent photograph of Trump making the rounds, in which the president\u2019s grotesque tan lines are extra-visible. Per Jost: \u201cIt\u2019s like the day at the nursing home where they let the patients put their own makeup on.\u201d He and Michael Che trade shots at Trump\u2019s rambling acquittal speech; his confusing Kansas City, Kansas, for Kansas City, Missouri; and his penchant for slurring words \u2013 all to the loud, self-satisfied applause of the audience. This material has already been driven into the ground on social media and across late night, and in light of Trump\u2019s recent victories and the Democrats\u2019 recent debacles, it couldn\u2019t feel more pointless. Series newcomer Chloe Fineman gets her first showcase by joining the hosts to discuss her \u201cfavorite holiday\u201d, the Oscars. It\u2019s really just an excuse for her to do impressions \u2013 some better than others \u2013 of the actors Ana de Armas, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Saoirse Ronan, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Meryl Streep, Scarlett Johansson and Laura Dern. In a new episode of Thirsty Cops, RuPaul and Ego Nwodim\u2019s horny officers take turns harassing a reckless driver. The last time the show used this setup, the Baltimore police department threw a hissy fit, but this one seems too milquetoast (and frankly, forgettable) to cause much of a stir. The Old New York Show is a local-access program hosted by longtime drinking companions and shut-ins Madge and Dickie (Aidy Bryant and McKinnon). They\u2019re joined by their mutual ex-husband, Terry T (\u201cby day an unemployed shoe critic, by night \u2026 an usher on Broadway where I yell at ladies to pee faster!\u201d). They all reminisce about the golden days of \u201cold New York\u201d (or, 1994), sing some quick show tunes and make prank calls/terrorist threats. It\u2019s all very scattershot, but also endearingly grungy and consistently funny. The show obviously ran long, so rather than a closing sketch, things wrap up with Bieber (and guest rapper Quavo) performing Intentions. Talented an overall performer as he is, RuPaul just didn\u2019t seem particularly well-suited to live sketch comedy. But the bigger issue with this episode, and with the show overall now that the primaries are well and truly upon us, is the political material. This past week saw several major political car wrecks play out before our eyes, and yet Saturday Night Live couldn\u2019t craft one memorable sketch \u2013 nor even a single memorable joke \u2013 out of any of it. At this point, if the best it can do is show us an embarrassing picture of Trump that people have already been laughing at for two days, it\u2019s fair to ask: what purpose is the show even serving?",

      "body": "<p>I am a radiator-hugging hater of being cold. It makes me tense and tetchy. But what if you are in your house, heated to 18C (64F), wearing a scarf so long and fluffy that it wraps around you four times and buries your chin, and you are still chilly? What if you are the one in the office always huddled under a shawl, blue-nosed, while everyone else goes about their business in T-shirts?</p> <p>Clearly, these situations pose no threat to maintaining a core body temperature of about 36.5C. In <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/345141/uk_housing_fact_file_2013.pdf\" title=\"\">1970</a>, fewer people had central heating, and the temperature of the average British home in winter was 12C. As much as I appreciate my gas boiler, the sound of it revving up to burn more fossil fuel has come to represent climate-crisis doom. I aspire to feel cosy at 12C. Can I ever become one of those rosy-cheeked hardy types who pop to the corner shop in flip-flops in February?</p> <p>According to Christopher Minson, a professor of human physiology at the University of Oregon, there is hope. \u201cAbsolutely, people can adapt progressively to cooler temperatures,\u201d he says. \u201cHumans have become very thermostatic. We go from our perfectly heated or air-conditioned house to our perfectly heated or air-conditioned cars to our perfectly heated or air-conditioned work.\u201d This, he believes, is not healthy. We\u2019re not exercising the mechanisms we use to keep warm, and our perception of acceptable temperatures has become unnaturally narrow.</p> <p>Essentially, says Minson, humans are big bags of water and meat. \u201cWhat keeps us warm, really, is our metabolic rate: how much energy we\u2019re producing.\u201d But there are physiological differences meaning that some have to work harder than others to maintain their core temperature.</p> <p>\u201cMen in general are going to have a bit more muscle mass than women,\u201d says Minson, \u201cso this helps them stay a little warmer.\u201d This is because having more muscle increases your basal metabolic rate \u2013 your capacity to burn energy from food. It helps explain the modern phenomenon of <a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1373402/air-conditioning-is-sexist-and-cynthia-nixon-and-andrew-cuomos-debate-about-it-shows-it/\" title=\"\">\u201csexist\u201d office air-conditioning</a>, whereby the temperature is perfect for most men, but chilly for most women.</p> <p>There are always exceptions, and other reasons why some people feel the cold more than others. Age is a big factor because the older we are, the lower our metabolic rates tend to be. But we all have thermoreceptors, says Minson. \u201cThroughout your body \u2013 your skin, your muscles, your organs and your tissues \u2013 they are feeding information back to your hypothalamus, which is where your big central regulator of temperatures is.\u201d Even if the blood in that area is 36.5C, signals coming in saying that the temperature has dropped are seen as a threat. This triggers vasoconstriction in the skin, to minimise the heat from our warm blood being lost to the outside world. In response, we curl up and bring our arms close to our bodies and put more layers on.</p> <p>It is possible to train ourselves out of our thermostatic ruts, and Minson is constantly experimenting on himself. As it got colder one winter, he wore progressively warmer jackets to cycle to work. \u201cI still saw people wearing just a T-shirt,\u201d he says. So, one day, he decided to copy them. \u201cThe first few days were like: \u2018Wow, it\u2019s really cold,\u2019 but within less than a week it got easier, and after a couple of weeks I could ride with my arms exposed and not feel as cold.\u201d</p> <p>Minson is a big fan of cold blasts in the shower, too.

      "bodyText": "I am a radiator-hugging hater of being cold. It makes me tense and tetchy. But what if you are in your house, heated to 18C (64F), wearing a scarf so long and fluffy that it wraps around you four times and buries your chin, and you are still chilly? What if you are the one in the office always huddled under a shawl, blue-nosed, while everyone else goes about their business in T-shirts? Clearly, these situations pose no threat to maintaining a core body temperature of about 36.5C. In 1970, fewer people had central heating, and the temperature of the average British home in winter was 12C. As much as I appreciate my gas boiler, the sound of it revving up to burn more fossil fuel has come to represent climate-crisis doom. I aspire to feel cosy at 12C. Can I ever become one of those rosy-cheeked hardy types who pop to the corner shop in flip-flops in February? According to Christopher Minson, a professor of human physiology at the University of Oregon, there is hope. \u201cAbsolutely, people can adapt progressively to cooler temperatures,\u201d he says. \u201cHumans have become very thermostatic. We go from our perfectly heated or air-conditioned house to our perfectly heated or air-conditioned cars to our perfectly heated or air-conditioned work.\u201d This, he believes, is not healthy. We\u2019re not exercising the mechanisms we use to keep warm, and our perception of acceptable temperatures has become unnaturally narrow. Essentially, says Minson, humans are big bags of water and meat. \u201cWhat keeps us warm, really, is our metabolic rate: how much energy we\u2019re producing.\u201d But there are physiological differences meaning that some have to work harder than others to maintain their core temperature. \u201cMen in general are going to have a bit more muscle mass than women,\u201d says Minson, \u201cso this helps them stay a little warmer.\u201d This is because having more muscle increases your basal metabolic rate \u2013 your capacity to burn energy from food. It helps explain the modern phenomenon of \u201csexist\u201d office air-conditioning, whereby the temperature is perfect for most men, but chilly for most women. There are always exceptions, and other reasons why some people feel the cold more than others. Age is a big factor because the older we are, the lower our metabolic rates tend to be. But we all have thermoreceptors, says Minson. \u201cThroughout your body \u2013 your skin, your muscles, your organs and your tissues \u2013 they are feeding information back to your hypothalamus, which is where your big central regulator of temperatures is.\u201d Even if the blood in that area is 36.5C, signals coming in saying that the temperature has dropped are seen as a threat. This triggers vasoconstriction in the skin, to minimise the heat from our warm blood being lost to the outside world. In response, we curl up and bring our arms close to our bodies and put more layers on. It is possible to train ourselves out of our thermostatic ruts, and Minson is constantly experimenting on himself. As it got colder one winter, he wore progressively warmer jackets to cycle to work. \u201cI still saw people wearing just a T-shirt,\u201d he says. So, one day, he decided to copy them. \u201cThe first few days were like: \u2018Wow, it\u2019s really cold,\u2019 but within less than a week it got easier, and after a couple of weeks I could ride with my arms exposed and not feel as cold.\u201d Minson is a big fan of cold blasts in the shower, too. He started out by turning the shower to cold for 15 seconds, then increased it to 30 seconds until he could tolerate what he calls enthusiastically, \u201ca one-minute cold blast. It\u2019s miserable for a while, but you do adapt. After doing that for a month or two, I started finding that when I was in cold environments I felt less cold.\u201d He puts this acclimatising effect mostly down to an adjustment in our cold-threat perception. \u201cThe thermoreceptors in your skin are now telling your brain this is not a threat \u2013 you\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d The precise mechanics of this haven\u2019t been sufficiently demonstrated, but a fair assumption would be that \u201cthe firing rate of those thermoreceptors has decreased. Certainly, the perception of what those neural firings mean would be viewed as less of a threat to our standard body temperature.\u201d A second benefit is that the exposure to cold stressors trains the body to keep warm more effectively, \u201cmaybe increasing metabolic rate or having better vasoconstriction\u201d, says Minson. The walls of blood vessels are muscular, and leading thermostatic lives doesn\u2019t exercise them. \u201cIf you\u2019re not stretching those muscles to constrict and dilate, then it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re not as healthy.\u201d An obvious cause of my chills is sitting down to work for hours, moving only my eyes and fingers.

The complaint has been referred to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. Within days of the referral being made on Thursday, news of the process was passed to the BBC. The BBC declined to say who had passed on the information. A spokesman for Starmer\u2019s campaign said: \u201cWe categorically reject these nonsensical allegations and are incredibly disappointed that they have been leaked to the media. We are still awaiting the party\u2019s formal response to the serious concerns we and others had about access to Labour party membership data.\u201d Chapman said events began when Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign sent an email to thousands of supporters that included a link to a database of potential backers who could be contacted. This link appeared to access the Labour party phone bank of contacts, which contravened leadership rules, Chapman told BBC Radio 5 Live. Chapman said the Starmer campaign then alerted the party to what, appeared to possibly be an inadvertent data breach. \u201cAnd that was really the end of it, as far as we were concerned. The next thing you know, a couple of people on our campaign receive letters saying: \u2018Actually, we think you\u2019ve done something wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s utter, utter nonsense.\u201d According to the BBC, the letters accuse Starmer\u2019s team of \u201cdata-scraping\u201d \u2013 in effect hacking membership data to bolster their campaign efforts. Chapman declined to speculate on why this could have happened or who passed the information to the BBC. \u201cWhoever decided to send these threatening letters to people on the Keir Starmer campaign and then to leak it to the BBC really isn\u2019t doing the Labour party or their preferred candidate any favours here,\u201d she said. Speaking on the same programme, Lord Falconer, a minister under Tony Blair, said he assumed it was intended to damage Starmer. \u201cIt tells us much more about the sense of the left in Labour losing its grip on the party,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you believe Keir Starmer or do you believe that shower that has been around dealing with, for example, allegations of antisemitism. My money is on the Keir Starmer side.\u201d A Labour spokesman said: \u201cThe Labour party takes its legal responsibilities for data protection \u2013 and the security and integrity of its data and systems \u2013 extremely seriously. We have written to all leadership candidates to remind them of their obligations under the law and to seek assurances that membership data will not be misused.\u201d It is understood that Jennie Formby, the party\u2019s general secretary, has written to all candidates to remind them about proper use of data, and that so far the party has not uncovered evidence of wrongdoing by Long-Bailey\u2019s team.",

      "body": "<h2>Sinn Fein votes to fight for seats in the Dail: IRA political wing to take seats in Irish parliament</h2> <p>by David Hearst<br>3 November 1986</p> <p><em>Dublin<br></em>The republican movement voted in Dublin last night to take up seats in the Dail, the Irish parliament, overturning the central tenet of republican faith for 65 years.</p> <p>The move is certain to embarrass coalition and opposition parties in the south in the run-up to the general election.</p> <p>Last night the Irish premier, Dr Garret FitzGerald, called on all Irish \u2018democratic parties\u2019 to unite to ensure no Sinn Fein representative is elected to the Dail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/14/northernireland.politics\">Abstention policy's deep roots</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a highly charged five-hour debate in which the leaders of the Provisional Sinn Fein were accused by the abstentionists of collaborating with a parliament they were dedicated to overthrowing, the party\u2019s executive succeeded by a margin of nine delegate votes in getting the two-thirds majority needed to change the party\u2019s constitution. The vote was carried by 429 to 161.</p> <p>But the long-awaited walkout of delegates under the leadership of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/ruairi-o-bradaigh\">Ruairi O\u2019Bradaigh</a>, the former president of the Provisional Sinn Fein, involved fewer than 30 delegates.</p> <p>Most heeded the public call for unity expressed by Mr Gerry Adams, the party\u2019s president, and author of the new strategy, who made a point of shaking Mr O\u2019Bradaighs hand before he addressed the meeting. In an emotional appeal Mr Adams said that a split would only help the movement\u2019s enemies: \u2018There must be no blood feud. \u2018</p> <p>Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading member of Sinn Fein in Londonderry, who is regarded as being close to the leadership of the Provisional IRA, told delegates that when the IRA met to discuss the issue in special convention a month ago a minority disagreed with the decision but pledged that they would not form a breakaway group.</p> <p>Later last night Mr O\u2019Bradaigh and Mr Daithi O\u2019Connell announced that they were setting up a new party, which they called Republican Sinn Fein. At a meeting at an hotel outside Dublin attended by over 130 members O\u2019Connell said the new party was dedicated to establishing a \u2018democratic socialist republic. \u2018</p> <p>Earlier he had warned the delegates that once they entered Leinster House, the seat of the Dail, they would have to abide by its rules. \u2018In God\u2019s name, don\u2019t let it come about that Haughey, FitzGerald, Spring and those in London and Belfast can say, \u2018It took 65 years but they have come at last. \u2018</p> <p>Sinn Fein could expect from its current lack of support in the south to secure only one or two seats in the Dail.</p> <p>In a debate which often invoked the memory of members of the IRA killed in action the leaders of the party argued that they were not compromising their commitment to what they called \u2018the armed struggle\u2019. It was necessary to build a political base in the south and abstentionists were only increasing their isolation from ordinary people who accepted the Dail as their government.</p> <p>Giving one of the most assured performances of his political career, Mr Adams said in his presidential address that generations of Republicans had made the mistake of leaving politics to those outside the movement: \u2018The only feasible way to break out from our isolation, to make political gains and win support for our policies is by approaching people at the level they understood. \u2018</p> <p>Abstentionists had argued that if the party entered the Dail they would be tainted and the movement would be slowly reformed. As one delegate put it: \u2018When you lie down with the dog, you get up with the fleas. \u2018</p> <p>In a sustained attempt to remind the abstentionists, who were mainly from Dublin, that the leaders had the support of the Provisional IRA, one speaker after another said that the policy did not mean abandoning their commitment to rid the six counties of British rule.</p> <p>Mr Pat Doherty, a leading member of the party\u2019s ruling body, the Ard Chomhairle, said that the leaders had not fallen out of the sky but had picked up the pieces of their split with the Official Republicans in 1969. \u2018There are no long rifles in this leadership,\u2019 a reference to those supporters in Dublin who are accused by the north of supporting the IRA only by proxy.</p> <p>Mr John Joe McGirl, vice-president of the Sinn Fein and one of the IRA\u2019s old guard, said their hands had been tied in elections by the handicap of abstentionism.</p> <p>If they succeeded in getting seats in the Dail and building a political base in the south they would have succeeded where others had failed and hand down their struggle to younger generations.</p> <h2>The vote was regarded last night in Dublin as a personal affirmation of the leadership of Mr Adams</h2> <p>by Joe Joyce</p> <p>The volatility of public opinion in the Irish Republic is shown by an opinion poll today, which points towards a hung Dail if a general election were held now.</p> <p>The poll shows a slump in support for the main opposition party, Fianna Fail, from 51 per cent to 46 per cent of those questioned by the Market Research Bureau of Ireland. Dr Garret FitzGerald\u2019s Fine Gael party has increased its standing from 25 per cent in June to 29 per cent now.</p> <p>The poll, published by the Irish Times, was carried out last week but could have been only partly influenced by Colonel Gadafy\u2019s declaration of support for the opposition leader, Mr Charles Haughey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Click to read.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theguardian.newspapers.com/clip/43900406/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;display:block;&quot; target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?id=260283116&amp;width=700&amp;height=337&amp;crop=742_174_3814_2182&amp;rotation=0&amp;brightness=0&amp;contrast=0&amp;invert=0&amp;ts=1581246864&amp;h=07eb3b149ecc15a64b772adad58f22a6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;font: 13px helvetica, sans-serif; color: #747474;padding: 4px 0;max-width: 700px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  The Guardian, 3 November 1986.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Click to read.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Editorial: Sinn Fein in the hot seats</h2> <p>3 November 1986</p> <p>Sinn Fein\u2019s decision to end its abstentionist policy in the Irish Dail, a policy as old as the Republic, is a victory for Mr Gerry Adams and the younger spirits against the old guard, mainly in the South and mainly outside Dublin.

      "bodyText": "Sinn Fein votes to fight for seats in the Dail: IRA political wing to take seats in Irish parliament by David Hearst 3 November 1986 Dublin The republican movement voted in Dublin last night to take up seats in the Dail, the Irish parliament, overturning the central tenet of republican faith for 65 years. The move is certain to embarrass coalition and opposition parties in the south in the run-up to the general election. Last night the Irish premier, Dr Garret FitzGerald, called on all Irish \u2018democratic parties\u2019 to unite to ensure no Sinn Fein representative is elected to the Dail. After a highly charged five-hour debate in which the leaders of the Provisional Sinn Fein were accused by the abstentionists of collaborating with a parliament they were dedicated to overthrowing, the party\u2019s executive succeeded by a margin of nine delegate votes in getting the two-thirds majority needed to change the party\u2019s constitution. The vote was carried by 429 to 161. But the long-awaited walkout of delegates under the leadership of Ruairi O\u2019Bradaigh, the former president of the Provisional Sinn Fein, involved fewer than 30 delegates. Most heeded the public call for unity expressed by Mr Gerry Adams, the party\u2019s president, and author of the new strategy, who made a point of shaking Mr O\u2019Bradaighs hand before he addressed the meeting. In an emotional appeal Mr Adams said that a split would only help the movement\u2019s enemies: \u2018There must be no blood feud. \u2018 Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading member of Sinn Fein in Londonderry, who is regarded as being close to the leadership of the Provisional IRA, told delegates that when the IRA met to discuss the issue in special convention a month ago a minority disagreed with the decision but pledged that they would not form a breakaway group. Later last night Mr O\u2019Bradaigh and Mr Daithi O\u2019Connell announced that they were setting up a new party, which they called Republican Sinn Fein. At a meeting at an hotel outside Dublin attended by over 130 members O\u2019Connell said the new party was dedicated to establishing a \u2018democratic socialist republic. \u2018 Earlier he had warned the delegates that once they entered Leinster House, the seat of the Dail, they would have to abide by its rules. \u2018In God\u2019s name, don\u2019t let it come about that Haughey, FitzGerald, Spring and those in London and Belfast can say, \u2018It took 65 years but they have come at last. \u2018 Sinn Fein could expect from its current lack of support in the south to secure only one or two seats in the Dail. In a debate which often invoked the memory of members of the IRA killed in action the leaders of the party argued that they were not compromising their commitment to what they called \u2018the armed struggle\u2019. It was necessary to build a political base in the south and abstentionists were only increasing their isolation from ordinary people who accepted the Dail as their government. Giving one of the most assured performances of his political career, Mr Adams said in his presidential address that generations of Republicans had made the mistake of leaving politics to those outside the movement: \u2018The only feasible way to break out from our isolation, to make political gains and win support for our policies is by approaching people at the level they understood. \u2018 Abstentionists had argued that if the party entered the Dail they would be tainted and the movement would be slowly reformed. As one delegate put it: \u2018When you lie down with the dog, you get up with the fleas. \u2018 In a sustained attempt to remind the abstentionists, who were mainly from Dublin, that the leaders had the support of the Provisional IRA, one speaker after another said that the policy did not mean abandoning their commitment to rid the six counties of British rule. Mr Pat Doherty, a leading member of the party\u2019s ruling body, the Ard Chomhairle, said that the leaders had not fallen out of the sky but had picked up the pieces of their split with the Official Republicans in 1969. \u2018There are no long rifles in this leadership,\u2019 a reference to those supporters in Dublin who are accused by the north of supporting the IRA only by proxy. Mr John Joe McGirl, vice-president of the Sinn Fein and one of the IRA\u2019s old guard, said their hands had been tied in elections by the handicap of abstentionism. If they succeeded in getting seats in the Dail and building a political base in the south they would have succeeded where others had failed and hand down their struggle to younger generations. The vote was regarded last night in Dublin as a personal affirmation of the leadership of Mr Adams by Joe Joyce The volatility of public opinion in the Irish Republic is shown by an opinion poll today, which points towards a hung Dail if a general election were held now. The poll shows a slump in support for the main opposition party, Fianna Fail, from 51 per cent to 46 per cent of those questioned by the Market Research Bureau of Ireland. Dr Garret FitzGerald\u2019s Fine Gael party has increased its standing from 25 per cent in June to 29 per cent now. The poll, published by the Irish Times, was carried out last week but could have been only partly influenced by Colonel Gadafy\u2019s declaration of support for the opposition leader, Mr Charles Haughey. Editorial: Sinn Fein in the hot seats 3 November 1986 Sinn Fein\u2019s decision to end its abstentionist policy in the Irish Dail, a policy as old as the Republic, is a victory for Mr Gerry Adams and the younger spirits against the old guard, mainly in the South and mainly outside Dublin. It marks the biggest change in republican strategy since the split between the Provisional and Official IRA in 1970. The established parties will need time to come to terms with the decision, but it is bound to affect the conduct even of the next general election. Sinn Fein, under PR, may win a seat or two then, though they will be lucky to do so, but now that there is a serious candidate for deep green republicans to vote for the contest in the border areas between Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail will be all the keener.

The percentage of people in work is now higher than it has ever been and unemployment, using the internationally agreed yardstick, is below 4% and at its lowest since the mid-1970s.</p> \n<p>But as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation noted in a <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/uk-poverty-2019-20\">report released last week</a>, many of those with jobs are struggling to get by.

According to the foundation, 56% of those below the poverty line live in a household where someone is working.</p> \n<p>In-work poverty is not new. It was there in the late 1990s when Gordon Brown brought in tax credits to top up the earnings of those not making enough to get by from their wages alone. Critics of Labour\u2019s answer to in-work poverty said it would simply encourage employers to pay low wages because they knew the government would provide a top up. Over the years, the bill for tax credits kept on rising, and proved an easy target for George Osborne when he became chancellor in the 2010 coalition government.</p> \n<p>As the benefits system has become less generous, people have needed to work longer hours to get by.

Britain looks like a full-employment economy but also has large pockets of under-employment.

      "bodyText": "Turn the clock back to the mid-1990s. The UK economy is on the mend after its second deep recession in a decade but the scars are deep. Britain has an unemployment problem and a poverty problem. What\u2019s more, the two are linked because the majority of poor people live in workless households. Times have changed. The percentage of people in work is now higher than it has ever been and unemployment, using the internationally agreed yardstick, is below 4% and at its lowest since the mid-1970s. But as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation noted in a report released last week, many of those with jobs are struggling to get by. Britain still has a poverty problem, but now it is concentrated among the employed rather than the jobless. The official definition of poverty is someone who lives in a household where the money coming in \u2013 typically from pay and benefits \u2013 is below 60% of the median income for a similar family type after housing costs. According to the foundation, 56% of those below the poverty line live in a household where someone is working. In-work poverty is not new. It was there in the late 1990s when Gordon Brown brought in tax credits to top up the earnings of those not making enough to get by from their wages alone. Critics of Labour\u2019s answer to in-work poverty said it would simply encourage employers to pay low wages because they knew the government would provide a top up. Over the years, the bill for tax credits kept on rising, and proved an easy target for George Osborne when he became chancellor in the 2010 coalition government. As the benefits system has become less generous, people have needed to work longer hours to get by. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates that a single parent with two children in a job earning the \u201cnational living wage\u201d needs to work 23 hours per week to live free of poverty, compared with the 16 hours required in the absence of benefit cuts made post-2010. This helps explain why earnings growth has been so weak even as the official jobless rate has fallen to below 4%. Britain looks like a full-employment economy but also has large pockets of under-employment. If demand for labour increases, employers don\u2019t need to pay more to attract new workers; they simply have to offer existing workers more hours at the current rate. Two other things have happened over the past decade to intensify the problem of in-work poverty. Firstly, the financial crisis and its aftermath have transformed the labour market: there is more self-employment, there are more people on zero-hour contracts, more people who would work longer if they could. Secondly, housing has become a lot more expensive for those on low incomes. Most of those affected by in-work poverty are not owner-occupiers, so while ultra-low mortgage rates have kept housing costs down for those who own their own homes, renting has become more expensive. That helps explain why some of the highest levels of in-work poverty are to be found in London. Despite all that, analysis of the 2019 general election shows that those once described by Theresa May as \u201cjust about managing\u201d were more likely to have voted Conservative than Labour. Boris Johnson now has to deliver for them. Labour, still trying to work out why it was that working people deserted the party in their droves, says there is a big gap between the government\u2019s rhetoric and what it has actually delivered. \u201cWith wages still below pre-crisis levels and so many people struggling with universal credit, the Tories have singularly failed to deliver the decent wages and strong social security needed to lift people out of poverty,\u201d said John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. \u201cThe Tories have some cheek to talk about \u2018levelling up\u2019 when this report makes clear they have been responsible for levelling down the foundations of a healthy society, including good jobs and social security.\u201d McDonnell is right to point out the gap between the government\u2019s rhetoric and its record over the past decade. Unless Labour can win back the support of the in-work poor, its political prospects will remain bleak. How to do that? The most obvious way to tackle poverty pay is to raise wages.

      "bodyText": "Devastating storms have swept through eastern New South Wales, forcing flood evacuations and leaving tens of thousands without electricity. Utility companies were on Sunday rushing to turn the lights back on for the more than 100,000 customers left without power. Residents in low-lying areas near the Narrabeen Lagoon in northern Sydney were on Sunday night ordered to evacuate by the NSW State Emergency Service. The SES said people risked being trapped without power and water if they didn\u2019t leave the area. The south-west Sydney suburbs of Moorebank, Chipping Norton and Milperra were also ordered to evacuate. Flooding along the Hawkesbury River could disrupt gas and water deliveries to the north-west Sydney towns of Richmond and Windsor, the SES said. Emergency services have been swamped with calls since the deluge set in on Friday, while the extreme weather has caused transport chaos across Sydney. \u201cThis wet and windy weather is really wreaking havoc on our roads today, with paramedics responding to five car accidents every hour since Friday night,\u201d NSW Ambulance spokesman Giles Buchanan said on Sunday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019ve responded to multiple trees that had fallen on to cars, trees into houses and units, and people trapped in cars in floodwaters.\u201d NSW Maritime said a number of boats had been sunk by the turbulent conditions at sea. Four people were hospitalised on Sunday afternoon after a tree fell on their car in the Sydney CBD. A 16-year-old boy was also taken to hospital with suspected broken ribs after he was trapped between debris in waist-deep water for two hours in the Hunter region. The teen was rescued by emergency services after falling into Allyn River while canoeing at about 9am on Sunday. Utility company Ausgrid says more than 77,000 customers had lost electricity across Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle. Endeavour Energy said a further 26,000 customers were without power in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and southern highlands. \u201cCrews are reporting extensive damage after very strong winds brought down power lines in many areas,\u201d Endeavour Energy said. A severe weather warning was issued on Sunday for the entire coast of NSW, and would remain in place on Monday. The Bureau of Meteorology said the deluge could cause \u201clife-threatening flash flooding\u201d in the Hunter region, the Central Coast, greater Sydney, Illawarra and the Blue Mountains. Sydney, the Central Coast and the Blue Mountains were soaked by between 200 and 400mm of rain from 9am Friday to 5pm Sunday. The last time Sydney and the state\u2019s coast had similar rainfall was mid-2016. \u201cBut we\u2019ve surpassed those figures and you have to go back as far back as 1998 to see totals like we\u2019ll get,\u201d a weather bureau spokeswoman said. \u201cIt is uncommon to see rainfall rates as high as we have seen, up in the hundreds of millimetres occurring over consecutive days.\u201d NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Karen Webb urged drivers to take caution and avoid floodwaters. \u201cThere are currently hundreds of calls for assistance, including trees, boulders or power poles down on to cars and homes, and across roads, as well as power outages and localised flooding impacting various roads and traffic lights,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that I need to remind people to act responsibly and not to take risks in these types of conditions, especially when around floodwaters.\u201d A king tide in Sydney also caused inundation in low-lying areas and there were risks of coastal erosion, Golding said. That was expected to hit Collaroy and other areas that were eroded by the 2016 storm surge. The Sydney Harbour buoy was recording waves of 5m, surging to 8m, and the seas were so rough that the buoy off Collaroy beach pulled free from its moorings. The heaviest rain was recorded in the northern rivers region, where Kingscliff received 300mm in 24 hours. That rain was moving south down the coast, Golding said. Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains had received 200mm in the previous 24-hours, and parts of the mid-north coast received 250mm. The town of Narrabri, 521km north-west of Sydney, went from \u201cdrought to flooding in a day\u201d, the local SES said. Heavy rains made lakes of paddocks and flooded the train station. In the Blue Mountains, a landslip affected what appeared to be part of the rain line at Leura, which according to witness Charly Race left the rails exposed. \u201cIt was quite a loud noise,\u201d Race told Guardian Australia. \u201cMy mum heard it \u2013 she came out running and screaming. We then saw all the mud coming through the back yard. \u201cA bollard that was holding up the track has come out. There is nothing holding them up. You can see them \u2013 there\u2019s nothing under them.\u201d A significant amount of rain fell in the catchment areas for Sydney\u2019s water supply. WaterNSW storages were up 2% this week, and the Warragamba Dam catchment was forecast to receive 200mm of rain which will bring the dam level up to 70%. In the past week water levels in Warragamba have increased 0.9% to 43.8% full. The Avon Dam was up 6.1% in the past week, the Blue Mountains Dam was up 9.7%, and the Nepean Dam was up 7%. Meanwhile, locals on the NSW south coast were applauding the efforts of emergency services following the news that the massive Currowan Fire had been extinguished after burning for more than 70 days. \u201cAs of 8pm tonight, the Currowan Fire burning in the Shoalhaven has been set to out,\u201d NSW Rural Fire Service announced on Facebook on Saturday night. The blaze burnt for 74 days and across 499,621 hectares, spanning right across the region and spreading to neighbouring councils including Eurobodalla, Wingecarribee and Queanbeyan Palerang. The weather bureau warned that the burned-out landscape and loss of vegetation had left the south coast vulnerable to landslips. A video was posted online of a man driving his jetski past a McDonald\u2019s down a flooded street in Tuggerah on the Central Coast. It drew swift condemnation from the NSW police minister, David Elliott, who labelled the driver a \u201cboofhead\u201d and asked police to investigate. \u201cWe have emergency services deployed during a difficult job under difficult circumstances, and for them to have to divert their resources \u2026 it\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d Elliott said.",

      "body": "<h2>Bike &amp; Boot, Scarborough</h2> <p>A new hotel concept that focuses solely on the practicalities of cycling and walking in typical English weather. Inevitably mud is something of a preoccupation. \u201cWe will have drying areas, a bicycle station with cleaning area, a dog grooming and bathing station,\u201d says Simon Kershaw, executive director. \u201cAnd a shower area for guests, too.\u201d </p> <p>With Bike &amp; Boot, Kershaw and his business partner Simon Rhatigan are making a \u00a32m bet that the British are willing to swap foreign tans for a fine coating of the British countryside. The first one, with 60 rooms, opens on the seafront in Scarborough in May, but is already taking bookings.</p> <p>\u2018\u2018In terms of facilities, it\u2019ll be ski-chalet level,\u201d says Kershaw. Hotel guests will get access to its \u201cRetreat\u201d, with complimentary tea, coffee and cake. The secure cycle storage area will have CCTV and if the weather is really atrocious, there\u2019s an in-house cinema and an all-day restaurant.</p> <p>Until now, hostels have largely led the way in terms of offering good facilities. They are anticipating a reboot of the classic touring holiday; motorcyclists won\u2019t be forgotten, nor will classic car drivers. Both subcultures will have dedicated secure areas to park and there will be charging points for electric cars. Kershaw and Rhatigan, with over 40 years experience in hotels between them, have already pinpointed sites to expand to in the satisfyingly hilly areas of North Wales, the Peak District and the Forest of Bowland.</p> <p>Country house hotels have slowly started to adapt too, ditching the hunting, shooting and fishing ethos for less class-ridden activities. As holiday-makers are thinking more seriously about their carbon footprint and the ethics of long-haul flights, Kershaw and Rhatigan\u2019s niche offering feels like perfect timing. <br>\u2022 <em>Rates </em><em>start at \u00a370 room only, rising to \u00a3185 for </em><em>suites,</em><em><a href=\"https://www.bikeandboot.com/\" title=\"\">bikeandboot.com</a></em></p> <h2>YHA Dartmoor</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb7d01737682493ed54e6b71ae53a05f79150c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb7d01737682493ed54e6b71ae53a05f79150c91/0_133_5180_3108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man hiking across a stone bridge in Dartmoor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take a hike: a stone bridge on Dartmoor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Gregory/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This hostel in Postbridge, Devon has the active essentials of cycle store, drying room and laundry area.

      "bodyText": "Bike &amp; Boot, Scarborough A new hotel concept that focuses solely on the practicalities of cycling and walking in typical English weather. Inevitably mud is something of a preoccupation. \u201cWe will have drying areas, a bicycle station with cleaning area, a dog grooming and bathing station,\u201d says Simon Kershaw, executive director. \u201cAnd a shower area for guests, too.\u201d With Bike &amp; Boot, Kershaw and his business partner Simon Rhatigan are making a \u00a32m bet that the British are willing to swap foreign tans for a fine coating of the British countryside. The first one, with 60 rooms, opens on the seafront in Scarborough in May, but is already taking bookings. \u2018\u2018In terms of facilities, it\u2019ll be ski-chalet level,\u201d says Kershaw. Hotel guests will get access to its \u201cRetreat\u201d, with complimentary tea, coffee and cake. The secure cycle storage area will have CCTV and if the weather is really atrocious, there\u2019s an in-house cinema and an all-day restaurant. Until now, hostels have largely led the way in terms of offering good facilities. They are anticipating a reboot of the classic touring holiday; motorcyclists won\u2019t be forgotten, nor will classic car drivers. Both subcultures will have dedicated secure areas to park and there will be charging points for electric cars. Kershaw and Rhatigan, with over 40 years experience in hotels between them, have already pinpointed sites to expand to in the satisfyingly hilly areas of North Wales, the Peak District and the Forest of Bowland. Country house hotels have slowly started to adapt too, ditching the hunting, shooting and fishing ethos for less class-ridden activities. As holiday-makers are thinking more seriously about their carbon footprint and the ethics of long-haul flights, Kershaw and Rhatigan\u2019s niche offering feels like perfect timing. \u2022 Rates start at \u00a370 room only, rising to \u00a3185 for suites,bikeandboot.com YHA Dartmoor This hostel in Postbridge, Devon has the active essentials of cycle store, drying room and laundry area. There\u2019s a family-friendly six-mile circular route that goes past the hostel, while Bellever Forest has more trails that are also good for novices. Walking and climbing is also superb, including circular routes and more challenging ones. \u2022 Private rooms, sleeping up to three, from \u00a336, room only, yha.org.uk Enniskeen Country House Hotel, County Down This small hotel in the Mourne Mountains is run by a family of enthusiastic walkers. It does a pick-up and drop-off service for both walkers and cyclists, as well as providing laminated maps, packed lunches and Thermos flasks. Back at the hotel, a Victorian mansion built by a local tobacco and shipping-rope magnate, the drying room comes with dehumidifiers. Bike hire can be arranged, including e-bikes. The hotel also has walking boots, waterproof clothing and rucksacks for hire. \u2022 Doubles B&amp;B from \u00a3100, enniskeenhotel.co.uk Castle Hotel, Shropshire In the tiny market town of Bishop\u2019s Castle, this hotel has a history that reaches back 300 years. It now has a keen cyclist in charge. There\u2019s secure lockable space available for bicycles, as well as overnight clothes-drying facilities. In addition, there\u2019s an external hose and brushes to clean bikes, plus bicycle repair, pump, tools and first aid kit available. The Bishop\u2019s Castle Ring and the Bishop\u2019s Castle Challenge Walk provide plenty of challenges for experienced walkers. \u2022 B&amp;B from \u00a3110, thecastlehotelbishopscastle.co.uk Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel, Gwynedd At the foot of Mount Snowdon, this was once a key training base for the successful 1953 ascent of Everest. There\u2019s still a 1950s ambience, from the vintage hobnail boots on display and the chintz furniture, alongside wood fires and hearty meals. It\u2019s fair to say that mountaineers are top of the heap here, but walkers also come in their droves, and while there\u2019s no dedicated storage, cyclists can store their bikes in the locked beer shed. \u2022 Doubles B&amp;B from \u00a395, pyg.co.uk White Swan, Yorkshire A cheery pub in the market town of Pickering that\u2019s nicely placed for the Tour de Yorkshire highlights, as well as Dalby Forest, which has hosted the world mountain bike championships. Owned by a cycling enthusiast, plenty of thought has been given to the facilities including a drying room, lockable storage and a work-bench. There\u2019s a proper pub atmosphere with open fires, plus Feast, a caf\u00e9 that can provide a packed lunch. \u2022 Doubles B&amp;B from \u00a3150, white-swan.co.uk Manorhaus Ruthin and Llangollen Just over the Welsh border from Chester, Ruthin\u2019s walking trails around Clwydian Range, Dee Valley and Offa\u2019s Dyke means that this hotel has a strong walking heritage. Road cycling highlights include the Horseshoe Pass running from Llandegla \u2013 just outside Ruthin \u2013 to Llangollen and there\u2019s also the mountain-biking centre at Coed Llandegla. At Manorhaus in Ruthin, there\u2019s lockable storage for three bikes; its sister hotel in Llangollen has space for six. As Chris Frost, co-owner of Manorhaus, says: \u201cIf you have a \u00a35,000 bike, you want to know it\u2019s going to be stored properly \u2013 and you want to stay somewhere nice.\u201d \u2022 Doubles from \u00a380 room only, manorhaus.com Bunk &amp; Breakfast, Yorkshire Basic but well thought through accommodation that is part of the Dales Bike Centre in Swaledale Valley. There are 14 bunk beds, with shared facilities plus caf\u00e9, repair shop, washdown area and, above all, 24-hour cake access via an honesty box (there\u2019s usually a selection of around 15 different bakes). Nearby rides include the 30-mile Tan Hill Loop. \u2022 B&amp;B rooms from \u00a358, dalesbikecentre.co.uk Selkirk Arms Hotel, Dumfries &amp; Galloway In the arty town of Kirkcudbright, this friendly inn has a large, lockable storage area for bicycles, with a wrench and tune area with washdown and lube facilities. Owner Chris Walker has a variety of routes to share on Strava. If you don\u2019t bring your bike with you, nearby Galloway Cycles can rent bicycles from \u00a330 a day. On foot, there\u2019s the River Dee and the Solway coast to explore. \u2022 Doubles B&amp;B from \u00a399, selkirkarmshotel.co.uk Brimstone, Cumbria Easily accessible by train, this luxury hotel near Ambleside has a partnership with Arc\u2019teryx that allows guests to borrow everything from boots, jackets and gloves to rucksacks. It\u2019s part of the Langdale Estate, so guests have 14 hectares (35 acres) to explore \u2013 with Hodge Close off-road cycling just beyond \u2013 and can spa their aches away afterwards. There\u2019s secure storage for bikes and bike hire available nearby. \u2022 Doubles B&amp;B from \u00a3314, 01539 438 062, brimstonehotel.co.uk Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>Nine-year-old Jai lives in a slum on the outskirts of an unnamed Indian city with his parents and older sister. In many ways he is an unremarkable boy: he watches reality cop shows on TV, attends the overcrowded government school, and tries to stay out of trouble. But when one of his classmates goes missing, Jai \u2013 taking inspiration from the television programmes he devours \u2013 turns amateur detective and vows to uncover the mystery of the disappearance. With the help of his two best friends \u2013 sensible swot Pari and diligent Faiz \u2013 they form a comically hapless trio and set off on the city metro\u2019s purple line to investigate.</p> <p>Anappara\u2019s debut novel is part detective story, part coming-of-age tale, with a powerful undercurrent of social commentary. The \u201cbasti\u201d where Jai lives is a place of oppressive streets and ramshackle houses: \u201cI look at our house with upside-down eyes and count five holes in our tin roof. There might be more but I can\u2019t see them because the black smog outside has wiped the stars off the sky.\u201d Anappara seduces us with tastes and smells, reminding us that even within this environment, where pollution weighs heavy in the air and scavenging from the local landfill is commonplace, there is still beauty and enjoyment in food: \u201cMa gathers ginger and garlic slivers and throws them into the pan, followed by a pinch of turmeric and coriander and cumin powder.\u201d</p> <p>Overlooking the slum is a gated community, populated by those at the other end of the economic spectrum, where Jai\u2019s mother works for a demanding and domineering boss. The juxtaposition is nicely conceived and Anappara creates a sense of claustrophobia.</p> <p>What really sets <em>Djinn Patrol </em>apart, though, is the authenticity of Jai\u2019s voice. Narrating in the first person, Anappara immerses us not only in Jai\u2019s world of deep social inequities, but also in his internal world. Precocious experiences are juxtaposed with childlike sensibilities. Jai gets a job as a teashop boy, the work heartbreakingly severe for a nine-year-old child: \u201cIt takes ages to clean just one of the Duttaram\u2019s pans. Their bottoms are sticky with burnt tea and spices and sugar.

      "bodyText": "Nine-year-old Jai lives in a slum on the outskirts of an unnamed Indian city with his parents and older sister. In many ways he is an unremarkable boy: he watches reality cop shows on TV, attends the overcrowded government school, and tries to stay out of trouble. But when one of his classmates goes missing, Jai \u2013 taking inspiration from the television programmes he devours \u2013 turns amateur detective and vows to uncover the mystery of the disappearance. With the help of his two best friends \u2013 sensible swot Pari and diligent Faiz \u2013 they form a comically hapless trio and set off on the city metro\u2019s purple line to investigate. Anappara\u2019s debut novel is part detective story, part coming-of-age tale, with a powerful undercurrent of social commentary. The \u201cbasti\u201d where Jai lives is a place of oppressive streets and ramshackle houses: \u201cI look at our house with upside-down eyes and count five holes in our tin roof. There might be more but I can\u2019t see them because the black smog outside has wiped the stars off the sky.\u201d Anappara seduces us with tastes and smells, reminding us that even within this environment, where pollution weighs heavy in the air and scavenging from the local landfill is commonplace, there is still beauty and enjoyment in food: \u201cMa gathers ginger and garlic slivers and throws them into the pan, followed by a pinch of turmeric and coriander and cumin powder.\u201d Overlooking the slum is a gated community, populated by those at the other end of the economic spectrum, where Jai\u2019s mother works for a demanding and domineering boss. The juxtaposition is nicely conceived and Anappara creates a sense of claustrophobia. What really sets Djinn Patrol apart, though, is the authenticity of Jai\u2019s voice. Narrating in the first person, Anappara immerses us not only in Jai\u2019s world of deep social inequities, but also in his internal world. Precocious experiences are juxtaposed with childlike sensibilities. Jai gets a job as a teashop boy, the work heartbreakingly severe for a nine-year-old child: \u201cIt takes ages to clean just one of the Duttaram\u2019s pans. Their bottoms are sticky with burnt tea and spices and sugar. I have to scrub and scrub, and my fingertips turn blue from the icy waters and my legs hurt from squatting to wash vessels.\u201d Unwilling \u2013 or perhaps unable \u2013 to accept that the children\u2019s disappearances might be due to kidnappers, child traffickers or murderers, Jai finds comfort in the idea that they have been abducted by a mythical djinn. And yet, at times, he also displays a preternatural maturity in his observations: \u201cOur basti could go up in flames and we still won\u2019t be on TV.\u201d In channelling complex social and political realities through Jai\u2019s voice, Anappara creates an endearing and highly engaging narrator to navigate us through the dark underbelly of modern India. \u2022 Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line by Deepa Anappara is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>Halima Aden, then aged 19, became the first contestant in the Miss USA 2016 beauty pageant to wear a hijab and burkini, attracting the attention of French fashion legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/carine-roitfeld\" title=\"\">Carine Roitfeld</a>. The following year she became the first hijab-wearing model to sign with a global modelling agency, IMG, and then the first to walk at New York fashion week, for Yeezy, the Kanye West brand. She later became the first hijab-wearing model to make the cover of <em>Vogue</em> \u2013 twice (first <em>Vogue Arabia</em>, then British <em>Vogue</em>) \u2013 and soon afterwards a <em>Sports Illustrated</em> swimsuit shoot followed. By that point she\u2019d already become a Unicef ambassador, and a go-to voice on diversity in the fashion industry. In 2017 she gave the first <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/halima_aden_how_i_went_from_child_refugee_to_international_model?language=en\" title=\"\">TED</a> talk at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. <em>Teen Vogue</em> went with her.</p> <p>When we meet, at a hotel near King\u2019s Cross, I ask if it ever gets tiring, being the first in so many different ways, shouldering the burden of representation. \u201cSomebody needs to,\u201d Aden says. \u201cI want my sister, my little nieces, even my nephews to see representations of somebody who wears a hijab in modern ways, in such a way that they can relate to.\u201d We\u2019re sitting side by side on a window seat, Aden holding court before a little audience of PRs, management and her best friend, Lizeth, who has travelled with her from the US. Though she looks very much the high-fashion figure, all in black \u2013 sequins and brocade lace, knee-high stiletto boots \u2013 she seems younger than her 22 years, gabbing away in the stream-of-conscious slang and asides of a teenager still starstruck by the turns her life has taken.</p> <p>But on the topics of diversity, representation and sustainability, she speaks with passion and conviction. She has said in the past that, growing up in the US: \u201cThe only times I saw somebody dressed like me was on CNN \u2013 and they weren\u2019t doing anything I approve of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel like we all deserve representation and I didn\u2019t have that,\u201d Aden says now. \u201cI never got to flip through a magazine and see somebody who looks like me.\u201d Lizeth digs out the latest issue of <em>Essence</em> magazine, Aden proud in pink on the cover. Aden takes it from her, somewhat wonderingly. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s so wild for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI still catch myself\u2026 When my friend went and got that from the newsstand, I was like: \u2018Oh my God.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d66a43e807dfcff365c9f4c8c67a81e7e2e7e0b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d66a43e807dfcff365c9f4c8c67a81e7e2e7e0b3/0_673_3473_2084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Modesty blaze: taking a selfie with Carine Roitfeld and Gigi Hadid at a Business of Fashion event during New York fashion week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modesty blaze: taking a selfie with Carine Roitfeld and Gigi Hadid at a Business of Fashion event during New York fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact she has been able to have a global career in fashion at all is proof that the industry is increasingly open to diversity. Aden is 5ft 5in, petite for a model, and a resident of Minnesota, far from the industry capitals of New York, London, Paris or Milan. \u201cAnd the fact that I\u2019m able to do runway, the fact that I have graced these magazine covers and wear a hijab on top of that, be who I am, have my identity, wear it proudly\u2026 I think fashion is doing a beautiful job.\u201d</p> <p>Aden now has her own 47-piece hijab collection, Halima x Modanisa, and her hijab is stipulated as non-negotiable in her contract with IMG. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of my identity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t think people are going to listen \u2013 it\u2019s more so they know what to expect. I always bring extras \u2013 my own set of turbans, turtlenecks, tights \u2013 because it\u2019s a collaboration. I also recognise that for a lot of people, in my first year especially, I was the only hijab-wearing girl they\u2019d worked with. So they\u2019re not going to necessarily know 100% what to expect, just like I didn\u2019t know what to expect with fashion, because it\u2019s not the world that I come from.\u201d</p> <p>She does have certain requirements, such as a pop-up tent in which to change backstage at shows, but she says she\u2019s never been uncomfortably set apart, or made to feel othered. She remembers her experience of walking for Yeezy at New York fashion week in 2017, her breakout year, as a watershed moment. The first outfit she was presented with \u201cwas just not going to work,\u201d she says, gesturing above her knee \u2013 too short. \u201cEven then I knew: walking away when something doesn\u2019t fit is always better than feeling you need to force something.\u201d</p> <p>She returned to her hotel, disappointed but resolute. \u201cAnd then, without having to say anything, they called back: \u2018We have a second option.\u2019 I tried it on and it was perfect. I just knew it was a pivotal moment in my life. The people who you want to work with, they\u2019re willing to work with you just the way you are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"246f3328a0b2fa82a66d6a9efb709d28e569021e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/246f3328a0b2fa82a66d6a9efb709d28e569021e/0_0_6176_7420/832.jpg\" alt=\"My story isn\u2019t just: \u2018I grew up in a refugee camp\u2019: Halima Aden wears hoodie by rokit.co.uk; dress by Ss\u014dne, matchesfashion.com; glasses by francisdelara.com; and bag strap, worn as a headband, bottletop.com.\" width=\"832\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My story isn\u2019t just: \u2018I grew up in a refugee camp\u2019: Halima Aden wears hoodie by <a href=\"http://rokit.co.uk\">rokit.co.uk</a>; dress by Ss\u014dne, <a href=\"http://matchesfashion.com\">matchesfashion.com</a>; glasses by <a href=\"http://francisdelara.com\">francisdelara.com</a>; and bag strap, worn as a headband, <a href=\"http://bottletop.com\">bottletop.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul Pietrus/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That same year, Aden remembers walking for MaxMara at Milan fashion week in a look that had been designed with her in mind. When she posted it on Instagram, a woman commented: \u201cHe keeps you in mind, he keeps us in mind. Now this Muslim shopper will keep MaxMara in mind.\u201d Aden shared it with the brand. \u201cI was like \u2013 wink-wink-wink!\u201d</p> <p>It led to an exclusive capsule collection in the Middle East, for which Aden was the face. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for designers when they\u2019re diverse; it\u2019s a win for the brand, it\u2019s a win for everybody \u2013 we all want to see a little piece of ourselves reflecting back.\u201d And it makes a difference, she says. The year after Aden became the first contestant to wear a hijab in Miss USA, there were seven others. Last year she was one of two hijabi models on the MaxMara catwalk in Milan, and one of three for her second <em>Vogue Arabia</em> cover.</p> <p>When Aden was seven, she used to pray for rain \u2013 the kind of torrential rain that would wash away her new home in the American Midwest. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Then our neighbours could come out and play,\u2019\u201d she says. Even the structure of her apartment building felt alienating. \u201cI was like, \u2018God, everybody is so isolated.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Aden was born a refugee in the United Nations Kakuma camp in northwestern Kenya, where her mother had fled the Somali civil war in 1994. There their house was made of mud, scraps, sticks \u2013 anything her mother could find. \u201cIt would be normal for me to go to nursery school, come back and find it had washed away,\u201d she says. But then the community would come together to rebuild it, \u201cand then it\u2019s the kids\u2019 time to play around.\u201d</p> <p>The model remembers her childhood in the camp as being joyful and supportive. \u201cThere\u2019s no walls keeping you apart from your neighbour,\u201d she says. In her new home in Missouri, where she was relocated with her family in 2004, before moving to Minnesota, where they live today, the barriers stood strong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99e42afdac0d31cb395c009ee9e69cacebd7e7c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99e42afdac0d31cb395c009ee9e69cacebd7e7c8/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Listen up: speaking at a Teen Vogue summit in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Listen up: speaking at a Teen Vogue summit in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cKakuma\u201d translates from Swahili as \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d. \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m like, \u2018I was born in the middle of nowhere,\u2019 people think I\u2019m joking,\u201d Aden says. \u201cBut if you actually look at Google Maps\u2026\u201d People tend to think of a refugee camp as being a temporary settlement. But Kakuma is \u201cmore of a city of its own,\u201d says Aden, in both permanence and size. Established by the UN in 1992 with a 70,000-person capacity, it has since ballooned to about 192,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority of whom are never resettled (the global figure is less than 1%).</p> <p>As a child, Aden remembers thriving under the collective care of the community, which was two thirds women and children. She was bright \u2013 she spoke Somali and Swahili, sometimes translating for the grown-ups \u2013 and popular, roaming the camp with up to 30 playmates of mixed ages and ethnicities. (\u201cIf you could keep up, you were in the group.\u201d)</p> <p>Aden is well aware that her happy stories of childhood challenge the stereotype of the \u201ctragic refugee\u201d, though she credits her mother with working hard to shield her young family from hardship. Aden never knew her father. He was lost during the Somali civil war, and assumed dead by her mother; he made contact after they had moved to the US, but died before Aden could develop a relationship. \u201cIt was both the scars and the smiles,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a happy childhood and also, we lived in uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>Symbolic of this limbo was a noticeboard that was updated with the names and destinations of those lucky few bound for resettlement. Aden remembers it as larger than life, \u201clike something out of <em>The Hunger Games</em>\u201d: \u201cIt would control your entire future \u2013 it was literally the difference between life and death. For parents it meant a brand new life: \u2018We\u2019re starting over, we won the lottery.\u2019 But for the kids it is: \u2018I\u2019m never seeing my friends again\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"201f00b7e7493e817d0563ce613b82ebebb269b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/201f00b7e7493e817d0563ce613b82ebebb269b7/0_0_7043_8220/857.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion meets activism: Halima Aden wears coat by Gabriela Hearst, selfridges.com; top by charlotteknowles.com; belt by varanaworld.com; and bag by bottletop.com.\" width=\"857\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fashion meets activism: Halima Aden wears coat by Gabriela Hearst, <a href=\"http://selfridges.com/\">selfridges.com</a>; top by <a href=\"http://charlotteknowles.com/\">charlotteknowles.com</a>; belt by <a href=\"http://varanaworld.com/\">varanaworld.com</a>; and bag by <a href=\"http://bottletop.com/\">bottletop.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul Pietrus/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another common misconception of being a refugee, Aden says, \u201cis that you get a say where you go\u201d. Her family were relocated to a poverty-stricken, crime-rife neighbourhood in St Louis, Missouri, which \u2013 compared to the \u201cnurturing\u201d community of Kakuma \u2013 came as a shock. That was when she felt most isolated, when she wished for her house to wash away. It was the first time she\u2019d heard gunshots. \u201cBut nonetheless, did I have the fear of malaria? No \u2013 so, in a way, it was like trading one obstacle for another.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest hurdle was learning English: Aden\u2019s school in St Louis did not have an English language programme. After two weeks of presenteeism, Aden recalls her mother asking her to read some written English aloud. \u201cI literally started mouthing the words to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYHDfJDPDc\" title=\"\">Dilemma</a>\u201d \u2013 rapper Nelly and Kelly Rowland\u2019s syrupy duet, which she knew from the radio. Aden mimics a haltering recital: \u201c\u2018No matt-er. Whatido. All I think about. Is you\u2019 \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t stand the idea of disappointing her.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually Aden\u2019s mother decided to relocate the family to St Cloud, Minnesota, where they found a community like the one that they had left at the camp. At first they were heavily reliant on it, living on food stamps and even, for six months, in a women\u2019s shelter. Aden remembers the kindness of neighbours, taking the family to the grocery store during the punishing winters, giving her mother lifts when she couldn\u2019t drive. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m so loyal,\u201d she says. \u201cI love my state.\u201d She lives in St Paul now, closer to the airport, but only 40 minutes from her mother, who\u2019s still in St Cloud. Minnesota is known for high taxes, but Aden says she is happy to pay them. \u201cI relied on welfare when I was little... I think of it as my way of paying back.\u201d</p> <p>Before we meet, Aden\u2019s team is adamant that I don\u2019t ask her about Trump or US politics, so instead I ask her how superficial diversity in fashion tallies with a more fractious, divided world.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even really avoid politics,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve needed in order to connect with people. Once I share my story, there\u2019s always some common ground. It doesn\u2019t have to be: \u2018I grew up in a refugee camp.\u2019 I get just as many messages, believe it or not, from parents who are not Muslim, who are not black, who say, \u2018Thank you for making modesty look cool and young\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24791cd81a1670d66e645d472bab3706fcfbdbb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24791cd81a1670d66e645d472bab3706fcfbdbb5/0_0_6110_8220/743.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I want people to see me wearing a hijab in ways they can relate to\u2019: Halima Aden wears jacket, shirt and trousers, all by stellamccartney.com; trainers by Good News, net-a-porter.com; bag and brooches by bottletop.com; and headscarf by Halima x Modanisa, modanisa.com.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want people to see me wearing a hijab in ways they can relate to\u2019: Halima Aden wears jacket, shirt and trousers, all by <a href=\"http://stellamccartney.com/\">stellamccartney.com</a>; trainers by Good News, <a href=\"http://net-a-porter.com/\">net-a-porter.com</a>; bag and brooches by <a href=\"http://bottletop.com/\">bottletop.com</a>; and headscarf by Halima x Modanisa, <a href=\"http://modanisa.com/\">modanisa.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul Pietrus/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When she entered the Miss Minnesota USA pageant in 2016, as a freshman at St Cloud State University, Aden told local media that she wanted to represent Muslim women and counter the image that they were oppressed. \u201cThe hijab is a symbol we wear on our heads,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I want people to know that it is my choice.\u201d Today she says her motivations for entering were less lofty. \u201cCollege tuition is expensive in the States, muuuuuucho expensive!\u201d And the top 15 at the pageant were offered scholarships. Did Aden think she\u2019d win? \u201cNo, God, no.\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut top 15?

Two days before the pageant, Aden almost pulled out. But as she told the newspaper at the time: \u201cYou don\u2019t let being the first to do it stop you.\u201d</p> <p>She ended up making the semi-finals, \u201cbraces and all.

Sorry, Mom!\u201d</p> <p>The global spotlight on Aden caught the eye of Carine Roitfeld, who flew her to New York to shoot the cover of <em><a href=\"https://www.crfashionbook.com/\" title=\"\">CR Fashion Book</a></em> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gigi-hadid\" title=\"\">Gigi Hadid</a>, Paris Jackson and legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti.

      "bodyText": "Halima Aden, then aged 19, became the first contestant in the Miss USA 2016 beauty pageant to wear a hijab and burkini, attracting the attention of French fashion legend Carine Roitfeld. The following year she became the first hijab-wearing model to sign with a global modelling agency, IMG, and then the first to walk at New York fashion week, for Yeezy, the Kanye West brand. She later became the first hijab-wearing model to make the cover of Vogue \u2013 twice (first Vogue Arabia, then British Vogue) \u2013 and soon afterwards a Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot followed. By that point she\u2019d already become a Unicef ambassador, and a go-to voice on diversity in the fashion industry. In 2017 she gave the first TED talk at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. Teen Vogue went with her. When we meet, at a hotel near King\u2019s Cross, I ask if it ever gets tiring, being the first in so many different ways, shouldering the burden of representation. \u201cSomebody needs to,\u201d Aden says. \u201cI want my sister, my little nieces, even my nephews to see representations of somebody who wears a hijab in modern ways, in such a way that they can relate to.\u201d We\u2019re sitting side by side on a window seat, Aden holding court before a little audience of PRs, management and her best friend, Lizeth, who has travelled with her from the US. Though she looks very much the high-fashion figure, all in black \u2013 sequins and brocade lace, knee-high stiletto boots \u2013 she seems younger than her 22 years, gabbing away in the stream-of-conscious slang and asides of a teenager still starstruck by the turns her life has taken. But on the topics of diversity, representation and sustainability, she speaks with passion and conviction. She has said in the past that, growing up in the US: \u201cThe only times I saw somebody dressed like me was on CNN \u2013 and they weren\u2019t doing anything I approve of.\u201d \u201cI feel like we all deserve representation and I didn\u2019t have that,\u201d Aden says now. \u201cI never got to flip through a magazine and see somebody who looks like me.\u201d Lizeth digs out the latest issue of Essence magazine, Aden proud in pink on the cover. Aden takes it from her, somewhat wonderingly. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s so wild for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI still catch myself\u2026 When my friend went and got that from the newsstand, I was like: \u2018Oh my God.\u2019\u201d The fact she has been able to have a global career in fashion at all is proof that the industry is increasingly open to diversity. Aden is 5ft 5in, petite for a model, and a resident of Minnesota, far from the industry capitals of New York, London, Paris or Milan. \u201cAnd the fact that I\u2019m able to do runway, the fact that I have graced these magazine covers and wear a hijab on top of that, be who I am, have my identity, wear it proudly\u2026 I think fashion is doing a beautiful job.\u201d Aden now has her own 47-piece hijab collection, Halima x Modanisa, and her hijab is stipulated as non-negotiable in her contract with IMG. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of my identity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t think people are going to listen \u2013 it\u2019s more so they know what to expect. I always bring extras \u2013 my own set of turbans, turtlenecks, tights \u2013 because it\u2019s a collaboration. I also recognise that for a lot of people, in my first year especially, I was the only hijab-wearing girl they\u2019d worked with. So they\u2019re not going to necessarily know 100% what to expect, just like I didn\u2019t know what to expect with fashion, because it\u2019s not the world that I come from.\u201d She does have certain requirements, such as a pop-up tent in which to change backstage at shows, but she says she\u2019s never been uncomfortably set apart, or made to feel othered. She remembers her experience of walking for Yeezy at New York fashion week in 2017, her breakout year, as a watershed moment. The first outfit she was presented with \u201cwas just not going to work,\u201d she says, gesturing above her knee \u2013 too short. \u201cEven then I knew: walking away when something doesn\u2019t fit is always better than feeling you need to force something.\u201d She returned to her hotel, disappointed but resolute. \u201cAnd then, without having to say anything, they called back: \u2018We have a second option.\u2019 I tried it on and it was perfect. I just knew it was a pivotal moment in my life. The people who you want to work with, they\u2019re willing to work with you just the way you are.\u201d That same year, Aden remembers walking for MaxMara at Milan fashion week in a look that had been designed with her in mind. When she posted it on Instagram, a woman commented: \u201cHe keeps you in mind, he keeps us in mind. Now this Muslim shopper will keep MaxMara in mind.\u201d Aden shared it with the brand. \u201cI was like \u2013 wink-wink-wink!\u201d It led to an exclusive capsule collection in the Middle East, for which Aden was the face. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for designers when they\u2019re diverse; it\u2019s a win for the brand, it\u2019s a win for everybody \u2013 we all want to see a little piece of ourselves reflecting back.\u201d And it makes a difference, she says. The year after Aden became the first contestant to wear a hijab in Miss USA, there were seven others. Last year she was one of two hijabi models on the MaxMara catwalk in Milan, and one of three for her second Vogue Arabia cover. When Aden was seven, she used to pray for rain \u2013 the kind of torrential rain that would wash away her new home in the American Midwest. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Then our neighbours could come out and play,\u2019\u201d she says. Even the structure of her apartment building felt alienating. \u201cI was like, \u2018God, everybody is so isolated.\u2019\u201d Aden was born a refugee in the United Nations Kakuma camp in northwestern Kenya, where her mother had fled the Somali civil war in 1994. There their house was made of mud, scraps, sticks \u2013 anything her mother could find. \u201cIt would be normal for me to go to nursery school, come back and find it had washed away,\u201d she says. But then the community would come together to rebuild it, \u201cand then it\u2019s the kids\u2019 time to play around.\u201d The model remembers her childhood in the camp as being joyful and supportive. \u201cThere\u2019s no walls keeping you apart from your neighbour,\u201d she says. In her new home in Missouri, where she was relocated with her family in 2004, before moving to Minnesota, where they live today, the barriers stood strong. \u201cKakuma\u201d translates from Swahili as \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d. \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m like, \u2018I was born in the middle of nowhere,\u2019 people think I\u2019m joking,\u201d Aden says. \u201cBut if you actually look at Google Maps\u2026\u201d People tend to think of a refugee camp as being a temporary settlement. But Kakuma is \u201cmore of a city of its own,\u201d says Aden, in both permanence and size. Established by the UN in 1992 with a 70,000-person capacity, it has since ballooned to about 192,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority of whom are never resettled (the global figure is less than 1%). As a child, Aden remembers thriving under the collective care of the community, which was two thirds women and children. She was bright \u2013 she spoke Somali and Swahili, sometimes translating for the grown-ups \u2013 and popular, roaming the camp with up to 30 playmates of mixed ages and ethnicities. (\u201cIf you could keep up, you were in the group.\u201d) Aden is well aware that her happy stories of childhood challenge the stereotype of the \u201ctragic refugee\u201d, though she credits her mother with working hard to shield her young family from hardship. Aden never knew her father. He was lost during the Somali civil war, and assumed dead by her mother; he made contact after they had moved to the US, but died before Aden could develop a relationship. \u201cIt was both the scars and the smiles,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a happy childhood and also, we lived in uncertainty.\u201d Symbolic of this limbo was a noticeboard that was updated with the names and destinations of those lucky few bound for resettlement. Aden remembers it as larger than life, \u201clike something out of The Hunger Games\u201d: \u201cIt would control your entire future \u2013 it was literally the difference between life and death. For parents it meant a brand new life: \u2018We\u2019re starting over, we won the lottery.\u2019 But for the kids it is: \u2018I\u2019m never seeing my friends again\u2019.\u201d Another common misconception of being a refugee, Aden says, \u201cis that you get a say where you go\u201d. Her family were relocated to a poverty-stricken, crime-rife neighbourhood in St Louis, Missouri, which \u2013 compared to the \u201cnurturing\u201d community of Kakuma \u2013 came as a shock. That was when she felt most isolated, when she wished for her house to wash away. It was the first time she\u2019d heard gunshots. \u201cBut nonetheless, did I have the fear of malaria? No \u2013 so, in a way, it was like trading one obstacle for another.\u201d The biggest hurdle was learning English: Aden\u2019s school in St Louis did not have an English language programme. After two weeks of presenteeism, Aden recalls her mother asking her to read some written English aloud. \u201cI literally started mouthing the words to Dilemma\u201d \u2013 rapper Nelly and Kelly Rowland\u2019s syrupy duet, which she knew from the radio. Aden mimics a haltering recital: \u201c\u2018No matt-er. Whatido. All I think about. Is you\u2019 \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t stand the idea of disappointing her.\u201d Eventually Aden\u2019s mother decided to relocate the family to St Cloud, Minnesota, where they found a community like the one that they had left at the camp. At first they were heavily reliant on it, living on food stamps and even, for six months, in a women\u2019s shelter. Aden remembers the kindness of neighbours, taking the family to the grocery store during the punishing winters, giving her mother lifts when she couldn\u2019t drive. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m so loyal,\u201d she says. \u201cI love my state.\u201d She lives in St Paul now, closer to the airport, but only 40 minutes from her mother, who\u2019s still in St Cloud. Minnesota is known for high taxes, but Aden says she is happy to pay them. \u201cI relied on welfare when I was little... I think of it as my way of paying back.\u201d Before we meet, Aden\u2019s team is adamant that I don\u2019t ask her about Trump or US politics, so instead I ask her how superficial diversity in fashion tallies with a more fractious, divided world. \u201cI don\u2019t even really avoid politics,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve needed in order to connect with people. Once I share my story, there\u2019s always some common ground. It doesn\u2019t have to be: \u2018I grew up in a refugee camp.\u2019 I get just as many messages, believe it or not, from parents who are not Muslim, who are not black, who say, \u2018Thank you for making modesty look cool and young\u2019.\u201d When she entered the Miss Minnesota USA pageant in 2016, as a freshman at St Cloud State University, Aden told local media that she wanted to represent Muslim women and counter the image that they were oppressed. \u201cThe hijab is a symbol we wear on our heads,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I want people to know that it is my choice.\u201d Today she says her motivations for entering were less lofty. \u201cCollege tuition is expensive in the States, muuuuuucho expensive!\u201d And the top 15 at the pageant were offered scholarships. Did Aden think she\u2019d win? \u201cNo, God, no.\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut top 15? I was like, \u2018I think I could do that\u2019.\u201d Aden\u2019s mother was strongly against her entering the pageant, arguing it would distract from her studies, and that the two-piece burkini was too skimpy. Though they have since been able to find common ground through her advocacy and work with Unicef, it can feel like they are from two different cultures sometimes. She didn\u2019t tell her mum about the Sports Illustrated shoot \u201cuntil it hit newsstands\u201d. She was also criticised by members of the Muslim community who saw modelling as haram \u2013 forbidden by Islamic law. \u201cIt was scary to put myself out there, because I didn\u2019t know if I would get backlash, or how bad it was going to be,\u201d she says. Two days before the pageant, Aden almost pulled out. But as she told the newspaper at the time: \u201cYou don\u2019t let being the first to do it stop you.\u201d She ended up making the semi-finals, \u201cbraces and all. And then IMG came calling \u2013 like, \u2018Well, well, well\u2026 maybe I don\u2019t need school.\u2019\u201d She leans back, for a second jokily triumphant \u2013 then seems to feel a chill coming in from across the Atlantic. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Sorry, Mom!\u201d The global spotlight on Aden caught the eye of Carine Roitfeld, who flew her to New York to shoot the cover of CR Fashion Book with Gigi Hadid, Paris Jackson and legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti. Aden agonised about asking for a selfie with Gigi (\u201cSo cringy,\u201d she says now). As for Sorrenti, though, she had to Google her later. His direction to her was, \u201cGive me sexy\u201d, she seems a little abashed to say. \u201cI didn\u2019t know fashion lingo, I didn\u2019t know photographers. I\u2019m a Minnesota girl \u2013 very small town.\u201d Even after signing with IMG, she watched all of Tyra Banks\u2019s outlandish reality series America\u2019s Next Top Model \u201cto practise\u201d. Seven months into her modelling career, she was still working part-time as a housekeeper in St Cloud. But rather than asking Aden to change, fashion\u2019s royalty has made room for her as she is. Last week she was back in Kenya for a shoot and \u201cI was just thinking, how crazy is it that, in one lifetime, I\u2019ve gotten to experience both extremes.\u201d Aden says she does not feel angry about the inequality she has seen \u2013 partly because she does not find it to be productive. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I say: \u2018We don\u2019t want your pity.\u2019 Let\u2019s talk about solutions, invite refugees to the table. They\u2019re part of the conversation \u2013 no policies should be enacted without their say.\u201d Though she rules out a career in politics (\u201cfor now\u201d), in the future she hopes to return to Kakuma with Unicef to inspire hope within the camp for a new life beyond it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you what that would have meant to me as a six or seven-year-old \u2013 like, \u2018Wait, there\u2019s a life outside these walls?\u2019 Hopefully, it\u2019s not going to be so rare to see kids from the camps grow up and become teachers, lawmakers, presidents and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. There\u2019s talent everywhere.\u201d For now Aden is pursuing opportunities in \u201cfashion activism\u201d. This month she was announced as the new face of the British accessories brand Bottletop, which was ahead of its time in positioning itself as \u201csustainable luxury\u201d in 2002. Its handbags and clutches, which are made from sustainable leather and upcycled metal ring pulls, help to alleviate poverty in Brazil, Nepal and Kenya. Aden is optimistic in general, but particularly about the potential for consumer choice to be a force for positive change: \u201cI think we\u2019re at a place where people want to support brands and organisations they know are giving back.\u201d She is also an ambassador for Bottletop\u2019s #Togetherband campaign, which is tasked with raising awareness of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. Aden is probably one of the few celebrities who can \u201crelate personally\u201d to all 17 of them. She has been assigned the eighth goal: \u201cDecent work and economic growth.\u201d The fact that the Swiss multinational bank UBS is a founding partner seems to suggest which way the wind is blowing. \u201cMy career in fashion is not just, \u2018I want to work with this brand, I want to get on that catwalk\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re not sitting here talking about \u2018Buy this heel, because this heel will make you feel sexy.\u2019\u201d She kicks up her stiletto boot, knee-high in black patent leather (admittedly very sexy). \u201cI\u2019m proud that I can say I combined fashion and activism.

You can find the latest updates related to your region on the NSW Bureau of Meteorology and NSW State Emergency Service websites. Thanks to everyone who contributed stories, photos and videos about the impacts of the floods. Stay safe everyone. Thanks to @Stilgherrian for letting us know that it\u2019s reportedly Leura not Katoomba. Let\u2019s take a look back at how the devastating storms that have ripped through the east coast of Australia unfolded today. Sydney, the Central Coast and the Blue Mountains were soaked by between 200 and 400mm of rain from 9am Friday to 5pm Sunday. Residents in low-lying areas near the Narrabeen Lagoon in northern Sydney, along with people in Moorebank, Chipping Norton and Milperra, have been ordered to evacuate by the NSW State Emergency Service. The SES says flooding along the Hawkesbury River could disrupt gas and water deliveries to the northwest Sydney towns of Richmond and Windsor. Emergency services have been swamped with calls since the deluge set in on Friday, while the extreme weather has caused transport chaos across Sydney. NSW Maritime says a number of boats have been sunk by the turbulent conditions at sea. Four people were hospitalised on Sunday afternoon after a tree fell on their car in the Sydney CBD. A 16-year-old boy was taken to hospital with suspected broken ribs after he was trapped between debris in waist-deep water for two hours in the Hunter region. Utility company Ausgrid says more than 77,000 customers have lost electricity across Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle, while Endeavour Energy says a further 26,000 customers are without power in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands regions. A severe weather warning was issued on Sunday for the entire coast of NSW, and will remain in place on Monday. The Bureau of Meteorology says the deluge could cause \u201clife-threatening flash flooding\u201d in the Hunter region, the Central Coast, greater Sydney, Illawarra and the Blue Mountains. In happier news, parched dams around Sydney, including the major Warragamba Dam, are swelling to their highest levels in years. The town of Warwick in southern Queensland had two years worth of drinking water flow into its dam. Emergency services in Western Australia have issued an all clear for areas of the Pilbara affected by cyclone Damien. This is a good reminder of how quickly the weather has changed in some areas. Narrabeen Sports High has announced it will be closed tomorrow due to flooding in the area. It said in the statement that other schools in the area will also be closed at the request of the SES. NSW SES has issued an evacuation order for Narrabeen Lagoon. It is directing people within Narrabeen Lagoon to evacuate the high danger area using Pittwater Road or Ocean Street by 10.30pm. The affected area is all properties surrounding Narrabeen Lagoon, from Wakehurst Parkway, Narrabeen bordered by The Esplanade, west of Pittwater Road from Goodwin St to Albert Street then along Lagoon St to Octavia St, properties west of Lisle St, including low-lying properties of Emerald St and Malcom St, Walsh Street west of Pittwater Rd towards Warriewood Rd along Macpherson St down Garden St to Pittwater Rd including low-lying properties of Nareen Pde, Gondola Rd, Rickard Rd, Windsor Pde and Bristol Ln. 1. Residents should relocate personal possessions to a safe place. 2. By 10:30pm, leave the high danger area and move to safety within the Narrabeen Lagoon. Once floodwater [reaches] 2.4m Pittwater Road will be cut. If you remain in the area after 10:30pm you will be trapped without power, water and other essential services and it may be too dangerous to rescue you. This flood will be higher than the 2016 flood of the Narrabeen Lagoon. More information is available here. More reports of fallen trees on the northern beaches. And another look at the tree that fell on a car in the Sydney CBD earlier today, landing its four passengers on hospital \u2013 thankfully in stable conditions. The State Emergency Service has issued a flood evacuation order for Moorebank, Chipping Norton and Milperra residents, who are being told to evacuate immediately. The affected area is all properties on Arthur Street (off Rickard Road), Rickard Road, Davy Robinson Drive and Newbridge Road between Milperra Bridge and Riverside Road. Residents should leave the high danger area towards Liverpool, the SES says. More information is available on the SES website. Some very important safety advice here from Fire and Rescue NSW for people who have chemicals stored in sheds that are in danger of flooding. Here\u2019s what it looks like in Narrabeen on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, which was issued with a flood evacuation warning a couple of hours ago. (You can read the full evacuation warning notice here). There are lots of homes without power this evening. AAP reports that utility companies are rushing to restore power in swamped regions, with more than 100,000 customers without electricity at one point on Sunday. Utility company Ausgrid says more than 77,000 customers have lost electricity across Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle. Endeavour Energy says a further 26,000 customers are without power in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and southern highlands regions. \u201cCrews are reporting extensive damage after very strong winds brought down power lines in many areas,\u201d Endeavour Energy said. A flood evacuation warning has also been issued for Hawkesbury River at North Richmond Lowlands: As a result of the flood level predicted by the Bureau of Meteorology for North Richmond Lowlands at 4:30pm 9th February, residents within the areas listed below should prepare to evacuate within the next 4 hours. The warning area covers all properties bounded by the Hawkesbury River, Brahma Road to rear of Poor Clares property, Douglas Street to Bells Line of Road at Redbank Creek. Residents should monitor the situation and be prepared to evacuate when instructed to do so. An Evacuation Order will be issued by the NSW SES if evacuation is required. The State Emergency Service has issued flood evacuation warnings for low-lying areas of Narrabeen in northern Sydney. \u201cHeavy rainfall is resulting in the Narrabeen Lagoon to rise quickly. There will be another high tide tonight at 10:45pm where you may become trapped without power, water and other essential services and it may be too dangerous for NSW SES to rescue you,\u201d the warning says. The advice right now is for residents to monitor the situation and be prepared to evacuate when instructed to do so. An Evacuation Order will be issued by the NSW SES if evacuation is required. According to the SES website residents within the areas listed below should prepare to evacuate: All residents of Wimbeldon Ave Residents on Nareen Parade between Narroy Road and Pittwater Road Low-lying areas of Waterloo Street All residents of Verona Street Residents on Gondola Road between Verona Street and Pittwater Road Residents on Garden Street between Jackson Road and Pittwater Road Residents on Darius Ave between Lake Park Road and Parukala Place Residents on Lake Park Road Sydney Academy of Sport and Recreation on Wakehurst Parkway You can find more information here. We\u2019ve had trains \u2013 now planes. The weather has led to a lot of waiting about in the skies apparently. More rail misery ahead for commuters tomorrow: Back to Sydney and the dam levels. According to Sydney Water, the biggest dam out there \u2013 the Warragamba \u2013 has seen a rise in its levels of nearly 1% over the past week. Not sure how up to date that figure is (within the past few hours or the past day) but it shows the effect of this torrential rain. Earlier in this blog we heard about a landslide in the Katoomba area and how one local resident, Charly Race, alerted police to the train track being suspended in mid-air. Well NSW Trainlink West has just put this tweet out showing a pretty scary situation. More good news for drought-stricken areas of Queensland. AAP reports that in the state\u2019s south-east corner six dams and weirs are officially over capacity: While the six dams and weirs are some of the region\u2019s smallest, they provide plenty of optimism for the region. Four of the dams are either located in or supply a drought-declared local government area: Leslie Harrison Dam, Litter Nerang Dam, Six Mile Creek and Wappa Dam. The overflowing Leslie Harrison Dam, which supplies Redland City south of Brisbane, was recorded at 76% capacity on Friday. The region\u2019s two largest dams, Wivenhoe and Somerset, both had increases of about 1% over the weekend. The overall dam level in south-east Queensland has increased by nearly 1% after heavy rain over the weekend. South-east Queensland\u2019s water grid total sits at 57.2% following the weekend downpour. The main drinking supply for the Gold Coast, Hinze Dam, has reached 88.7% capacity from 86.3% before the weekend. We\u2019ve seen lot\u2019s of rain today, but there\u2019s more on the way. You can keep up to date with weather warnings current in your area on the Bureau of Meteorology website: Several people have been taken to hospital in New South Wales today as a result of trees falling on cars and from becoming trapped in flood waters. AAP reports: Four people were hospitalised on Sunday afternoon after a tree fell on their car in the Sydney CBD. \u201cThis wet and windy weather is really wreaking havoc on our roads today, with paramedics responding to five car accidents every hour since Friday night,\u201d NSW Ambulance spokesman Giles Buchanan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve responded to multiple trees that had fallen onto cars, trees into houses and units, and people trapped in cars in flood waters.\u201d A 16-year-old boy has been taken to hospital with suspected broken ribs after he was trapped between debris in waist-deep water for two hours in the Hunter region. The teen was rescued by emergency services after falling into Allyn River while canoeing at about 9am on Sunday. Commiserations to Canberra and other parts of the east coast that have missed this rain. Sydney is not the only place that\u2019s flooded. This is in Brisbane. But also, Sydney is very much flooded. It is good weather for frogs, and very good weather for participating in a spot of citizen science by downloading the Frog ID app. As a bonus, you will be able to smugly identify your local frogs to your friends, if that\u2019s the kind of thing that your friends find impressive. And if it\u2019s not, frankly, get new friends. More from that heavy flooding on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches. \u2018A lot of people could have been hurt\u2019 In the Blue Mountains there has been some dramatic scenes with what appears to be part of the railway line at Katoomba suffering a landslip, leaving rails exposed and, according to one witness, hanging in the air. Charly Race was at her home that borders the track with her two-year-old daughter and mother, Chauntelle Dowd. Charly told Guardian Australia: It was quite a loud noise. My mum heard it \u2013 she came out running and screaming. We then saw all the mud coming through the backyard. A bollard that was holding up the track has come out. There is nothing holding them up. You can see them \u2013 there\u2019s nothing under them. Charly said she called the police who appear to have immediately stopped any trains from crossing the area. The police came and they realised that the train tracks are exposed. Luckily we called the cops when we did otherwise a lot of people could have been hurt. She said her roads had been cut off by the storm and now they were looking at cleaning up after the landslide. It is still flowing down. It has taken out the backyard of our neighbours. We weren\u2019t expecting this on a Sunday afternoon. Guardian Australia still hasn\u2019t received a response from Transport for NSW. While we\u2019re thinking about the impact on wildlife, we\u2019ve had a report from Marcia Church who lives with her husband on a small acreage at Tuncurry on the mid-north coast. They were surrounded on three sides by bushfires from October to December and have been on level four water restrictions since December. Marcia was collecting shower water in a bucket to water the birds. But now they\u2019re soaking \u2013 274.5mm of rain between 9am Wednesday and 9am Sunday, and about half of that fell last night. Roads that were cut by bushfires late last year have now been flooded out. And, sadly, the rain too has affected the birds. This morning Marcia found a small sea bird, later identified as a tern with its closest breeding colony on Lord Howe Island, which is 620km offshore. She took the bird to her local wildlife rescue volunteer and apparently wasn\u2019t the only one \u2013 Fawna, the network of wildlife rescuers in mid-north NSW, has received reports of confused seabirds from Port Macquarie to Newcastle \u201call exhausted from being blown so far off course from their home at Lord Howe island\u201d, Marcia says. She adds: They are swamped with calls for wildlife rescues ... firstly from bushfires, now with the torrential rains ... extremely sad, isn\u2019t it? Be careful if you\u2019re walking or driving around Sydney and the central coast today. Trees are falling all over the place. Here\u2019s a tree that crushed a car at Macquarie Place Park on the corner of Loftus and Bridge streets in the Sydney CBD. And another, in a carpark in western Sydney. And while we\u2019re in western Sydney, this storm drain in Canterbury looks like a whitewater rafting course. Do not under any circumstances use it as a whitewater rafting course or enter the water in any way \u2013 you heard the SES. We\u2019re looking into reports that a mudslide has impacted train tracks near Leura in the Blue Mountains. Here\u2019s a video from a resident showing damage to their neighbour\u2019s backyard, with the train tracks in the background. We\u2019ve sent it to Transport NSW and will let you know their response. Transport NSW travel alerts say the Blue Mountains line is not running between Katoomba and Mount Victoria due to a fallen tree in overhead wires at Blackheath. The Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, said he had one report of a landslide in Leura earlier this morning, but not affecting the train track. A \u201csubstantial land slip\u201d was reported at Cliff Drive, which will be closed for further notice because of the volume of mud and debris on the road. Parts of the Blue Mountains have received up to 200mm of rain in 24 hours. You may recall Mark because we spoke to him a lot in December, during the height of the Gospers Mountain fire. Now he\u2019s dealing with landslides and floods. Emergency services in Western Australia have issued an all clear for areas of the Pilbara affected by cyclone Damien, meaning that residents who were sheltering in their homes in Karratha, Roebourne and Dampier are now allowed to go outdoors. The area is still under a blue alert, so people are advised to show caution when moving around outdoors. Heavy rain has caused localised flooding, and there are flash-flooding warnings in place for much of the Pilbara and northern Gascoyne. The cyclone will continue to weaken as it moves inland. \u2018From drought to flood in a day\u2019 This photo is of Narribri train station, 521km northwest of Sydney. Last week it was in an area of NSW that was severely affected by drought. Today, it\u2019s a lake. The local fire and rescue unit has been called to help people stranded in rising floodwaters. They rescued 14 people and a number of animals on Saturday. It is, as you can see, a bit wet. The Narrabri SES unit says the town has gone \u201cfrom drought to flood in a day\u201d. We\u2019re seeing reports that Manly Dam is overflowing, after a year of being almost empty. Well this is just the absolute best. They don\u2019t just fight fires. And a reminder to watch your kids and pets (and yourself!) around storm drains. Suburbs around Manly and the Northern Beaches in Sydney are among the most affected. Access to Palm Beach has been cut off due to a tree fallen over the road. This was the scene at Dover Heights earlier. And Manly this morning. The Manly ferry service has been cancelled, for understandable reasons. Commuters are advised to catch a bus. And a bit further north at Dee Why. More reports of damage and flooding in Sydney. The Bureau of Meteorology has warned of flash flooding in northern Sydney over the next few hours. The BOM is also warning of minor to moderate flooding in the Hawkesbury, Nepean, Manning, Colo, and Cooks Rivers, as well as Tuggerah and Wallis Lakes. Further north, the Manning River Valley on the mid-north coast and northern tablelands has received 350mm of rain, or 14 inches in old money. Meanwhile, in northern NSW, the dams are filling. Always good when the radar goes yellow. Collaroy is one of the areas at risk of coastal erosion over the next two days, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s manager of weather services for NSW and the Australian Capital Territory, Jane Golding, told reporters at a press conference in Sydney earlier. A king tide today caused localised flooding, and there\u2019s another king tide scheduled for tomorrow. Waves offshore are 5m, cresting to 8m. That\u2019s according to buoys in the harbour, but apparently the buoy near Collaroy has broken its mooring in the rough seas. Collaroy was one of the areas worst affected by coastal erosion the last time Sydney experienced a weather system of this type, in June 2016. Golding said the damage might not be exactly the same this time, because the waves are coming from the east not the north-east. So the same beaches will be affected, but not necessarily the same parts of those beaches. Narrabeen is another area that was significantly affected in 2016, and looks to be again today. She\u2019s bucketing down in the Sydney CBD. Meanwhile, in Mosman, overflow from the council culvert is shifting the 20kg paving stones in Kathryn\u2019s backyard and made off with the cushions. This is totally fine. How is this for some good news: the town of Warwick in southern Queensland has just had two years worth of drinking water flow into its dam. More from AAP: Leslie Dam, which supplies water to Warwick and surrounding communities, nearly doubled its capacity overnight. At 4pm on Saturday SunWater recorded the dam\u2019s level at 7.66 per cent. By 10.30am on Sunday it had risen to 12.64 per cent. Mayor of the Southern Downs, Tracy Dobie, told AAP as much as two years worth of drinking water had flowed into Leslie Dam. \u201cWe have had almost as much rain in January and February as we had in all of 2019,\u201d Ms Dobie said. The community of Stanthorpe near the border with NSW also received much needed rain. The community officially ran out of drinking water in January, needing to truck water from Connolly dam 60km to the town\u2019s north. Ms Dobie told AAP Connelly dam received good rain, but the town\u2019s main supply, Storm King Dam, did not receive enough to halt water trucking. \u201cWe got one month of water into Storm King Dam, but we are looking at needing six months worth of rain to stop the trucking,\u201d she said. You may recall that Stanthorpe is one of the towns that has been relying on water donations from charities for months. Here\u2019s more on that from Guardian Australia\u2019s Brisbane correspondent, Ben Smee: Fallen trees and flooding have caused traffic delays in parts of Sydney. Hello, and welcome to what authorities say could be the wettest weekend in Sydney in 22 years. After years of drought, Sydney is expected to receive the most rain it has had in one weather event since 1998. The Bureau of Meteorology is recording rainfall rates of 15-20mm per hour in Sydney and the central coast of New South Wales, and there are reports of trees falling and roads flooding throughout the city, as well as extensive flooding on the north coast of NSW and southern Queensland. The State Emergency Service has received more than 3,000 calls for assistance since Thursday, and 40 calls to rescue people stranded in floodwaters. We will keep you updated on the situation as it unfolds. I\u2019m Calla Wahlquist, you can send me your updates and weather photos to calla.wahlquist@theguardian.com or on twitter @callapilla.",

As preparation I read many of the recent books about the vast currents of people desperate to escape conflict and the degradation of their lives. This one contains the most adventurous analysis. The title says it all: if you leave your home because otherwise you\u2019ll starve, you\u2019re a migrant; if it\u2019s because bombs are falling on your village, you\u2019re a refugee. Those who help you cross borders may be criminals profiting from your defencelessness, but it may be those same thugs who save your life.</p> <h2>3.

He has been a writer in residence at London\u2019s Royal Court theatre (1995-97) and was artistic director of the Young Vic from 2000 to 2018, when he received the Laurence Olivier special award for his role in productions such as The Jungle and The Inheritance.

It whirls to an end with the first lady of the brave and the crazed encircled by a chorus of black women intoning \u201cI\u2019m not your bitch!\u201d, herself hurling out the coda: \u201cHave we made ourselves clear?\u201d Yup. 2.

And yet, long ago, I had heard Neil\u2019s words before.</p> <p>\u201cWas any of the licence fee used to produce something purely designed to demean us?\u201d journalist and former adviser to Paddy Ashdown Miranda Green asked, as we looked, sickened, into a backstage Westminster workspace. It was 27 February 2014. We were among that week\u2019s <em>This Week</em> guests. And we witnessed the foulest of finishing touches, added to a horrible project, shrouded in terrible secrecy \u2013 the weekly reboot of Andrew Neil\u2019s hair.</p> <p>The atrocity Green and I saw enacted that night felt like a calculated insult to our species. And though Green and I have often been in the same room since, most recently at the premiere of <em>F</em><em>ast </em><em>&amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs </em><em>&amp; Shaw</em>, she never acknowledges me, afraid of reliving our experience.</p> <p>Seven years ago, Neil was just journalism\u2019s clammy Christmas uncle, then unstained by the inelegant small-hours cyber-frothing for which he is now famed. But would even Neil\u2019s cannibalistic countryman <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-21506077\" title=\"\">Sawney Bean</a> nestle into Michael Portillo\u2019s fluffed cushions had he seen the eyesore Green and I saw? For the horrid contents of Bean\u2019s sick mountain nook were as nothing compared to the gore-strewn phantasmagoria of Neil\u2019s obscene powder room.</p> <p>As Michael Portillo emptied a bin of stunned bats on to the floor, disgusted BBC beauticians presented the dazed mammals to the light, seeking the most taut scrotum. Neil, sat in shadow in a wicker bath chair and a silken robe, cried out: \u201cThat\u2019s it! Stretch them! Stretch those bloody bats\u2019 scrotums, girls, like your lives depend on it.\u201d Portillo choked the chosen bat and tightened its scrotum over a nameless and putrid woodland fungus, sculpted to be the size and shape of Neil\u2019s head. Then he slung the unwanted bat parts into the corridor, where they stank. Another guest, Pat Kane, of pop group the Kane Gang, walked by unaware, suspiciously sniffing the air. Years later, I learned online that he attributed the stench to me.</p> <p>Donning an enormous chef\u2019s hat, Portillo grated tiny shavings of fennel on to the bat scrotum, which were then tweezer-teased to attention. Then this week\u2019s <em>This Week</em> hairpiece was nailed to Neil\u2019s needy nut. Green and I knew we had seen something which, if we valued our careers, we should contrive to forget.</p> <p>But fennel-hair Neil isn\u2019t alone in criticising <em>Horrible Histories</em>. The show\u2019s supposed \u201clack of patriotism\u201d is now another useful skirmish in both the inevitable dismantling of public broadcasting and a wider culture war; a culture war deliberately coordinated to mop up the last pockets of bedraggled resistance to a far-right coup; a far-right coup that appears to be an intentional result of Brexit; a result that may in fact have been Brexit\u2019s real raisin of being all along, for those who worked hardest to deliver it. Indeed, the photograph tweeted out by P Staines (the online influencer Guido Fawkes) of last week\u2019s guest list of client-commentators, at what was genuinely called the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MediaGuido/status/1222978075341836288\" title=\"\">Brexit Battalion Media Corps</a> celebration dinner, tells you all you need to know. Google it. It was always a stitch-up.</p> <p>If you were lucky enough to be seated for parsnip soup with Tony Parsons, baked rack of venison with inaccurate Allison Pearson, hot raspberry ripple with realist Rod Liddle and finally a Stinking Bishop with Father Alexander Sherbrooke, you would surely feel like you had been present at Brexit Britain\u2019s equivalent of the storied <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/the-algonquin-round-table-about-the-algonquin/527/\" title=\"\">Algonquin Round Table</a>.</p> <p>Except that instead of dropping Dorothy Parker wit-bombs, diners were saying things like: \u201cIn that case presumably I can choose to identify as a 17-year-old Swedish au pair!\u201d or: \u201cI like my women like I like my bananas, firm and fresh, not old and past their sell-by date.\u201d Did the once-salvageable Dan Hodges wonder how the journey of his life led him to this infernal banquet of the damned, a Florence fresco of doomed sinners sharing shit-flavoured stew with impossibly long spoons, while being stuffed into the devil\u2019s anus, or twitching Tim Montgomerie, as it is also known?</p> <p>Of course, the <em>Horrible Histories</em> non-story, turning on an axis of anger about <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbciplayer/videos/1021384044884536/\" title=\"\">a silly song featuring Queen Victoria</a> from 11 years ago, and introduced by an uppity coloured feller who should know his place, was deliberately weaponised to bully the BBC into toeing the government line, an ongoing attempt to eliminate the last vestiges of scrutiny.</p> <p>Will any of the Cumming-trombones at BBC News attempt to square the current prime minister\u2019s condemnation of \u201cjuvenile anti-Americanism\u201d with the fact that, when London mayor, the same man called Donald Trump a person of \u201cquite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d?

The atrocity Green and I saw enacted that night felt like a calculated insult to our species. And though Green and I have often been in the same room since, most recently at the premiere of Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, she never acknowledges me, afraid of reliving our experience. Seven years ago, Neil was just journalism\u2019s clammy Christmas uncle, then unstained by the inelegant small-hours cyber-frothing for which he is now famed. But would even Neil\u2019s cannibalistic countryman Sawney Bean nestle into Michael Portillo\u2019s fluffed cushions had he seen the eyesore Green and I saw? For the horrid contents of Bean\u2019s sick mountain nook were as nothing compared to the gore-strewn phantasmagoria of Neil\u2019s obscene powder room. As Michael Portillo emptied a bin of stunned bats on to the floor, disgusted BBC beauticians presented the dazed mammals to the light, seeking the most taut scrotum. Neil, sat in shadow in a wicker bath chair and a silken robe, cried out: \u201cThat\u2019s it! Stretch them! Stretch those bloody bats\u2019 scrotums, girls, like your lives depend on it.\u201d Portillo choked the chosen bat and tightened its scrotum over a nameless and putrid woodland fungus, sculpted to be the size and shape of Neil\u2019s head. Then he slung the unwanted bat parts into the corridor, where they stank. Another guest, Pat Kane, of pop group the Kane Gang, walked by unaware, suspiciously sniffing the air. Years later, I learned online that he attributed the stench to me. Donning an enormous chef\u2019s hat, Portillo grated tiny shavings of fennel on to the bat scrotum, which were then tweezer-teased to attention. Then this week\u2019s This Week hairpiece was nailed to Neil\u2019s needy nut. Green and I knew we had seen something which, if we valued our careers, we should contrive to forget. But fennel-hair Neil isn\u2019t alone in criticising Horrible Histories. The show\u2019s supposed \u201clack of patriotism\u201d is now another useful skirmish in both the inevitable dismantling of public broadcasting and a wider culture war; a culture war deliberately coordinated to mop up the last pockets of bedraggled resistance to a far-right coup; a far-right coup that appears to be an intentional result of Brexit; a result that may in fact have been Brexit\u2019s real raisin of being all along, for those who worked hardest to deliver it. Indeed, the photograph tweeted out by P Staines (the online influencer Guido Fawkes) of last week\u2019s guest list of client-commentators, at what was genuinely called the Brexit Battalion Media Corps celebration dinner, tells you all you need to know. Google it. It was always a stitch-up. If you were lucky enough to be seated for parsnip soup with Tony Parsons, baked rack of venison with inaccurate Allison Pearson, hot raspberry ripple with realist Rod Liddle and finally a Stinking Bishop with Father Alexander Sherbrooke, you would surely feel like you had been present at Brexit Britain\u2019s equivalent of the storied Algonquin Round Table. Except that instead of dropping Dorothy Parker wit-bombs, diners were saying things like: \u201cIn that case presumably I can choose to identify as a 17-year-old Swedish au pair!\u201d or: \u201cI like my women like I like my bananas, firm and fresh, not old and past their sell-by date.\u201d Did the once-salvageable Dan Hodges wonder how the journey of his life led him to this infernal banquet of the damned, a Florence fresco of doomed sinners sharing shit-flavoured stew with impossibly long spoons, while being stuffed into the devil\u2019s anus, or twitching Tim Montgomerie, as it is also known? Of course, the Horrible Histories non-story, turning on an axis of anger about a silly song featuring Queen Victoria from 11 years ago, and introduced by an uppity coloured feller who should know his place, was deliberately weaponised to bully the BBC into toeing the government line, an ongoing attempt to eliminate the last vestiges of scrutiny. Will any of the Cumming-trombones at BBC News attempt to square the current prime minister\u2019s condemnation of \u201cjuvenile anti-Americanism\u201d with the fact that, when London mayor, the same man called Donald Trump a person of \u201cquite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d? Was any of the licence fee spent on not asking him about this? Thought not. As you were, lickspittle collaborators. On Monday night, however, journalists collectively, even the compliant Kuenssberg whose electoral fealty Cumming will yet forget, stood firm against Conservative attempts to exclude critical correspondents from briefings. For now. But first they came for the black satirist; then they came for the policeman from Hot Fuzz doing a silly William the Conqueror dance; then they came for the Hanoverian kings singing a funny boy band song; and then they will come for you.

      "body": "<p>Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor, has just released his first children\u2019s book. It\u2019s a bedtime story he hopes will inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs and leaders. There are other stories that keep Dalio awake at night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/08/harry-meghan-sussexes-jp-morgan-miami\">Harry and Meghan attend exclusive JP Morgan event in Miami</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stock markets have soared in recent years, employers are struggling to find workers, inflation is under control. And yet: \u201cThis period is very similar to that of the 1930s,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats when these are the best of times. I worry about the bad times.\u201d</p> <p>Dalio, the founder of investment firm Bridgewater Associates, one of the world\u2019s largest hedge funds, and a man with a personal fortune that tops $18.7bn, is one of a handful of the 0.01% who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/24/ray-dalio-jamie-dimon-kings-of-capitalism-concerned\">gone public</a> with their worries about the system that created that wealth.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has gone mad, and the system is broken,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-how-capitalism-needs-reformed-parts-1-2-ray-dalio/\">series</a> of viral posts on the issues he sees in the modern economy last year.</p> <p>The gap between rich and poor has grown too wide, and most people have not seen real income growth in decades, he wrote. The economy is stacked against those at the bottom. Education, healthcare, the tax system, the prison system and political deadlock have created a situation that presents an \u201cexistential risk\u201d to the US and the rest of the world. It was a searing indictment of the status quo, not least because it came from someone who had benefited from it the most.</p> <p>While on the surface the financial numbers of the world economy look good, it is clear that the Great Recession has left a pool of seething resentment in its wake. Nationalism is sweeping the world and the political order is being overturned. As Eric Hoffer pointed out in The True Believer, his book on mass movements, the French and Russian revolutions came not at economic and social nadirs, but as living conditions were improving.</p> <p>Dalio hopes, in part, that his latest book can help people at an individual level to address the dilemmas they now face and will always face \u2013 no matter what the political or economic headwinds. An illustrated distillation of his bestselling book <a href=\"https://www.principles.com/\">Principles for Success</a>, the book offers the life lessons Dalio says helped him not only amass one of the world\u2019s largest fortunes but live a successful life.</p> <p>In the book, an unnamed hero in a backpack and Pharrell Williams hat negotiates a series of problems, a dark wood, a mountaintop and the loss of said hat, as he chases a blue diamond. While it\u2019s not really clear what the diamond represents (maybe $18.7bn?), it\u2019s really about the journey. Over 157 pages, Dalio shares his insights, a five-point system for assessing our weaknesses and overcoming problems, and somewhat hokey aphoristic formulae like Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life and Pain + Reflection = Progress.</p> <p>The Hungry Caterpillar it ain\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abc11184de53c6c9d786c38db032f07f4afc88b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abc11184de53c6c9d786c38db032f07f4afc88b5/0_250_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Dalio in April last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ray Dalio in April last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says he wrote the book because friends said they wanted it for their kids. It\u2019s hard to see pajama-clad children clamoring for Principles (\u201cDaddy, is there a follow-up on compound interest?\u201d) but the original Principles has sold over a million copies and been downloaded 3 million times, so who knows? Kids these days!</p> <p>\u201cI think everybody would benefit from writing down their principles, not in an abstract way,\u201d says Dalio. \u201cIt serves a purpose of bringing clarity to your thinking. It\u2019s a joy. I think these principles apply to anybody, whatever their circumstances are.\u201d He is hoping some of his peers will follow suit.</p> <p>But while he is hopeful that his principles can be a practical benefit at the individual level, Dalio is worried about the future of society those individuals live in. \u201cI think the capitalism system needs to be reformed, because first of all it\u2019s not fair. And secondly, it\u2019s not optimally productive.\u201d</p> <p>The system that Dalio grew up in, he says, is very different to the one we have today. Born in 1949 the son of a jazz musician, Dalio grew up in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of New York City\u2019s Queens. He had loving parents, attended a good public school and entered \u201ca job market that offered me equal opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>He began trading at the age of 12 and opened Bridgewater in 1981. By 2005, it had become the largest hedge fund in the world, betting on \u201cmacro\u201d world-shaping economic events. He made investors a fortune correctly predicting the last recession when others bet it would be business as usual.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/wuhan-facing-wartime-conditions-as-china-tries-to-contain-coronavirus\">Wuhan facing 'wartime conditions' as global coronavirus deaths reach 724</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo have these things and use them to build a great life is what was meant by living the American Dream,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-how-capitalism-needs-reformed-parts-1-2-ray-dalio/\">he wrote last year</a>. Now, Dalio argues, capitalism has broken that promise. The relentless pursuit of profit over people has created a structural flaw that threatens to bring the whole system down. \u201cAll systems should evolve. We all need to evolve. We need to be reformed constantly,\u201d says Dalio.</p> <p>He is, of course, not alone in thinking this. Democratic presidential candidates including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would be entirely in agreement if they weren\u2019t so against him. The problem for Dalio is whether anyone can hear this message from the mouth of a billionaire. Sanders has said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax.html\">billionaires should not exist</a>. Warren is selling mugs stamped \u201c<a href=\"https://shop.elizabethwarren.com/products/billionaire-tears-mug\">Billionaire Tears</a>\u201d as she pushes plans for a huge hike in taxes on the super wealthy.</p> <p>Dalio won\u2019t talk politics in the specifics, but he says he has a strong aversion to any kind of prejudice, and worries about the vitriol being leveled at him and his Croeseus-like cohorts.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we get into an environment of demonizing people or stereotyping people. It\u2019s like if you call a leader, a billionaire, evil \u2026 it\u2019s almost like saying you\u2019re a poor person, then that\u2019s evil or you\u2019re a Jew or a black person, and that\u2019s evil.

      "bodyText": "Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor, has just released his first children\u2019s book. It\u2019s a bedtime story he hopes will inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs and leaders. There are other stories that keep Dalio awake at night. Stock markets have soared in recent years, employers are struggling to find workers, inflation is under control. And yet: \u201cThis period is very similar to that of the 1930s,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats when these are the best of times. I worry about the bad times.\u201d Dalio, the founder of investment firm Bridgewater Associates, one of the world\u2019s largest hedge funds, and a man with a personal fortune that tops $18.7bn, is one of a handful of the 0.01% who have gone public with their worries about the system that created that wealth. \u201cThe world has gone mad, and the system is broken,\u201d he wrote in a series of viral posts on the issues he sees in the modern economy last year. The gap between rich and poor has grown too wide, and most people have not seen real income growth in decades, he wrote. The economy is stacked against those at the bottom. Education, healthcare, the tax system, the prison system and political deadlock have created a situation that presents an \u201cexistential risk\u201d to the US and the rest of the world. It was a searing indictment of the status quo, not least because it came from someone who had benefited from it the most. While on the surface the financial numbers of the world economy look good, it is clear that the Great Recession has left a pool of seething resentment in its wake. Nationalism is sweeping the world and the political order is being overturned. As Eric Hoffer pointed out in The True Believer, his book on mass movements, the French and Russian revolutions came not at economic and social nadirs, but as living conditions were improving. Dalio hopes, in part, that his latest book can help people at an individual level to address the dilemmas they now face and will always face \u2013 no matter what the political or economic headwinds. An illustrated distillation of his bestselling book Principles for Success, the book offers the life lessons Dalio says helped him not only amass one of the world\u2019s largest fortunes but live a successful life. In the book, an unnamed hero in a backpack and Pharrell Williams hat negotiates a series of problems, a dark wood, a mountaintop and the loss of said hat, as he chases a blue diamond. While it\u2019s not really clear what the diamond represents (maybe $18.7bn?), it\u2019s really about the journey. Over 157 pages, Dalio shares his insights, a five-point system for assessing our weaknesses and overcoming problems, and somewhat hokey aphoristic formulae like Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life and Pain + Reflection = Progress. The Hungry Caterpillar it ain\u2019t. He says he wrote the book because friends said they wanted it for their kids. It\u2019s hard to see pajama-clad children clamoring for Principles (\u201cDaddy, is there a follow-up on compound interest?\u201d) but the original Principles has sold over a million copies and been downloaded 3 million times, so who knows? Kids these days! \u201cI think everybody would benefit from writing down their principles, not in an abstract way,\u201d says Dalio. \u201cIt serves a purpose of bringing clarity to your thinking. It\u2019s a joy. I think these principles apply to anybody, whatever their circumstances are.\u201d He is hoping some of his peers will follow suit. But while he is hopeful that his principles can be a practical benefit at the individual level, Dalio is worried about the future of society those individuals live in. \u201cI think the capitalism system needs to be reformed, because first of all it\u2019s not fair. And secondly, it\u2019s not optimally productive.\u201d The system that Dalio grew up in, he says, is very different to the one we have today. Born in 1949 the son of a jazz musician, Dalio grew up in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of New York City\u2019s Queens. He had loving parents, attended a good public school and entered \u201ca job market that offered me equal opportunity\u201d. He began trading at the age of 12 and opened Bridgewater in 1981. By 2005, it had become the largest hedge fund in the world, betting on \u201cmacro\u201d world-shaping economic events. He made investors a fortune correctly predicting the last recession when others bet it would be business as usual. \u201cTo have these things and use them to build a great life is what was meant by living the American Dream,\u201d he wrote last year. Now, Dalio argues, capitalism has broken that promise. The relentless pursuit of profit over people has created a structural flaw that threatens to bring the whole system down. \u201cAll systems should evolve. We all need to evolve. We need to be reformed constantly,\u201d says Dalio. He is, of course, not alone in thinking this. Democratic presidential candidates including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would be entirely in agreement if they weren\u2019t so against him. The problem for Dalio is whether anyone can hear this message from the mouth of a billionaire. Sanders has said billionaires should not exist. Warren is selling mugs stamped \u201cBillionaire Tears\u201d as she pushes plans for a huge hike in taxes on the super wealthy. Dalio won\u2019t talk politics in the specifics, but he says he has a strong aversion to any kind of prejudice, and worries about the vitriol being leveled at him and his Croeseus-like cohorts. \u201cWhen we get into an environment of demonizing people or stereotyping people. It\u2019s like if you call a leader, a billionaire, evil \u2026 it\u2019s almost like saying you\u2019re a poor person, then that\u2019s evil or you\u2019re a Jew or a black person, and that\u2019s evil. I think demonizing a category of people is a very bad thing,\u201d he says. If we are to find a way out of this mess, he says, it\u2019ll be \u201cwith the collective involvement of people who bring not only different perspectives, but different skills to bear\u201d on the problems. \u201cThis engineering exercise has got to be done with skill so that there\u2019s a redistribution of opportunity and a redistribution so that productivity is increased,\u201d he says. \u201cGenerally speaking, the capitalists focus on increasing the size of the pie, but not on dividing it well. Socialists focus more on dividing it well, not on how to increase its size. \u201cI think that we have to work together and this all has to be done in a bipartisan or not partisan way, because I think that right now you\u2019re producing such anger and division and that is our greatest risk,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a belief that many of his plutocratic peers share, says Dalio. The reaction to his capitalist critique from fellow billionaires has been \u201coverwhelmingly agreement, although not open agreement,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what the fear is. It\u2019s not that they will be taxed more. That\u2019s interesting, because I think most people think that that\u2019s their main fear. The main fear is that the system of making productivity work will be hurt,\u201d he says. Just like corporations, billionaires are people too. Dalio is not alone in believing he has an answer to the problem that created him. Donald Trump rode into office on a wave of populist economics. Mike Bloomberg (net worth $60bn) and Tom Steyer ($1.6bn) want to replace him. Theirs is that old, radically conservative, message: everything must change so that everything can stay the same. The question now is whether the system that produced Dalio, his principles and peers can survive the world they created. And if not, what comes after?",

      "body": "<p>Dusk at Ostend, and a black pall descends on the eerie lighthouse. The skyline is starting to fade, the shoreline dwindles to a glimmer. The town lies still, but out at sea the waves are heaving like a sleeper troubled by dangerous dreams. And this is where we are, where the picture puts us \u2013 out here in the drowning darkness.</p> <p>The Belgian artist L\u00e9on Spilliaert (1881-1946) was probably not more than 20 when he made this frightening image, using diluted black ink, paintbrushes and coloured pencil. It feels as if he was standing right there in the undertow. The pull of the tide was lifelong for Spilliaert, who patrolled this stretch of coast every day, walking out across the Ostend sands before dawn, at dusk and in the midnight hour. He knew this sea by heart.</p> <p>But I did not know his work until a couple of years ago, except for a single self-portrait in which he appears like a ghost in a sepulchral parlour, and a lone house reflecting black in a twilight dyke. I didn\u2019t know how to say his name \u2013 the emphasis is, pleasingly, on the last syllable, pronounced \u201cart\u201d. I had only the haziest sense of his life or dates. But then I came across him in the oddest way.</p> <p>I was looking for images of deserted beaches for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/23/on-chapel-sands-laura-cumming-extract-memoir-mother\" title=\"\">On Chapel Sands</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/23/on-chapel-sands-laura-cumming-extract-memoir-mother\" title=\"\">, a memoir I was writing about my mother</a>, who was snatched from another long, flat shore as a child. Most European artists of the period can\u2019t resist parasols or sails or paddling children. Of course there was Turner, from first to last. But I was trying to find an artist who saw the beach somewhat as I did, as a stage from which people might suddenly disappear. Spilliaert\u2019s beaches were not only dramatically empty, they seemed to hold the sense of a vanished presence, of uneasiness and even threat.</p> <p>His paintings appeared as timeless as the shorelines themselves \u2013 sand, sea and sky in successive bands of abstraction. And he took them even further from the marine radiance we associate with seaside pleasures into the monochrome land of night. Which was where Spilliaert himself liked to live, or so it seemed to me from that <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/482055\" title=\"\">startling self-portrait</a> I had seen in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Here was the young Spilliaert, with his trademark quiff and narrow suit, sitting with a drawing board before a mirror that shows distempered walls, black windows and another dark mirror behind him: a wraith in a box of shadows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"747a8a89d44869198630c24e3571930a498dfdb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/747a8a89d44869198630c24e3571930a498dfdb5/0_0_2479_3496/709.jpg\" alt=\"Self-portrait (with drawing board), 1907 by L\u00e9on Spilliaert.\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A wraith in a box of shadows\u2019: Self-portrait (with drawing board), 1907 by L\u00e9on Spilliaert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan Museum of Art/Art Resource/Scala, Florence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But to look at his seashores in anything but reproduction was almost impossible. Spilliaert is barely represented in museums outside Belgium, and scarcely at all in Britain. His art is mainly hidden away in private collections. To see it in reality meant travelling to Ostend, where he lived and died, and tracing his footsteps through the night.</p> <p>For L\u00e9on Spilliaert is the great night bird of modern art. Restless, insomniac, and suffering from stomach ulcers from a very young age, he would rise in the small hours and walk the dead streets to the long promenade where Ostend meets the shore. His art is captivated by the unnerving solitude and silence. Image after image shows the empty seafront, the lone gaslights along the pier, the vertiginous steps dropping down to the wide blank sands, the black sea turning over and over.</p> <p>His beaches glower in the crepuscular gloom. Coastal defences shear away at violent angles. Paths, arched colonnades and stone terraces hurtle towards the vanishing point. His palette runs from silver twilight, lead grey and sepia to obliterating black, with only the occasional touch of light in the moon, or a lamp\u2019s halo. There is nobody there (except Spilliaert).</p> <p>The artist was born into a family of shopkeepers in central Ostend. His grandfather had been the lighthouse keeper, but his father was a perfumier with a grand storefront on Kapellestraat, still the main shopping street. He also owned a hairdressing salon, which his son painted in 1909. In the low glow of a candelabrum, coats and hats dangle from pegs like dead people. Clearly, there are still customers, but the scene is so dim it feels like the middle of the night.</p> <p>At school, Spilliaert studied the philosophy of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and began to read the claustrophobic stories of Edgar Allan Poe. At the age of 18 he started a degree at the Academy of Fine Arts in nearby Bruges, but illness seems to have stymied his plans and he never finished the course. Perhaps by way of consolation, his father took Spilliaert to the World\u2019s Fair in Paris, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77KiF3nfRew\" title=\"\">in 1900</a>, and bought him the large box of coloured pastels that is now in the Mu.Zee in Ostend. He used them as subtly as Seurat, leaving the white paper blank for a pencil of light stealing across a street or the glowing disc of the moon. Grey, black, Prussian blue, ultramarine \u2013 all the dark pastels are worn down, the warm colours almost untouched.</p> <p>To reach his home town, you must take the coast train from Bruges, where the guard consults a timetable glued inside his hat to confirm the correct platform. The station turns out to be so close to the sea that boats are moored right next to the platform. You exit through a magnificent Roman arch, a surviving fragment of the neoclassical <em>grands projets</em> of Leopold II, so much of them destroyed in two world wars.</p> <p>Arrive by night, however, and Spilliaert\u2019s Ostend is immediately visible. Here are his visions of boulevards as dark canyons ending, abruptly, in depthless black water. Here is the sea wall veering sharply across the dark shore. At the far end of the night beach, more than a mile out of town, is the set of steep, plunging steps that appear in <em><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/leon-spilliaert/vertigo-1908\" title=\"\">Vertigo</a></em>, one of his most famous paintings to Belgians. A faceless figure in black clothes crouches on one perilous step, looking out to sea, her funereal veil unfurling like a howl in the air.</p> <p>Ostend, in winter, is pure L\u00e9on Spilliaert. The streets are empty, like some perpetual closing day, or as if the population had all departed. The immense beach is deserted, bar the occasional dark speck moving through the sea mists. Night falls on the tide, and you walk out to its freezing edge \u2013 solitary, wave-lapped, out of time and place. This was his gift, this exhilarating sense of estrangement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae959aad240cfc662f562761815a939134843086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae959aad240cfc662f562761815a939134843086/0_179_6905_4144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman at the Shoreline, 1910 by L\u00e9on Spilliaert,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woman at the Shoreline, 1910 by L\u00e9on Spilliaert,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cedric Verhelst/Private collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It could be Biarritz off-season, the perfect sands raked every morning, the grand hotel with its palm court and elegant glass doors opening straight on to the front. But Ostend is extraordinarily distinct. For running all along this front is the uninterrupted surprise of a neoclassical colonnade, column upon column, arch after arch, holding dark shadows within. The very structure that Spilliaert painted many times \u2013 at dusk, in darkness, or perhaps with an occasional light shining through one opening, its source unexplained \u2013 remains as startling, almost, as his pictures.</p> <p>In the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/leon-spilliaert\" title=\"\">Spilliaert show at the Royal Academy</a> \u2013 astonishingly, his first in Britain \u2013 visitors will be able to see <em>The Royal Galleries at Ostend</em>, from 1908, in which the artist positions himself at the precise point where the stone pillars seem to zoom towards the extreme vanishing point of a palace gate in the distance, in a race with the tide. The view is nearly parallax. Anne Adriaens-Pannier, a leading Spilliaert scholar and the show\u2019s curator, believes that \u201cthe reality of his living, breathing home town became like a fantasy\u201d. She quotes a letter he wrote in 1920, after returning from one of his rare trips away. \u201cI belong here so much. I am living in a real phantasmagoria\u2026 all around me dreams and mirages.\u201d</p> <p>One such mirage, as it seems, is the curious sensation that there are two colonnades running in parallel. And so there are \u2013 two endless corridors, adjacent to each other and separated only by a glass partition, which materialises as an enigmatic reflection in one of Spilliaert\u2019s paintings. You could, and still can, take either promenade according to the wind and weather. On one side is the sea, for Edwardian convalescents in need of bracing air; on the other is a racecourse \u2013 once named after Napoleon, later Wellington, after Waterloo \u2013 still boasting equestrian statues of Leopold. A paddling pond stands cracked and empty, and the ornamental iron railings are long gone, smelted for armaments by the Germans during the second world war; the seagrass grows wild and tall.</p> <p>Spilliaert never got away to sea, never took the longed-for voyage. He watches departing ships cut a swathe through the waves, a white wake beneath an equivalent tornado of black steam. The Royal Academy will be showing his marvellously strange painting of a towering hull, front on, rising like a faceless monster from the dock. What\u2019s striking, every time, is the sheer graphic zip and register of Spilliaert\u2019s shape-making; and the perspective, in both respects.</p> <p>He is always angling the space, cutting off a hat, emphasising a soaring vertical. Figures are way above or well below eye level, seascapes rise up to high horizons. He puts you in the water, as it seems, sometimes looking back at the remote lights of Ostend. Or he invents surrogates for himself and the viewer, strange proxy watchers on the promontory. Most captivating of all is the painting of a beach hut, casting its dark shadow on the sand, and looking out to sea, as if it too was a nightwalker roaming the shore.</p> <p>The contemporary Belgian painter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2012/oct/29/luc-tuymans-artist-interview-video\" title=\"\">Luc Tuymans</a> has contributed a hymn of praise to the Royal Academy show\u2019s catalogue. Tuymans has studied Spilliaert, and clearly learned deeply from him. You can see traces of his own pale and etiolated images in Spilliaert\u2019s quasi-portraits \u2013 some of them already based on the imagination, or photography, more than a century ago. The young Prince Leopold, spectral as if already dead; the rail magnate Andrew Carnegie, a ghost in sepia and black gouache, eyes like the scissored holes in a Hammer Horror portrait \u2013 both pictures surpassingly strange.</p> <p>Tuymans alludes to the silent interiors of the Danish painter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/06/art4\" title=\"\">Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i</a>, and to the cityscapes of <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/giorgio-de-chirico-902\" title=\"\">De Chirico</a>. It is not evident that Spilliaert had seen the work of either artist, and his colonnades certainly prefigure the latter. The artist to whom he is most often compared is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/14/edvard-munch-love-and-angst-british-museum-review\" title=\"\">Edvard Munch</a>; indeed, they were shown together during Spilliaert\u2019s lifetime. The connection is most often made when rare figures make an appearance in the Belgian\u2019s art.</p> <p>A top-hatted spectre slips between dark arches. Two children watch the sea creep towards them, in dread, on the shore. In <em>The Gust of Wind</em>, a girl stands against iron railings on the promenade. Wind lifts her dress, revealing a flash of white petticoat in the gloaming, and her hair flares violently sideways. Look closely, and you see that her mouth is open in horror against the dying sky. To some eyes, this work makes Spilliaert the Munch of Ostend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb9579a049b2d57ae022d9ebd7bc9bc7a36f71d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb9579a049b2d57ae022d9ebd7bc9bc7a36f71d1/0_0_5135_6599/778.jpg\" alt=\"The Gust of Wind, 1904 by L\u00e9on Spilliaert.\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gust of Wind, 1904 by L\u00e9on Spilliaert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugo Maertens/lukasweb.be; Art in Flanders</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the comparison is mainly confined to this painting. Spilliaert stands alone as an artist, and solitude is his special expertise. At the Mu.Zee, he is presented alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/30/james-ensor-royal-academy-luc-tuymans\" title=\"\">James Ensor</a> as one of the <a href=\"https://www.muzee.be/en/muzee/t207150/james-ensor-and-leon-spilliaert-two-masters-of-ostend\" title=\"\">Two </a><a href=\"https://www.muzee.be/en/muzee/t207150/james-ensor-and-leon-spilliaert-two-masters-of-ostend\" title=\"\">Masters of Ostend</a>. Ensor, the senior artist by two decades, might not have appreciated the proximity. He was apparently irritated by the younger man\u2019s attentions, complaining that he had once caught Spilliaert literally following in his footsteps round town. But they have nothing in common other than shopkeeper parents and an irreducibly Belgian strain of visionary imagination.</p> <p>Spilliaert moved to Brussels for a while, illustrating the works of Maeterlinck and Mallarm\u00e9 for a publisher. At the end of the first world war, aged 35, he married Rachel Vergison, and they had a daughter, Madeleine. She appears with him in a photograph from 1923, merrily digging the Ostend sand with a spade while he relaxes beside her (still in formal attire, of course). Marriage brought him serenity, but with paradoxical consequences. Spilliaert\u2019s work was far stronger, alas, when he was unhappy. The more content, the more decorative his art. The girl from <em>The Gust of Wind</em>, loosely adapted, even appears on one of his father\u2019s perfume bottles.</p> <p>In later life, the artist took to painting trees as if they too were lonely beings. But almost all of the works to be shown at the Royal Academy were made before 1918. A single bed, jammed between dark window and oppressive wardrobe, is covered head to toe in a white sheet: is there somebody, or nobody, or a hopeless soul beneath? Glass flasks gather hugger-mugger on a mantelpiece, dominating the parlour, and yet so diaphanous they too could be a mirage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0d1aec13ceb98b7e0e1a60028d4b582d11f89406\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d1aec13ceb98b7e0e1a60028d4b582d11f89406/151_72_6007_4700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u00e9on Spilliaert, left, with the sculptor Oscar Jespers on the balcony of the Kursaal, Ostend, August 1925.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"782\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L\u00e9on Spilliaert, left, with the sculptor Oscar Jespers on the balcony of the Kursaal, Ostend, August 1925.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maurice Antony/SOFAM Belgium/DACS, London 2020</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Period photographs in the grand Thermae Palace hotel on the front show views of Ostend in Spilliaert\u2019s day.

He haunts the dark bedroom, stands before the black mirror, electrifying eyes touched in with blue pencil.

This was Spilliaert\u2019s fate, along with so many artists through time: he was patronised mainly by the thrifty middle classes, not by public museums. His great champion, the Belgian critic and poet \u00c9mile Verhaeren, died in an accident in 1916; and James Ensor, of course, used up most of the oxygen in Ostend culture. He even outlived Spilliaert, who died of heart failure at the age of 65.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6cbb03171e9bc5be24563a85418e3d0856c06e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff6cbb03171e9bc5be24563a85418e3d0856c06e/0_204_3367_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u00e9on Spilliaert, The Shipwrecked Man, 1926\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L\u00e9on Spilliaert, The Shipwrecked Man, 1926.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luc Schrobiltgen/Private collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a vital opportunity, then, to catch sight of his dark and startling art in all its precise originality, and to understand him as more than a painter of the cold North Sea.

      "bodyText": "Dusk at Ostend, and a black pall descends on the eerie lighthouse. The skyline is starting to fade, the shoreline dwindles to a glimmer. The town lies still, but out at sea the waves are heaving like a sleeper troubled by dangerous dreams. And this is where we are, where the picture puts us \u2013 out here in the drowning darkness. The Belgian artist L\u00e9on Spilliaert (1881-1946) was probably not more than 20 when he made this frightening image, using diluted black ink, paintbrushes and coloured pencil. It feels as if he was standing right there in the undertow. The pull of the tide was lifelong for Spilliaert, who patrolled this stretch of coast every day, walking out across the Ostend sands before dawn, at dusk and in the midnight hour. He knew this sea by heart. But I did not know his work until a couple of years ago, except for a single self-portrait in which he appears like a ghost in a sepulchral parlour, and a lone house reflecting black in a twilight dyke. I didn\u2019t know how to say his name \u2013 the emphasis is, pleasingly, on the last syllable, pronounced \u201cart\u201d. I had only the haziest sense of his life or dates. But then I came across him in the oddest way. I was looking for images of deserted beaches for On Chapel Sands, a memoir I was writing about my mother, who was snatched from another long, flat shore as a child. Most European artists of the period can\u2019t resist parasols or sails or paddling children. Of course there was Turner, from first to last. But I was trying to find an artist who saw the beach somewhat as I did, as a stage from which people might suddenly disappear. Spilliaert\u2019s beaches were not only dramatically empty, they seemed to hold the sense of a vanished presence, of uneasiness and even threat. His paintings appeared as timeless as the shorelines themselves \u2013 sand, sea and sky in successive bands of abstraction. And he took them even further from the marine radiance we associate with seaside pleasures into the monochrome land of night. Which was where Spilliaert himself liked to live, or so it seemed to me from that startling self-portrait I had seen in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Here was the young Spilliaert, with his trademark quiff and narrow suit, sitting with a drawing board before a mirror that shows distempered walls, black windows and another dark mirror behind him: a wraith in a box of shadows. But to look at his seashores in anything but reproduction was almost impossible. Spilliaert is barely represented in museums outside Belgium, and scarcely at all in Britain. His art is mainly hidden away in private collections. To see it in reality meant travelling to Ostend, where he lived and died, and tracing his footsteps through the night. For L\u00e9on Spilliaert is the great night bird of modern art. Restless, insomniac, and suffering from stomach ulcers from a very young age, he would rise in the small hours and walk the dead streets to the long promenade where Ostend meets the shore. His art is captivated by the unnerving solitude and silence. Image after image shows the empty seafront, the lone gaslights along the pier, the vertiginous steps dropping down to the wide blank sands, the black sea turning over and over. His beaches glower in the crepuscular gloom. Coastal defences shear away at violent angles. Paths, arched colonnades and stone terraces hurtle towards the vanishing point. His palette runs from silver twilight, lead grey and sepia to obliterating black, with only the occasional touch of light in the moon, or a lamp\u2019s halo. There is nobody there (except Spilliaert). The artist was born into a family of shopkeepers in central Ostend. His grandfather had been the lighthouse keeper, but his father was a perfumier with a grand storefront on Kapellestraat, still the main shopping street. He also owned a hairdressing salon, which his son painted in 1909. In the low glow of a candelabrum, coats and hats dangle from pegs like dead people. Clearly, there are still customers, but the scene is so dim it feels like the middle of the night. At school, Spilliaert studied the philosophy of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and began to read the claustrophobic stories of Edgar Allan Poe. At the age of 18 he started a degree at the Academy of Fine Arts in nearby Bruges, but illness seems to have stymied his plans and he never finished the course. Perhaps by way of consolation, his father took Spilliaert to the World\u2019s Fair in Paris, in 1900, and bought him the large box of coloured pastels that is now in the Mu.Zee in Ostend. He used them as subtly as Seurat, leaving the white paper blank for a pencil of light stealing across a street or the glowing disc of the moon. Grey, black, Prussian blue, ultramarine \u2013 all the dark pastels are worn down, the warm colours almost untouched. To reach his home town, you must take the coast train from Bruges, where the guard consults a timetable glued inside his hat to confirm the correct platform. The station turns out to be so close to the sea that boats are moored right next to the platform. You exit through a magnificent Roman arch, a surviving fragment of the neoclassical grands projets of Leopold II, so much of them destroyed in two world wars. Arrive by night, however, and Spilliaert\u2019s Ostend is immediately visible. Here are his visions of boulevards as dark canyons ending, abruptly, in depthless black water. Here is the sea wall veering sharply across the dark shore. At the far end of the night beach, more than a mile out of town, is the set of steep, plunging steps that appear in Vertigo, one of his most famous paintings to Belgians. A faceless figure in black clothes crouches on one perilous step, looking out to sea, her funereal veil unfurling like a howl in the air. Ostend, in winter, is pure L\u00e9on Spilliaert. The streets are empty, like some perpetual closing day, or as if the population had all departed. The immense beach is deserted, bar the occasional dark speck moving through the sea mists. Night falls on the tide, and you walk out to its freezing edge \u2013 solitary, wave-lapped, out of time and place. This was his gift, this exhilarating sense of estrangement. It could be Biarritz off-season, the perfect sands raked every morning, the grand hotel with its palm court and elegant glass doors opening straight on to the front. But Ostend is extraordinarily distinct. For running all along this front is the uninterrupted surprise of a neoclassical colonnade, column upon column, arch after arch, holding dark shadows within. The very structure that Spilliaert painted many times \u2013 at dusk, in darkness, or perhaps with an occasional light shining through one opening, its source unexplained \u2013 remains as startling, almost, as his pictures. In the forthcoming Spilliaert show at the Royal Academy \u2013 astonishingly, his first in Britain \u2013 visitors will be able to see The Royal Galleries at Ostend, from 1908, in which the artist positions himself at the precise point where the stone pillars seem to zoom towards the extreme vanishing point of a palace gate in the distance, in a race with the tide. The view is nearly parallax. Anne Adriaens-Pannier, a leading Spilliaert scholar and the show\u2019s curator, believes that \u201cthe reality of his living, breathing home town became like a fantasy\u201d. She quotes a letter he wrote in 1920, after returning from one of his rare trips away. \u201cI belong here so much. I am living in a real phantasmagoria\u2026 all around me dreams and mirages.\u201d One such mirage, as it seems, is the curious sensation that there are two colonnades running in parallel. And so there are \u2013 two endless corridors, adjacent to each other and separated only by a glass partition, which materialises as an enigmatic reflection in one of Spilliaert\u2019s paintings. You could, and still can, take either promenade according to the wind and weather. On one side is the sea, for Edwardian convalescents in need of bracing air; on the other is a racecourse \u2013 once named after Napoleon, later Wellington, after Waterloo \u2013 still boasting equestrian statues of Leopold. A paddling pond stands cracked and empty, and the ornamental iron railings are long gone, smelted for armaments by the Germans during the second world war; the seagrass grows wild and tall. Spilliaert never got away to sea, never took the longed-for voyage. He watches departing ships cut a swathe through the waves, a white wake beneath an equivalent tornado of black steam. The Royal Academy will be showing his marvellously strange painting of a towering hull, front on, rising like a faceless monster from the dock. What\u2019s striking, every time, is the sheer graphic zip and register of Spilliaert\u2019s shape-making; and the perspective, in both respects. He is always angling the space, cutting off a hat, emphasising a soaring vertical. Figures are way above or well below eye level, seascapes rise up to high horizons. He puts you in the water, as it seems, sometimes looking back at the remote lights of Ostend. Or he invents surrogates for himself and the viewer, strange proxy watchers on the promontory. Most captivating of all is the painting of a beach hut, casting its dark shadow on the sand, and looking out to sea, as if it too was a nightwalker roaming the shore. The contemporary Belgian painter Luc Tuymans has contributed a hymn of praise to the Royal Academy show\u2019s catalogue. Tuymans has studied Spilliaert, and clearly learned deeply from him. You can see traces of his own pale and etiolated images in Spilliaert\u2019s quasi-portraits \u2013 some of them already based on the imagination, or photography, more than a century ago. The young Prince Leopold, spectral as if already dead; the rail magnate Andrew Carnegie, a ghost in sepia and black gouache, eyes like the scissored holes in a Hammer Horror portrait \u2013 both pictures surpassingly strange. Tuymans alludes to the silent interiors of the Danish painter Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, and to the cityscapes of De Chirico. It is not evident that Spilliaert had seen the work of either artist, and his colonnades certainly prefigure the latter. The artist to whom he is most often compared is Edvard Munch; indeed, they were shown together during Spilliaert\u2019s lifetime. The connection is most often made when rare figures make an appearance in the Belgian\u2019s art. A top-hatted spectre slips between dark arches. Two children watch the sea creep towards them, in dread, on the shore. In The Gust of Wind, a girl stands against iron railings on the promenade. Wind lifts her dress, revealing a flash of white petticoat in the gloaming, and her hair flares violently sideways. Look closely, and you see that her mouth is open in horror against the dying sky. To some eyes, this work makes Spilliaert the Munch of Ostend. But the comparison is mainly confined to this painting. Spilliaert stands alone as an artist, and solitude is his special expertise. At the Mu.Zee, he is presented alongside James Ensor as one of the Two Masters of Ostend. Ensor, the senior artist by two decades, might not have appreciated the proximity. He was apparently irritated by the younger man\u2019s attentions, complaining that he had once caught Spilliaert literally following in his footsteps round town. But they have nothing in common other than shopkeeper parents and an irreducibly Belgian strain of visionary imagination. Spilliaert moved to Brussels for a while, illustrating the works of Maeterlinck and Mallarm\u00e9 for a publisher. At the end of the first world war, aged 35, he married Rachel Vergison, and they had a daughter, Madeleine. She appears with him in a photograph from 1923, merrily digging the Ostend sand with a spade while he relaxes beside her (still in formal attire, of course). Marriage brought him serenity, but with paradoxical consequences. Spilliaert\u2019s work was far stronger, alas, when he was unhappy. The more content, the more decorative his art. The girl from The Gust of Wind, loosely adapted, even appears on one of his father\u2019s perfume bottles. In later life, the artist took to painting trees as if they too were lonely beings. But almost all of the works to be shown at the Royal Academy were made before 1918. A single bed, jammed between dark window and oppressive wardrobe, is covered head to toe in a white sheet: is there somebody, or nobody, or a hopeless soul beneath? Glass flasks gather hugger-mugger on a mantelpiece, dominating the parlour, and yet so diaphanous they too could be a mirage. Period photographs in the grand Thermae Palace hotel on the front show views of Ostend in Spilliaert\u2019s day. Ladies in long dresses, nannies with perambulators and whiskered gentlemen are shown sitting where we sit today, or walking exactly where we still walk, watching the ever-changing performance of the tide. Spilliaert himself appears in one shot, standing on the balcony of the old Kursaal concert hall and casino, in wing collar and three-piece suit, staring down at the bathing machines below.

L\u00e9on Spilliaert is at the Royal Academy, London, from 23 February to 25 May, transferring to the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, 15 June to 13 September.

The ceasefire has been routinely broken by both sides, but an attritional campaign by Syria has escalated since Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate, seized control of most of the area last year.</p> <p>A full-scale regime air and ground offensive, which began in December, has sparked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/syria-half-a-million-displaced-in-idlib-says-un-body\" title=\"\">one of the worst humanitarian crises in Syria</a>\u2019s nine-year-old war to date, killing more than 300 civilians in airstrikes that hit hospitals, markets and bakeries, and driving 580,000 people fleeing the violence towards the Turkish border. Turkey, already home to about four million Syrian refugees, is unwilling to open its border to more.</p> <p>Fifty-year-old Abu Omar, from the village of Hass in southern Idlib, left home with his family for another village as the fighting drew close at the end of last year.

I am disappointed: when the Turkish observation posts were established [as part of the deescalation deal], I thought, \u2018It\u2019s over, the regime can\u2019t advance anymore.\u2019 But the opposite has happened.\u201d</p> <p>Turkey has intervened militarily in Syria three times in operations against Islamic State and US-backed Kurdish-led forces it regards as a terrorist threat, but has never attacked Assad\u2019s troops and allied militias.</p> <p>Since Monday\u2019s rare clash between Turkish and Syrian government forces, Ankara has urged Moscow to convince its Syrian allies to end the Idlib offensive. A Russian delegation was set to meet yesterday [Saturday] with Turkish officials to discuss the situation.</p> <p>Ankara has sent in 350 vehicles with commandos backed by armoured vehicles to beef up its 12 observation positions since Friday, state-run Anadolu news agency said, after officials reported that three had been surrounded by regime troops.</p> <p>\u201cDespite their cooperation in several areas in Syria there are unfortunately many glaring communication issues between Ankara and Moscow,\u201d said Dareen Khalifa, a senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group.</p> <p>\u201cRussia and Assad are still pushing ahead with this offensive despite the fact Ankara has reiterated its red lines because they underestimate how vital stability in Idlib is for Turkey.

      "bodyText": "Time is running out for three million civilians on Syria\u2019s border with Turkey, caught in the crosshairs of a brutal regime offensive that has led Ankara to threaten military action against Bashar al-Assad if his forces do not pull back. Yesterday Turkey\u2019s defence ministry said it would strike back at regime troops and allied militias if its military posts in Syria\u2019s northwest Idlib province were threatened, echoing President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ultimatum last week that Assad must withdraw to a previously agreed ceasefire line before the end of February. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said the escalation in Idlib \u2013 which led to the deaths of eight Turkish military personnel on Monday \u2013 was unacceptable. \u201cWe cannot tolerate what has been unfolding in Idlib. We will seek accountability for our martyrs,\u201d he told a Turkey-Syria media forum in Istanbul yesterday. \u201cBashar al-Assad\u2019s place in the future ... is not the presidential palace but the international court of justice at The Hague.\u201d Turkey is seeking to shore up a de-escalation agreement for Idlib brokered in 2018 by Moscow \u2013 which backs Assad \u2013 and Ankara, which supports some rebel groups in the area. The ceasefire has been routinely broken by both sides, but an attritional campaign by Syria has escalated since Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate, seized control of most of the area last year. A full-scale regime air and ground offensive, which began in December, has sparked one of the worst humanitarian crises in Syria\u2019s nine-year-old war to date, killing more than 300 civilians in airstrikes that hit hospitals, markets and bakeries, and driving 580,000 people fleeing the violence towards the Turkish border. Turkey, already home to about four million Syrian refugees, is unwilling to open its border to more. Fifty-year-old Abu Omar, from the village of Hass in southern Idlib, left home with his family for another village as the fighting drew close at the end of last year. After shelling reached their temporary home two weeks ago, they fled to Deir Hassan on the Turkish border. All 11 family members have been living in a tent in freezing winter conditions, camped out with thousands of other families. \u201cWe have lost all hope at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cI think wWe are going to have to stay here a long time, but if the regime keeps advancing there is no other place left to go.\u201d \u201cTurkey has let us down. I am disappointed: when the Turkish observation posts were established [as part of the deescalation deal], I thought, \u2018It\u2019s over, the regime can\u2019t advance anymore.\u2019 But the opposite has happened.\u201d Turkey has intervened militarily in Syria three times in operations against Islamic State and US-backed Kurdish-led forces it regards as a terrorist threat, but has never attacked Assad\u2019s troops and allied militias. Since Monday\u2019s rare clash between Turkish and Syrian government forces, Ankara has urged Moscow to convince its Syrian allies to end the Idlib offensive. A Russian delegation was set to meet yesterday [Saturday] with Turkish officials to discuss the situation. Ankara has sent in 350 vehicles with commandos backed by armoured vehicles to beef up its 12 observation positions since Friday, state-run Anadolu news agency said, after officials reported that three had been surrounded by regime troops. \u201cDespite their cooperation in several areas in Syria there are unfortunately many glaring communication issues between Ankara and Moscow,\u201d said Dareen Khalifa, a senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group. \u201cRussia and Assad are still pushing ahead with this offensive despite the fact Ankara has reiterated its red lines because they underestimate how vital stability in Idlib is for Turkey. Keeping the border shut is a huge national security concern.\u201d Assad\u2019s forces have swept through dozens of towns and villages in southern Idlib over the last two weeks. Yesterday the regime it said the key town of Saraqib was back under its control. When airstrikes on the city escalated and she realised Saraqib was about to fall, making her town, Ariha, the next target, Huda Omar, 43, left for Turkish-controlled Afrin. She still fears her family will not be safe in the volatile area. \u201cThe future is unknown. I can\u2019t predict anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the hands of Russia and Turkey right now and completely out of the control of Syrians.\u201d Additional reporting by Hussein Akoush in Gaziantep, Turkey",

      "body": "<p>Like most people I know, my Weekly Screen Report is obscene. Every Sunday, when the notification pops up to tell me the hours I have wasted, mostly texting, I think about all the things I could have done. Finished <em>Middlemarch</em>. Started <em>Middlemarch</em>. But as I have my phone in my hand, I scroll through Instagram instead. I send an article or a joke to a friend, a picture of the dog to the family WhatsApp, catch up on someone else\u2019s night out. Recently, I clocked up \u2013 and I\u2019m ashamed as I write this \u2013 six hours and 29 minutes of phone usage in a single day. I have had days where I\u2019ve barely been awake that long. Messages is my most used app. I am talking all the time.</p> <p>But I am rarely <em>talking</em>. For the chatterboxes among us, this is a time of upheaval. The long, spontaneous chat on the phone is going the way of the fax. The percentage of households with a landline that\u2019s used to make calls is declining every year, from 83% in 2016 to 73% in 2019; the number of calls made on house phones plummeted by 17% in 2018 alone. We still use our mobiles to talk \u2013 in 2018, Ofcom surveyed mobile users for three months and found only 6% of them never made a single call \u2013 but we are not talking in any great depth. The same study found that over 80% of calls were shorter than five minutes, and the majority were under 90 seconds. I looked at my own recent call list: three minutes, two minutes, five minutes at a push. What can you say in that time? You can only make the point you\u2019ve called to make.</p> <p>I know many will welcome this as a kind of freedom. The very idea of talking on the phone invokes horror among those who claim to loathe it. There are thousands of memes explaining the many ways that talking, not texting, is rude, basically criminal. Calling is not time-efficient, ill-suited to the attention economy, where all eyes must be on several screens at once. You can send messages when you\u2019re doing something else \u2013 watching <em>The Irishman</em>, or having a bath, or even talking to another person in real life. My dad recently marvelled at me being able to text with two thumbs; I marvel at teenagers being able to text while talking to you and not looking at the screen. Once technology gave us the ability to easily screen calls, we ran with it. We can ignore the relative who phones with a list of recent hometown tragedies, the work call we don\u2019t feel like taking, our chattiest of friends who might not let us go for an hour. But what happens if you <em>are</em> that chatty friend?</p> <p>Smart phones are smart enough to tell you that you\u2019re using them too much. The dumb phone is making a comeback. I wondered if it was possible to ride this wave of the digital detox and make a deliberate effort to call instead of text. I wanted to see if it would change my relationships, particularly the ones I had grown lazy about maintaining. The plan was to stay off text and DMs for a solid month. I was fed up of paddling in the shallows. I wanted to swim.

We talk with one eye on efficiency, and it strangles what is so good about it \u2013 the spontaneity, the lack of ability to control what happens when two people are rambling on to each other.</p> <p>The psychologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/18/sherry-turkle-not-anti-technology-pro-conversation\" title=\"\">Sherry Turkle</a> has been studying the impact of computers on human psychology since the early 1980s, and in 2015 she published <em>Reclaiming Conversation</em>, in which she referred to \u201cthe edited life\u201d that we live now. She spoke to teachers who observed that their students seemed to develop empathetic skills at a slower rate than they would be expected to. \u201cFace-to-face conversation is the most human \u2013 and humanising \u2013 thing we do,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFully present to one another, we learn to listen. It\u2019s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It\u2019s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood.\u201d</p> <p>Are we losing that joy of being heard? Most offices are quieter places than they have ever been. The open-plan rooms I have worked in over the last decade or so are filled with people wearing headphones, silently tapping away on Gchat or Slack. Even workplaces that should invite conversation are making it easier to avoid talking at all. If you stay in a budget hotel, you can check yourself in and out. If you scan your onions on the supermarket\u2019s self- service checkout, you don\u2019t need to chat about what you\u2019re planning to do with them. When it was common enough to be considered a problem, making a phone call on public transport used to be frowned upon. In the early 00s, Dom Joly built a TV career out of shouting \u201cHello!\u201d into an oversized mobile in public places. Train carriages are now full of heads bowed, illuminated by blue light. A few years ago the <a href=\"https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Daily Mash</a> ran a much-shared satirical news story: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/society/northerner-terrorised-london-by-saying-hello-20151001102473\" title=\"\">A northern man has left a trail of terror across London by attempting to interact socially with everyone he meets</a>.\u201d And even in the north, screens have begun to dominate. Quiet carriages are becoming redundant. We are making ourselves quiet.</p> <p>In 2014, someone set up a family WhatsApp group. Before then, I spoke to my family on the phone all the time. Now, we spend more time in touch with each other than ever before, yet I miss them. It\u2019s a noticeboard, more than a conversation. The person I still speak to most often, and for longest, is my nan, who is 83. She has a mobile, but doesn\u2019t text. The other day I phoned to see how she was, and she told me a long story about how she was never supposed to have the name that she has, but there were 23 pubs in the village she was born in, and her father stopped in at most of them on the way to register her birth. By the time he got to the clerk, he\u2019d forgotten what he\u2019d been told to call her, so he named her after the clerk instead.</p> <p>Verbal conversations are unpredictable and unwieldy in a way that those written down are not, because when we type or tap, we are in control, of our side, at least. This ruthless chat efficiency has excised the flab but, I realise, I love the flab. It\u2019s where the excitement happens. I wanted to revive those conversations with everyone. So in my month of no texts, the WhatsApp group would be the first thing to go. I went to delete the app, pressed my finger on the screen, let it wobble \u2013 and then I stopped. There was a video of my niece dancing in front of the TV that I wanted to show my partner and I thought, I can just look at the photos and videos, every now and then. Can\u2019t I?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Dr Scott Wark is a research associate at Warwick University who studies culture, technology and social media; his PhD thesis was about memes. I called him to see if we are actually moving away from verbal communication. He was in Chile for work, and I couldn\u2019t get through until I emailed to check he was there. But when we finally managed it, he was more optimistic than I had anticipated.</p> <p>He does believe that people are less willing to make calls. \u201cIt feels like more of an imposition. If I want to talk to my boss, we schedule a time to make a call. She doesn\u2019t just call.\u201d He points out that social media gives us far more control over a chat. \u201cEven though there\u2019s an idea that everyone\u2019s addicted to social media and constantly checking updates, you can ignore a notification of a message. If I\u2019m chatting to a friend in Australia, and I stop responding to her, I\u2019ve probably just gone to sleep and I\u2019ll pick it up the next day. It\u2019s a continuous conversation that doesn\u2019t interrupt anything and is parallel to whatever else we\u2019re both doing.\u201d</p> <p>Wark disputes the idea that we are becoming more disconnected; he says it\u2019s important to make a distinction between disconnection and distraction. If people are becoming more mindful about their phone usage, though, does he think calling might make a comeback?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Texting trims the flab of chatting. But I love that flab</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat people are responding to, with the idea of a \u2018digital detox\u2019, is this overload of distractions. That is a huge problem, because there are all these demands on our cognitive capacity and that\u2019s overwhelming, and exhausting. We\u2019re spread thin.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s good to know we\u2019re all at it. There is a running joke in my house that if the phone rings after 7pm, without a text to warn that a call is coming, one of us has to say, \u201cWho\u2019s dead now?\u201d It\u2019s not ha-ha funny, but it speaks volumes about what the once humble phone call has come to mean. I thought it was just us, that we\u2019d developed gallows humour after a year of the kind of calls that drain the blood from the body, that in saying the worst out loud, it somehow would ward off more bad news.</p> <p>Wark said that he, too, thinks the worst if he has an unexpected missed call. When I talked to my friends about it, I realised that most people feel the same way. A phone call, out of the blue, is alarming. It\u2019s a harbinger of doom, its ringtone a tiny scythe. The first thing I say when I answer the phone is usually, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>On the first day of not texting for a month, a friend had some bad news about her health. I wanted to know how she was. But I thought calling would alarm her, because it has become alarming. So I texted, and we had a text chat, while the telly was on. Calling really would have felt like an imposition. I thought I\u2019d call my girlfriend to see what she fancied for dinner, but she was on the tube, and the missed call made her worried that something had happened, so we ended up texting about that, too. My month of not texting was barely even a day old. I failed completely.</p> <p>I am wary of nostalgia. Nobody wants to hear another old person chirping that it was better in their day. When I spoke to Dr Wark, he sounded hopeful about the changing nature of communication. \u201cI\u2019m 31, and I\u2019ve been chatting to people online since I was nine. Talking to people on text is totally naturalised,\u201d he says. \u201cYounger people are more willing to FaceTime one another now, and be watching TV, without really saying anything, just hanging out. There\u2019s a different kind of presence involved.\u201d There\u2019s an argument that all this texting facilitates people meeting up in real life anyway, he says, and research to back that up. We may be more distracted than before, but we are more connected. I ask Wark if he\u2019s a texter or a caller himself. It depends, he says, on the person, and his relationship to them. He calls his mum, he texts his partner. \u201cBut personally, I would prefer to meet my friends and just talk to them in a pub.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I could not stop texting, but in the search for a better connection, I did start to call more. I started to phone to cancel plans, and it proved a good litmus test: having to talk about it made me consider whether I genuinely wanted to cancel, or whether I was just being idle. I phoned a friend to say that, honestly, I couldn\u2019t be bothered to travel for 45 minutes to see a film I wasn\u2019t interested in and he said that, honestly, neither could he. We talked for half an hour. My girlfriend is often away for work and it\u2019s become clear that talking on the phone once every couple of days is more substantial and infinitely nicer than constant texting about humdrum stuff.</p> <p>On the Failed Day of No Texts, it became horribly apparent just how compelled I was to share every little detail of what was happening to me. I dropped a plate, and went to tell someone about it, anyone. But to realise I might have to call someone to tell them I was clumsy, which they already knew, made it seem totally redundant. I felt free, somehow, from the obligation to transmit the boring bits of my life as rolling news. By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are almost always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face, they\u2019re even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. It is much more difficult to be rude, and we could all use a bit of that.</p> <p>Talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned, scheduled, and to call is to really mean it. I still text, all the time. I feel inordinately proud of myself if my screen time drops below three hours a day. But I am calling more, too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two-sided and flexible and unpredictable. I just send a text to say I\u2019m going to call first.</p>",

It\u2019s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It\u2019s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood.\u201d Are we losing that joy of being heard? Most offices are quieter places than they have ever been. The open-plan rooms I have worked in over the last decade or so are filled with people wearing headphones, silently tapping away on Gchat or Slack. Even workplaces that should invite conversation are making it easier to avoid talking at all. If you stay in a budget hotel, you can check yourself in and out. If you scan your onions on the supermarket\u2019s self- service checkout, you don\u2019t need to chat about what you\u2019re planning to do with them. When it was common enough to be considered a problem, making a phone call on public transport used to be frowned upon. In the early 00s, Dom Joly built a TV career out of shouting \u201cHello!\u201d into an oversized mobile in public places. Train carriages are now full of heads bowed, illuminated by blue light. A few years ago the Daily Mash ran a much-shared satirical news story: \u201cA northern man has left a trail of terror across London by attempting to interact socially with everyone he meets.\u201d And even in the north, screens have begun to dominate. Quiet carriages are becoming redundant. We are making ourselves quiet. In 2014, someone set up a family WhatsApp group. Before then, I spoke to my family on the phone all the time. Now, we spend more time in touch with each other than ever before, yet I miss them. It\u2019s a noticeboard, more than a conversation. The person I still speak to most often, and for longest, is my nan, who is 83. She has a mobile, but doesn\u2019t text. The other day I phoned to see how she was, and she told me a long story about how she was never supposed to have the name that she has, but there were 23 pubs in the village she was born in, and her father stopped in at most of them on the way to register her birth. By the time he got to the clerk, he\u2019d forgotten what he\u2019d been told to call her, so he named her after the clerk instead. Verbal conversations are unpredictable and unwieldy in a way that those written down are not, because when we type or tap, we are in control, of our side, at least. This ruthless chat efficiency has excised the flab but, I realise, I love the flab. It\u2019s where the excitement happens. I wanted to revive those conversations with everyone. So in my month of no texts, the WhatsApp group would be the first thing to go. I went to delete the app, pressed my finger on the screen, let it wobble \u2013 and then I stopped. There was a video of my niece dancing in front of the TV that I wanted to show my partner and I thought, I can just look at the photos and videos, every now and then. Can\u2019t I? * * * Dr Scott Wark is a research associate at Warwick University who studies culture, technology and social media; his PhD thesis was about memes. I called him to see if we are actually moving away from verbal communication. He was in Chile for work, and I couldn\u2019t get through until I emailed to check he was there. But when we finally managed it, he was more optimistic than I had anticipated. He does believe that people are less willing to make calls. \u201cIt feels like more of an imposition. If I want to talk to my boss, we schedule a time to make a call. She doesn\u2019t just call.\u201d He points out that social media gives us far more control over a chat. \u201cEven though there\u2019s an idea that everyone\u2019s addicted to social media and constantly checking updates, you can ignore a notification of a message. If I\u2019m chatting to a friend in Australia, and I stop responding to her, I\u2019ve probably just gone to sleep and I\u2019ll pick it up the next day. It\u2019s a continuous conversation that doesn\u2019t interrupt anything and is parallel to whatever else we\u2019re both doing.\u201d Wark disputes the idea that we are becoming more disconnected; he says it\u2019s important to make a distinction between disconnection and distraction. If people are becoming more mindful about their phone usage, though, does he think calling might make a comeback? \u201cWhat people are responding to, with the idea of a \u2018digital detox\u2019, is this overload of distractions. That is a huge problem, because there are all these demands on our cognitive capacity and that\u2019s overwhelming, and exhausting. We\u2019re spread thin.\u201d It\u2019s good to know we\u2019re all at it. There is a running joke in my house that if the phone rings after 7pm, without a text to warn that a call is coming, one of us has to say, \u201cWho\u2019s dead now?\u201d It\u2019s not ha-ha funny, but it speaks volumes about what the once humble phone call has come to mean. I thought it was just us, that we\u2019d developed gallows humour after a year of the kind of calls that drain the blood from the body, that in saying the worst out loud, it somehow would ward off more bad news. Wark said that he, too, thinks the worst if he has an unexpected missed call. When I talked to my friends about it, I realised that most people feel the same way. A phone call, out of the blue, is alarming. It\u2019s a harbinger of doom, its ringtone a tiny scythe. The first thing I say when I answer the phone is usually, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d On the first day of not texting for a month, a friend had some bad news about her health. I wanted to know how she was. But I thought calling would alarm her, because it has become alarming. So I texted, and we had a text chat, while the telly was on. Calling really would have felt like an imposition. I thought I\u2019d call my girlfriend to see what she fancied for dinner, but she was on the tube, and the missed call made her worried that something had happened, so we ended up texting about that, too. My month of not texting was barely even a day old. I failed completely. I am wary of nostalgia. Nobody wants to hear another old person chirping that it was better in their day. When I spoke to Dr Wark, he sounded hopeful about the changing nature of communication. \u201cI\u2019m 31, and I\u2019ve been chatting to people online since I was nine. Talking to people on text is totally naturalised,\u201d he says. \u201cYounger people are more willing to FaceTime one another now, and be watching TV, without really saying anything, just hanging out. There\u2019s a different kind of presence involved.\u201d There\u2019s an argument that all this texting facilitates people meeting up in real life anyway, he says, and research to back that up. We may be more distracted than before, but we are more connected. I ask Wark if he\u2019s a texter or a caller himself. It depends, he says, on the person, and his relationship to them. He calls his mum, he texts his partner. \u201cBut personally, I would prefer to meet my friends and just talk to them in a pub.\u201d * * * I could not stop texting, but in the search for a better connection, I did start to call more. I started to phone to cancel plans, and it proved a good litmus test: having to talk about it made me consider whether I genuinely wanted to cancel, or whether I was just being idle. I phoned a friend to say that, honestly, I couldn\u2019t be bothered to travel for 45 minutes to see a film I wasn\u2019t interested in and he said that, honestly, neither could he. We talked for half an hour. My girlfriend is often away for work and it\u2019s become clear that talking on the phone once every couple of days is more substantial and infinitely nicer than constant texting about humdrum stuff. On the Failed Day of No Texts, it became horribly apparent just how compelled I was to share every little detail of what was happening to me. I dropped a plate, and went to tell someone about it, anyone. But to realise I might have to call someone to tell them I was clumsy, which they already knew, made it seem totally redundant. I felt free, somehow, from the obligation to transmit the boring bits of my life as rolling news. By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are almost always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face, they\u2019re even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. It is much more difficult to be rude, and we could all use a bit of that. Talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned, scheduled, and to call is to really mean it. I still text, all the time. I feel inordinately proud of myself if my screen time drops below three hours a day. But I am calling more, too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two-sided and flexible and unpredictable. I just send a text to say I\u2019m going to call first.",

      "body": "<p>Once it was exercise enough to walk the dog. Now increasing numbers of owners are being taken by their pets for a vigorous run instead. </p> <p>Although canicross \u2013 where a human is strapped with a bungee cord to a dog in a harness as it races across fields and woodland trails \u2013 has been slowly growing in popularity, there has been a huge jump in participation in the last 12 months. Demand across the UK for equipment has quadrupled, while for training classes it has nearly tripled. Record numbers are also signing up to running events that allow dogs.</p> <p>In response, a plethora of canicross training companies have sprung up, offering to teach joggers how to direct their dogs while running and ensure the pet\u2019s pace is appropriate for its age and fitness level.</p> <p>At DogFit, around 4,000 people have taken part in training classes over the past year alone, which is 2,500 more than last year. \u201cParticipation is at record levels,\u201d says co-founder Gail Walker. She estimates that over the same period sales of her canicross equipment kits have quadrupled. \u201cAt Christmas we were inundated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been the busiest year for canicross equipment that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d says Adrian Ward, owner of Innerwolf.co.uk, a website which sells canicross harnesses for dogs, waist belts for humans and leads made from bungee cords, to protect dog and owner from sudden changes in speed or direction.</p> <p>He has seen demand \u201cat least double\u201d over the past year, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s exposure, I suppose. More people are hearing about it and, because most trail running events now incorporate a canicross category, there is more availability at races now as well.\u201d</p> <p>Canix, which organises canicross racing events all over the UK, is putting on 15% more races this year and signing up 10% more runners for each one. \u201cThe sport is definitely becoming more popular. We\u2019re seeing more interest from beginners all the time,\u201d says spokeswoman Dawn Crook-Richards. \u201cI think people are more aware of the need to keep themselves and their dog fit. Compared with a lot of other sports it\u2019s cheap \u2013 and people really love it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"175f4c4228c99b4b3dc64cb0e3fe3a2b6d77d2eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/175f4c4228c99b4b3dc64cb0e3fe3a2b6d77d2eb/0_130_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gail Walker and her rescue dog Winston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gail Walker and her rescue dog Winston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhian White</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mark Tasker, a dog trainer at the Dog Academy in Hertfordshire, decided to start offering canicross taster classes last month after requests from his clients. \u201cThe first session was sold out and the next one is sold out too. Customers are looking for extra things to do with their dog,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Canicross appeals because dog owners like the idea of getting fit while strengthening their bond with their pet, he adds. \u201cPlus, if you run with your dog, you are learning a new skill, and actually, it\u2019s easier than running on your own because you\u2019re working as a team.\u201d</p> <p>At Cani-Fit, another canicross training company, founder Lindsay Johnson says her clients and their dogs particularly enjoy the social aspect of the weekly hour-long training runs. \u201cWe get a lot of people who wouldn\u2019t attend a gym or a running club. They use the dog as a crutch \u2013they tell themselves they are doing it for the dog. As for the dogs, they love running with other dogs.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a great way, she says, for nervous dogs in particular to safely socialise with other dogs. \u201cWhen they all face the same direction, there doesn\u2019t tend to be any intimidation.\u201d</p> <p>Since it is best for dogs to run long distances on surfaces which are naturally bouncy and kind to their paws, canicross runs typically take place on trails, rather than pavements. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running the types of trails we do, you\u2019re going on a real adventure,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cYou\u2019re running off-piste, through woods and streams, over fallen trees. It\u2019s like going back to your childhood days, when you\u2019re out playing in the woods, but you get to do it with your dog.\u201d</p> <p>To run along such trails together, owners must work with their dogs. \u201cYou achieve a different level of understanding each other because you\u2019re having to pick up on different senses, touch and positions. You get such a stronger bond, and such a sense of achievement with your dog,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>One of the reasons canicross has become so popular so quickly is because it has a high retention rate, Walker says. \u201cOnce people go to a class, most people will continue with it.\u201d She is particularly keen to stress the impact canicross has had on some of her runners with mental health issues. \u201cThey say it\u2019s been really good for them because they\u2019re running outside, they\u2019re meeting people and they\u2019re doing all that with their dog, their best friend. I\u2019ve been told some lovely, heartwarming stories.\u201d</p> <p>She will never forget the first time she tried canicross herself. \u201cIt was just exhilarating. You get a little pull from your dog, which you can control using commands, but it feels like you are running with dogs in a pack. They\u2019re excited, they\u2019re enjoying it, and you feed off them. It puts the fun back into serious running.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Once it was exercise enough to walk the dog. Now increasing numbers of owners are being taken by their pets for a vigorous run instead. Although canicross \u2013 where a human is strapped with a bungee cord to a dog in a harness as it races across fields and woodland trails \u2013 has been slowly growing in popularity, there has been a huge jump in participation in the last 12 months. Demand across the UK for equipment has quadrupled, while for training classes it has nearly tripled. Record numbers are also signing up to running events that allow dogs. In response, a plethora of canicross training companies have sprung up, offering to teach joggers how to direct their dogs while running and ensure the pet\u2019s pace is appropriate for its age and fitness level. At DogFit, around 4,000 people have taken part in training classes over the past year alone, which is 2,500 more than last year. \u201cParticipation is at record levels,\u201d says co-founder Gail Walker. She estimates that over the same period sales of her canicross equipment kits have quadrupled. \u201cAt Christmas we were inundated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been the busiest year for canicross equipment that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d says Adrian Ward, owner of Innerwolf.co.uk, a website which sells canicross harnesses for dogs, waist belts for humans and leads made from bungee cords, to protect dog and owner from sudden changes in speed or direction. He has seen demand \u201cat least double\u201d over the past year, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s exposure, I suppose. More people are hearing about it and, because most trail running events now incorporate a canicross category, there is more availability at races now as well.\u201d Canix, which organises canicross racing events all over the UK, is putting on 15% more races this year and signing up 10% more runners for each one. \u201cThe sport is definitely becoming more popular. We\u2019re seeing more interest from beginners all the time,\u201d says spokeswoman Dawn Crook-Richards. \u201cI think people are more aware of the need to keep themselves and their dog fit. Compared with a lot of other sports it\u2019s cheap \u2013 and people really love it.\u201d Mark Tasker, a dog trainer at the Dog Academy in Hertfordshire, decided to start offering canicross taster classes last month after requests from his clients. \u201cThe first session was sold out and the next one is sold out too. Customers are looking for extra things to do with their dog,\u201d he says. Canicross appeals because dog owners like the idea of getting fit while strengthening their bond with their pet, he adds. \u201cPlus, if you run with your dog, you are learning a new skill, and actually, it\u2019s easier than running on your own because you\u2019re working as a team.\u201d At Cani-Fit, another canicross training company, founder Lindsay Johnson says her clients and their dogs particularly enjoy the social aspect of the weekly hour-long training runs. \u201cWe get a lot of people who wouldn\u2019t attend a gym or a running club. They use the dog as a crutch \u2013they tell themselves they are doing it for the dog. As for the dogs, they love running with other dogs.\u201d It\u2019s a great way, she says, for nervous dogs in particular to safely socialise with other dogs. \u201cWhen they all face the same direction, there doesn\u2019t tend to be any intimidation.\u201d Since it is best for dogs to run long distances on surfaces which are naturally bouncy and kind to their paws, canicross runs typically take place on trails, rather than pavements. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running the types of trails we do, you\u2019re going on a real adventure,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cYou\u2019re running off-piste, through woods and streams, over fallen trees. It\u2019s like going back to your childhood days, when you\u2019re out playing in the woods, but you get to do it with your dog.\u201d To run along such trails together, owners must work with their dogs. \u201cYou achieve a different level of understanding each other because you\u2019re having to pick up on different senses, touch and positions. You get such a stronger bond, and such a sense of achievement with your dog,\u201d she adds. One of the reasons canicross has become so popular so quickly is because it has a high retention rate, Walker says. \u201cOnce people go to a class, most people will continue with it.\u201d She is particularly keen to stress the impact canicross has had on some of her runners with mental health issues. \u201cThey say it\u2019s been really good for them because they\u2019re running outside, they\u2019re meeting people and they\u2019re doing all that with their dog, their best friend. I\u2019ve been told some lovely, heartwarming stories.\u201d She will never forget the first time she tried canicross herself. \u201cIt was just exhilarating. You get a little pull from your dog, which you can control using commands, but it feels like you are running with dogs in a pack. They\u2019re excited, they\u2019re enjoying it, and you feed off them. It puts the fun back into serious running.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On the Greek island of Lesbos is the Moria refugee camp, constructed for 3,100 people but now with a population of more than 20,000 men, women and children. It has become a place of violence, deprivation, suffering and despair. I am a doctor from London and I have just spent three weeks working for the <a href=\"https://bootvluchteling.nl/en/\" title=\"\">Boat Refugee Foundation</a> (BRF). This was my third time there \u2013 and my most shocking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902BJGKEJF5XHHx/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/archive-zip/giv-3902BJGKEJF5XHHx/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>BRF is the only emergency medical provider for the entire camp between the evening hours of four and 11. These thousands of vulnerable people spill out into the surrounding olive groves in makeshift tents, which are elevated on wooden palettes to try to prevent the cold from the freezing ground seeping into their tired, aching bodies. Most of them have made a treacherous journey to come to this unsafe place; 40% of them are children. Without BRF, I know many would have died every day in the three short weeks I was there: adults \u2013 both men and women \u2013 from violent stabbings that are stabilised by medics trained briefly in \u201cstop the bleed\u201d; children from a new outbreak of meningitis whose fevers spike at night in their tents; vulnerable women in labour; four-day-old babies sleeping in freezing tents.</p> <p>I kept a diary of the cases I saw, thinking it would be cathartic after the chaos to read through one or two major incidents, for personal processing purposes. Little did I know how much the events from just one day would catch in my throat on re-reading. And the next day, and the next. I want to tell you about one day<strong> </strong>in the life of the little portable cabin clinic where I worked. I am the narrator of the stories of the people still there; this is not about me.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>People queue outside the wire-fenced cabin for hours before the clinic opens at four, hoping to be able to speak to a doctor about their child\u2019s rash, their pregnancy-related abdominal pains, their hallucinations and flashbacks from witnessed violence, their sleep disturbance, their itch from having to wear nappies at night for fear of having to go to the toilet in the pitch-black camp. There has been no reliable electricity in the camp for more than two-and-a-half months now (with 20,000 people trying to use a grid made for 3,000, it constantly trips and cannot be relied upon for any period of time), and the threat of violence and sexual violence is incredibly high. Women and minors largely choose to wear nappies to avoid having to leave their tents after the sun goes down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"248db10ec11c98f6e081831b63c16b9e557e77de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/248db10ec11c98f6e081831b63c16b9e557e77de/0_190_6425_3855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctor Annie Chapman at work in the yellow area of the clinic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctor Annie Chapman at work in the \u2018yellow\u2019 area of the clinic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonie Linotte/BRF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They come with infected wounds that need cleaning and bandaging; they have minimal access to clean water out in the olive grove areas. They come with the infamous \u201cMoria flu\u201d and a whole range of chronic problems one would normally expect in a population of this size. Any chronic problems are advised to come back to doctors working in the daytime: this clinic is for acute care only, for emergencies only. And we work at full capacity.</p> <p>Patients can only enter with their police papers, known as their <em>ausweis</em>, which contain their photograph, name and number. They are triaged at the door by one medic alongside a translator in Farsi and Arabic. \u201cGreen\u201d patients need urgent care; \u201cyellow\u201d patients are severely unwell with abnormal vital signs and require a full examination on a bed; \u201cred\u201d emergency patients usually suffer from major panic attacks, extreme pain, collapses and, increasingly, life-threatening stab wounds or the results of other violence.</p> <p>We are a team from across the world \u2013 when I was on Lesbos there was a mix of Dutch, French, English, American and Spanish doctors, nurses and support crew. We work together with our translators (refugees living in the camp themselves, volunteering daily in return for bus tickets, phone credit, education and dinner as they are not able to stand in the food queue while working with us) from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Somalia and the Congo. We make up the clinic team, and respond together as the crowds enter.</p> <p>The names of patients to be seen are written on a whiteboard in order of priority and we call them inside one by one. The clinic has two rooms, split into four consultation areas. It is basic but functional. We have boxes with the essentials for consultations \u2013 oxygen saturation probes, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers and ophthalmoscopes. The thermometers and SATs probes [oxygen measure] often stop working for the triage doctor outside the clinic as night draws in and temperatures drop, so throughout the shift we swap them with those inside. There are four beds against the walls that can be pulled out in case of emergencies to allow access around the entire patient. We carry crash bags and emergency drugs to the clinic every day in rucksacks and have them in A1 \u2013 the emergency care room \u2013 where any \u201cred\u201d patients are taken for emergencies that day. On any given day, we can see 180 to 250 patients during clinic hours. Here are their stories.</p> <p>A mother comes in with her four-year-old child who has a very high fever, and who hasn\u2019t been eating, drinking or responding to her properly for hours. To get to the cabin, she has had to walk through the camp on the side of a steep hill, weaving between <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/latest/2019/11/5ddfa7654/unhcr-chief-urges-action-conditions-asylum-seekers-greek-island.html\" title=\"\">UNHCR and makeshift tents</a>, past the falafel store, the <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-12-17/school-refugee-camp-lesbos-safe-haven-children\" title=\"\">Wave of Hope for the Future school</a> with its new library, past the barbers and people doing their washing, past the rubbish that hasn\u2019t been cleared for a month, past the gang of wild dogs barking and running after her. She has waited patiently in line in the cold. When the gate is unlocked there is a rush of people, each shouting that they are an emergency, waving their <em>ausweis</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acab5b547a259b75b9d7bc621e33e4187ea69343\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acab5b547a259b75b9d7bc621e33e4187ea69343/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Images of Moria refugee camp taken in July 2017 and January 2020 illustrate the population explosion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Images of Moria refugee camp taken in July 2017 and January 2020 illustrate the population explosion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Nicolas Economou/NurPhotos &amp; Dimitris Tosidis/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I call the febrile child in. The mother is crying and the father looks ashen-faced as he explains through the Farsi translator that they are worried as the child won\u2019t drink and looks tired. He has heard that another child from a nearby tent is now in hospital in Athens with a brain infection. He looks at the floor, apologises for attending, but asks for help.</p> <p>Just as I start examining the child, I can hear shouting and the sound of someone being dragged along the gravel outside. The support crew member on the back door shouts \u201cred patient\u201d and I move the febrile child into the back space of the cabin, pulling the bed out and making space for the emergency. He is a young man in his teens, unconscious, dragged in a dark grey blanket by four people from the surrounding tents. He was seen to be shouting and screaming and then collapsed, breathing very heavily and not waking up. The men have been running with him unconscious in the blanket for 10 minutes to reach the medical area.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>What have you seen? What are you still seeing? I can\u2019t comprehend it. And when we send them back to their tents, I feel ashamed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I start the tests on him. As I go to inflate the blood pressure cuff, he opens his eyes and screams \u2013 a long, sustained scream, followed by extreme hyperventilation and rigidity in his arms. This is a classic picture of a panic attack associated with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and a common presentation to the clinic. We are fortunate to have a psychiatric nurse in our team, and once any more sinister pathology is excluded, we move the man to a back room to rest and be reviewed by her, to plan onward referral and care.</p> <p>In terms of mental health help for refugees, there are currently two referral pathways for the more severe end of the spectrum, but each takes time and depends on exposure to violence, sexual violence, and previous history. In the acute phase we provide emergency care for these patients and their friends, relatives and tent-mates, who listen to them cry at night, and drag them to the clinic in blankets when they have attacks.</p> <p>Despite seeing multiple patients suffering with panic attacks every day, the sound of the screams still shocks and chills me as I wonder: what have you seen? What are you still seeing? I can\u2019t comprehend it. And when we send them back to their tents, I feel ashamed.</p> <p>I call the child back to my clinic space for a full assessment. By midway through my second week in the camp, we have had three confirmed cases of meningococcal meningitis and are considering a camp-wide vaccination programme. This child is persistently hot and lethargic, and has a concerning rash. We give him intramuscular ceftriaxone antibiotic and request a taxi to take him to hospital. With only two ambulances on the island despite a rapid 25% increase in the population, the service is not fit for purpose, and we are increasingly using taxis to transport patients to hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9a8c59f090c9afe1c8cfcd6c47f4cdd70046a00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9a8c59f090c9afe1c8cfcd6c47f4cdd70046a00/0_264_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A translator looks at the large queue of refugees through the door of the clinic before triage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A translator looks at the large queue of refugees through the door of the clinic before triage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tessa Kraan/BRF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I continue, with the help of my translator, to see patients in the \u201cyellow\u201d queue, mostly children with fevers, adults with abdominal pain, pregnant women, minors with scabies. We are busy today, as we are every day; there are a lot of people to see. As the sun goes down, I always feel the atmosphere at triage and inside the clinic changes. I get a sense of desperation and hostility, not usually played out, but always at the back of my mind. Because there is no electricity in the camp, the darkness outside is engulfing. Our clinic runs on the grid, regularly tripping out, and we carry out our consultations by the glow of head torches and battery-operated lights.</p> <p>An entire family is dragged in, two of the four children unconscious and the father appearing confused, shouting about \u201cfire\u201d. Apparently they went to a neighbour\u2019s tent where a fire was lit for warmth after sundown, and have been exposed to carbon monoxide for a sustained period of time. We start oxygen from our transported cylinders on the children who are not responding, wrap them in emergency blankets, and call the ambulance, while checking over the others. We have only two oxygen tanks so rotate them in response to clinical need. The ambulance will not drive up to the clinic (a short distance from the front gate of the camp) for safety reasons after dark unless in extreme emergencies, so we run the children down to the ambulance when it arrives, connecting their masks to the oxygen in the ambulance and sending them on their way. They have started responding by the time they are in the ambulance, and we know they will be OK.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Their resilience and care for their fellow refugees nearly chokes me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The hubbub created by another \u201cred\u201d patient draws close and echoes around outside the clinic. This time two young men from the sections for unaccompanied minors are dragged in between friends, gasping and covered in blood. Both have been stabbed in the chest. One stabbing like this in London would receive emergency trauma care from a highly trained team, probably in a major trauma centre. In Moria, this is not the case.</p> <p>I call all five doctors and the emergency nurse to the cabin and we split into teams, with two translators at each bedside. The majority of doctors are not used to dealing with acute stabbings: BRF has not actively recruited for emergency doctors previously, as we were offering more clinic-based urgent care. We had gone through some team pre-hospital trauma care earlier in the week and have had daily exposure to stabbings by now, so we get to work putting in lines and assessing each patient. We now have only one oxygen tank as we used the other on the children with carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b61710d0e1c4b120e2b9e78fe4e8501fc831c8c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61710d0e1c4b120e2b9e78fe4e8501fc831c8c7/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BRF doctors from the Netherlands and Belgium, Mirjam Wubs, Lisanne Schreuder Goedheijt with translator Nourullah Ishaqzi, Lucie Blond\u00e9 and Mari\u00ebtte de Reeper, work in the \u201cgreen\u201d area.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BRF doctors from the Netherlands and Belgium \u2013 Mirjam Wubs, Lisanne Schreuder Goedheijt with translator Nourullah Ishaqzi, Lucie Blond\u00e9, and Mari\u00ebtte de Reeper \u2013 work in the \u201cgreen\u201d area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tessa Kraan/BRF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We prioritise the boy with the central chest stab as he appears to be having repeated apnoeic episodes. As we wait for the ambulance to arrive, the other one starts to gargle and choke. One of his lungs is filling up with air and blood where he has been stabbed. We switch the oxygen tank to him, while stabilising the other boy\u2019s bleeding, and plan how to extricate both on stretchers from the tiny clinic room. We put in an emergency needle to decompress the damaged lung. It works for a few minutes, then fills with blood again. We decide to decompress that side of his chest with a cut to his chest wall. The tension is released, for now. The translators \u2013 non-medical but now accustomed to this type of emergency \u2013 grab oxygen masks, gauze and cannula dressings, and squeeze in fluid like members of a trained trauma team. Their resilience and care for their fellow refugees nearly chokes me.</p> <p>As the ambulance arrives, we beg them to come down to the clinic gates to minimise the time transferring the boys in the freezing cold. They agree and also agree to take both boys at the same time \u2013 a rare occurrence, but last week a young man died from a stab wound and we work together in the dark shadow of this memory. We take the boys out in emergency blankets, with fluids and lines in place, on stretchers, in front of the patients waiting to be seen in the cold, gravel-floored cage that is the waiting room. I go back to debrief the team; the translators are already cleaning the blood from the floor, beds and walls.</p> <p>We see the next patients. We keep going. People keep arriving and we continue to try to keep them safe in whatever capacity we can.</p> <p>At the end of our clinic time, the responsibility for the medical care of patients in the camp is down to a lone \u201carmy doctor\u201d, who cannot be accessed by patients unless the police deem them to have a serious enough medical problem. Unless there is a life-threatening emergency, they will wait until the day clinic opens at nine. People queue in the dark from 6:30 to try to get help.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>This is not abnormal. This is daily. The next day we had a 16-year-old boy, again from the supposedly protected sections, fall through the back doors of the clinic with a knife still in his back. On the last night I was working we saw four life-threatening stabbings, including a stabbed neck and an open chest. We assessed and stabilised them all and got them to hospital. As far as I\u2019m aware, all of these patients are still alive.</p> <p>There has been no electricity in the camp now for two and a half months. We know about the direct correlation between light and crime \u2013 people have been requesting an end to this darkness. It has not come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7aa31defd52651fa4178383c45afc0165447b9a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aa31defd52651fa4178383c45afc0165447b9a5/0_110_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy plays with a scooter in front of rubbish bags in area outside camp Moria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boy plays with a scooter in front of rubbish bags in area outside camp Moria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/dpa/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sections for unaccompanied minors and vulnerable women consist of fenced areas with sleeping cabins inside, locked in a secure area near to the police and new arrivals areas. They are understaffed. Guardians work hard to keep the most vulnerable safe, but with boredom and violence still prevalent, and staff often not speaking the same language as the refugees, monitoring and care is stretched, and problems continue to spiral. With finite space and an infinite number of increasingly vulnerable people arriving, many minors and women are living alone outside the sections, at risk of abuse, violence, and systemic failings.</p> <p>The boredom in the camp is maddening and the asylum process is opaque. Even those of us with contacts in other NGOs and with lawyers cannot work it out. During my time there, one of our most calm, loyal, and impressive translators was arrested after a second rejection and deported without papers, and without a lawyer. We have still not been able to contact him. We do not know where he is and we do not know the details of his rejection. We know he will not be safe back in Afghanistan. This kind of thing reaches through the camp, adding to the feeling of resignation and hopelessness. And the madness continues.</p> <p>The suffering is palpable, the hopelessness is insidious, the feeling of abandonment is all-consuming. I have not done a special job here. I have gone to volunteer, as many have before me and many continue to do while I return to my home, where I have central heating, regular food I can choose, and my freedom \u2013 and all of these afforded to me only by my luck at birth.</p> <p>Moria refugee camp is at breaking point; the situation is about to implode. This will happen inwardly, harming some of the most vulnerable people in the world. The implosion will probably cause a tiny ripple of outward explosion, and then be forgotten. The world continues to turn its back. We must open the conversation once more, we must consider taking responsibility for our fellow humans. I have no solution, but I want to give a voice to these silenced people, and hope there is a willing audience prepared to begin to listen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the Greek island of Lesbos is the Moria refugee camp, constructed for 3,100 people but now with a population of more than 20,000 men, women and children. It has become a place of violence, deprivation, suffering and despair. I am a doctor from London and I have just spent three weeks working for the Boat Refugee Foundation (BRF). This was my third time there \u2013 and my most shocking. BRF is the only emergency medical provider for the entire camp between the evening hours of four and 11. These thousands of vulnerable people spill out into the surrounding olive groves in makeshift tents, which are elevated on wooden palettes to try to prevent the cold from the freezing ground seeping into their tired, aching bodies. Most of them have made a treacherous journey to come to this unsafe place; 40% of them are children. Without BRF, I know many would have died every day in the three short weeks I was there: adults \u2013 both men and women \u2013 from violent stabbings that are stabilised by medics trained briefly in \u201cstop the bleed\u201d; children from a new outbreak of meningitis whose fevers spike at night in their tents; vulnerable women in labour; four-day-old babies sleeping in freezing tents. I kept a diary of the cases I saw, thinking it would be cathartic after the chaos to read through one or two major incidents, for personal processing purposes. Little did I know how much the events from just one day would catch in my throat on re-reading. And the next day, and the next. I want to tell you about one day in the life of the little portable cabin clinic where I worked. I am the narrator of the stories of the people still there; this is not about me. * * * People queue outside the wire-fenced cabin for hours before the clinic opens at four, hoping to be able to speak to a doctor about their child\u2019s rash, their pregnancy-related abdominal pains, their hallucinations and flashbacks from witnessed violence, their sleep disturbance, their itch from having to wear nappies at night for fear of having to go to the toilet in the pitch-black camp. There has been no reliable electricity in the camp for more than two-and-a-half months now (with 20,000 people trying to use a grid made for 3,000, it constantly trips and cannot be relied upon for any period of time), and the threat of violence and sexual violence is incredibly high. Women and minors largely choose to wear nappies to avoid having to leave their tents after the sun goes down. They come with infected wounds that need cleaning and bandaging; they have minimal access to clean water out in the olive grove areas. They come with the infamous \u201cMoria flu\u201d and a whole range of chronic problems one would normally expect in a population of this size. Any chronic problems are advised to come back to doctors working in the daytime: this clinic is for acute care only, for emergencies only. And we work at full capacity. Patients can only enter with their police papers, known as their ausweis, which contain their photograph, name and number. They are triaged at the door by one medic alongside a translator in Farsi and Arabic. \u201cGreen\u201d patients need urgent care; \u201cyellow\u201d patients are severely unwell with abnormal vital signs and require a full examination on a bed; \u201cred\u201d emergency patients usually suffer from major panic attacks, extreme pain, collapses and, increasingly, life-threatening stab wounds or the results of other violence. We are a team from across the world \u2013 when I was on Lesbos there was a mix of Dutch, French, English, American and Spanish doctors, nurses and support crew. We work together with our translators (refugees living in the camp themselves, volunteering daily in return for bus tickets, phone credit, education and dinner as they are not able to stand in the food queue while working with us) from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Somalia and the Congo. We make up the clinic team, and respond together as the crowds enter. The names of patients to be seen are written on a whiteboard in order of priority and we call them inside one by one. The clinic has two rooms, split into four consultation areas. It is basic but functional. We have boxes with the essentials for consultations \u2013 oxygen saturation probes, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers and ophthalmoscopes. The thermometers and SATs probes [oxygen measure] often stop working for the triage doctor outside the clinic as night draws in and temperatures drop, so throughout the shift we swap them with those inside. There are four beds against the walls that can be pulled out in case of emergencies to allow access around the entire patient. We carry crash bags and emergency drugs to the clinic every day in rucksacks and have them in A1 \u2013 the emergency care room \u2013 where any \u201cred\u201d patients are taken for emergencies that day. On any given day, we can see 180 to 250 patients during clinic hours. Here are their stories. A mother comes in with her four-year-old child who has a very high fever, and who hasn\u2019t been eating, drinking or responding to her properly for hours. To get to the cabin, she has had to walk through the camp on the side of a steep hill, weaving between UNHCR and makeshift tents, past the falafel store, the Wave of Hope for the Future school with its new library, past the barbers and people doing their washing, past the rubbish that hasn\u2019t been cleared for a month, past the gang of wild dogs barking and running after her. She has waited patiently in line in the cold. When the gate is unlocked there is a rush of people, each shouting that they are an emergency, waving their ausweis. I call the febrile child in. The mother is crying and the father looks ashen-faced as he explains through the Farsi translator that they are worried as the child won\u2019t drink and looks tired. He has heard that another child from a nearby tent is now in hospital in Athens with a brain infection. He looks at the floor, apologises for attending, but asks for help. Just as I start examining the child, I can hear shouting and the sound of someone being dragged along the gravel outside. The support crew member on the back door shouts \u201cred patient\u201d and I move the febrile child into the back space of the cabin, pulling the bed out and making space for the emergency. He is a young man in his teens, unconscious, dragged in a dark grey blanket by four people from the surrounding tents. He was seen to be shouting and screaming and then collapsed, breathing very heavily and not waking up. The men have been running with him unconscious in the blanket for 10 minutes to reach the medical area. I start the tests on him. As I go to inflate the blood pressure cuff, he opens his eyes and screams \u2013 a long, sustained scream, followed by extreme hyperventilation and rigidity in his arms. This is a classic picture of a panic attack associated with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and a common presentation to the clinic. We are fortunate to have a psychiatric nurse in our team, and once any more sinister pathology is excluded, we move the man to a back room to rest and be reviewed by her, to plan onward referral and care. In terms of mental health help for refugees, there are currently two referral pathways for the more severe end of the spectrum, but each takes time and depends on exposure to violence, sexual violence, and previous history. In the acute phase we provide emergency care for these patients and their friends, relatives and tent-mates, who listen to them cry at night, and drag them to the clinic in blankets when they have attacks. Despite seeing multiple patients suffering with panic attacks every day, the sound of the screams still shocks and chills me as I wonder: what have you seen? What are you still seeing? I can\u2019t comprehend it. And when we send them back to their tents, I feel ashamed. I call the child back to my clinic space for a full assessment. By midway through my second week in the camp, we have had three confirmed cases of meningococcal meningitis and are considering a camp-wide vaccination programme. This child is persistently hot and lethargic, and has a concerning rash. We give him intramuscular ceftriaxone antibiotic and request a taxi to take him to hospital. With only two ambulances on the island despite a rapid 25% increase in the population, the service is not fit for purpose, and we are increasingly using taxis to transport patients to hospital. I continue, with the help of my translator, to see patients in the \u201cyellow\u201d queue, mostly children with fevers, adults with abdominal pain, pregnant women, minors with scabies. We are busy today, as we are every day; there are a lot of people to see. As the sun goes down, I always feel the atmosphere at triage and inside the clinic changes. I get a sense of desperation and hostility, not usually played out, but always at the back of my mind. Because there is no electricity in the camp, the darkness outside is engulfing. Our clinic runs on the grid, regularly tripping out, and we carry out our consultations by the glow of head torches and battery-operated lights. An entire family is dragged in, two of the four children unconscious and the father appearing confused, shouting about \u201cfire\u201d. Apparently they went to a neighbour\u2019s tent where a fire was lit for warmth after sundown, and have been exposed to carbon monoxide for a sustained period of time. We start oxygen from our transported cylinders on the children who are not responding, wrap them in emergency blankets, and call the ambulance, while checking over the others. We have only two oxygen tanks so rotate them in response to clinical need. The ambulance will not drive up to the clinic (a short distance from the front gate of the camp) for safety reasons after dark unless in extreme emergencies, so we run the children down to the ambulance when it arrives, connecting their masks to the oxygen in the ambulance and sending them on their way. They have started responding by the time they are in the ambulance, and we know they will be OK. The hubbub created by another \u201cred\u201d patient draws close and echoes around outside the clinic. This time two young men from the sections for unaccompanied minors are dragged in between friends, gasping and covered in blood. Both have been stabbed in the chest. One stabbing like this in London would receive emergency trauma care from a highly trained team, probably in a major trauma centre. In Moria, this is not the case. I call all five doctors and the emergency nurse to the cabin and we split into teams, with two translators at each bedside. The majority of doctors are not used to dealing with acute stabbings: BRF has not actively recruited for emergency doctors previously, as we were offering more clinic-based urgent care. We had gone through some team pre-hospital trauma care earlier in the week and have had daily exposure to stabbings by now, so we get to work putting in lines and assessing each patient. We now have only one oxygen tank as we used the other on the children with carbon monoxide poisoning. We prioritise the boy with the central chest stab as he appears to be having repeated apnoeic episodes. As we wait for the ambulance to arrive, the other one starts to gargle and choke. One of his lungs is filling up with air and blood where he has been stabbed. We switch the oxygen tank to him, while stabilising the other boy\u2019s bleeding, and plan how to extricate both on stretchers from the tiny clinic room. We put in an emergency needle to decompress the damaged lung. It works for a few minutes, then fills with blood again. We decide to decompress that side of his chest with a cut to his chest wall. The tension is released, for now. The translators \u2013 non-medical but now accustomed to this type of emergency \u2013 grab oxygen masks, gauze and cannula dressings, and squeeze in fluid like members of a trained trauma team. Their resilience and care for their fellow refugees nearly chokes me. As the ambulance arrives, we beg them to come down to the clinic gates to minimise the time transferring the boys in the freezing cold. They agree and also agree to take both boys at the same time \u2013 a rare occurrence, but last week a young man died from a stab wound and we work together in the dark shadow of this memory. We take the boys out in emergency blankets, with fluids and lines in place, on stretchers, in front of the patients waiting to be seen in the cold, gravel-floored cage that is the waiting room. I go back to debrief the team; the translators are already cleaning the blood from the floor, beds and walls. We see the next patients. We keep going. People keep arriving and we continue to try to keep them safe in whatever capacity we can. At the end of our clinic time, the responsibility for the medical care of patients in the camp is down to a lone \u201carmy doctor\u201d, who cannot be accessed by patients unless the police deem them to have a serious enough medical problem. Unless there is a life-threatening emergency, they will wait until the day clinic opens at nine. People queue in the dark from 6:30 to try to get help. * * * This is not abnormal. This is daily. The next day we had a 16-year-old boy, again from the supposedly protected sections, fall through the back doors of the clinic with a knife still in his back. On the last night I was working we saw four life-threatening stabbings, including a stabbed neck and an open chest. We assessed and stabilised them all and got them to hospital. As far as I\u2019m aware, all of these patients are still alive. There has been no electricity in the camp now for two and a half months. We know about the direct correlation between light and crime \u2013 people have been requesting an end to this darkness. It has not come. The sections for unaccompanied minors and vulnerable women consist of fenced areas with sleeping cabins inside, locked in a secure area near to the police and new arrivals areas. They are understaffed. Guardians work hard to keep the most vulnerable safe, but with boredom and violence still prevalent, and staff often not speaking the same language as the refugees, monitoring and care is stretched, and problems continue to spiral. With finite space and an infinite number of increasingly vulnerable people arriving, many minors and women are living alone outside the sections, at risk of abuse, violence, and systemic failings. The boredom in the camp is maddening and the asylum process is opaque. Even those of us with contacts in other NGOs and with lawyers cannot work it out. During my time there, one of our most calm, loyal, and impressive translators was arrested after a second rejection and deported without papers, and without a lawyer. We have still not been able to contact him. We do not know where he is and we do not know the details of his rejection. We know he will not be safe back in Afghanistan. This kind of thing reaches through the camp, adding to the feeling of resignation and hopelessness. And the madness continues. The suffering is palpable, the hopelessness is insidious, the feeling of abandonment is all-consuming. I have not done a special job here. I have gone to volunteer, as many have before me and many continue to do while I return to my home, where I have central heating, regular food I can choose, and my freedom \u2013 and all of these afforded to me only by my luck at birth. Moria refugee camp is at breaking point; the situation is about to implode. This will happen inwardly, harming some of the most vulnerable people in the world. The implosion will probably cause a tiny ripple of outward explosion, and then be forgotten. The world continues to turn its back. We must open the conversation once more, we must consider taking responsibility for our fellow humans. I have no solution, but I want to give a voice to these silenced people, and hope there is a willing audience prepared to begin to listen.",

Nominated for an Oscar for her part in <em>Phantom Thread</em> and now doted on by Hollywood, she returns to the National Theatre to star in Tony Kushner\u2019s new version of Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt\u2019s tragicomedy <em>The Visit</em>.</p> <p><strong>Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt said the leading lady in </strong><em><strong>The Visit</strong></em><strong> was a \u201cwicked creature, and for precisely that reason must not be played wicked\u201d.</strong><strong> Do you agree? How are you approaching the role?</strong><br>Claire Zachanassian was damaged as a teenager and never got over it. She comes back to her home town, which Tony Kushner has relocated to upstate New York \u2013 a fictitious town called Slurry based on north-west New York state, around the shores of Lake Erie. She left home as a 16-year-old orphan. Now, she is back as the world\u2019s richest woman. The townsfolk think she has an open heart and will improve the town\u2019s fortunes, but she has returned for revenge. The question of her wickedness is a delicate one. It is vital to understand her. She is highly intelligent, dark and witty and during the course of the evening her soul is laid bare.</p> <p><strong>What does being in your </strong><strong>60s mean \u2013 is there new licence to be a wicked old lady yourself?</strong><br>I don\u2019t think of myself as old. I feel at the top of my form as an actor and a woman: free, liberated, energised. I want this feeling to stay \u2013 I\u2019d quite like to lock it \u2013 because I know I\u2019m not what you\u2019d call young but don\u2019t feel I\u2019m what you would call old. I don\u2019t conform to the stereotype of a 63-year-old. I still dress young \u2013 although not inappropriately. I know that, in the next decade, all sorts of things I can\u2019t quite imagine will probably kick in. I\u2019m still incredibly physically agile and energetic, but don\u2019t know if that is going to get crushed the older I get.</p> <p><strong>Is your stamina in your genes?</strong><br>There\u2019s an inherent thing in my brain that makes me work hard. I don\u2019t take any job for granted. I learn my lines. I know what I\u2019m doing. I come in good spirit, good faith and with humour. I don\u2019t ever want to slow up. I work with people much younger than me who sometimes don\u2019t turn up prepared and I find that aggravating and inexcusable. And then in the next sentence, they\u2019ll say: \u201cI hope when I\u2019m your age, I have your career,\u201d and I feel like saying: \u201cWell, buck up and get your act together a bit more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cb483a27aca06f41d1174acf8964f177c0e3b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cb483a27aca06f41d1174acf8964f177c0e3b79/0_27_5097_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lesley Manville in Phantom Thread.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesley Manville in Phantom Thread.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What was it like being discovered by Hollywood after half a century?</strong><br>Extraordinary\u2026 I\u2019m glad it happened when it did, because to be really successful in your 20s or 30s is hard to sustain. I knew who I was and what I was capable of as an actor and so it is a gorgeous cherry on the cake. Also, because I was working with Paul Thomas Anderson, I was not in a fake glitzy world of Hollywood, the work was a segue from Mike Leigh. <em>Phantom Thread</em> came left of field.

Not that I\u2019m a sad, lonely alcoholic, but I can tap into that wistfulness.

I knew something of the experience from her. What also helped is that the staff \u2013 the chemo and biopsy nurses and technicians in the film \u2013 were, with the exception of the oncologist, real. That was incredibly valuable. And the script lent itself to being treated in a realistic way.

To see it in this context is to consider the insect anew, in all its complex reticulations, \u201cadorned with a curiously polish\u2019d suit of sable Armour, neatly jointed, and beset with multitudes of\u2026 bright conical Steel-bodkins\u201d. The flea is jumping baroque.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Architecture aside, the British baroque is almost entirely the work of European artists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first gallery is so superbly orchestrated that you see Charles everywhere you look \u2013 with and without luxurious moustache, in towering heels, in a chunk of stately home ceiling brought down to earth. Here, the familiar face \u2013 black eyes, sensuous lips, the nose more limb than feature \u2013 becomes conveniently <a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/407412/charles-ii-1630-1685\" title=\"\">caricatural</a>. You\u2019ll recognise him by this shorthand for the rest of the show, which is essentially about art as propaganda.</p> <p>The elegant aristocrat calms the wild beast. The admiral turns his rugged face to the turbulent sea. The dove settles, unafraid, on the child\u2019s innocent lap. The various series of \u201cbeauties\u201d, as they were known, are shown outdoors dressed as Diana, holding a shell, a rosebud, a symbolically fruitful orange \u2013 crucial props, as it would otherwise be hard to tell the sitters apart.</p> <p>Lely and Godfrey Kneller are the main painter-flatterers here. But the look they purveyed could hardly seem less attractive now: puffy eyelids, goitrous necks and <a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/401211/jane-needham-mrs-myddleton-1646-92\" title=\"\">exopthalmic eyes</a>. Several of these women were royal mistresses, and one of them appears as a portly Madonna, holding her miraculous son \u2013 one of Charles\u2019s many illegitimate children \u2013 in an insanely perverse instance of casting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00b131ad33d8286dbda9203d40617b9de08a9bc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00b131ad33d8286dbda9203d40617b9de08a9bc5/0_0_2400_2952/813.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Palmer (n\u00e9e Villiers), Duchess of Cleveland with her son, probably Charles FitzRoy, as the Virgin and Child, c1664 by Peter Lely.\" width=\"813\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Palmer (n\u00e9e Villiers), Duchess of Cleveland with her son, probably Charles FitzRoy, as the Virgin and Child, c1664 by Peter Lely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Portrait Gallery London/Courtesy of Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Charles II was a closet Catholic, his brother-successor, James II, appears to have shocked the court with his open displays of faith. Some of the strongest paintings here are annunciations and crucifixions by Italian painters \u2013 just as you might expect. Architecture aside, the British baroque is almost entirely the work of European artists.</p> <p>A point that would have been even more apparent had the show opened with the Flemish genius Van Dyck, engaged as Charles I\u2019s court painter in 1632. But for some unexplained reason, the curators have chosen to define the British baroque as starting about 30 years later than anywhere else, with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The show ends just as arbitrarily with the death of Queen Anne, in 1714, depicted here as a stout matron with flaming red jowls.</p> <p>This leaves out all sorts of magnificent visitors, from Rubens and Van Dyck to Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi. British art history was and remains for ever international. You see this most especially in the gallery devoted to painted illusions, including spectacular Dutch flower paintings, every dewdrop twinkling, every petal delicate as a butterfly\u2019s wing; and the supposed violin hanging from a real hook on the back of a door by Jan van der Vaart. Even now, with LED lighting, there is the irresistible double take, as with <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/samuel-van-hoogstraten-a-peepshow-with-views-of-the-interior-of-a-dutch-house\" title=\"\">Samuel </a><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/samuel-van-hoogstraten-a-peepshow-with-views-of-the-interior-of-a-dutch-house\" title=\"\">van Hoogstraten</a>\u2019s famous perspective box, into which you peer as through a keyhole into the pristine rooms of a 17th-century Dutch house.</p> <p>One gallery superbly recreates the room at Petworth House, in West Sussex, where the portraits of the eponymous beauties hung, their loose hair and looser bodies multiplied in full-length silver mirrors. Another gallery \u2013 the last \u2013 pulls off a kind of counter coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre to all the extravagance that precedes it.</p> <p>By now, baroque style and royal power are simultaneously on the wane. After rooms of overfed aristocrats and their double-chinned mistresses, writers and intellectuals start to make an appearance. The painting improves. And all of a sudden, a lone sitter \u2013 the poet and diplomat <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/b/baroque/illusions-power-british-baroque\" title=\"\">Matthew Prior</a> \u2013 throws off the ridiculous spaniel wig and emerges as an actual human being. The painting, by Godfrey Kneller, rises at every level to meet singular intelligence of this living presence. It is by far the best work in the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1c52e9f9fd17df7181074a9b39721016fd31661\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1c52e9f9fd17df7181074a9b39721016fd31661/0_0_3528_4890/721.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Prior, 1700 by Godfrey Kneller.\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Prior, 1700 by Godfrey Kneller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Master and Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge/Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/radical-figures/\" title=\"\">Radical Figures: Painting in the New Millennium</a></strong> is a pretty grandiloquent title for a straightforward group show of 10 excellent to mediocre figurative painters. But supposedly, they represent the zeitgeist. \u201cPainting,\u201d according to the catalogue, \u201chad its last hurrah in the 1980s, when the stock market boom fuelled the brash brushwork and swagger of neo-expressionism.\u201d This will be news to many great painters of the past 30 years and more, but it is nonetheless a useful description of \u201cthe new direction in painting\u201d promoted here, which is nothing if not determined to make a show of itself.</p> <p>Squeezed, smeared and flicked, dripped and encrusted, blurred, jabbed and stippled, oleaginously liquid, scraped back to the dry canvas \u2013 sometimes all in one work \u2013 the gestural effects are always openly declared. These are painters of excess. They take the human body, morph, distort and cannibalise its elements, push it to the limits, politicise it, but always turn it back into paint.</p> <p>Tala Madani (b1981) depicts three babies crawling over a brown sofa from which emerges something excremental \u2013 a figure, living or dead, or a heap of waste? <em>Shit Moms</em> is the ho-ho title. <a href=\"https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/dana_schutz.htm\" title=\"\">Dana Schut</a>z (b1976) is wilfully cack-handed too. She is showing a coarse cartoon of a man eating \u2013 or is it vomiting? \u2013 his own chest, and a gross reprise of Philip Guston\u2019s tragicomic heads with their cyclopean eyes. Guston gets a rough deal everywhere.</p> <p>Cecily Brown\u2019s (b1969) recent paintings increasingly resemble the ab-ex she once pastiched. Bit of a figure, bit of De Kooning \u2013 but not quite.

      "bodyText": "Charles II, otherwise known as the \u201cMerry Monarch\u201d, was 6ft 2in in his stockings but taller still in the royal wig. He is tossing his wigged head with such melodrama, in the stone bust that opens this show, you can almost feel the heavy swing of the curls. The positioning is perfect. For this wig is an emblem of everything you are about to see in Tate Britain\u2019s lavish blockbuster \u2013 from diamond-encrusted miniatures to soaring murals and blazing candelabra: room after room of outrageous pomp and theatricality. British Baroque is Blenheim and Castle Howard and Grinling Gibbons\u2019s prolific wood-carved fruit. It is Inigo Jones and Handel and Charles seated at the apex of a preposterous seaborne pyramid of mermen and naiads, straight out of Cecil B DeMille. It is Peter Lely\u2019s florid portraits of the Windsor Beauties in yards of gold satin, and it is, in this show at least, Robert Hooke\u2019s astonishing Micrographia. Tate Britain has the full 12-inch pull-out of the flea, as observed, described and engraved by that multitudinous mind with the use of early magnifying lenses. To see it in this context is to consider the insect anew, in all its complex reticulations, \u201cadorned with a curiously polish\u2019d suit of sable Armour, neatly jointed, and beset with multitudes of\u2026 bright conical Steel-bodkins\u201d. The flea is jumping baroque. The first gallery is so superbly orchestrated that you see Charles everywhere you look \u2013 with and without luxurious moustache, in towering heels, in a chunk of stately home ceiling brought down to earth. Here, the familiar face \u2013 black eyes, sensuous lips, the nose more limb than feature \u2013 becomes conveniently caricatural. You\u2019ll recognise him by this shorthand for the rest of the show, which is essentially about art as propaganda. The elegant aristocrat calms the wild beast. The admiral turns his rugged face to the turbulent sea. The dove settles, unafraid, on the child\u2019s innocent lap. The various series of \u201cbeauties\u201d, as they were known, are shown outdoors dressed as Diana, holding a shell, a rosebud, a symbolically fruitful orange \u2013 crucial props, as it would otherwise be hard to tell the sitters apart. Lely and Godfrey Kneller are the main painter-flatterers here. But the look they purveyed could hardly seem less attractive now: puffy eyelids, goitrous necks and exopthalmic eyes. Several of these women were royal mistresses, and one of them appears as a portly Madonna, holding her miraculous son \u2013 one of Charles\u2019s many illegitimate children \u2013 in an insanely perverse instance of casting. If Charles II was a closet Catholic, his brother-successor, James II, appears to have shocked the court with his open displays of faith. Some of the strongest paintings here are annunciations and crucifixions by Italian painters \u2013 just as you might expect. Architecture aside, the British baroque is almost entirely the work of European artists. A point that would have been even more apparent had the show opened with the Flemish genius Van Dyck, engaged as Charles I\u2019s court painter in 1632. But for some unexplained reason, the curators have chosen to define the British baroque as starting about 30 years later than anywhere else, with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The show ends just as arbitrarily with the death of Queen Anne, in 1714, depicted here as a stout matron with flaming red jowls. This leaves out all sorts of magnificent visitors, from Rubens and Van Dyck to Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi. British art history was and remains for ever international. You see this most especially in the gallery devoted to painted illusions, including spectacular Dutch flower paintings, every dewdrop twinkling, every petal delicate as a butterfly\u2019s wing; and the supposed violin hanging from a real hook on the back of a door by Jan van der Vaart. Even now, with LED lighting, there is the irresistible double take, as with Samuel van Hoogstraten\u2019s famous perspective box, into which you peer as through a keyhole into the pristine rooms of a 17th-century Dutch house. One gallery superbly recreates the room at Petworth House, in West Sussex, where the portraits of the eponymous beauties hung, their loose hair and looser bodies multiplied in full-length silver mirrors. Another gallery \u2013 the last \u2013 pulls off a kind of counter coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre to all the extravagance that precedes it. By now, baroque style and royal power are simultaneously on the wane. After rooms of overfed aristocrats and their double-chinned mistresses, writers and intellectuals start to make an appearance. The painting improves. And all of a sudden, a lone sitter \u2013 the poet and diplomat Matthew Prior \u2013 throws off the ridiculous spaniel wig and emerges as an actual human being. The painting, by Godfrey Kneller, rises at every level to meet singular intelligence of this living presence. It is by far the best work in the show. Radical Figures: Painting in the New Millennium is a pretty grandiloquent title for a straightforward group show of 10 excellent to mediocre figurative painters. But supposedly, they represent the zeitgeist. \u201cPainting,\u201d according to the catalogue, \u201chad its last hurrah in the 1980s, when the stock market boom fuelled the brash brushwork and swagger of neo-expressionism.\u201d This will be news to many great painters of the past 30 years and more, but it is nonetheless a useful description of \u201cthe new direction in painting\u201d promoted here, which is nothing if not determined to make a show of itself. Squeezed, smeared and flicked, dripped and encrusted, blurred, jabbed and stippled, oleaginously liquid, scraped back to the dry canvas \u2013 sometimes all in one work \u2013 the gestural effects are always openly declared. These are painters of excess. They take the human body, morph, distort and cannibalise its elements, push it to the limits, politicise it, but always turn it back into paint. Tala Madani (b1981) depicts three babies crawling over a brown sofa from which emerges something excremental \u2013 a figure, living or dead, or a heap of waste? Shit Moms is the ho-ho title. Dana Schutz (b1976) is wilfully cack-handed too. She is showing a coarse cartoon of a man eating \u2013 or is it vomiting? \u2013 his own chest, and a gross reprise of Philip Guston\u2019s tragicomic heads with their cyclopean eyes. Guston gets a rough deal everywhere. Cecily Brown\u2019s (b1969) recent paintings increasingly resemble the ab-ex she once pastiched. Bit of a figure, bit of De Kooning \u2013 but not quite. It is imperative that these salads of brushstrokes shouldn\u2019t add up. And the same might be said of Christina Quarles (b1985), with her complicated neon riffs. Female bodies \u2013 or are they? \u2013 struggle out of gingham tablecloths, tangle in hedges of green paint, their limbs extruded as anything by Dal\u00ed. Nicole Eisenman (b1965) reprises Renoir in a heavy drinking session al fresco. Her enormous diptych, Progress: Real and Imagined, runs all the way from parody Brueghel to depressed Blake, contemporary sexual politics tartly satirised along the way. Art history is chewed and spewed. The most senior artist here, Daniel Richter (1962), is represented by some tremendous quick-change fusions \u2013 from Alpine romanticism to dancefloor seduction \u2013 but his largest painting, Tarifa, sets a dinghy of refugees high on the tumultuous black sea in which they might drown. The sea is terrifying, but the refugees are straight out of Peter Doig. There are 40 paintings here, some coining enthralling new forms (Michael Armitage in particular), but others rebarbatively eye-poking or spurious. It feels, at times, like the kind of show Charles Saatchi used to put on \u2013 and, come to think of it, actually did, back in 2013, with some of the same artists.

      "body": "<p>N<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/neil-rankin\" title=\"\">eil Rankin</a> first really took notice of vegans in 2016 when they were threatening to protest outside his restaurant. The 43-year-old chef had just opened <a href=\"https://temperrestaurant.com/about-2/\" title=\"\">Temper</a>, a barbecue joint in Soho built around a six metre-long fire pit, which was the biggest in London and perhaps in any restaurant anywhere. Whole beasts were brought in, butchered and grilled theatrically in thick slabs over the embers. As the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/11/temper-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Jay Rayner noted (admiringly)</a>: \u201cThere is a menu, but they could just replace it with a massive sign stamped with the word MEAT!, alongside one of those comedy boxing gloves on an extending arm which keeps punching you in the face until you surrender.\u201d</p> <p>Rankin was in many respects an obvious target for vegan ire. With his elaborate tatts, brawny forearms and trucker cap, he was a poster boy for the strange but powerful barbecue fixation that took hold a few years ago; before Temper, he worked variously as a chef at Pitt Cue Co, Smokehouse and Bad Egg. He\u2019d also just spent two years smoking, braising and grilling to produce a bible for carnivores titled <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/tips-and-recipes-for-barbecue-food\" title=\"\">Low and Slow: How to Cook Meat</a></em>. \u201cI\u2019ve cooked 15 goats all at once,\u201d Rankin says, flecks of Edinburgh in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve butchered many animals in my time.\u201d</p> <p>So when the vegans came after him on social media, Rankin wasn\u2019t surprised or especially bothered. Those at the \u201cextremist\u201d end, he ignored \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no grey area,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cyou\u2019re evil, you\u2019re wrong, that\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 but others, he\u2019d debate. One in particular, a university lecturer on food issues, he became friendly with and they went out for dinner. Rankin pointed out that, unlike most steakhouses, his use of entire carcasses respected animals and minimised offcuts, but on certain issues he was swayed. \u201cI was part of a group of people who made barbecue big again in the UK and I\u2019m not too sure if that was a good thing,\u201d he concedes now. \u201cIt was an interesting eye-opener to my own ethics and what I was doing.\u201d</p> <p>Rankin is telling me this in a vegan restaurant. His zero-waste vegan restaurant, in fact: <a href=\"https://www.simplicityburger.london/\" title=\"\">Simplicity Burger</a> on Brick Lane in east London, across the street from the famous bagel shops. When we meet, he\u2019s almost completed Veganuary. Rankin estimates that he probably hasn\u2019t bought meat to cook at home for two-and-a-half years. It\u2019s like Richard Dawkins confiding that maybe he was a bit hasty writing off the whole God thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a79ba78810d5713ca05681f1e5ed5b17e7464e11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a79ba78810d5713ca05681f1e5ed5b17e7464e11/0_0_4134_2759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Neil Rankin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chef Neil Rankin, who launched meat\u2011lover\u2019s paradise Temper in Soho, now also runs a zero\u2011waste vegan restaurant in east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Hambury/Evening Standard/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Either that or Rankin is very canny at predicting and leading food trends. There is disagreement over the popularity of veganism in the UK: most estimates put it at a little over 1% of the population. But there is clearly unprecedented awareness and press coverage of it. This year, 400,000 people globally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/03/veganuary-signed-up-record-400000-people-campaign-reveals\" title=\"\">signed up</a> for Veganuary, compared with 250,000 in 2019. Not long ago, the big supermarkets might have a sorry corner with some Quorn and Linda McCartney products; as of last month, when Sainsbury\u2019s joined the club, they all have own-brand plant-based ranges, as well as many stocking the likes of the Meatless Farm Co, Vivera and Oumph!. There\u2019s everything from fake turkey to vegetarian \u201cham\u201d, and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/13/pork-free-scratchings-classic-pub-snack-gets-a-vegan-makeover\" title=\"\">vegan pork scratchings</a>, made from flash-fried soya pieces, which received 174% funding on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/veganpig/the-worlds-first-vegan-pork-scratching\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> last year. The global demand for plant-based protein has grown from <a href=\"https://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Article/2017/05/10/Meat-substitute-market-to-reach-4.bn-globally\" title=\"\">\u00a32.9bn in 2015</a> to a predicted \u00a34bn this year.</p> <p>One area of undisputed growth is plant-based convenience food. The Vegan Society <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/news/media/statistics\" title=\"\">calls it</a> \u201cthe UK\u2019s fastest-growing takeaway choice\u201d, having exploded by 388% (from, admittedly, a low base) between 2016 and 2018. A tipping point was the release last year of the Greggs vegan sausage roll, which, thanks to Piers Morgan, clever use of social media and the fact that it doesn\u2019t taste awful, has brought a new audience to plant-based meat alternatives. Greggs doesn\u2019t talk about specific sales, only that the \u201chuge popularity\u201d of its vegan sausage roll \u2013 and, this year\u2019s releases, the vegan steak bake and a doughnut \u2013 have driven total sales to rise by 13.5%. Last month, the company announced it would pay its 25,000 employees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/greggs-to-pay-workers-7m-bonus-after-vegan-sausage-roll-success\" title=\"\">bonuses totall</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/greggs-to-pay-workers-7m-bonus-after-vegan-sausage-roll-success\" title=\"\">ing \u00a37m</a>, or up to \u00a3300 each.</p> <p>Plant-based food is now even raiding the spiritual castle of the meat pie: the football ground. When Chelsea played Arsenal last month, supporters at Stamford Bridge could warm themselves at half-time with a vegan doner kebab or buffalo cauli wings at the Premier League\u2019s first fully vegan kiosk.</p> <p>Much of the demand in the fast-food sector is for fake burgers, with restaurants lasciviously telling vegans and flexitarians \u2013 meat-reducers, essentially \u2013 that theirs \u201cooze\u201d and \u201cbleed\u201d just like the real thing. Anyone doubting there is serious money in this sector need only look at the US company Beyond Meat, which supplies smaller UK chains such as Honest, Neat Burger and Halo Burger but also All Bar Ones, Premier Inns and Toby Carverys. In July last year, Beyond Meat briefly had a market valuation of $11.7bn (\u00a39bn).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8073cc58377745f294a657d26cd36a876b8db7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8073cc58377745f294a657d26cd36a876b8db7e/0_51_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A board announces the launch of the vegan steak bake outside a Manchester branch of Greggs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A board announces the launch of the vegan steak bake outside a Manchester branch of Greggs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Rankin set out to make his plant-based Simplicity Burger he did not want to make a product that would appeal to vegans. That was thinking far too small. He wanted to craft a burger with such deep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/apr/09/umami-fifth-taste\" title=\"\">umami</a> notes that anyone and everyone would find it delicious. \u201cEight months at home, just doing weird stuff with mushrooms and things like that,\u201d Rankin recalls. \u201cI got the flavour really early on; it was the texture that was the hardest thing to get. There were times when I was pulling my hair out. Times I gave up. But when I finally nailed it, that was a good feeling. I was like, \u2018Thank god I didn\u2019t have to add some weird chemical.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rankin is in some senses a late arrival at the plant-based party. But the difference, he believes, is that he has approached the challenge as a chef, not as a food scientist, wellness guru or tech entrepreneur. For example, the cheese for the Simplicity Burger could have been a simple vegan cheese: it might not have tasted of much, but it would have melted and provided a familiar texture. Instead, Rankin decided to extract the liquid from vegan cheese and replace it with fermented tomato water, fried onion oil and pickle juice. The result is quite mind-bending: it\u2019s cheese that tastes not of cheese, but faintly of a cheeseburger.</p> <p>The reason that many chefs have been slow to engage with vegan food, Rankin suggests, is hubris. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not cool,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a lot of flak for it. I get laughed at. I go to these little chef things and they go, \u2018How\u2019s your vegan thing? Haha!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018How\u2019s your restaurant that does fuck all for nobody apart from your own ego?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Still, Rankin knows, from years sweating over a fire pit, how deep and primal our love of meat is and how difficult it will be to convince the doubters. \u201cThere\u2019s a cultural identity to it,\u201d says Rankin. \u201cIf you take that scene in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, where Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta come into the room and he\u2019s eating the burger and he tries it and says, \u2018This <em>is</em> a tasty burger\u2026\u2019 You can\u2019t replace that scene with a falafel and get away with it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Rankin\u2019s Simplicity Burger is indeed a tasty burger. The first mouthful delivers a dense, satisfying umami whoomph I haven\u2019t tasted before from plant-based fast food. That\u2019s not to imply that I\u2019m tricked into thinking I\u2019m eating a beef burger: it doesn\u2019t fall apart in your mouth in quite the same way. But that\u2019s not a criticism of Rankin; it\u2019s just an acknowledgment that replicating meat is an outsize, maybe even impossible, culinary and scientific challenge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f32a3d8d34dade37253501c04432fd5b676beb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f32a3d8d34dade37253501c04432fd5b676beb9/0_274_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Every, a vegan food blogger, checks out the menu at Simplicity Burger.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clare Every, a vegan food blogger, checks out the menu at Simplicity Burger.

The meat browns \u2013 the Maillard reaction \u2013 and creates more than 4,000 different molecules, which are responsible for its distinctive look, texture, smell and flavour. Humans have found the taste of cooked meat irresistible for approximately two-and-a-half million years. Eating animals is the main reason our brains developed and our stomachs shrank and we no longer had to spend all day foraging for food.</p> <p>So why then, if it\u2019s so difficult, are so many people trying to mimic meat with vegetables? The climate emergency is the most pressing reason. In the past half century, global meat production has increased by more than 400%. In the next 30 years, as the population nudges 10 billion, there are projections that demand for meat will double again. \u201cAnd cows just take too long to grow,\u201d says Simeon Van der Molen, who launched the plant-based manufacturer <a href=\"https://movingmountainsfoods.com/\" title=\"\">Moving Mountains</a> in west London in 2015. \u201cAfter three years, you get 1,000 kilograms of beef, but that\u2019s a ridiculously long time.\u201d</p> <p>Van der Molen, who is 47 years old and favours the Branson-casual entrepreneur uniform of open-necked shirt and running shoes, had no previous experience in the food industry; his other company, Ecozone, makes detergents. But he had an itch to try something different and he was hearing a lot of noise from the States about Beyond Meat and market leader <a href=\"https://impossiblefoods.com/\" title=\"\">Impossible Foods</a>, which was founded by Pat Brown, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University, and has a stated aim to make animal agriculture and deep-sea fishing redundant by 2035. Van der Molen also had personal reasons.</p> <p>\u201cI went to the doctors and I had cholesterol at 6.9 and the doctor told me to stop eating burgers,\u201d he recalls when we meet at the Moving Mountains co-working office in Chiswick. \u201cOtherwise I was going to end up on statins all my life. So I went straight to the supermarket and, as you can imagine back in 2015, it wasn\u2019t very tasty: the burgers were bean burgers, nut burgers. And for someone who has gone from eating a quarter pounder that\u2019s juicy and succulent, having a burger that looks like a squashed falafel is just too much of a step.\u201d</p> <p>In this regard, Van der Molen thinks he is typical. His research suggests that most Moving Mountains customers are either aged 15 to 25, \u201cdoing it for the environment and animal welfare\u201d, or between 45 and 65 and driven by health reasons. \u201cBecause their doctors told them like they told me,\u201d says Van der Molen. Women significantly outnumber men.</p> <p>Van der Molen started by speaking to food technologists. He paid for it from his own pocket; he also sold his collection of classic cars, including rare Bugattis and Teslas, plunging the money into the new company. The consultants suggested that oyster mushrooms, with their deep taste and fibrous texture, would make a good base for the first Moving Mountains burger. \u201cI dislike mushrooms,\u201d admits Van der Molen. \u201cI was against it.\u201d Nevertheless, they made up about 20% of the burger, and were supplemented by peas, potatoes, wheat and soy proteins, coconut oil and vitamin B12. The final touch was the addition of beetroot juice, which would give the illusion that the burger was \u201cbleeding\u201d.</p> <p>The Moving Mountains B12 burger was a hit. It was launched in February 2018 at Mildreds, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant in Dalston, east London, but there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/bleeding-vegan-b12-burger-marstons-uk-pub\" title=\"\">mainstream crossover</a> in September when all of Marston\u2019s 400-plus food pubs began offering it. In 2019, Harvester followed, then Europe\u2019s Hard Rock Cafes and the massive pub operators Stonegate and Mitchells &amp; Butlers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0a8174cb097f48c6843c77376ed92e6dcecd6c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a8174cb097f48c6843c77376ed92e6dcecd6c1/0_66_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Moving Mountains B12 Burger, the meatless burger that \u2018bleeds\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Moving Mountains B12 Burger, the meatless burger that \u2018bleeds\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Michaels</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their secret? \u201cFour words we never mention: vegan, vegetarian, meatless, meat-free,\u201d says Van der Molen. \u201cWe have to be so firm sometimes with restaurants, top companies such as Hard Rock Cafe. Call it the Moving Mountains burger. Meat-free and meatless are all about what is missing from the product: \u2018Meat free? What\u2019s in it then? I don\u2019t want it.\u2019 So we want to promote this as plant-based meat. Even though it\u2019s not technically meat, we can still call it what we want. And we want to promote what\u2019s good about it, not what\u2019s lacking.\u201d</p> <p>This, Van der Molen contends, differentiates his product from, say, the Greggs vegan sausage roll and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/02/greggs-launches-meatless-steak-bake-beef-up-vegan-range\" title=\"\">meatless steak bake</a>. \u201cA vegan sausage roll \u2013 again, you\u2019re limiting it to the amount of people who are going to buy it,\u201d says Van der Molen. \u201cI have friends that would never go to Greggs and ask for the vegan sausage roll because they never ever want to use the word \u2018vegan\u2019 when they\u2019re with their mates. And it\u2019s the same in restaurants. They don\u2019t want to say it. It\u2019s still old school. It\u2019s sissy. You don\u2019t want to be associated with vegan.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You don't have to flavour it to make it taste of meat, because the cells are derived from animals</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Van der Molen always saw Moving Mountains as restaurant only. \u201cI don\u2019t really like supermarkets, what can I say?\u201d he says, with a smirk. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with them most of my life.\u201d He mellowed, however, and in late December last year, three of Moving Mountains\u2019 plant-based products \u2013 a sausage burger, sausage and hot dog, though not the regular burger \u2013 became available in the frozen food aisle of Sainsbury\u2019s.</p> <p>Plant-based is here to stay, insists Van der Molen, and will be a global phenomenon. Moving Mountains already sells in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, but Van der Molen is eager this year to take on Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat in the US. He has especially high hopes for the Moving Mountains hot dog, which has a main ingredient of sunflower seeds. \u201cNo one\u2019s been able to replicate that,\u201d he says. \u201cSo where will the plant-based market and Moving Mountains be in two years? We probably could be meeting in New York, I think.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As you enter <a href=\"https://www.unitydiner.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Unity Diner</a> in Spitalfields, east London, there is a large neon sign that reads: \u201cThe future is vegan.\u201d On the menu, there are lots of ingredients my spellcheck is not happy about \u2013 cheeze, chikken, bakon and prawnz \u2013 as well as the Moving Mountains burger and hot dog. You can wash it down with a gin cocktail called Piers Morgan\u2019s Tears, served with a straw made from wheat stems.</p> <p>I order the burger and my companion, Illtud Llyr Dunsford, selects a Moving Mountains hot dog with added prawnz: vegan surf\u2019n\u2019turf. If Rankin would be near the bottom of the list of people that you would expect to go into the market for meat alternatives, then Dunsford, a jolly, curious 39-year-old with a warm smile, isn\u2019t far behind. His family has been farming in the Gwendraeth Valley, west Wales, for more than 300 years. Dunsford, meanwhile, was so inspired by the nose-to-tail philosophy of St John chef Fergus Henderson that in 2011 he set up a <a href=\"https://www.visitwales.com/things-do/food-drink/food-producers/charcutier-ltd\" title=\"\">company called Charcutier</a> with the aim of making world-class air-dried ham from Welsh pedigree pigs. Dunsford knows his hot dogs, too: he used to supply them for Harrods. \u201cOne of my nicknames back then was the Sausage Dude,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good nickname or not.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6e89a641d866ed623a3c3b6372d8a4a2c5e363f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6e89a641d866ed623a3c3b6372d8a4a2c5e363f/0_1_958_958/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Unity Diner\u2019s vegan Philly Cheezesteak sandwich.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Unity Diner\u2019s vegan Philly Cheezesteak sandwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Unity Diner/Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what does Dunsford make of the Moving Mountains hot dog? \u201cThat\u2019s surprisingly good,\u201d he says, fighting an admirable battle to keep ketchup out of his thick, reddish-brown beard. \u201cIt tastes like a commodity product, a cheap product, the texture is a little bit too hard, but for me if this was a street-corner product it replaces it quite easily.\u201d</p> <p>Praise then, but qualified. Dunsford can see scenarios in which plant-based simulacra can fill a gap \u2013 and for the planet that has to be so \u2013 but the notion that they can replace the real thing entirely is a stretch too far. \u201cFor me as a meat eater, there\u2019s an organoleptic quality when you consume meat,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd none of these plant-based products offers exactly the same response. You don\u2019t quite have that little glob of hot fat going down your chin you get with real meat.\u201d</p> <p>For this reason, Dunsford believes the future of meat has to be growing it in labs from animal cells. His long, at times confounding journey to this conclusion began in 2015, when he attended a symposium on cultured meat at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and continued when he was chosen as a prestigious Nuffield farming scholar and spent 15 months travelling the world to explore the future of meat production, which included seeing the impact of animal agriculture on deforestation in the Amazon. But it all fell into place in late 2017, in the San Francisco headquarters of a US company Just, Inc (a building where Dunsford, a film buff, notes that <em>Toy Story</em> was screened for the first time).</p> <p>\u201cThey cooked me up a little duck liver chorizo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was in a little taco, it was tiny. And I ate it and it just had the umami kick of what I expect from meat. It was like this final piece of the jigsaw for me: this actually tastes exactly the same as meat. I thought, \u2018Well, if you could produce that product cheaper, why on earth would a consumer buy something else instead?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Charcutier was wound down and Dunsford now runs <a href=\"https://www.cellularagriculture.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cellular Agriculture</a>, the first UK startup in the cell-based meat space, with Dr Marianne Ellis, whose day job is head of chemical engineering at the University of Bath. \u201cOur machine at the moment produces milligrams worth of cells, so very, very small,\u201d says Dunsford. \u201cBut by the end of the next two years, we\u2019re looking at about 10 kilos for a cycle, which is about three weeks. And the aspiration really, in around five years, is to build factories that produce tonnages of cells.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbddf82c8d41f6fb81074fafa7b9f4ad5d92283f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbddf82c8d41f6fb81074fafa7b9f4ad5d92283f/13_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists at work in the labs Illtud Llyr Dunsford\u2019s company Cellular Agriculture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists at work in the labs Illtud Llyr Dunsford\u2019s company Cellular Agriculture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: cellularagriculture.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dunsford is well aware that cell-based meat has a yuck factor to overcome, but he\u2019s confident that over time it will. And if it does, the potential market is huge: while he believes plant-based food will mainly appeal to flexitarians, vegetarians and vegans, who make up about 20% of the British population, cultured meat would be an option for everyone else, whether they plan to reduce their meat intake or not. \u201cThe difference with cell-based is that chemically it <em>is</em> meat,\u201d says Dunsford. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that you have to do to it to flavour it to make it taste of meat, because the cells are derived from animals.\u201d</p> <p>As an individual, Dunsford accepts that he should be the perfect target for meat alternatives: he buys local; he cares about sustainability; when he takes a flight, he offsets his carbon. \u201cSo I\u2019m that kind of consumer and I\u2019ve tried to do plant-based but I can\u2019t,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just my body and my mind are not strong enough. Even though I know there are a certain number of things that we need to do to help the planet, I\u2019m weak. Most people are.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Cell-based meat is, as you would expect, divisive. For Rankin, it\u2019s a future that he doesn\u2019t care much to imagine. \u201cOne, growing meat in labs, that\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd two, we have sustainably produced meat in this country. It\u2019s just the fact we are eating too much of it. The whole problem with meat is that we just need to replace 90% of what we eat with other things, then we can sustainably farm animals and the animals can sustainably add manure to the soil. That whole thing that we used to do 100 years ago, really effectively, can work again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/19/cultured-meat-on-its-way-to-a-table-near-you-cultivated-cells-farming-society-ethics\">Out of the lab and into your frying pan: the advance of cultured meat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So Rankin doesn\u2019t think lab-grown meat will find a market then? \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it will take off, but I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s going to be terrible for us,\u201d he warns. \u201cYou look at history and as soon as we started to get labs or companies to do our diets for us or to feed us food it turned out incredibly badly every single time.\u201d</p> <p>Van der Molen looked into cell-based meat before starting Moving Mountains. For him, the issue was not ethics, but timescale. \u201cI met with the University of Bath and, as soon as I understood what was involved, I stopped that,\u201d he says. Why? \u201cIt\u2019s another 10 years away from now, I would guess, from being produced. Anyone who tells you it\u2019s this year is wanting more money from a funding round in my opinion. And as well as caring for the planet, I\u2019m also a businessman. I need to have a company and I need to get the company moving.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Van der Molen agrees with Dunsford that ultimately the market for cell-based meat will far outstrip that of the plant-based sector. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018Well, I won\u2019t eat it\u2019 and I say, \u2018But you just might not have a choice, because these massive big meat producers will just force it upon you.\u2019 They don\u2019t necessarily care about the environment \u2013 though some certainly do \u2013 but the savings that they can possibly make from using cell-based as opposed to rearing cattle? Unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>So we will see cell-based meat in McDonald\u2019s or Burger King? \u201cOh God, 100%,\u201d Van der Molen replies. \u201cYeah, I just think it will dominate.\u201d</p> <p>For Dunsford, the breakthrough product will likely be a hybrid of cell- and plant-based ingredients. \u201cBecause the cells actually taste of meat and plant-based doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to think about things like a fish cake: a lot of that is potatoes. Think of a sausage, a lot of that is just filler. So it is the same principle as what we currently do with food products.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone agrees \u2013 some with zeal, others resignation \u2013 that it\u2019s not if meat production will change, but when and how. In 2016, Dunsford was asked by advisers at Downing Street to present his research on protein alternatives. At the end of the day, he walked down the Strand to catch his tube and started humming David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity. \u201cThe line \u2018Take your protein pill\u2026\u2019 came into my mind,\u201d Dunsford recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do next. I want to make a sausage in space! I want to build a system that will exist for space travel and for planet colonisation!\u2019 That\u2019s what will come of this technology.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Neil Rankin first really took notice of vegans in 2016 when they were threatening to protest outside his restaurant. The 43-year-old chef had just opened Temper, a barbecue joint in Soho built around a six metre-long fire pit, which was the biggest in London and perhaps in any restaurant anywhere. Whole beasts were brought in, butchered and grilled theatrically in thick slabs over the embers. As the Observer\u2019s Jay Rayner noted (admiringly): \u201cThere is a menu, but they could just replace it with a massive sign stamped with the word MEAT!, alongside one of those comedy boxing gloves on an extending arm which keeps punching you in the face until you surrender.\u201d Rankin was in many respects an obvious target for vegan ire. With his elaborate tatts, brawny forearms and trucker cap, he was a poster boy for the strange but powerful barbecue fixation that took hold a few years ago; before Temper, he worked variously as a chef at Pitt Cue Co, Smokehouse and Bad Egg. He\u2019d also just spent two years smoking, braising and grilling to produce a bible for carnivores titled Low and Slow: How to Cook Meat. \u201cI\u2019ve cooked 15 goats all at once,\u201d Rankin says, flecks of Edinburgh in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve butchered many animals in my time.\u201d So when the vegans came after him on social media, Rankin wasn\u2019t surprised or especially bothered. Those at the \u201cextremist\u201d end, he ignored \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no grey area,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cyou\u2019re evil, you\u2019re wrong, that\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 but others, he\u2019d debate. One in particular, a university lecturer on food issues, he became friendly with and they went out for dinner. Rankin pointed out that, unlike most steakhouses, his use of entire carcasses respected animals and minimised offcuts, but on certain issues he was swayed. \u201cI was part of a group of people who made barbecue big again in the UK and I\u2019m not too sure if that was a good thing,\u201d he concedes now. \u201cIt was an interesting eye-opener to my own ethics and what I was doing.\u201d Rankin is telling me this in a vegan restaurant. His zero-waste vegan restaurant, in fact: Simplicity Burger on Brick Lane in east London, across the street from the famous bagel shops. When we meet, he\u2019s almost completed Veganuary. Rankin estimates that he probably hasn\u2019t bought meat to cook at home for two-and-a-half years. It\u2019s like Richard Dawkins confiding that maybe he was a bit hasty writing off the whole God thing. Either that or Rankin is very canny at predicting and leading food trends. There is disagreement over the popularity of veganism in the UK: most estimates put it at a little over 1% of the population. But there is clearly unprecedented awareness and press coverage of it. This year, 400,000 people globally signed up for Veganuary, compared with 250,000 in 2019. Not long ago, the big supermarkets might have a sorry corner with some Quorn and Linda McCartney products; as of last month, when Sainsbury\u2019s joined the club, they all have own-brand plant-based ranges, as well as many stocking the likes of the Meatless Farm Co, Vivera and Oumph!. There\u2019s everything from fake turkey to vegetarian \u201cham\u201d, and even vegan pork scratchings, made from flash-fried soya pieces, which received 174% funding on Kickstarter last year. The global demand for plant-based protein has grown from \u00a32.9bn in 2015 to a predicted \u00a34bn this year. One area of undisputed growth is plant-based convenience food. The Vegan Society calls it \u201cthe UK\u2019s fastest-growing takeaway choice\u201d, having exploded by 388% (from, admittedly, a low base) between 2016 and 2018. A tipping point was the release last year of the Greggs vegan sausage roll, which, thanks to Piers Morgan, clever use of social media and the fact that it doesn\u2019t taste awful, has brought a new audience to plant-based meat alternatives. Greggs doesn\u2019t talk about specific sales, only that the \u201chuge popularity\u201d of its vegan sausage roll \u2013 and, this year\u2019s releases, the vegan steak bake and a doughnut \u2013 have driven total sales to rise by 13.5%. Last month, the company announced it would pay its 25,000 employees bonuses totalling \u00a37m, or up to \u00a3300 each. Plant-based food is now even raiding the spiritual castle of the meat pie: the football ground. When Chelsea played Arsenal last month, supporters at Stamford Bridge could warm themselves at half-time with a vegan doner kebab or buffalo cauli wings at the Premier League\u2019s first fully vegan kiosk. Much of the demand in the fast-food sector is for fake burgers, with restaurants lasciviously telling vegans and flexitarians \u2013 meat-reducers, essentially \u2013 that theirs \u201cooze\u201d and \u201cbleed\u201d just like the real thing. Anyone doubting there is serious money in this sector need only look at the US company Beyond Meat, which supplies smaller UK chains such as Honest, Neat Burger and Halo Burger but also All Bar Ones, Premier Inns and Toby Carverys. In July last year, Beyond Meat briefly had a market valuation of $11.7bn (\u00a39bn). When Rankin set out to make his plant-based Simplicity Burger he did not want to make a product that would appeal to vegans. That was thinking far too small. He wanted to craft a burger with such deep umami notes that anyone and everyone would find it delicious. \u201cEight months at home, just doing weird stuff with mushrooms and things like that,\u201d Rankin recalls. \u201cI got the flavour really early on; it was the texture that was the hardest thing to get. There were times when I was pulling my hair out. Times I gave up. But when I finally nailed it, that was a good feeling. I was like, \u2018Thank god I didn\u2019t have to add some weird chemical.\u2019\u201d Rankin is in some senses a late arrival at the plant-based party. But the difference, he believes, is that he has approached the challenge as a chef, not as a food scientist, wellness guru or tech entrepreneur. For example, the cheese for the Simplicity Burger could have been a simple vegan cheese: it might not have tasted of much, but it would have melted and provided a familiar texture. Instead, Rankin decided to extract the liquid from vegan cheese and replace it with fermented tomato water, fried onion oil and pickle juice. The result is quite mind-bending: it\u2019s cheese that tastes not of cheese, but faintly of a cheeseburger. The reason that many chefs have been slow to engage with vegan food, Rankin suggests, is hubris. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not cool,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a lot of flak for it. I get laughed at. I go to these little chef things and they go, \u2018How\u2019s your vegan thing? Haha!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018How\u2019s your restaurant that does fuck all for nobody apart from your own ego?\u2019\u201d Still, Rankin knows, from years sweating over a fire pit, how deep and primal our love of meat is and how difficult it will be to convince the doubters. \u201cThere\u2019s a cultural identity to it,\u201d says Rankin. \u201cIf you take that scene in Pulp Fiction, where Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta come into the room and he\u2019s eating the burger and he tries it and says, \u2018This is a tasty burger\u2026\u2019 You can\u2019t replace that scene with a falafel and get away with it.\u201d * * * Rankin\u2019s Simplicity Burger is indeed a tasty burger. The first mouthful delivers a dense, satisfying umami whoomph I haven\u2019t tasted before from plant-based fast food. That\u2019s not to imply that I\u2019m tricked into thinking I\u2019m eating a beef burger: it doesn\u2019t fall apart in your mouth in quite the same way. But that\u2019s not a criticism of Rankin; it\u2019s just an acknowledgment that replicating meat is an outsize, maybe even impossible, culinary and scientific challenge. When you put a ground beef in a hot pan, there\u2019s immediately a reaction between amino acids and simple sugars that form complex flavour compounds. The meat browns \u2013 the Maillard reaction \u2013 and creates more than 4,000 different molecules, which are responsible for its distinctive look, texture, smell and flavour. Humans have found the taste of cooked meat irresistible for approximately two-and-a-half million years. Eating animals is the main reason our brains developed and our stomachs shrank and we no longer had to spend all day foraging for food. So why then, if it\u2019s so difficult, are so many people trying to mimic meat with vegetables? The climate emergency is the most pressing reason. In the past half century, global meat production has increased by more than 400%. In the next 30 years, as the population nudges 10 billion, there are projections that demand for meat will double again. \u201cAnd cows just take too long to grow,\u201d says Simeon Van der Molen, who launched the plant-based manufacturer Moving Mountains in west London in 2015. \u201cAfter three years, you get 1,000 kilograms of beef, but that\u2019s a ridiculously long time.\u201d Van der Molen, who is 47 years old and favours the Branson-casual entrepreneur uniform of open-necked shirt and running shoes, had no previous experience in the food industry; his other company, Ecozone, makes detergents. But he had an itch to try something different and he was hearing a lot of noise from the States about Beyond Meat and market leader Impossible Foods, which was founded by Pat Brown, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University, and has a stated aim to make animal agriculture and deep-sea fishing redundant by 2035. Van der Molen also had personal reasons. \u201cI went to the doctors and I had cholesterol at 6.9 and the doctor told me to stop eating burgers,\u201d he recalls when we meet at the Moving Mountains co-working office in Chiswick. \u201cOtherwise I was going to end up on statins all my life. So I went straight to the supermarket and, as you can imagine back in 2015, it wasn\u2019t very tasty: the burgers were bean burgers, nut burgers. And for someone who has gone from eating a quarter pounder that\u2019s juicy and succulent, having a burger that looks like a squashed falafel is just too much of a step.\u201d In this regard, Van der Molen thinks he is typical. His research suggests that most Moving Mountains customers are either aged 15 to 25, \u201cdoing it for the environment and animal welfare\u201d, or between 45 and 65 and driven by health reasons. \u201cBecause their doctors told them like they told me,\u201d says Van der Molen. Women significantly outnumber men. Van der Molen started by speaking to food technologists. He paid for it from his own pocket; he also sold his collection of classic cars, including rare Bugattis and Teslas, plunging the money into the new company. The consultants suggested that oyster mushrooms, with their deep taste and fibrous texture, would make a good base for the first Moving Mountains burger. \u201cI dislike mushrooms,\u201d admits Van der Molen. \u201cI was against it.\u201d Nevertheless, they made up about 20% of the burger, and were supplemented by peas, potatoes, wheat and soy proteins, coconut oil and vitamin B12. The final touch was the addition of beetroot juice, which would give the illusion that the burger was \u201cbleeding\u201d. The Moving Mountains B12 burger was a hit. It was launched in February 2018 at Mildreds, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant in Dalston, east London, but there was a mainstream crossover in September when all of Marston\u2019s 400-plus food pubs began offering it. In 2019, Harvester followed, then Europe\u2019s Hard Rock Cafes and the massive pub operators Stonegate and Mitchells &amp; Butlers. Their secret? \u201cFour words we never mention: vegan, vegetarian, meatless, meat-free,\u201d says Van der Molen. \u201cWe have to be so firm sometimes with restaurants, top companies such as Hard Rock Cafe. Call it the Moving Mountains burger. Meat-free and meatless are all about what is missing from the product: \u2018Meat free? What\u2019s in it then? I don\u2019t want it.\u2019 So we want to promote this as plant-based meat. Even though it\u2019s not technically meat, we can still call it what we want. And we want to promote what\u2019s good about it, not what\u2019s lacking.\u201d This, Van der Molen contends, differentiates his product from, say, the Greggs vegan sausage roll and meatless steak bake. \u201cA vegan sausage roll \u2013 again, you\u2019re limiting it to the amount of people who are going to buy it,\u201d says Van der Molen. \u201cI have friends that would never go to Greggs and ask for the vegan sausage roll because they never ever want to use the word \u2018vegan\u2019 when they\u2019re with their mates. And it\u2019s the same in restaurants. They don\u2019t want to say it. It\u2019s still old school. It\u2019s sissy. You don\u2019t want to be associated with vegan.\u201d Van der Molen always saw Moving Mountains as restaurant only. \u201cI don\u2019t really like supermarkets, what can I say?\u201d he says, with a smirk. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with them most of my life.\u201d He mellowed, however, and in late December last year, three of Moving Mountains\u2019 plant-based products \u2013 a sausage burger, sausage and hot dog, though not the regular burger \u2013 became available in the frozen food aisle of Sainsbury\u2019s. Plant-based is here to stay, insists Van der Molen, and will be a global phenomenon. Moving Mountains already sells in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, but Van der Molen is eager this year to take on Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat in the US. He has especially high hopes for the Moving Mountains hot dog, which has a main ingredient of sunflower seeds. \u201cNo one\u2019s been able to replicate that,\u201d he says. \u201cSo where will the plant-based market and Moving Mountains be in two years? We probably could be meeting in New York, I think.\u201d * * * As you enter Unity Diner in Spitalfields, east London, there is a large neon sign that reads: \u201cThe future is vegan.\u201d On the menu, there are lots of ingredients my spellcheck is not happy about \u2013 cheeze, chikken, bakon and prawnz \u2013 as well as the Moving Mountains burger and hot dog. You can wash it down with a gin cocktail called Piers Morgan\u2019s Tears, served with a straw made from wheat stems. I order the burger and my companion, Illtud Llyr Dunsford, selects a Moving Mountains hot dog with added prawnz: vegan surf\u2019n\u2019turf. If Rankin would be near the bottom of the list of people that you would expect to go into the market for meat alternatives, then Dunsford, a jolly, curious 39-year-old with a warm smile, isn\u2019t far behind. His family has been farming in the Gwendraeth Valley, west Wales, for more than 300 years. Dunsford, meanwhile, was so inspired by the nose-to-tail philosophy of St John chef Fergus Henderson that in 2011 he set up a company called Charcutier with the aim of making world-class air-dried ham from Welsh pedigree pigs. Dunsford knows his hot dogs, too: he used to supply them for Harrods. \u201cOne of my nicknames back then was the Sausage Dude,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good nickname or not.\u201d So what does Dunsford make of the Moving Mountains hot dog? \u201cThat\u2019s surprisingly good,\u201d he says, fighting an admirable battle to keep ketchup out of his thick, reddish-brown beard. \u201cIt tastes like a commodity product, a cheap product, the texture is a little bit too hard, but for me if this was a street-corner product it replaces it quite easily.\u201d Praise then, but qualified. Dunsford can see scenarios in which plant-based simulacra can fill a gap \u2013 and for the planet that has to be so \u2013 but the notion that they can replace the real thing entirely is a stretch too far. \u201cFor me as a meat eater, there\u2019s an organoleptic quality when you consume meat,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd none of these plant-based products offers exactly the same response. You don\u2019t quite have that little glob of hot fat going down your chin you get with real meat.\u201d For this reason, Dunsford believes the future of meat has to be growing it in labs from animal cells. His long, at times confounding journey to this conclusion began in 2015, when he attended a symposium on cultured meat at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and continued when he was chosen as a prestigious Nuffield farming scholar and spent 15 months travelling the world to explore the future of meat production, which included seeing the impact of animal agriculture on deforestation in the Amazon. But it all fell into place in late 2017, in the San Francisco headquarters of a US company Just, Inc (a building where Dunsford, a film buff, notes that Toy Story was screened for the first time). \u201cThey cooked me up a little duck liver chorizo,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was in a little taco, it was tiny. And I ate it and it just had the umami kick of what I expect from meat. It was like this final piece of the jigsaw for me: this actually tastes exactly the same as meat. I thought, \u2018Well, if you could produce that product cheaper, why on earth would a consumer buy something else instead?\u2019\u201d Charcutier was wound down and Dunsford now runs Cellular Agriculture, the first UK startup in the cell-based meat space, with Dr Marianne Ellis, whose day job is head of chemical engineering at the University of Bath. \u201cOur machine at the moment produces milligrams worth of cells, so very, very small,\u201d says Dunsford. \u201cBut by the end of the next two years, we\u2019re looking at about 10 kilos for a cycle, which is about three weeks. And the aspiration really, in around five years, is to build factories that produce tonnages of cells.\u201d Dunsford is well aware that cell-based meat has a yuck factor to overcome, but he\u2019s confident that over time it will. And if it does, the potential market is huge: while he believes plant-based food will mainly appeal to flexitarians, vegetarians and vegans, who make up about 20% of the British population, cultured meat would be an option for everyone else, whether they plan to reduce their meat intake or not. \u201cThe difference with cell-based is that chemically it is meat,\u201d says Dunsford. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that you have to do to it to flavour it to make it taste of meat, because the cells are derived from animals.\u201d As an individual, Dunsford accepts that he should be the perfect target for meat alternatives: he buys local; he cares about sustainability; when he takes a flight, he offsets his carbon. \u201cSo I\u2019m that kind of consumer and I\u2019ve tried to do plant-based but I can\u2019t,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just my body and my mind are not strong enough. Even though I know there are a certain number of things that we need to do to help the planet, I\u2019m weak. Most people are.\u201d * * * Cell-based meat is, as you would expect, divisive. For Rankin, it\u2019s a future that he doesn\u2019t care much to imagine. \u201cOne, growing meat in labs, that\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd two, we have sustainably produced meat in this country. It\u2019s just the fact we are eating too much of it. The whole problem with meat is that we just need to replace 90% of what we eat with other things, then we can sustainably farm animals and the animals can sustainably add manure to the soil. That whole thing that we used to do 100 years ago, really effectively, can work again.\u201d So Rankin doesn\u2019t think lab-grown meat will find a market then? \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it will take off, but I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s going to be terrible for us,\u201d he warns. \u201cYou look at history and as soon as we started to get labs or companies to do our diets for us or to feed us food it turned out incredibly badly every single time.\u201d Van der Molen looked into cell-based meat before starting Moving Mountains. For him, the issue was not ethics, but timescale. \u201cI met with the University of Bath and, as soon as I understood what was involved, I stopped that,\u201d he says. Why? \u201cIt\u2019s another 10 years away from now, I would guess, from being produced. Anyone who tells you it\u2019s this year is wanting more money from a funding round in my opinion. And as well as caring for the planet, I\u2019m also a businessman. I need to have a company and I need to get the company moving.\u201d Still, Van der Molen agrees with Dunsford that ultimately the market for cell-based meat will far outstrip that of the plant-based sector. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018Well, I won\u2019t eat it\u2019 and I say, \u2018But you just might not have a choice, because these massive big meat producers will just force it upon you.\u2019 They don\u2019t necessarily care about the environment \u2013 though some certainly do \u2013 but the savings that they can possibly make from using cell-based as opposed to rearing cattle? Unbelievable.\u201d So we will see cell-based meat in McDonald\u2019s or Burger King? \u201cOh God, 100%,\u201d Van der Molen replies. \u201cYeah, I just think it will dominate.\u201d For Dunsford, the breakthrough product will likely be a hybrid of cell- and plant-based ingredients. \u201cBecause the cells actually taste of meat and plant-based doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to think about things like a fish cake: a lot of that is potatoes. Think of a sausage, a lot of that is just filler. So it is the same principle as what we currently do with food products.\u201d Everyone agrees \u2013 some with zeal, others resignation \u2013 that it\u2019s not if meat production will change, but when and how. In 2016, Dunsford was asked by advisers at Downing Street to present his research on protein alternatives. At the end of the day, he walked down the Strand to catch his tube and started humming David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity. \u201cThe line \u2018Take your protein pill\u2026\u2019 came into my mind,\u201d Dunsford recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do next. I want to make a sausage in space! I want to build a system that will exist for space travel and for planet colonisation!\u2019 That\u2019s what will come of this technology.\u201d",

By the time the service reached Peterborough they were promising free passage back to London for anyone who wanted to turn tail already. A couple of England fans on a corporate freebie sitting near me made it as far as York before they gave up. Even the England team rearranged their schedule so they could fly out later Saturday night, as soon as they had done what they had to do. It was one of those nights, one to admire from behind the curtains while you\u2019re beside the fire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/08/scotland-england-six-nations-match-report\">Ellis Genge try earns England stormy Six Nations win over Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWorst conditions you\u2019ve ever played in?\u201d they asked Stuart Hogg afterwards. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p> <p>The writer Ron Butlin once decided to count how many different words the Scottish have for rain, he made it to 70 before he gave up. Given that the academics from the University of Glasgow who are putting together <em>The Historical Thesaurus of Scots</em> found 421 distinct words for snow, Butlin probably still has a way to go. They do, too. Four years ago they promised they were going to do all the different synonyms for rain next, but they don\u2019t seem to have finished it yet. What would you call the stuff falling at Murrayfield this Saturday, for instance, where it was wasn\u2019t just cats and dogs coming down, but plastic beer bottles too.</p> <p>One of those flew down from the gantry after the England team bus pulled up and caught one of the support staff on the back of the head. Welcome to Murrayfield.

Never mind David Sole\u2019s famous slow walk from the tunnel in this fixture back in 1990, this time it was the Scottish Rugby Union\u2019s patron, Princess Anne, who kept everyone waiting. She, at least, was utterly unruffled by the weather, and took her royal time going out to shake the players\u2019 hands before the kick-off. England (rash decision this) were wearing their shorts and they all stood shivering through their polite grins while she made her way ever so slowly down the line. Behind them, a 30-piece brass band bashed out 500 Miles by the Proclaimers while 60,000-odd Scots sang along.</p> <p>As soon as she was done the players all started bouncing and jiggling and beating their arms to get the blood flowing again. The Scots, better prepared, were all wearing trousers. Their team made a warm start, too, when Sam Johnson smacked down Jonny May after the kick-off. Another dose of Scottish hospitality. The Scots followed up with three minutes of furious pick-and-go drives, pummelling the English pack. Already then, you could tell the game was shaping up to be a real test of the mettle of this England team, of \u201ctheir leadership\u201d, as Jones said, and of their spirt, smarts and character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cdd376dcfd74c9f073d8d2393384204de32c6181\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd376dcfd74c9f073d8d2393384204de32c6181/0_156_3444_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kicking conditions were tough for both teams at Murrayfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kicking conditions were tough for both teams at Murrayfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England\u2019s plan became clear as the half wore on.

      "bodyText": "The forecast was that bad that on the trains north on Saturday morning they were warning passengers to abandon any plans to travel back that way on Sunday. By the time the service reached Peterborough they were promising free passage back to London for anyone who wanted to turn tail already. A couple of England fans on a corporate freebie sitting near me made it as far as York before they gave up. Even the England team rearranged their schedule so they could fly out later Saturday night, as soon as they had done what they had to do. It was one of those nights, one to admire from behind the curtains while you\u2019re beside the fire. \u201cWorst conditions you\u2019ve ever played in?\u201d they asked Stuart Hogg afterwards. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d The writer Ron Butlin once decided to count how many different words the Scottish have for rain, he made it to 70 before he gave up. Given that the academics from the University of Glasgow who are putting together The Historical Thesaurus of Scots found 421 distinct words for snow, Butlin probably still has a way to go. They do, too. Four years ago they promised they were going to do all the different synonyms for rain next, but they don\u2019t seem to have finished it yet. What would you call the stuff falling at Murrayfield this Saturday, for instance, where it was wasn\u2019t just cats and dogs coming down, but plastic beer bottles too. One of those flew down from the gantry after the England team bus pulled up and caught one of the support staff on the back of the head. Welcome to Murrayfield. And people wonder why the players talk about how much they hate playing here. Eddie Jones called it \u201cniggle\u201d before the match. That\u2019s a polite description for some of what they had to put up with, the raucous hoots and whistles whenever Owen Farrell lined up a penalty. Murrayfield isn\u2019t the only place where they boo the kicker. But it may be the only place where they boo the stadium announcement asking them not to. Niggle\u2019s more fitting for all that pre-match rigmarole. Never mind David Sole\u2019s famous slow walk from the tunnel in this fixture back in 1990, this time it was the Scottish Rugby Union\u2019s patron, Princess Anne, who kept everyone waiting. She, at least, was utterly unruffled by the weather, and took her royal time going out to shake the players\u2019 hands before the kick-off. England (rash decision this) were wearing their shorts and they all stood shivering through their polite grins while she made her way ever so slowly down the line. Behind them, a 30-piece brass band bashed out 500 Miles by the Proclaimers while 60,000-odd Scots sang along. As soon as she was done the players all started bouncing and jiggling and beating their arms to get the blood flowing again. The Scots, better prepared, were all wearing trousers. Their team made a warm start, too, when Sam Johnson smacked down Jonny May after the kick-off. Another dose of Scottish hospitality. The Scots followed up with three minutes of furious pick-and-go drives, pummelling the English pack. Already then, you could tell the game was shaping up to be a real test of the mettle of this England team, of \u201ctheir leadership\u201d, as Jones said, and of their spirt, smarts and character. England\u2019s plan became clear as the half wore on. Farrell ran through his entire repertoire of kicks in the space of five or so minutes, a chip to one corner, a grubber to the other, an up-and-under down the middle. It would have been a good plan any day they weren\u2019t playing into the teeth of a gale. Never mind the flags flapping round the top of the grandstands, the posts themselves were blowing sideways. Farrell executed them pretty well in the circumstances. The three penalties he missed, all by a distance, showed just how hard the gusting wind was making things. There were a whole lot of errors on both sides, \u201cmust have been 40 or 50 altogether\u201d, Gregor Townsend said. Kicks that were overhit and flew wildly into touch, others that went up and boomeranged right back the way they came. In between all that slapstick, there was a lot of short, ugly work, two teams throwing body blows at each other. You caught little glimpses of the action among the tumult, limbs popping out of a cloud of dust in a cartoon punch up, Maro Itoje scragging Ali Price, and Tom Curry stripping the ball off Blair Kinghorn.

      "body": "<p>Cabinet reshuffles are always fraught with tension. But when they involve chancellors of the exchequer they can be particularly nasty. When Theresa May became prime minister in July 2016, one of her first acts was to dismiss George Osborne. In a short and brutal conversation she told him that he should go away and spend more time getting to know the Conservative party. Osborne, who had been chancellor for six years, was so furious that he reportedly told friends that he would not rest until May was \u201cchopped up in bags in my freezer\u201d.</p> <p>On Thursday, Boris Johnson will carry out what is expected to be a wide-ranging reshuffle of his cabinet. At a meeting of ministerial special advisers on Friday evening the PM\u2019s most powerful aide, Dominic Cummings, raised the tension levels in Whitehall to new heights, concluding by telling the advisers (who will lose their jobs if their bosses are sacked) that he would \u201csee half of you next week\u201d.</p> <p>This is the same Dominic Cummings whose relations with the current chancellor of the exchequer, Sajid Javid, have deteriorated steadily over recent months, since before the general election, and are now said to be at best icy. Cummings and Javid are competing for the prime minister\u2019s ear over issues central to the entire direction of government policy. Broadly speaking, Javid is keen to keep a tight grip on spending while Cummings\u2019s priority is to spend lots in order to \u201clevel up\u201d the country in order hold on to seats the Tories won from Labour in the Midlands and the north at the general election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>See half of you next week</p> <footer> <cite>Dominic Cummings, to PM's advisers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given that Javid was appointed chancellor by Johnson less than seven months ago it would be astonishing if he were to get the chop on Thursday. Johnson firing Javid would make May sacking Osborne look like a tea party. The fact that the removal of the chancellor seven months into a job he was given by the current PM has even been debated in the media is remarkable enough, and testament to Cummings\u2019s disruptive influence.</p> <p>All the indications this weekend were, however, that Javid will stay put \u2013 and therefore be strengthened in his battles with Cummings. In recent weeks there have been briefings coming out of No 10 to the effect that if Javid were to stay, he would still not have it all his own way. There was talk of the creation of a new \u201csuper economic ministry\u201d under the control of the chancellor\u2019s deputy, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak. That plan seems to have gone off the boil.</p> <p>There are different way of interpreting the state of this power play between Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street. One theory is that Cummings has been deliberately riling Javid to keep him on edge and make sure he comes into line. But another is that Cummings is not as influential as he would like, that he is losing many of his early battles in government, and that the shape of this week\u2019s reshuffle will reinforce this sense.</p> <p>In Whitehall there is also a growing feeling of weariness at his inability to calm down, even after delivering Brexit and helping to win a general election for Johnson. \u201cHe does not have another mode other than the disruptive one,\u201d said a former Tory cabinet minister on Saturday. \u201cIt can become very tiresome.\u201d</p> <p>This weekend the government took the unusual step (before a reshuffle) of briefing that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, would definitely be kept in his job. It is also hinting strongly that the HS2 high-speed rail line between London and Manchester and Leeds will be given the go-ahead within days. Cummings has described HS2 as a \u201cdisaster zone\u201d and thinks the \u00a3100bn-plus to be spent on it would be better allocated elsewhere. Furthermore Johnson\u2019s government recently gave approval for Chinese telecoms company Huawei to help build Britain\u2019s 5G network \u2013 another decision of which Cummings strongly disapproved. His ideas for sweeping reforms of Whitehall and to move the House of Lords to York seem to have gone cold too.</p> <p>The reshuffle is still expected to be extensive. There could well be high-level casualties, with exits for the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been silenced since his pre-election gaffe suggesting that victims of the Grenfell disaster should have shown \u201ccommon sense\u201d and fled the building. Several female cabinet ministers could also be ousted, including Liz Truss, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey and Andrea Leadsom. The justice minister Lucy Frazer is being tipped to replace Cox and become the first female attorney general.</p> <p>But the occupants of the three great offices of state \u2013 foreign secretary Dominic Raab, home secretary Priti Patel and Javid look likely to remain in place \u2013 suggesting that Boris Johnson may want more continuity and stability than his restless chief adviser. With a new cabinet in place, the question may soon become how much longer Cummings himself remains at the heart of it all. As a former Tory minister put it: \u201cThe new cabinet will consist of the prime minister\u2019s people. If Cummings starts waging war on them I don\u2019t see the point of him being there much longer.\u201d</p> <h2>Key cards in the pack</h2> <p><strong>Dominic Cummings</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5fc4d60789b0255b6671648e1a4cae0d269b42ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fc4d60789b0255b6671648e1a4cae0d269b42ac/0_158_5906_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Whoever is hired and fired on Thursday, the reshuffle should give a hint about the relative status of the most controversial figure in Boris Johnson\u2019s team \u2013 Dominic Cummings, his senior adviser. There are already signs that some of the grand plans that Cummings has had in mind for years, such as a major overhaul of how Whitehall operates, are not a priority. His dislike of the HS2 project is also expected to be overruled. How much say he is given over the reshuffle will be a further indication of how dominant a figure he remains in Downing Street. If the cabinet is reduced in size or more power is handed to No 10 or to Vote Leave figures like Michael Gove, then it\u2019s likely Cummings will have had something to do with it.</p> <p><strong>Michael Gove</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9bef0aab96e898e3cee4e67031db2fd389995d52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bef0aab96e898e3cee4e67031db2fd389995d52/0_91_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Johnson\u2019s former Vote Leave colleague and leadership rival is likely to get a new role. He currently oversees Brexit preparations at the Cabinet Office and is regarded as the government\u2019s most effective operator.

      "bodyText": "Cabinet reshuffles are always fraught with tension. But when they involve chancellors of the exchequer they can be particularly nasty. When Theresa May became prime minister in July 2016, one of her first acts was to dismiss George Osborne. In a short and brutal conversation she told him that he should go away and spend more time getting to know the Conservative party. Osborne, who had been chancellor for six years, was so furious that he reportedly told friends that he would not rest until May was \u201cchopped up in bags in my freezer\u201d. On Thursday, Boris Johnson will carry out what is expected to be a wide-ranging reshuffle of his cabinet. At a meeting of ministerial special advisers on Friday evening the PM\u2019s most powerful aide, Dominic Cummings, raised the tension levels in Whitehall to new heights, concluding by telling the advisers (who will lose their jobs if their bosses are sacked) that he would \u201csee half of you next week\u201d. This is the same Dominic Cummings whose relations with the current chancellor of the exchequer, Sajid Javid, have deteriorated steadily over recent months, since before the general election, and are now said to be at best icy. Cummings and Javid are competing for the prime minister\u2019s ear over issues central to the entire direction of government policy. Broadly speaking, Javid is keen to keep a tight grip on spending while Cummings\u2019s priority is to spend lots in order to \u201clevel up\u201d the country in order hold on to seats the Tories won from Labour in the Midlands and the north at the general election. Given that Javid was appointed chancellor by Johnson less than seven months ago it would be astonishing if he were to get the chop on Thursday. Johnson firing Javid would make May sacking Osborne look like a tea party. The fact that the removal of the chancellor seven months into a job he was given by the current PM has even been debated in the media is remarkable enough, and testament to Cummings\u2019s disruptive influence. All the indications this weekend were, however, that Javid will stay put \u2013 and therefore be strengthened in his battles with Cummings. In recent weeks there have been briefings coming out of No 10 to the effect that if Javid were to stay, he would still not have it all his own way. There was talk of the creation of a new \u201csuper economic ministry\u201d under the control of the chancellor\u2019s deputy, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak. That plan seems to have gone off the boil. There are different way of interpreting the state of this power play between Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street. One theory is that Cummings has been deliberately riling Javid to keep him on edge and make sure he comes into line. But another is that Cummings is not as influential as he would like, that he is losing many of his early battles in government, and that the shape of this week\u2019s reshuffle will reinforce this sense. In Whitehall there is also a growing feeling of weariness at his inability to calm down, even after delivering Brexit and helping to win a general election for Johnson. \u201cHe does not have another mode other than the disruptive one,\u201d said a former Tory cabinet minister on Saturday. \u201cIt can become very tiresome.\u201d This weekend the government took the unusual step (before a reshuffle) of briefing that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, would definitely be kept in his job. It is also hinting strongly that the HS2 high-speed rail line between London and Manchester and Leeds will be given the go-ahead within days. Cummings has described HS2 as a \u201cdisaster zone\u201d and thinks the \u00a3100bn-plus to be spent on it would be better allocated elsewhere. Furthermore Johnson\u2019s government recently gave approval for Chinese telecoms company Huawei to help build Britain\u2019s 5G network \u2013 another decision of which Cummings strongly disapproved. His ideas for sweeping reforms of Whitehall and to move the House of Lords to York seem to have gone cold too. The reshuffle is still expected to be extensive. There could well be high-level casualties, with exits for the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been silenced since his pre-election gaffe suggesting that victims of the Grenfell disaster should have shown \u201ccommon sense\u201d and fled the building. Several female cabinet ministers could also be ousted, including Liz Truss, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey and Andrea Leadsom. The justice minister Lucy Frazer is being tipped to replace Cox and become the first female attorney general. But the occupants of the three great offices of state \u2013 foreign secretary Dominic Raab, home secretary Priti Patel and Javid look likely to remain in place \u2013 suggesting that Boris Johnson may want more continuity and stability than his restless chief adviser. With a new cabinet in place, the question may soon become how much longer Cummings himself remains at the heart of it all. As a former Tory minister put it: \u201cThe new cabinet will consist of the prime minister\u2019s people. If Cummings starts waging war on them I don\u2019t see the point of him being there much longer.\u201d Key cards in the pack Dominic Cummings Whoever is hired and fired on Thursday, the reshuffle should give a hint about the relative status of the most controversial figure in Boris Johnson\u2019s team \u2013 Dominic Cummings, his senior adviser. There are already signs that some of the grand plans that Cummings has had in mind for years, such as a major overhaul of how Whitehall operates, are not a priority. His dislike of the HS2 project is also expected to be overruled. How much say he is given over the reshuffle will be a further indication of how dominant a figure he remains in Downing Street. If the cabinet is reduced in size or more power is handed to No 10 or to Vote Leave figures like Michael Gove, then it\u2019s likely Cummings will have had something to do with it. Michael Gove Johnson\u2019s former Vote Leave colleague and leadership rival is likely to get a new role. He currently oversees Brexit preparations at the Cabinet Office and is regarded as the government\u2019s most effective operator. A move to become the de facto deputy prime minister was talked about \u2013 though he may now be needed to solve the crisis in Britain\u2019s preparations for COP26, a crucial international climate summit in Glasgow. David Cameron and William Hague have turned down the chance to oversee the summit. Gove has a good reputation with green groups after his hyperactive stint as environment secretary and could be the best fit. Rishi Sunak The chief secretary to the Treasury is favoured by No 10 and had been lined up for a promotion. However, he could end up suffering from the rapidly changing ambitions of Downing Street. He had initially been linked to a new super-ministry, looking at economics and infrastructure, but plans for an immediate rewiring of Whitehall have been scaled back in order to prioritise delivering tangible gains for new Tory seats. The tight public finances may also mean Sunak is needed to oversee a spending review \u2013 and having an ally in the troublesome Treasury is useful for No 10. A move to the business department could be a possible compromise. Lucy Frazer The prisons minister has impressed Johnson\u2019s team with her assured style. She is being lined up to replace either Robert Buckland as justice secretary or \u2013 more likely \u2013 Geoffrey Cox as attorney general.

The contest is in desperate need of an injection of energy and the flesh accidentally exposed to parliament by the Batley and Spen MP has excited more national conversation than anything being said by the current runners.</p> <p>The American Democrats have just illustrated one way not to stage a successful leadership contest by turning their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/the-iowa-caucuses-only-reinforced-the-idea-that-democracy-is-a-joke\" title=\"\">Iowa presidential caucus</a> into a farce. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2020/jan/02/labour-leadership-election-the-latest-odds\" title=\"\">British Labour party</a> is demonstrating another way of not doing a successful leadership contest by turning its race into a bore. People like me are giving it our attention because it is our job to do so. People like you, the sort of people who read commentaries like this, are probably giving it a bit of your time because you are above average in your interest in politics. It is fair to say that the Labour leadership contest is not seizing the imagination of the vast majority of the population. It is not even giving the nation a light tap on the elbow.</p> <p>This didn\u2019t have to be the case. Leadership contests can be a positive for a party if they shop-window talent, introduce fresh and engaging faces and ideas to the public and demonstrate that a party has a lively mind fizzing with fruitful debate about the future. When a contest is held after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/27/labour-defeat-due-to-gimmicks-and-division-say-members\" title=\"\">severe election defeat</a>, it also offers an opposition party the chance, should it choose to seize the opportunity, to publicly recognise that it misread the electorate and to start to prove to the country that it is willing to listen to the voters and is serious about learning from its mistakes.</p> <p>You might suppose there is a particular imperative for Labour to do the latter: to demonstrate that it is trying to understand why it was so comprehensively routed at the ballot box eight weeks ago. Lest anyone forget, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/16/labour-2017-2019-corbyn-brexit-election\" title=\"\">election defeat</a> in December was the party\u2019s fourth consecutive rejection by the country and a battering so thumping that Labour\u2019s parliamentary representation is crushed down to its lowest level since 1935. You have to be an octogenarian or older to have any memory of the last time that Labour had so few MPs to rub together.</p> <p>There has been hesitant acceptance by some of the contenders that Labour made errors, but the interrogation of the root causes of such a calamitous defeat has been feeble. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\" title=\"\">Sir Keir Starmer</a> tentatively ventures that the manifesto was possibly a bit over-loaded with too many promises, yet also refers to that gift catalogue of fantasy wish-lists that voters found incredible as the party\u2019s \u201cfoundational document\u201d.</p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey awards Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/rebecca-long-bailey-defends-corbyns-legacy-as-she-launches-labour-leadership-bid\" title=\"\">\u201c10 out of 10\u201d</a> for leadership and asserts there was nothing wrong with the fantastic policies that she helped to formulate, suggesting that all would have been just dandy but for Brexit. Lisa Nandy argues that Labour has been losing the allegiance of towns in what we used to call the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/i-dont-want-to-go-backwards-wary-worksop-welcomes-lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">red heartlands</a> for a long time. This is true enough, but it is an analysis too limited to fully explain why Labour got boxed not just in the north but all around the compass. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/18/boris-johnson-labour-brexit-election-emily-thornberry\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry</a> says her colleagues were idiots for ignoring her warnings not to permit Boris Johnson to have a pre-Christmas election. This is also true enough, but it implies that the best way for Labour to avoid losing elections is never to have to face them.</p> <p>No one says it out loud, even if they privately think it, that the outgoing leader and his hard left clique presented the country with a repulsively deadly combination of toxic politics and rank incompetence fronted by a man both traditional supporters and swing voters shuddered to think of in Number 10. This is one of the great taboos of this contest.

      "bodyText": "Is it too late for Tracy Brabin\u2019s bared shoulder to be entered as a candidate to be the next Labour leader? The contest is in desperate need of an injection of energy and the flesh accidentally exposed to parliament by the Batley and Spen MP has excited more national conversation than anything being said by the current runners. The American Democrats have just illustrated one way not to stage a successful leadership contest by turning their Iowa presidential caucus into a farce. The British Labour party is demonstrating another way of not doing a successful leadership contest by turning its race into a bore. People like me are giving it our attention because it is our job to do so. People like you, the sort of people who read commentaries like this, are probably giving it a bit of your time because you are above average in your interest in politics. It is fair to say that the Labour leadership contest is not seizing the imagination of the vast majority of the population. It is not even giving the nation a light tap on the elbow. This didn\u2019t have to be the case. Leadership contests can be a positive for a party if they shop-window talent, introduce fresh and engaging faces and ideas to the public and demonstrate that a party has a lively mind fizzing with fruitful debate about the future. When a contest is held after a severe election defeat, it also offers an opposition party the chance, should it choose to seize the opportunity, to publicly recognise that it misread the electorate and to start to prove to the country that it is willing to listen to the voters and is serious about learning from its mistakes. You might suppose there is a particular imperative for Labour to do the latter: to demonstrate that it is trying to understand why it was so comprehensively routed at the ballot box eight weeks ago. Lest anyone forget, the election defeat in December was the party\u2019s fourth consecutive rejection by the country and a battering so thumping that Labour\u2019s parliamentary representation is crushed down to its lowest level since 1935. You have to be an octogenarian or older to have any memory of the last time that Labour had so few MPs to rub together. There has been hesitant acceptance by some of the contenders that Labour made errors, but the interrogation of the root causes of such a calamitous defeat has been feeble. Sir Keir Starmer tentatively ventures that the manifesto was possibly a bit over-loaded with too many promises, yet also refers to that gift catalogue of fantasy wish-lists that voters found incredible as the party\u2019s \u201cfoundational document\u201d. Rebecca Long-Bailey awards Jeremy Corbyn \u201c10 out of 10\u201d for leadership and asserts there was nothing wrong with the fantastic policies that she helped to formulate, suggesting that all would have been just dandy but for Brexit. Lisa Nandy argues that Labour has been losing the allegiance of towns in what we used to call the red heartlands for a long time. This is true enough, but it is an analysis too limited to fully explain why Labour got boxed not just in the north but all around the compass. Emily Thornberry says her colleagues were idiots for ignoring her warnings not to permit Boris Johnson to have a pre-Christmas election. This is also true enough, but it implies that the best way for Labour to avoid losing elections is never to have to face them. No one says it out loud, even if they privately think it, that the outgoing leader and his hard left clique presented the country with a repulsively deadly combination of toxic politics and rank incompetence fronted by a man both traditional supporters and swing voters shuddered to think of in Number 10. This is one of the great taboos of this contest. None of the contenders have the courage to say it was madness for Labour to fight the election with the most unpopular leader in the history of polling. This is one truth they dare not utter for fear of offending those party members who still worship at the shrine of St Jeremy the Martyr. Another reason for this vow of silence about the multiple failings of Mr Corbyn and his crew is all the contenders for the leadership and deputy leadership were recommending him as prime minister just two months ago, five of them from positions in his shadow cabinet. The boggling scale of Labour\u2019s defeat has made the party less capable of thorough self-examination. The evisceration in December was of such traumatising magnitude it has frazzled synapses.

      "body": "<p>The Derek and Joy Sander College of Drama and Elocution has a lot to answer for. When he was 10 years old, John Sweeney\u2019s family moved from Manchester down to Hampshire, and at his new school Sweeney was teased and bullied for his northern vowels. His worried mum sent him to elocution classes in Southampton to help him fit in. The drama college did not change his accent much \u2013 Sweeney was cast in plays as the flat-capped northerner \u2013 but it did an expert job in teaching him to project his voice.</p> <p>That voice has been a primary weapon in Sweeney\u2019s one-man tour of duty as a reporter over 40 years, not so much speaking truth to power as, on occasion, yelling it. It was most notoriously employed against the official spokesman of the Church of Scientology in 2007; a clip of Sweeney (<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9032000/9032278.stm\">who apologised for \u201closing it\u201d on assignment for the BBC\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9032000/9032278.stm\">Panorama</a></em>) has been viewed several million times. It has also been consistently raised against tyrants and terrorists and gangsters (Sweeney, who retains a schoolboy sense of right and wrong, still likes to call them \u201cbaddies\u201d). Its finest hour was when Sweeney spoke out, after a four-year investigation, about the evidence given by specialist witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/dec/14/health.medicineandhealth\" title=\"\">Sir Roy Meadow</a> in a series of cot-death trials. His stubborn work was crucial in helping to free three women falsely convicted for murdering their babies from Britain\u2019s jails <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/dec/14/health.medicineandhealth\" title=\"\">in 2003</a> and save several others from prison.</p> <p>I first heard Sweeney\u2019s inimitable foghorn nearly 30 years ago in the <em>Observer</em> newsroom or, just as often, in the Coach and Horses pub next door, invariably telling stories of the places from which he had recently returned and just about lived to tell the tale. For a few of Sweeney\u2019s dozen years at this paper, I was his editor, taking in copy from his surrealist road trips through civil wars in Algeria and Bosnia and Burundi, heartfelt gonzo stories which dramatised the troubles of the world with himself at centre stage.</p> <p>When I knocked on his door in south London last week, I hadn\u2019t seen him for a few years, but he is one of those people with whom you just pick up in mid-sentence. He\u2019d invited me over to talk about his new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Useful-Idiot-John-Sweeney-ebook/dp/B082J456ZM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=276XA6AQ465EW&amp;keywords=the+useful+idiot&amp;qid=1580910201&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+useful+idiot%2Caps%2C125&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\">The Useful Idiot</a></em>, a novel set in Stalinist Moscow in 1932, as well as what he calls his \u201clatest troubles with the Beeb\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjlo4u_8g60\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mjlo4u_8g60?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjlo4u_8g60\">Watch John Sweeney\u2019s clash with a member of the Church of Scientology on Panorama.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In Sweeney\u2019s rumpled sitting room, bike in the doorway, books everywhere, photos on the walls cheerfully askew, we talk first about Gareth Jones, the hero of his novel, someone whose real-life story I\u2019d never heard. Jones was the junior foreign correspondent of the <em>Western Mail</em> in the 1930s, born in Barry. Having been posted to Russia in his 20s, he became the first journalist to tell the story of mass starvation in Stalin\u2019s regime, at a time when the rest of the world was hearing Soviet fake news. Sweeney\u2019s dramatic reconstruction of these events does not aspire to great subtlety, but the story of Jones, a man after the author\u2019s heart, is an enthralling one. (And the inspiration for a film released this week called <em>Mr Jones,</em> starring James Norton.)</p> <p>\u201cFor me, writing novels is like learning to be a brickie,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cMy first two thrillers were overcomplicated. But these historical thrillers (the first, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1909269107/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1\" title=\"\">Elephant Moon</a></em>, was set in Burma during the second world war) I think I can do. I\u2019m just finally doing that<strong> </strong>thing of writing exactly the books I would love to read.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Useful Idiot</em> was written partly as therapy during the extremely stressful months in which Sweeney came to the end of his 17-year career at the BBC. The final act of that long and often volatile association had been a well-publicised series of clashes with the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>Sweeney had made an investigative film for <em>Panorama </em>about Robinson, exposing his links to far-right extremists in Germany. But the film \u2013 which went through 45 revised scripts \u2013 was never broadcast after Sweeney himself was secretly filmed, after far too many drinks, trying to persuade an associate of Robinson\u2019s to speak to him on camera. Along the way in that video, circulated online, he was heard suggesting that \u201cthe BBC was a stupid and irritating organisation\u201d and that he shared with Robinson heritage as an \u201cIrish scumbag\u201d.</p> <p>An online hate mob of Robinson supporters came after Sweeney and hundreds of them protested outside the BBC\u2019s Salford offices about his proposed <em>Panorama </em>film. The corporation felt it had no choice but to publicly apologise for the remarks Sweeney had made, which had been \u201coffensive and inappropriate\u201d. He was put on gardening leave before an eventual parting of the ways. In a parting shot to Robinson, Sweeney took to Twitter to say: \u201c\u2026 I can finally say these are not the views of the BBC, but he\u2019s a complete c**t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbb24b59b371af91772026ea0dd7f6c028ce1b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb24b59b371af91772026ea0dd7f6c028ce1b8c/0_318_4497_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambusing Vladimir Putin in Yakutsk, Russia in 2014 over the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambushing Vladimir Putin in Yakutsk, Russia in 2014 over the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By his own admission, Sweeney had something of a breakdown during that period. His second marriage had not long ended and he had recently lost his mother. He wasn\u2019t sleeping and was getting paranoid about the abuse. \u201cI would wake up at three in the morning and all this stuff was going round in my head. I have been threatened lots of times. But in Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan, you have a helmet, a flak jacket, perhaps a security officer. Suddenly the dangerous place is just outside your own front door. I\u2019m cycling around London and people are shouting: \u2018Fuck off Sweeney! Tommy Robinson owns you!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He went to see a psychiatrist about PTSD. The psychiatrist asked him if there were any events he had witnessed that might have triggered his anxiety. He started to tell him about a career that had taken in just about every conflict zone in the world. He talked about the genocidal Hutu and Tutsi killings in Burundi and was still describing things he had seen in Bosnia in the 1990s when the psychiatrist had to intervene to tell him that the session was nearly up. In the end he worked out a rest cure for himself. He and his ex-wife had bought an attic flat in Umbria a decade ago. \u201cI fucked off to Italy and Italy cured me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThough it is true that certain wine bar owners in Perugia\u2019s old town, when they see me, their faces do light up.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney now lives just south of the river with his dog, Bertie. His two kids are in their 20s and 30s. In the months since he left the BBC he has begun the research for a podcast series investigating the killing of his friend Paul Jenks, the British photographer who was shot by a sniper while working in Osijek in Croatia in 1992. He has started on the next novel as well as a memoir and remains involved with campaigning for justice for the murdered Maltese journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/new-claims-emerge-about-daphne-caruana-galizia-plan\" title=\"\">Daphne Caruana Galizia</a>, about whom he co-wrote another book.</p> <p>I wonder where, looking back, he thinks he gets his restless sense of injustice from, his need to go after the baddies. In reply he talks first about his parents, whose photos are on the wall above where we are sitting. His dad left school at 14 to be an apprentice at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. In 1943 he was a third engineer in the merchant navy during the battle of the Atlantic. \u201cHe was a very funny man,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cHe used to do an impression in the pub of how it felt when a depth charge went off when you were in the engine room and the whole world shaking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8320a5579ea891d8a5608a47da1b68019e52fe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8320a5579ea891d8a5608a47da1b68019e52fe7/0_145_1490_894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A frank exchange of words with Tommy Robinson during filming for Panorama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A frank exchange of words with Tommy Robinson during filming for Panorama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mum was originally a scouser too. \u201cThey spent their whole lives either laughing or throwing verbal hand grenades at each other.

This dates back to 1992 when he was in a hotel bar in Dubrovnik and the city was under siege. The hotel was being shelled. Sweeney used his voice projection to address the bar: \u201cWe are all going to die, champagne is on the <em>Observer</em>.\u201d Fortunately for the assembled hacks \u2013 but unfortunately for Sweeney\u2019s expense account \u2013 the hotel was spared. Five months later, when the siege ended and the hotel reopened, he received a bill by post for \u00a3983.</p> <p>He set out as a teenager wanting to be a lawyer, but having gone along to trials could never imagine himself defending anyone he believed to be guilty. Journalism did not require that. He got his first break when doing shifts on the <em>Sheffield Telegraph</em>. He\u2019d gone away to visit a friend who was backpacking in India, and on the trip managed to talk his way into an interview with the Dalai Lama. He thought he better dress up like Sir Robin Day for the occasion. The interview began with the Dalai Lama asking Sweeney why he was wearing a bow tie but no socks. It made a centre spread.

      "bodyText": "The Derek and Joy Sander College of Drama and Elocution has a lot to answer for. When he was 10 years old, John Sweeney\u2019s family moved from Manchester down to Hampshire, and at his new school Sweeney was teased and bullied for his northern vowels. His worried mum sent him to elocution classes in Southampton to help him fit in. The drama college did not change his accent much \u2013 Sweeney was cast in plays as the flat-capped northerner \u2013 but it did an expert job in teaching him to project his voice. That voice has been a primary weapon in Sweeney\u2019s one-man tour of duty as a reporter over 40 years, not so much speaking truth to power as, on occasion, yelling it. It was most notoriously employed against the official spokesman of the Church of Scientology in 2007; a clip of Sweeney (who apologised for \u201closing it\u201d on assignment for the BBC\u2019s Panorama) has been viewed several million times. It has also been consistently raised against tyrants and terrorists and gangsters (Sweeney, who retains a schoolboy sense of right and wrong, still likes to call them \u201cbaddies\u201d). Its finest hour was when Sweeney spoke out, after a four-year investigation, about the evidence given by specialist witness Sir Roy Meadow in a series of cot-death trials. His stubborn work was crucial in helping to free three women falsely convicted for murdering their babies from Britain\u2019s jails in 2003 and save several others from prison. I first heard Sweeney\u2019s inimitable foghorn nearly 30 years ago in the Observer newsroom or, just as often, in the Coach and Horses pub next door, invariably telling stories of the places from which he had recently returned and just about lived to tell the tale. For a few of Sweeney\u2019s dozen years at this paper, I was his editor, taking in copy from his surrealist road trips through civil wars in Algeria and Bosnia and Burundi, heartfelt gonzo stories which dramatised the troubles of the world with himself at centre stage. When I knocked on his door in south London last week, I hadn\u2019t seen him for a few years, but he is one of those people with whom you just pick up in mid-sentence. He\u2019d invited me over to talk about his new book, The Useful Idiot, a novel set in Stalinist Moscow in 1932, as well as what he calls his \u201clatest troubles with the Beeb\u201d. In Sweeney\u2019s rumpled sitting room, bike in the doorway, books everywhere, photos on the walls cheerfully askew, we talk first about Gareth Jones, the hero of his novel, someone whose real-life story I\u2019d never heard. Jones was the junior foreign correspondent of the Western Mail in the 1930s, born in Barry. Having been posted to Russia in his 20s, he became the first journalist to tell the story of mass starvation in Stalin\u2019s regime, at a time when the rest of the world was hearing Soviet fake news. Sweeney\u2019s dramatic reconstruction of these events does not aspire to great subtlety, but the story of Jones, a man after the author\u2019s heart, is an enthralling one. (And the inspiration for a film released this week called Mr Jones, starring James Norton.) \u201cFor me, writing novels is like learning to be a brickie,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cMy first two thrillers were overcomplicated. But these historical thrillers (the first, Elephant Moon, was set in Burma during the second world war) I think I can do. I\u2019m just finally doing that thing of writing exactly the books I would love to read.\u201d The Useful Idiot was written partly as therapy during the extremely stressful months in which Sweeney came to the end of his 17-year career at the BBC. The final act of that long and often volatile association had been a well-publicised series of clashes with the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson. Sweeney had made an investigative film for Panorama about Robinson, exposing his links to far-right extremists in Germany. But the film \u2013 which went through 45 revised scripts \u2013 was never broadcast after Sweeney himself was secretly filmed, after far too many drinks, trying to persuade an associate of Robinson\u2019s to speak to him on camera. Along the way in that video, circulated online, he was heard suggesting that \u201cthe BBC was a stupid and irritating organisation\u201d and that he shared with Robinson heritage as an \u201cIrish scumbag\u201d. An online hate mob of Robinson supporters came after Sweeney and hundreds of them protested outside the BBC\u2019s Salford offices about his proposed Panorama film. The corporation felt it had no choice but to publicly apologise for the remarks Sweeney had made, which had been \u201coffensive and inappropriate\u201d. He was put on gardening leave before an eventual parting of the ways. In a parting shot to Robinson, Sweeney took to Twitter to say: \u201c\u2026 I can finally say these are not the views of the BBC, but he\u2019s a complete c**t.\u201d By his own admission, Sweeney had something of a breakdown during that period. His second marriage had not long ended and he had recently lost his mother. He wasn\u2019t sleeping and was getting paranoid about the abuse. \u201cI would wake up at three in the morning and all this stuff was going round in my head. I have been threatened lots of times. But in Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan, you have a helmet, a flak jacket, perhaps a security officer. Suddenly the dangerous place is just outside your own front door. I\u2019m cycling around London and people are shouting: \u2018Fuck off Sweeney! Tommy Robinson owns you!\u2019\u201d He went to see a psychiatrist about PTSD. The psychiatrist asked him if there were any events he had witnessed that might have triggered his anxiety. He started to tell him about a career that had taken in just about every conflict zone in the world. He talked about the genocidal Hutu and Tutsi killings in Burundi and was still describing things he had seen in Bosnia in the 1990s when the psychiatrist had to intervene to tell him that the session was nearly up. In the end he worked out a rest cure for himself. He and his ex-wife had bought an attic flat in Umbria a decade ago. \u201cI fucked off to Italy and Italy cured me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThough it is true that certain wine bar owners in Perugia\u2019s old town, when they see me, their faces do light up.\u201d Sweeney now lives just south of the river with his dog, Bertie. His two kids are in their 20s and 30s. In the months since he left the BBC he has begun the research for a podcast series investigating the killing of his friend Paul Jenks, the British photographer who was shot by a sniper while working in Osijek in Croatia in 1992. He has started on the next novel as well as a memoir and remains involved with campaigning for justice for the murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, about whom he co-wrote another book. I wonder where, looking back, he thinks he gets his restless sense of injustice from, his need to go after the baddies. In reply he talks first about his parents, whose photos are on the wall above where we are sitting. His dad left school at 14 to be an apprentice at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. In 1943 he was a third engineer in the merchant navy during the battle of the Atlantic. \u201cHe was a very funny man,\u201d Sweeney says. \u201cHe used to do an impression in the pub of how it felt when a depth charge went off when you were in the engine room and the whole world shaking.\u201d His mum was originally a scouser too. \u201cThey spent their whole lives either laughing or throwing verbal hand grenades at each other. Which was great. I think they both had a very big sense of social justice and fairness and honesty, and I liked that. For example, I would never, ever fiddle my expenses,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThough I\u2019ll admit they have been substantial on occasion.\u201d I remind Sweeney that one of his lasting legacies at the Observer has been a more parsimonious approach to spending.

No sooner was the name of convicted mobster Felix Sater \u2013 a former business partner of Trump\u2019s \u2013 out of Sweeney\u2019s mouth than Trump shook his hand and concluded their interview. Sweeney\u2019s proudest moment in this regard was his ambush of Vladimir Putin. He was making a film about the shooting down of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, generally believed to be the work of Russian military in Ukraine \u2013 an allegation the Kremlin denied. His producer had realised Putin was due to open a new woolly mammoth museum in Yakutsk, Siberia and they thought they might confront the president there. Sweeney arrived in Yakutsk straight from a long and bibulous night at his niece\u2019s wedding, hungover and jet-lagged. \u201cMy beard was quite full, and we reckoned I could pass quite easily as a professor of mammothology,\u201d he recalls. He lined up with all the other museum curators, who had formed a guard of honour for the president. As Putin came up the steps, Sweeney greeted him with the words: \u201cTell me about the killings in Ukraine, Mr Putin.\u201d Putin, startled, stopped to give his version of events. When Sweeney tried to ask a follow-up question, \u201ca wall of Kremlin muscle closes around me and I am marched off down to the basement where I\u2019m locked in\u201d.

Once the final sunny moments of autumn have gone, I\u2019m bounced along by preparations for the festive season. Even after the final New Year corks have popped, my own reforming zeal gets me through. I may not be tempted by dry Januaries, diets and punishing exercise regimes, but I\u2019m always a sucker for a fresh start, for plans drawn up on new stationery and commitments made to improve myself.</p> <p>But by early February, I\u2019m sagging. Tired, hungry and sick of the dark, my motivation has run out, my bank account is empty and the world feels soggy underfoot. I start to skip my yoga class and social invitations feel like an imposition. The urge to pull the duvet over my head becomes very strong indeed.</p> <p>Humans cannot actually hibernate, but in the coldest months of the year, many of us are drawn to something similar. We want to batten down the hatches against the treacherous weather outside, preserve our energies, lay on fat. If only we could suspend the demands of life, just until the sun comes out again, all would be well.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Winter has patience. After all there is nowhere else to be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is it such a bad thing, this desire to hibernate until spring? After all, it feels like a natural response: winter simply demands that we slow down rather than drop out altogether \u2013 why can\u2019t we find a way to do this?</p> <p>I recently visited hibernating dormice at <a href=\"https://kent.wildwoodtrust.org/\" title=\"\">Wildwood</a><a href=\"https://kent.wildwoodtrust.org/\" title=\"\"> Trust</a> just outside Canterbury. Dormice are one of only three UK mammals to hibernate (alongside hedgehogs and bats) and they do so for half of each year, retreating to their nests with the first frosts in October or November, and only emerging when food is abundant again in April or May. In late summer they gorge on fruit, storing the energy as easily accessible liquid fat just beneath the skin. As I learned when I held one \u2013 a perfect ball of amber fur rolling in my palm like a marble \u2013 you can leave fingerprints in a sleeping dormouse.</p> <p>To get through this long period without food, a dormouse will slow down its metabolism to the extent that it consumes almost no energy at all, waking briefly every 10 days to keep its organs in working order. We humans, having a few more worldly commitments and physical limitations than your average dormouse, are unable to do the same, but we can allow winter to modify the rhythms of our lives.</p> <p><em><strong>Everything about me</strong></em> changes in winter \u2013 and I let it happen. Winter is a time to enjoy the pleasures of solitude, to dream and contemplate. It opens up a space in which I can mass my energies, to restore and repair. I want to eat cooked food instead of raw, comforting carbs over fresh flavours. I want to revisit beloved old films and spend time pottering in the company of the radio. Gone are the splashy novels of summer; winter urges me towards thoughtful, ambulatory reading, chewed over in lamplight. In winter, I can spend hours in silent pursuit of a half-understood concept, or a detail of history. Winter has patience. There is nowhere else to be, after all.</p> <p>While summer often wakes me at 4am with dawn, in winter I can sleep for hours, surrendering to my bed shortly after 9pm, and drowsing there until my morning alarm. Our recent ancestors would have known this pattern well; after all, electric light has only been with us for just over a century. Before that the winter nights were very long indeed.</p> <p>Sleepy as I am in winter, I find that I rarely slumber right through. Instead, I often wake in the middle of the night and spend an hour or two mulling over my thoughts, sometimes getting up to read, write or meditate, before returning to my bed to sleep until morning. I used to worry over these moments, considering them to be insomnia, but A Roger Ekirch\u2019s book, <em>At Day\u2019s Close: a History of Nighttime</em>, convinced me otherwise. Waking in the midst of a long winter night is, he argues, a form of sleep that would have been entirely normal before light was at our command. Nights were divided into a first and second sleep, with a \u201cwatch\u201d in between, during which people would pray, reflect, make love or indulge in quiet conversation with family. It was an intimate time, so private and mundane that it barely merited a mention.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Nordic countries they stock the freezer with cakes over winter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A 1996 study by Thomas Wehr and colleagues suggests that we could fall back into this pattern given the right conditions. Wehr deprived his subjects of artificial light for 14 hours at a time in an attempt to replicate the prehistoric night. After several weeks, the participants fell into a routine of lying awake in bed for two hours before falling asleep for around four hours. They would then wake up and enjoy two or three hours of time that was characterised as contemplative and restful, and then take another four hours of sleep until morning. Most interesting of all, Wehr observed that the midnight watch was far from an anxious time for his subjects. They felt calm and reflective in these moments, and Wehr found that they had elevated levels of prolactin in their blood, a hormone more usually found in nursing mothers. It usually stimulates milk production, but in this context it seems to produce feelings of contentment and calmness. Wehr suggested that the watch was a unique state of consciousness with an \u201cendocrinology all of its own\u201d. Waking during this natural break in sleep seems to release a cocktail of hormones that isn\u2019t found at any other point in our existence.</p> <p>Is this, then, our human version of hibernation: a thoughtful mode of being that\u2019s profoundly restorative, brought about by the conditions of winter? Perhaps, but I prefer to see hibernation as a useful analogy rather than a biological imperative \u2013 after all, winter only comes to populations who live far from the equator; wintering is not a universal human experience.</p> <p>We also need to understand the healthy limits of our urge to hide away in winter. In regions where solitude is forced upon communities through impenetrable weather, careful preparations are made to ensure that life remains stimulating and joyful during the dark months. Hygge may have been a lifestyle trend in the UK, but closer to the Arctic Circle, those cosy candles and comfort foods are tools of self-preservation. In Nordic countries, it\u2019s common to stock the freezer with cakes and pastries over winter, ready to offer hospitality to anyone who comes to the door. </p> <p>The sauna is one of the ways that Finnish people battle against the cold. It is a place of refuge and a place that brings a sense of conviviality during periods of isolation. Chosen or not, our periods of hibernation need to be punctuated with moments of social contact, or else we unravel.</p> <p><em><strong>I\u2019ve learned to find</strong></em> my own way through winter though. I also seek moments of light and heat to keep my spirits high. In recent years, I\u2019ve developed the (admittedly slightly eccentric) habit of retrieving discarded Christmas trees and squirrelling them in my back garden to light a series of spectacular, resinous bonfires on the darkest nights.</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned to seek out some of the older winter festivals, too, which mark the beats of the season until the coming of spring. In January I attend one of Kent\u2019s growing number of wassails, a half-pagan, half-Christian ceremony in which an apple tree is fed a tribute of cider to encourage a good harvest later in the year. And I pause on 1 February to mark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/04/wenlock-edge-shropshire-february-fair-maids\" title=\"\">Imbolc</a>, the Gaelic festival that marks the start of spring, when the ewes are pregnant and the first snowdrops are appearing.</p> <p>Perhaps we can actually learn more from badgers and frogs than we can from dormice. Instead of hibernating, they fall into states of torpor for short periods of time when food is scarce. It seems to me that this is a model that works for our own winters, conserving our energies by avoiding the worst ravages of the cold rather than dropping out of life altogether.</p> <p><em>Wintering: How I Learned to Flourish When Life Became Frozen by Katherine May is published by Rider at \u00a314.99.

We also need to understand the healthy limits of our urge to hide away in winter. In regions where solitude is forced upon communities through impenetrable weather, careful preparations are made to ensure that life remains stimulating and joyful during the dark months. Hygge may have been a lifestyle trend in the UK, but closer to the Arctic Circle, those cosy candles and comfort foods are tools of self-preservation. In Nordic countries, it\u2019s common to stock the freezer with cakes and pastries over winter, ready to offer hospitality to anyone who comes to the door. The sauna is one of the ways that Finnish people battle against the cold. It is a place of refuge and a place that brings a sense of conviviality during periods of isolation. Chosen or not, our periods of hibernation need to be punctuated with moments of social contact, or else we unravel. I\u2019ve learned to find my own way through winter though. I also seek moments of light and heat to keep my spirits high. In recent years, I\u2019ve developed the (admittedly slightly eccentric) habit of retrieving discarded Christmas trees and squirrelling them in my back garden to light a series of spectacular, resinous bonfires on the darkest nights. I\u2019ve learned to seek out some of the older winter festivals, too, which mark the beats of the season until the coming of spring. In January I attend one of Kent\u2019s growing number of wassails, a half-pagan, half-Christian ceremony in which an apple tree is fed a tribute of cider to encourage a good harvest later in the year. And I pause on 1 February to mark Imbolc, the Gaelic festival that marks the start of spring, when the ewes are pregnant and the first snowdrops are appearing. Perhaps we can actually learn more from badgers and frogs than we can from dormice. Instead of hibernating, they fall into states of torpor for short periods of time when food is scarce. It seems to me that this is a model that works for our own winters, conserving our energies by avoiding the worst ravages of the cold rather than dropping out of life altogether.

Hammers United, an increasingly prominent fan group, organised a static protest in the Olympic Park before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/west-ham-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s 1-1 home draw with Everton</a> and further demonstrations are planned for the trip to Liverpool on 24 February and the visit from Southampton on 29 February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dbdffa1e7744263e32d08b948182f40954c86b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dbdffa1e7744263e32d08b948182f40954c86b3/0_131_4143_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Gold, Karren Brady and David Sullivan outside the unpopular London Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Gold, Karren Brady and David Sullivan outside the unpopular London Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony O\u2019Brien/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In West Ham\u2019s defence any protest inside the stadium recalls the disorder that marred their home defeat by Burnley in March 2018. As the Gold and Sullivan ownership enters its second decade, however, dissent is rising and the London club is on the ropes on and off the pitch. This past week the 83-year-old Gold spoke about growing up in poverty opposite the club\u2019s former home at Upton Park and denied there are plans to sell up, despite rumours of interest in a club thought to be valued at \u00a3500m at least. Sullivan, meanwhile, has spoken about leaving his sons, Jack and Dave Jr, in charge when he retires.</p> <p>Gold, always good at the sentimental side, added that he has never taken a salary from West Ham. There is, however, the interest Sullivan and Gold charge on the loans they made to the club in January 2010. West Ham\u2019s latest accounts show the pair were paid a combined \u00a32.9m in interest in August 2019 and that a further \u00a31m went to GGI International, a company related to Gold. As of 31 May 2019 the combined balance of unsecured loans advanced by Sullivan and Gold amounted to \u00a345m. As for Brady, her salary rose to \u00a31.136m.</p> <p>Supporters fail to see the justification for Brady\u2019s level of pay and the discontent has unnerved Sullivan, who was considering staying away from Sundays now-postponed match against Manchester City. While Gold lacks clout, Sullivan holds the power; and the recent negative coverage has taken a heavy toll on the club\u2019s majority shareholder. The 71-year-old is hurting. He went on holiday after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/01/west-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">last weekend\u2019s 3-3 draw with Brighton</a>, a result that left West Ham in the bottom three of the Premier League.</p> <p>Sullivan thought the \u201chigh-calibre appointment\u201d of Manuel Pellegrini on a three-year contract worth \u00a37m a year in the summer of 2018 would lift West Ham to the next level. But while the former Manchester City manager finished 10th last year, cracks appeared this season. Pellegrini was not regarded as a motivator by his players and the Chilean\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/28/west-ham-sack-manuel-pellegrini-as-manager-following-slump-in-form-football\" title=\"\">dismissal at the end of December</a> was followed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/west-ham-david-moyes-manuel-pellegrini\" title=\"\">appointment of David Moyes</a>, who returned 19 months after Sullivan decided he was not good enough.</p> <p>Relegation would lead to \u201cserious financial consequences\u201d, according to accounts revealing a pre-tax \u00a328.8m loss in the last financial year. That was attributed to expenditure on wages, transfers and training facilities. The club points to a \u00a3214.4m net spend on signings in the last four years.</p> <p>But while West Ham have broken their transfer record in each of the past four summers, the challenge is to spend wisely. The \u00a345m forward S\u00e9bastien Haller has struggled this season and what those accounts show is that West Ham, who aim to solve the London Stadium\u2019s structural issues by squaring off the stands behind the goal and bringing them closer to the pitch in the summer, are not making enough in player sales.</p> <p>They are not regarded as a progressive club when it comes to recruitment and, while people who have worked for Sullivan believe he wants the best for West Ham, some do not think he has a coherent vision for the future. One former executive describes him as an expert at Championship level, before adding that Sullivan is too old school to succeed in the Premier League.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"433ce579281fc0287ff6b1d3cc1a29ef82db202b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433ce579281fc0287ff6b1d3cc1a29ef82db202b/0_180_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Moyes faces a struggle to keep West Ham in the Premier League\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Moyes faces a struggle to keep West Ham in the Premier League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Stephen/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sullivan loves being involved in the search for players. But in February 2018, shortly after Tony Henry was fired as head of recruitment after making inappropriate comments about African players, Sullivan stepped back. He said there would be a bigger focus on analytics and that a director of football would be appointed.</p> <p>Yet while Sullivan wanted to lure the Spaniard Eduardo Maci\u00e0 away from Leicester, Pellegrini wanted the Argentinian Mario Husillos. An upside-down situation unfolded, in which the manager brought in his own director of football. Sullivan remained involved and lost faith in Husillos after the free transfer of the error-prone Spanish goalkeeper Roberto. Other dud signings include Jack Wilshere, who is out until May after a hernia operation, and Carlos S\u00e1nchez, who earns \u00a365,000 a week and has started three league games since his move in the summer of 2018.</p> <p>The scouting department was stripped back when Husillos and Pellegrini left. Sullivan was active during the January transfer window, with favoured agents helping out, and Moyes has spoken about the need for the club to target younger players. In fairness West Ham ended the window well, strengthening their midfield with the capture of Tomas Soucek on an initial loan and adding energy to their attack with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/31/west-ham-united-jarrod-bowen-hull-city-transfer-window-january\" title=\"\">the \u00a322m signing of Jarrod Bowen</a> from Hull.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>But structural improvements are required. It remains to be seen whether Sullivan appoints another director of football in the summer and the club have rejected claims that the training facilities are in a poor state. West Ham point out that \u00a310m has been spent on the Rush Green and Chadwell Heath sites. Yet Leicester City, third in the league, are spending \u00a3100m on their new training ground.</p> <p>For all that Brady trumpets the success of the move to Stratford, supporters doubt her regard for West Ham\u2019s heritage and do not feel she wants to listen to their concerns. The official supporters\u2019 board is derided by fans, who view it as an impediment to dissent. Hammers United and the West Ham United Independent Supporters\u2019 Association have refused to join the OSB at a meeting with Brady and Sullivan scheduled for 25 February.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/04/west-ham-ban-fan-for-wearing-anti-board-t-shirt-at-pitchside\">West Ham ban fan for wearing anti-board T-shirt at pitchside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brady has long been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/13/karren-brady-pressure-drop-sun-column-malcontents-west-ham\" title=\"\">urged from within the club</a> to give up her controversial <em>Sun</em> column but she will not budge, even though comments in it about Leicester\u2019s then owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, are said to have cost West Ham the chance to sign Islam Slimani two years ago. Brady has also called critics of the London Stadium \u201cmalcontents and keyboard warriors\u201d, said the signing of Robert Snodgrass \u201cwasn\u2019t exactly a triumph\u201d, taken aim at former West Ham players, questioned the character of players at other clubs and even raised doubts about Aston Villa\u2019s signings last summer. None of this improves West Ham\u2019s image or their relations with other clubs. It is a classless way to behave but even Sullivan, who is no stranger to unhelpful public statements, cannot stop Brady writing it.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brady-Sullivan dynamic is a problem,\u201d one source says, describing two headstrong figures struggling to work alongside each other constructively.</p> <p>It is a mess and the anger has been building ever since West Ham became anchor tenants at the London Stadium on an annual rent of \u00a32.5m. \u201cSold a dream and given a nightmare,\u201d is the common complaint from supporters and at this point it looks as if Sullivan was wrong when he said in December 2017 that the move would not \u201cchange our lives\u201d. West Ham are closer to the Championship than the Champions League and that is why the protests are going to get only louder.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When West Ham write to one of their season-ticket holders to tell him that his recent pitch-side protest against David Gold, David Sullivan and Karren Brady contained provocative messaging that was \u201cdeliberately intended to incite\u201d his fellow supporters, one retort is that nobody has done more to inflame tensions at the London Stadium than the unpopular trio in the boardroom. After all it is not Cameron Robson\u2019s fault that West Ham are nowhere near realising the ambition Brady outlined three years before the move from Upton Park to a soulless bowl in 2016. The vice-chair\u2019s vision was \u201ca world-class stadium with a world-class team\u201d and it is not an exaggeration to say that West Ham have failed woefully on both counts, bearing in mind the only reason supporters might struggle to assess their team\u2019s third relegation battle in four seasons is because the view in Stratford is ruined by the running track surrounding the London Stadium pitch. Robson\u2019s offence was comparatively small fry, unveiling an anti-board T-shirt while volunteering as a flag bearer before last month\u2019s home defeat by Liverpool, and the 23-year-old\u2019s subsequent ban from West Ham\u2019s games for the rest of the season has riled a disenchanted fanbase. It is another bad PR move from a club already at odds with the media and the problem for Gold, Sullivan and Brady is that Robson\u2019s supposedly provocative message \u2013 \u201cGSB Out\u201d \u2013 is cutting through. Hammers United, an increasingly prominent fan group, organised a static protest in the Olympic Park before last month\u2019s 1-1 home draw with Everton and further demonstrations are planned for the trip to Liverpool on 24 February and the visit from Southampton on 29 February. In West Ham\u2019s defence any protest inside the stadium recalls the disorder that marred their home defeat by Burnley in March 2018. As the Gold and Sullivan ownership enters its second decade, however, dissent is rising and the London club is on the ropes on and off the pitch. This past week the 83-year-old Gold spoke about growing up in poverty opposite the club\u2019s former home at Upton Park and denied there are plans to sell up, despite rumours of interest in a club thought to be valued at \u00a3500m at least. Sullivan, meanwhile, has spoken about leaving his sons, Jack and Dave Jr, in charge when he retires. Gold, always good at the sentimental side, added that he has never taken a salary from West Ham. There is, however, the interest Sullivan and Gold charge on the loans they made to the club in January 2010. West Ham\u2019s latest accounts show the pair were paid a combined \u00a32.9m in interest in August 2019 and that a further \u00a31m went to GGI International, a company related to Gold. As of 31 May 2019 the combined balance of unsecured loans advanced by Sullivan and Gold amounted to \u00a345m. As for Brady, her salary rose to \u00a31.136m. Supporters fail to see the justification for Brady\u2019s level of pay and the discontent has unnerved Sullivan, who was considering staying away from Sundays now-postponed match against Manchester City. While Gold lacks clout, Sullivan holds the power; and the recent negative coverage has taken a heavy toll on the club\u2019s majority shareholder. The 71-year-old is hurting. He went on holiday after last weekend\u2019s 3-3 draw with Brighton, a result that left West Ham in the bottom three of the Premier League. Sullivan thought the \u201chigh-calibre appointment\u201d of Manuel Pellegrini on a three-year contract worth \u00a37m a year in the summer of 2018 would lift West Ham to the next level. But while the former Manchester City manager finished 10th last year, cracks appeared this season. Pellegrini was not regarded as a motivator by his players and the Chilean\u2019s dismissal at the end of December was followed by the appointment of David Moyes, who returned 19 months after Sullivan decided he was not good enough. Relegation would lead to \u201cserious financial consequences\u201d, according to accounts revealing a pre-tax \u00a328.8m loss in the last financial year. That was attributed to expenditure on wages, transfers and training facilities. The club points to a \u00a3214.4m net spend on signings in the last four years. But while West Ham have broken their transfer record in each of the past four summers, the challenge is to spend wisely. The \u00a345m forward S\u00e9bastien Haller has struggled this season and what those accounts show is that West Ham, who aim to solve the London Stadium\u2019s structural issues by squaring off the stands behind the goal and bringing them closer to the pitch in the summer, are not making enough in player sales. They are not regarded as a progressive club when it comes to recruitment and, while people who have worked for Sullivan believe he wants the best for West Ham, some do not think he has a coherent vision for the future. One former executive describes him as an expert at Championship level, before adding that Sullivan is too old school to succeed in the Premier League. Sullivan loves being involved in the search for players. But in February 2018, shortly after Tony Henry was fired as head of recruitment after making inappropriate comments about African players, Sullivan stepped back. He said there would be a bigger focus on analytics and that a director of football would be appointed. Yet while Sullivan wanted to lure the Spaniard Eduardo Maci\u00e0 away from Leicester, Pellegrini wanted the Argentinian Mario Husillos. An upside-down situation unfolded, in which the manager brought in his own director of football. Sullivan remained involved and lost faith in Husillos after the free transfer of the error-prone Spanish goalkeeper Roberto. Other dud signings include Jack Wilshere, who is out until May after a hernia operation, and Carlos S\u00e1nchez, who earns \u00a365,000 a week and has started three league games since his move in the summer of 2018. The scouting department was stripped back when Husillos and Pellegrini left. Sullivan was active during the January transfer window, with favoured agents helping out, and Moyes has spoken about the need for the club to target younger players. In fairness West Ham ended the window well, strengthening their midfield with the capture of Tomas Soucek on an initial loan and adding energy to their attack with the \u00a322m signing of Jarrod Bowen from Hull. But structural improvements are required. It remains to be seen whether Sullivan appoints another director of football in the summer and the club have rejected claims that the training facilities are in a poor state. West Ham point out that \u00a310m has been spent on the Rush Green and Chadwell Heath sites. Yet Leicester City, third in the league, are spending \u00a3100m on their new training ground. For all that Brady trumpets the success of the move to Stratford, supporters doubt her regard for West Ham\u2019s heritage and do not feel she wants to listen to their concerns. The official supporters\u2019 board is derided by fans, who view it as an impediment to dissent. Hammers United and the West Ham United Independent Supporters\u2019 Association have refused to join the OSB at a meeting with Brady and Sullivan scheduled for 25 February. Brady has long been urged from within the club to give up her controversial Sun column but she will not budge, even though comments in it about Leicester\u2019s then owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, are said to have cost West Ham the chance to sign Islam Slimani two years ago. Brady has also called critics of the London Stadium \u201cmalcontents and keyboard warriors\u201d, said the signing of Robert Snodgrass \u201cwasn\u2019t exactly a triumph\u201d, taken aim at former West Ham players, questioned the character of players at other clubs and even raised doubts about Aston Villa\u2019s signings last summer. None of this improves West Ham\u2019s image or their relations with other clubs. It is a classless way to behave but even Sullivan, who is no stranger to unhelpful public statements, cannot stop Brady writing it. \u201cThe Brady-Sullivan dynamic is a problem,\u201d one source says, describing two headstrong figures struggling to work alongside each other constructively. It is a mess and the anger has been building ever since West Ham became anchor tenants at the London Stadium on an annual rent of \u00a32.5m. \u201cSold a dream and given a nightmare,\u201d is the common complaint from supporters and at this point it looks as if Sullivan was wrong when he said in December 2017 that the move would not \u201cchange our lives\u201d. West Ham are closer to the Championship than the Champions League and that is why the protests are going to get only louder.",

      "body": "<p>Logan Lewis had spent months building up to his first independent trip into town. The 13-year-old has a rare form of dwarfism which makes walking difficult and he relies on a customised mobility scooter. On the big day he and his friends awaited the early bus to take them from their remote Welsh village to Aberystwyth. Logan never got to town.</p> <p>\u201cThe bus driver refused to let him travel because he didn\u2019t want the scooter on his bus,\u201d said his mother, Perly Freeman. \u201cThe scooter is smaller than the average pram and while Logan was explaining that he is not confined to it and could park it in the wheelchair bay, the driver closed the doors in his face and drove off.\u201d</p> <p>Freeman discovered that the route operator, First Bus, has signed up to a voluntary code which requires mobility scooter users to undergo a training session to obtain a permit before they can board a bus. The website directs them to write to the company and an automated email response promises a reply within a fortnight. Four weeks later, Freeman had heard nothing.</p> <p>\u201cLogan\u2019s self-confidence that we have worked so hard to build up was massively knocked by the humiliation,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was full of self-loathing. He had a tracheostomy for his first eight years and needed 24-hour care and has only recently been able to find independence, so this trip was a massive thing for him.\u201d</p> <p>Logan\u2019s ordeal exposes the hurdles still faced by those with mobility aids when accessing public transport. Regulation and corporate policy changes have led to significant improvements in facilities and infrastructure over the last 10 years, but fragmented provision, poor training and unreformed attitudes can still leave passengers stranded.</p> <p>According to disability equality charity Scope, Logan\u2019s experience is dishearteningly common in the transport sector and the charity is campaigning for a passenger charter to clarify the rights of disabled passengers. \u201cWe know many disabled people continue to face barriers, outdated attitudes and difficulty getting hold of reliable information when they want to travel,\u201d said James Taylor, Scope\u2019s head of policy and campaigns. \u201cOur research has found one in three disabled people have been stopped from visiting certain places because of problems with public transport such as damage to mobility aids on planes, assistance failures on trains and unclear rules on whether wheelchairs users have priority over wheelchair spaces on buses.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, Logan fell victim to a rule devised to prevent him being left stranded. The Mobility Scooter Code of Conduct was drawn up in 2011 to standardise the acceptance of scooters on buses. Since 2017 all buses have to be accessible under the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, but there is no legal requirement for them to carry mobility scooters. This has left users unable to predict whether a driver will allow them to board.</p> <p>The code of conduct and a similar scheme operated by Transport for London allow for a permit guaranteeing access once the scooter has been deemed suitable and the owner shown how to board, park and disembark safely. Twenty-two bus operators have now signed up.</p> <p>The trouble is that scooter users may only discover the requirement once they have been denied boarding, then face a potential delay of weeks while they wait for a suitable training date and for the subsequent permit to be posted. Even Scope was unaware of the requirements until the <em>Observer</em> got in touch. \u201cThis family\u2019s experience is a clear demonstration that there is too much confusion around codes, regulations and how they are implemented,\u201d Taylor said.</p> <p>First Bus said drivers should allow scooters of suitable size and weight to board without a permit if there was room and explain the requirement for future journeys.</p> <p>The firm reacted swiftly when the <em>Observer </em>intervened. It allocated a dedicated bus and driver to assess Logan and his scooter, issued a permit on the spot and drove him home. \u201cAlthough this was very much an isolated incident, we\u2019ve launched an investigation to identify any internal opportunities to improve our processes. We have reminded drivers of the correct procedures to follow,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Logan would face a similar lottery on the rail network. From this year all trains must be accessible to wheelchairs, but not mobility scooters. While rail operators accept smaller models, some companies insist on permits, and some, including Heathrow Express, require them to be folded down.</p> <p>Wheelchair users can travel on the airport shuttle, but challenges may await them when they arrive at the terminal. The airport was criticised by the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority in 2017 for failing to treat disabled passengers with \u201cdignity and respect\u201d. Last year it improved its official rating to \u201cgood\u201d but it is still getting plenty of one-star reviews on the consumer website Trustpilot.</p> <p>Mark and Jane Dukes\u2019s (*) honeymoon began and ended in humiliation after a series of failures by airport staff. The newlyweds, both of whom rely on wheelchairs, had booked special assistance for their flight from Edinburgh to Vancouver via Heathrow. \u201cOn arrival at Heathrow we witnessed a heated argument between four members of staff about who was responsible for us. We had to beg them to take us to our terminal,\u201d said Jane. \u201cThe two who were delegated continued to argue and when my husband asked them to stop they switched to a different language and ignored us. They nearly tipped both of us out of our chairs as they took us off the transfer bus, then only one assistant was sent to take us to the plane, so we nearly missed the flight.\u201d</p> <p>On the Dukes\u2019s return from Vancouver the couple had to wait on board for an hour before Jane\u2019s wheelchair was found. Staff struggled to disembark them as they\u2019d been seated on a deck that did not accommodate the airline\u2019s wheeled aisle chair. They were abandoned in the terminal and by the time they found staff to convey them to their gate their connecting flight had departed. They had to wait five hours for another flight that could accommodate their wheelchairs. \u201cWe put a lot of work into the logistics of our trip given it was a special occasion and paid extra to travel business class, but we felt like baggage,\u201d said Jane.</p> <p>Heathrow apologised for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d experience, but it has refused to offer compensation. \u201cWe strive to accommodate the needs of all of our passengers, whilst treating them with courtesy and respect,\u201d it said. \u201cOur team has been in touch with the passengers to look into the circumstances of these journeys and necessary corrective action has been taken internally to address the issues raised.\u201d</p> <p>Disabled passengers generally face a far friendlier landscape than 10 years ago and the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-transport-strategy\" title=\"\">Inclusive Transport Strategy</a> wants to see equal access across the network by 2030 with overhauled infrastructure, information and staff training. Heathrow is this year re-tendering its subcontracted assistance service and investing \u00a330m in new facilities and training. Ironically, First Bus has been a leading advocate for disability access with workshops, school visits and travel-assistance cards specifying what help the holder requires. However, the experience of the Dukes and Logan show that a lack of empathy can be more of a barrier than dated rolling stock.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst experiences are caused by staff who don\u2019t know what to do, or make assumptions about disabled people and their abilities, or who simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s their job to help customers,\u201d says Keith Richards, chair of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee.</p> <p><em>* Names have been changed</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2020. The original said that mobility scooters were banned on Heathrow Express. This was based on information from the National Rail website, which has since been updated to confirm that fold-down scooters are accepted in the collapsed position. The article has been amended accordingly.</p>",

Regulation and corporate policy changes have led to significant improvements in facilities and infrastructure over the last 10 years, but fragmented provision, poor training and unreformed attitudes can still leave passengers stranded. According to disability equality charity Scope, Logan\u2019s experience is dishearteningly common in the transport sector and the charity is campaigning for a passenger charter to clarify the rights of disabled passengers. \u201cWe know many disabled people continue to face barriers, outdated attitudes and difficulty getting hold of reliable information when they want to travel,\u201d said James Taylor, Scope\u2019s head of policy and campaigns. \u201cOur research has found one in three disabled people have been stopped from visiting certain places because of problems with public transport such as damage to mobility aids on planes, assistance failures on trains and unclear rules on whether wheelchairs users have priority over wheelchair spaces on buses.\u201d Ironically, Logan fell victim to a rule devised to prevent him being left stranded. The Mobility Scooter Code of Conduct was drawn up in 2011 to standardise the acceptance of scooters on buses. Since 2017 all buses have to be accessible under the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, but there is no legal requirement for them to carry mobility scooters. This has left users unable to predict whether a driver will allow them to board. The code of conduct and a similar scheme operated by Transport for London allow for a permit guaranteeing access once the scooter has been deemed suitable and the owner shown how to board, park and disembark safely. Twenty-two bus operators have now signed up. The trouble is that scooter users may only discover the requirement once they have been denied boarding, then face a potential delay of weeks while they wait for a suitable training date and for the subsequent permit to be posted. Even Scope was unaware of the requirements until the Observer got in touch. \u201cThis family\u2019s experience is a clear demonstration that there is too much confusion around codes, regulations and how they are implemented,\u201d Taylor said. First Bus said drivers should allow scooters of suitable size and weight to board without a permit if there was room and explain the requirement for future journeys. The firm reacted swiftly when the Observer intervened. It allocated a dedicated bus and driver to assess Logan and his scooter, issued a permit on the spot and drove him home. \u201cAlthough this was very much an isolated incident, we\u2019ve launched an investigation to identify any internal opportunities to improve our processes. We have reminded drivers of the correct procedures to follow,\u201d it said. Logan would face a similar lottery on the rail network. From this year all trains must be accessible to wheelchairs, but not mobility scooters. While rail operators accept smaller models, some companies insist on permits, and some, including Heathrow Express, require them to be folded down. Wheelchair users can travel on the airport shuttle, but challenges may await them when they arrive at the terminal. The airport was criticised by the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority in 2017 for failing to treat disabled passengers with \u201cdignity and respect\u201d. Last year it improved its official rating to \u201cgood\u201d but it is still getting plenty of one-star reviews on the consumer website Trustpilot. Mark and Jane Dukes\u2019s (*) honeymoon began and ended in humiliation after a series of failures by airport staff. The newlyweds, both of whom rely on wheelchairs, had booked special assistance for their flight from Edinburgh to Vancouver via Heathrow. \u201cOn arrival at Heathrow we witnessed a heated argument between four members of staff about who was responsible for us. We had to beg them to take us to our terminal,\u201d said Jane. \u201cThe two who were delegated continued to argue and when my husband asked them to stop they switched to a different language and ignored us. They nearly tipped both of us out of our chairs as they took us off the transfer bus, then only one assistant was sent to take us to the plane, so we nearly missed the flight.\u201d On the Dukes\u2019s return from Vancouver the couple had to wait on board for an hour before Jane\u2019s wheelchair was found. Staff struggled to disembark them as they\u2019d been seated on a deck that did not accommodate the airline\u2019s wheeled aisle chair. They were abandoned in the terminal and by the time they found staff to convey them to their gate their connecting flight had departed. They had to wait five hours for another flight that could accommodate their wheelchairs. \u201cWe put a lot of work into the logistics of our trip given it was a special occasion and paid extra to travel business class, but we felt like baggage,\u201d said Jane. Heathrow apologised for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d experience, but it has refused to offer compensation. \u201cWe strive to accommodate the needs of all of our passengers, whilst treating them with courtesy and respect,\u201d it said. \u201cOur team has been in touch with the passengers to look into the circumstances of these journeys and necessary corrective action has been taken internally to address the issues raised.\u201d Disabled passengers generally face a far friendlier landscape than 10 years ago and the government\u2019s Inclusive Transport Strategy wants to see equal access across the network by 2030 with overhauled infrastructure, information and staff training. Heathrow is this year re-tendering its subcontracted assistance service and investing \u00a330m in new facilities and training. Ironically, First Bus has been a leading advocate for disability access with workshops, school visits and travel-assistance cards specifying what help the holder requires. However, the experience of the Dukes and Logan show that a lack of empathy can be more of a barrier than dated rolling stock. \u201cThe worst experiences are caused by staff who don\u2019t know what to do, or make assumptions about disabled people and their abilities, or who simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s their job to help customers,\u201d says Keith Richards, chair of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. * Names have been changed \u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2020. The original said that mobility scooters were banned on Heathrow Express. This was based on information from the National Rail website, which has since been updated to confirm that fold-down scooters are accepted in the collapsed position. The article has been amended accordingly.",

      "bodyText": "As both my father and uncle served in the navy, I take an interest in goings-on in the Senior Service. The news never seems anything other than of cutbacks and delays in the deployment of new ships. Last week was no exception, with a story headlined: \u201cNavy to axe half of office staff in boost to front line\u201d. I\u2019m all for getting desk wallahs to be more active, but half...? In the report, a spokesman was quoted as saying: \u201cWe could send them back to work on a ship, while their jobs could be done by either reducing the rank that it\u2019s done or we potentially civilianise them.\u201d I\u2019ve seen some grotesque words but that\u2019s off the scale. I wonder if the navy still flogs offenders round the fleet. If it doesn\u2019t, it should reinstate it swiftly, for that man surely deserves it. Mind you, there were a lot of voters in the Iowa caucus debacle causing similar offence by proudly brandishing posters saying: \u201cI\u2019m caucusing Bernie\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m caucusuing Joe\u201d. Not nice. It seems that even some US political pundits have trouble pronouncing Pete Buttigieg\u2019s surname. Many have resorted to the reasonable fallback position of calling him \u201cMayor Pete\u201d. Also last week, I was delighted to hear a fine sporting phrase that should certainly be added to the lexicon. Commentating on the Ireland and Scotland game (how did Stuart Hogg contrive to drop that ball?), an excitable commentator boldly proclaimed that \u201cScotland are playing on the edge of the envelope.\u201d Brilliant. I just hope someone will explain to me what that means. Lastly, a prediction. Just as \u201cprecarity\u201d has taken an unpleasant hold, I forecast that \u201cparticularity\u201d will soon follow in its clunking footsteps. \u2022 Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",

Imagine if the folks at the top followed that lead.</p> <p>A big win by the Southern Stars who put their lead-in to the February World Cup back on track with a vital win over England, setting up a final clash with India in the tri-series.</p> <p>Key first-round wins in the AFLW for Western Bulldogs and Collingwood, who showed far too much for St Kilda and West Coast, respectively. While in the A-League a much-needed win for the competition\u2019s bottom side, the Newcastle Jets, in the grudge match against local rivals, Central Coast.

      "bodyText": "So with apologies to AFLW fans from the West, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave Sportwatch this Sunday as a rain-reduced Guardian Australian office fights time and tide (literally) to bring you this coverage, amid power outages and internet drop outs. Wherever you are, around Australia and the world, stay safe. It\u2019s terrific to see these rains from a bushfire perspective, but gee, a little moderation wouldn\u2019t go astray. Speaking of the bushfires, a terrific commitment from the cricket community to raise a truckload of dollars for some organisations working very hard around Australia. It\u2019s been a devastating summer, but if there\u2019s one silver lining it\u2019s the reminder of community - and the power of people working together. Imagine if the folks at the top followed that lead. A big win by the Southern Stars who put their lead-in to the February World Cup back on track with a vital win over England, setting up a final clash with India in the tri-series. Key first-round wins in the AFLW for Western Bulldogs and Collingwood, who showed far too much for St Kilda and West Coast, respectively. While in the A-League a much-needed win for the competition\u2019s bottom side, the Newcastle Jets, in the grudge match against local rivals, Central Coast. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! And so ends the 49th F3 derby. Seven goals for those faithful who braved awful conditions up in the Hunter to cheer on their side. In fairness, the pitch held up pretty well given it hosted a Super Rugby game yesterday. They don\u2019t play boring games, these two sides. New coach Carl Robinson and his assistant Kenny Miller watching on will be under no illusions of the job ahead, given some of the calamitous defending his side offered up. Thankfully, their attack did better, and all in all they were good value for their three points, the Jets. They remain bottom of the table, courtesy that late Chris Harold goal, that keeps the Mariners in 10th thanks to goal difference. A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 4-3 Central Coast (Harold) 85 min: Oh my. That\u2019s a poor clearance from Jets \u2018keeper Italiano, who can only pick out sub and Mariners debutant Chris Harold. He chests down with aplomb before curling an effort into the top corner. Surely there can\u2019t be one last twist in this remarkable game of football? And if you missed the overnight result, some good news for Opals fans and Australian basketball in general. No surprises Liz Cambage was right in the mix of things: Tumultuous scenes to finish a very fun day for an even better cause. It\u2019s Dan Christian bowling to Nick Riewoldt, needing ten off the final ball - he finds the rope for four, but umpire Mel Jones has called Christian for chucking! He has to bowl one more - six to win it, but he can only get it down the field. They try to run four - but it finishes, just, in favour of Ponting\u2019s XI! Some great names, some great fun. Nice to see lots of smiles, and a stack of dollars raised for organisations working tirelessly throughout Australia\u2019s horror summer. Not the start to the new season the home side would have wanted as the Bulldogs finish in the manner they\u2019d started. A very dominant display, and there will be a few teams around the league looking at this performance, although no real surprises given their roster. Plenty for the Saints to work on for next weekend. A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 4-2 Central Coast (o.g. Kim) 55 min: It\u2019s raining from the heavens, and it\u2019s raining on the field - goals, that is. Another set piece, another fine delivery - this time from Bobby Burns. He looks for the head of Arroyo, but it\u2019s an unfortunate touch from the experienced Korean, Kim, who gets last touch. How unlucky that is, it flies past Birighitti! What a mad few minutes. A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 3-2 Central Coast (Petratos) 52 min: Wowee. It\u2019s all happening in the Hunter! Great persistence from Matt Millar who charges down a lost cause ball and finds a teammate centrally. O\u2019Donovan feeds Arroyo whose shot is blocked - but it\u2019s Petratos on the follow up, and it\u2019s another crisp, clean finish! It\u2019s all happening in Newcastle! A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 2-2 Central Coast (Clisby) 50 min: Oh my. Milan Duric with a terrific dead ball delivery to pick out Clisby at the far post - but he\u2019s completely unmarked the Mariners\u2019 fullback! He heads home - nothing Lewis Italiano can do about that. What\u2019s happened here? They were 2-0 nil up and cruising; it was almost three before Birghitti denied the returning Roy O\u2019Donovan; and all of a sudden - they could be right up against it, the home side. Groans from the home fans. They can\u2019t squander this; surely. Bushfire Cricket Bash: seventh over 4/72 (Symonds 19, Villani 2) Bold, this from Ponting who puts on the Australian coach - Justin Langer for a bowl. It\u2019s not gone too well - Andrew Symonds has sent him down the pitch for two massive sixes! He\u2019s seen enough, Langer - so he fakes a hammy injury and throws the ball to Nathan Lyons for the final delivery, which Villani reverse sweeps nicely; but there\u2019s a fielder there. Bushfire Cricket Bash: sixth over 4/58 (Symonds 5, Villani 2) Bing Lee knocks over Brad Hodge for a duck - a big swing but no ding for the silver-haired Victorian. Roy Symonds come out and takes hold of Luke Hodge - that goes for four. Ellyse Villani looks very comfortable at the other end, pushing and prodding. A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 2-1 Central Coast (Tongyik) 44 min: There\u2019s a lifeline! They\u2019ve taken one from the Jets\u2019 playbook now - it\u2019s the substitute Ruon Tongyik, on the pitch after injury to Rowles, who pops up on the end of a Jack Clisby corner - and he nods into an empty net! What\u2019s happened there, in the heart of the Jets\u2019 defence? An inquest follows. And have put together almost the perfect first half - a sucker punch; could that prove crucial for the visitors? Bushfire Cricket Bash: fourth over - 2/49 (Yuvraj 0, Hodge 0) Shane Watson gives Dan Cristian the medicine - so much for looking dusty, he\u2019s seeing it very well out there, Watto. He follows Brian Lara\u2019s lead and retires on 30* off about 9 deliveries. Very nice. And can you believe this! It\u2019s the Hawks legend Luke Hodge who trundles in - and he\u2019s just clean bowled Adam Gilchrist! He tries the knuckle ball, and he\u2019s keep that low and under the bat. The skipper goes - a little bemused how that stayed low. Terrific delivery. Bushfire Cricket Bash: Second over - 0/26 (Watson 16, Gilchrist 6) Gee, this is just a basket of Easter eggs for cricket fans. Watching Courtney Walsh pick up his 500th Test wicket at the SCG was one of my highlights as a fan, and now it\u2019s Wasim Akram with the ball. What a player. Shane Watson doesn\u2019t show him too much respect, mind - back to back sixes, flicked off the pads and deep over the rope! AFLW: 3-quarter-time: St Kilda 1.1 (7) vs Western Bulldogs 5.1 (32) Very little to add to in that third quarter, just the one behind for the visitors as the home side have failed to make significant inroads into this decent lead. A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 2-0 Central Coast (Topor-Stanley) 24 min: Bottom of the table, you said? Welly, well. It\u2019s a set piece and it\u2019s a poor piece of one-on-one defence as Kye Rowles loses Nikolai Topor-Stanley at the far post, and the Jets veteran steals in to lash home with the left peg! It\u2019s only early, but you have to say it\u2019s a long way back for the Mariners now - they\u2019ve only scored 14 goals all season; now they\u2019ll need three here to bag the points. A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 1-0 Central Coast (Petratos) 15 min: It is the Panamanian making a nuisance in the box - Arroyo uses his imposing frame to get on the end of a hopeful cross, and he nods it back well to a teammate, and that\u2019s a sumptuous volley home from Dimi Petratos! He missed a hatful last weekend, but he\u2019s lashed that home! A fine strike, and a worthy opener. Here we go. Bushfire Cricket Bash: Bonus over - 0/7 (Tendulkar 7) They finished with a flourish, the Ponting XI. Bringing up 104 at the loss of five wickets. But the new innings opens with something pretty special. Ellyse Perry vs Sachin Tendulkar. If you either thought you\u2019d read that sentence. I reckon she\u2019s got a tiny touch of stage fright, the Australian left arm, as she drags a few onto the bads, and like he hasn\u2019t missed a beat in five and a half years out of the game, the little master flicks that off the pads for four. That was worth the entrance fee alone. Gorgeous. A-League - 8 min: Post! Steven Ugarkovic with a drive from long-range - it beats an outstretched Mark Birighitti, but rattles back resolutely off the upright! A lovely move from the Jets, how close was that. A clever layoff from the Panamanian Abdiel Arroyo. He\u2019s looked handy in recent weeks, can he get on the scoresheet himself today? A-League: Kick off! 3 min: An auspicious start for the home side - barely a few minutes into Newcastle v Central Coast, and the home side have had to make a change; Ben Kantarovski\u2019s pulled up hobbled, and they\u2019ve gone to the bench - the Jets. The youngster Angus Thurgate comes into the fray. Morning Rich, morning all. I hope you\u2019re well, wherever you\u2019re following our coverage, around the globe. Thanks Scotty. A very kind welcome. It\u2019s true - it\u2019s a booming game in the Baltics, AFLW. So\u2019s cricket, just quietly. A shoutout to the Tallinn Hippos, doing battle today in the Estonian first division indoor cricket. A game that will be bubbling nicely a little closer to home is the F3 Derby in the A-League - lets get you there asap. That\u2019s where my contribution ends. I\u2019m off to type \u2018Brian Lara\u2019 as many times as I can into YouTube. Your host with the most (knowledge of AFLW in Estonia) for the rest of Sunday is Richard Parkin. I\u2019m Tallinn you, this bloke is good. All yours, Parko! AFLW: HT: St Kilda 1.1 (7) vs Western Bulldogs 5.1 (31) No inroads to speak of for the Saints as Bailey Hunt extends the Dogs\u2019 lead. They\u2019ve had their share of possession, St Kilda, but have overused the footy and committed too many errors. Work to do for the new kids on the block. Bushfire Cricket Bash: 7th over: Ponting XI 62-3 (Litchfield 3, Lara 8) Brian Lara, you wonderful man, you\u2019ve clearly still got it. Arguably the finest batsman of his generation - he might not have been, but you could argue it - smears a couple of cover drives right out of the screws to the fence. One was off the bowling of Elyse Villani, the other off Nick Riewoldt. Fine, he\u2019s faced better bowlers in his life. But indulge me. They were pretty shots to watch. As for the below, we all make mistakes. But I bet Brian could bat pretty well the other way around. Bushfire Cricket Bash: 5th over: Ponting XI 46-2 (Ponting 20, Litchfield 1) Hayden\u2019s on his way, caught off Yuvraj Singh for 16, which brings Phoebe Litchfield to the middle. She middles a couple of nice cover drives and the Ponting XI look to be going along OK at the midpoint of this 10-over bash. It\u2019s an exhibition game for a very good cause, but Ponting is ever the competitor. He\u2019s out there to win. I wonder if he\u2019s ever lost an argument with himself. Here\u2019s that ripper of a ball from Courtney Walsh. How come no one ever bowled like that to me? AFLW: QT: St Kilda 1.0 (6) vs Western Bulldogs 4.1 (25) A baptism of fire for another of the AFLW\u2019s new teams. It\u2019s all the Doggies at quarter time at windy Moorabbin. But there\u2019s plenty of time for the Saints and they can\u2019t take this one away from Molly McDonald. Bushfire Cricket Bash: 2nd over: Ponting XI 17-1 (Hayden 8, Ponting 1) Got \u2018im! Langer tries to pull a straight one - possibly for the first time in his life - and is bowled by Courtney Walsh. This brings Ricky Ponting to the crease and Walsh, well, Walsh completely messes up his ball release as the cherry goes 50m - 25 up, 25 down - and lands somewhere in another postcode. Ponting, who can\u2019t get out first ball, still wants a piece of it and chases that tiny piece of leather. Mayhem. Bushfire Cricket Bash: 1st over: Ponting XI 14-0 (Langer 6, Hayden 6) The two great openers of years gone by pick Peter Siddle off with ease in a good start for the Ponting XI. The inimitable Courtney Walsh is next ... Bushfire Cricket Bash: Gilchrist XI won the toss and will field Bushfire Cricket Bash: not long to go now. Both teams are out on the Junction Oval. John Williamson is belting out \u2018True Blue\u2019. Can\u2019t wait to see some big names of yesteryear going through their paces for a great cause. It started well for the Eagles in their first AFLW match, with Dana Hooker kicking the game\u2019s first goal as the Pies were held to a scoreless first term, but it was all downhill from there as Collingwood capitalised with the breeze and defended well without it. The icing on top of the cherry on top of the cake was Sharni Layton\u2019s major in the final term. Good old Collingwood forever. For the first time, they record a win in the opening round of the AFLW season. There might be a bitter postscript, however, with Brianna Davey suffering what looked to be a serious leg injury. Australia qualify for the final of this tri-series tournament thanks to a masterful display with the ball. Their tally of 132-7 looked like it mightn\u2019t be enough, but controlled, tight bowling meant England were never really in the hunt. Sophie Molineux was brilliant in the middle part of the innings, returning 3-19, after Tayla Vlaeminck ousted both opening bats. If Australia lost at the Junction Oval they were out on their ears, but instead it\u2019s England who fail to qualify for Wednesday\u2019s final against India. Women\u2019s T20 tri-nations: 19 overs: England 107-7 v Australia 132-7 A great piece of glovework from Alyssa Healy - a genuine one-handed beauty, all reaction and instinct - removes Lauren Winfield and Australia are now surely home. England need 26 runs from the final over to win. Women\u2019s T20 tri-nations: 18 overs: England 102-6 v Australia 132-7 Winfield and Brunt have kept England\u2019s seventh wicket intact - so they are at least set up for an assault in these last two overs - but 31 runs from 12 deliveries is a big ask indeed. Australia bowling with great discipline in these dying overs. AFLW: 3QT: Collingwood 3.4 (22) vs West Coast 1.4 (10) The Eagles had enough of the play in the third quarter but could not find the necessary polish to do some damage on the scoreboard. Collingwood skipper Steph Chiocci\u2019s major towards the end of the term really hurt West Coast. The Maggies are coming home with the wind and should run away with this match, but all eyes will be on Brianna Davey after the recruit went down with a leg injury. Women\u2019s T20 tri-nations: 15 overs: England 84-6 v Australia 132-7 Troubling times for England, who are bleeding wickets and falling behind the required run-rate all the while. Sophie Molineux has been the architect of destruction in the middle part of the innings, taking three wickets - including England skipper Heather Knight for 13. At the end of the 14th over it was nearly seven down as Rachael Haynes almost took a blinder of a catch off a Lauren Winfield reverse sweep. Would\u2019ve been a classic catch. AFLW: Q3: 7 mins remaining: Collingwood 2.3 (15) vs West Coast 1.3 (9) The Eagles have the breeze in this quarter but it\u2019s slow going as they bid to regain the lead that was snatched from them in two mad minutes during the second term. Prized recruit Kellie Gibson did have a chance to draw level but her set shot from distance faded slightly to the right for a minor score. All the scoring is happening at West Coast\u2019s end. One feels they\u2019ll need to take a lead into the final break if they\u2019re to have any hope of winning. Women\u2019s T20 tri-nations: 9 overs: England 55-3 v Australia 132-7 Softy, softly for England who started their run-chase needing about 6.7 runs per over to win ... and who still face that type of task approaching the midpoint. That said, wickets are falling. Australia are bowling well and refusing to give England any easy runs. Tayla Vlaeminck removed both openers before, in the ninth over, Ellyse Perry snaffled a nice catch in the deep to get rid of Natalie Sciver. Australia must win this game if they have a hope of featuring in Wednesday\u2019s final. Lose here, and they tune up for the women\u2019s T20 World Cup on a negative note. AFLW: HT: Collingwood 2.2 (14) vs West Coast 1.2 (8) After being held for almost the entirety of the first half, Collingwood boot two majors in as many minutes to take the lead against one of the AFLW\u2019s newbies. Firstly, Chloe Molloy slotted home a set shot from a tight angle before Jaimee Lambert converted from close range, bisecting an Eagles defensive line that was more interested in the umpire\u2019s call than stopping the scoring threat. In the first quarter, Dana Hooker kicked West Coast\u2019s first ever goal in the AFLW as the Pies were scoreless heading to the first break. Go the Opals. Ground staff, administrators, players - and, of course, the big man upstairs - conspiring to play a game of cricket during the Great Sydney Downpour (GSD) last night should very well join the invention of the wheel, sliced bread and the mighty Slap Chop as one of humanity\u2019s great achievements. Women\u2019s T20 tri-nations: 20 overs: Australia 132-7 v England It\u2019s a pretty simple equation for Australia: win here or surrender any hope at all of featuring in the final of this tri-series tournament. So far, it isn\u2019t going so well. After being sent in by England in Melbourne, Australia lost Alyssa Healy in the opening over and never really got going - despite Beth Mooney\u2019s 50 from 40 balls. Sophie Ecclestone (2-19) and Sarah Glenn (2-18) kept Australia on a very tight leash and, on the evidence of this tournament to date, a target of 133 should be well within England\u2019s reach. Good afternoon and welcome to the soggiest edition of Sportwatch in living memory. After your trusty host\u2019s car, bike and helicopter was washed away by Sydney\u2019s big wet, I flagged down the next passing dinghy and am now here, at your service on a Sunday that has plenty in store. Australia\u2019s women cricketers are at the midpoint of their must-win T20 tri-series match against England, two new teams - St Kilda and West Coast - make their maiden appearances as the opening round of the AFLW season continues, the F3 Derby in the A-League will go ahead despite the torrential rain sweeping large parts of New South Wales, plus there is some cycling and the rescheduled Bushfire cricket bash to keep us interested. So, yeah, lots on. As soon as I windscreen wipe my spectacles, we\u2019ll be under way. Something on your mind? If so, send me an email or tweet @scott_heinrich.",

      "bodyText": "At the end of the first day of the Harvey Weinstein trial in New York, after prosecutors had described the defendant to the jury as a predatory monster who sexually attacked numerous women, the fallen titan of Hollywood was asked whether he was feeling confident. After all, he is looking at spending the rest of his life behind bars. \u201cVery confident,\u201d Weinstein shot back as he trundled past reporters in the New York supreme court, leaning heavily \u2013 in pain or as role-play, nobody quite knows \u2013 on his signature walking frame. \u201cI got great lawyers.\u201d He might have said, \u201cI got a great lawyer.\u201d For the tone and tactics of his defense \u2013 and with it the likely outcome of his trial \u2013 depend in large part on one woman, the Chicago-based legal Rottweiler, Donna Rotunno. It is a measure of Rotunno\u2019s commanding presence in court No 99 that she is attracting almost as much public attention as her celebrity client. She appears every day in court sharply decked out in Salvatore Ferragamo dresses or leather skirts, Jimmy Choo heels and a gold necklace with pendant stating: \u201cNot guilty.\u201d The same sharp style applies to the men in her defense team. Her deputy, Arthur Aidala, sports check suits, blue silk pocket handkerchiefs, cashmere coat and trilby. Like everything Rotunno does, her look is entirely conscious and designed for maximum effect with the jury. \u201cJurors appreciate people taking pride in how you dress,\u201d she told a hometown newspaper before the trial began. If that sounds a little old-school, it is. What is so striking about the defense that Rotunno, 44, is spearheading is how conventional, retrograde, it is, almost as though the #MeToo movement never happened. It was the revelations in October 2017 that Weinstein had spent huge sums to silence several women accusers that sparked the #MeToo movement.

      "bodyText": "In July 2018, the Daily Beast\u2019s Lachlan Markay posted a short piece about a mysterious $375,000 contribution from \u201cGlobal Energy Producers\u201d to America First Action, a pro-Trump Super Pac. Eighteen months later, federal agents arrested Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman en route to Dulles airport; they were holding one-way tickets. Republican politicians who took their cash are offloading it as if it were doused with coronavirus and the president has suddenly forgotten the name of their former patron: Rudy Giuliani. With Beast White House correspondent Asawin Suebsaeng, Markay now delivers a breezy look at Trumpworld and our nation\u2019s capital. Their book is constructed out of fresh reporting, prior columns and gossip, lots of it. It is filled with tales of greed, envy and near violence, together with schemes, outbursts and profanity. Think of it as non-fiction beach reading for our impeachment winter. Few are spared. Donald Trump\u2019s insecurities and temper, Steve Bannon\u2019s foul mouth and Jared Kushner\u2019s habit of knowing less than he thinks he does \u2013 all are on display. Sinking in the Swamp contains at least a week\u2019s worth of material for The Daily Show. It chronicles the president\u2019s fear of assassination, as he repeatedly asks if the White House windows are bulletproof. \u201cYou sure?\u201d Trump would repeat. Tweets about \u201cyour favorite president, me!\u201d belie a man who knows he\u2019s despised by nearly half the country. Item. In the closing days of the 2016 election, Trump unloaded on David Bossie, the deputy campaign manager, who repeatedly tried to rein in the candidate\u2019s tweets. Although Kellyanne Conway was technically Bossie\u2019s superior, it was he who reportedly possessed nuts-and-bolts depth. Still, according to Markay and Suebsaeng, Trump went from unamused to perturbed, then lost it: \u201cGET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!! GET HIM THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME.\u201d That Bossie was instrumental in delivering Pennsylvania and Wisconsin mattered little. He would be banished, relegated to the Citizens United political action committee, penning books praising the president but never to serve in the White House. Gratitude? Not exactly. Item.

      "body": "<p>For some time, it has been widespread medical practice to treat a range of psychological conditions, including depression and anxiety, with what might be called mind-altering drugs, namely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which, as the name suggests, affect levels of serotonin in the brain. But there\u2019s one mental category that isn\u2019t considered appropriate for any kind of biomedical intervention. It\u2019s arguably the most talked about of all human states, the cause of much of our finest art, literature and music, and it is celebrated or, depending on your view, commercially exploited once again on Friday: love.</p> <p>It may be a many splendoured thing, but love is a condition for which there is famously no cure. All you need is love, as the song said, but money can\u2019t buy you it. It\u2019s viewed as an emotional ideal and yet the source of untold pain and suffering. Ask any 10 people what love is and you\u2019re sure to get 10 different answers. Unsurprisingly, given that it is the stuff of romance, we tend to romanticise it. Millions of words have been spilled in trying to describe the feeling, but not many have been devoted to the biochemical processes that lie behind it.</p> <p>In their new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/love-is-the-drug-9781526145413.html\" title=\"\">Love Is the Drug</a></em>, Oxford ethicists Brian Earp and Julian Savulescu point out that this neglected aspect of love is just as important as its social or psychological structures. Intuitively, perhaps, we\u2019ve always known this. After all, how do we explain the lack of interest felt on a new date? \u201cThere was no chemistry.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We just need to identify those cases where intervening with drugs or psychology will  improve authenticity</p> <footer> <cite>Brian Earp, ethicist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet while we have largely come to accept that drugs that affect the brain have a part to play in treating psychological illnesses, the idea that the same approach could apply to love goes against the grain. We think of love as natural and healthy and therefore not something that is in need of what Earp and Savulescu delicately call \u201cbiomedical enhancement\u201d.</p> <p>The authors, however, argue that it\u2019s time to change our attitudes and explore the possibilities offered by breakthroughs in biomedicine and neuroscience. \u201cIf it becomes possible to safely target the underlying neurochemistry that supports romantic attachment, using drugs or other brain-level technologies,\u201d they write, \u201cthen there is reason to think this could help some people who really need it.\u201d</p> <p>They go further and suggest that such drugs have already been partially tested, have been used by huge numbers of people around the world, and should urgently become the subject of controlled research. The problem is the drugs they\u2019re talking about are illegal psychoactive substances such as psilocybin and, in particular, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the active ingredient in the rave drug ecstasy.</p> <p>They cite studies that show positive results for the use of MDMA in counselling those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and speculate that similar outcomes might be expected for couples whose relationships have hit the rocks.</p> <p>But isn\u2019t that a bit of an inductive stretch? What does the effect of, say, fighting in Iraq have to do with failing romances? Earp points out that there is already a small study showing how couples in which one partner has PTSD have benefited from the regulated use of MDMA. The way the drug is thought to work on PTSD sufferers, he says, is by breaking down the defence mechanisms that prevent their being able to open up.</p> <p>\u201cOur point is that trauma falls on a spectrum and relationships themselves can be traumatic,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat causes a lot of relationships to break down over time is traumatic or semi-traumatic events that take place either inside or outside the relationship. People start to close down and stop sharing with their partners. Insofar as love requires a certain kind of intimacy, the defence mechanism and the kneejerk fear responses that we build up around talking about certain issues with our partners are the very things that this drug directly enables us to overcome.\u201d</p> <p>As may be gathered from that response, Earp is not interested in bringing biomedical enhancement to first dates, for reasons of what he terms \u201cauthenticity\u201d. He wants to focus on those who have already passed that initial chemistry test and whose love has subsequently become worn and torn by the everyday rigours of life.</p> <p>\u201cIf you take a drug that all of a sudden makes you feel much closer to someone than you did five minutes ago, there\u2019s a risk that it\u2019s the drug doing the work rather than some sort of established compatibility between you and the other person,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was Timothy Leary who coined the term \u2018instant marriage syndrome\u2019, where people would meet someone at a dance and think, \u2018Ooh, I\u2019ve met my soulmate\u2019 and they\u2019d go and get married and as the drug wore off, and they got to know each other better, they found they didn\u2019t actually have good compatibility.\u201d</p> <p>Of course MDMA is best known in this country for its starring role in the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/01/thirty-years-since-the-second-summer-of-love-1988\" title=\"\">second summer of love in 1988</a>, when a generation of rave-goers discovered ecstasy, got \u201cloved up\u201d and shared the mass euphoria of dancing all night in an urban warehouse or field. The social idealism glimpsed at the beginning of that social movement soon spiralled into hedonistic excess, and it wasn\u2019t long before stories of teenage deaths related to taking the drug ruined the utopian dream.</p> <p>Though largely unheard of in the UK before that summer, MDMA was already technically illegal for more than 10 years under umbrella legislation concerning phenethylamines. In the US, it was not made illegal until 1985. Earp and Savulescu are not now calling for its wholesale legalisation. They acknowledge its potential dangers, particularly if taken in the wrong situation with inadequate support, and argue that it should only be available in a therapeutic setting, under the guidance of a professional.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5f057db9c666bd2cb5b0c741f59330b9f496e74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5f057db9c666bd2cb5b0c741f59330b9f496e74/0_214_2364_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristin Kreuk and Adam Sinclair in Ecstasy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristin Kreuk and Adam Sinclair in Ecstasy, an adaptation of Irvine Welsh\u2019s 1996 story The Undefeatured, set amid ecstasy users in the rave scene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Intandem Films/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until 1985, as <em>Love Is the Drug</em> reminds us, MDMA had been used by many relationship counsellors in the US. In 1998, psychiatrists George Greer and Requa Tolbert wrote <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9924843\" title=\"\">in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9924843\" title=\"\">Journal of Psychoactive Drugs</a></em>, of their experience of conducting MDMA-enhanced therapeutic sessions with about 80 clients in the first half of the 1980s.</p> <p>These clients had to give their informed consent and were selected after a pre-screening process. Then Greer and Tolbert would meet the clients in their homes, where they would administer a pure dose of between 77mg and 150mg of MDMA, with a 50mg booster if requested later on (the street drug in the UK is said to contain upwards of 150mg, and occasionally as much as 300mg). According to Greer and Tolbert, 90% of their clients benefited from MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, with \u201csome\u201d, as Earp and Savulescu write, \u201creporting that they felt more love toward their partners and were better able to move beyond past pains and pointless grudges\u201d.</p> <p>A cynic might say, what\u2019s left of love after that? But a more serious point is how to distinguish the relationships that are worth saving or enhancing from those that are fundamentally dysfunctional, when there might be a danger that the temporary high could help disguise the dysfunction.</p> <p>Earp and Savulescu are careful not to be too prescriptive in their definitions of love, allowing that it\u2019s pretty much whatever those who declare possession of it say it is. Equally, Earp is on guard for external paternalistic judgments of other people\u2019s relationships. His belief is that there is a monogamy/promiscuity spectrum along which we all fall and that no position on it is more \u201cnatural\u201d than any other. So one-size-fits-all classifications are destined to miss the mark.</p> <p>\u201cI think it would be a mistake to say everyone should be lifelong monogamists, no matter what, and we\u2019re going to enforce that through the criminal code,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would also be a mistake to say that we\u2019re all just bonobos and monogamy is a thing of the past and we should have as many sexual partners as we can find. In the world of meaning, subjective experience and how we relate to each other, there\u2019s a lot of room for diverse interpretations of what\u2019s valuable.\u201d</p> <p>History has a bad track record of deciding what the \u201cright\u201d relationship is, says Earp, noting that it was only very recently that homosexual love was brought within the fold of acceptability. But there is one objective criterion to which the pair do hold firm. \u201cWhen it comes to violent abuse, we\u2019ve drawn a pretty strong line in the sand collectively as a society,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a very strong signal that it\u2019s objectively a bad relationship.\u201d</p> <p>The book makes several bold claims that seem the product of marketing needs rather than hardcore scientific fact. For example, it states that the \u201cbiological underpinnings of romantic love are being revealed\u201d and that the prospect of real love drugs is upon us. But there remains a great deal of debate, not to say confusion, about the workings of even such fundamental biological constituents as the hormone testosterone regarding its role in the libido.

      "bodyText": "For some time, it has been widespread medical practice to treat a range of psychological conditions, including depression and anxiety, with what might be called mind-altering drugs, namely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which, as the name suggests, affect levels of serotonin in the brain. But there\u2019s one mental category that isn\u2019t considered appropriate for any kind of biomedical intervention. It\u2019s arguably the most talked about of all human states, the cause of much of our finest art, literature and music, and it is celebrated or, depending on your view, commercially exploited once again on Friday: love. It may be a many splendoured thing, but love is a condition for which there is famously no cure. All you need is love, as the song said, but money can\u2019t buy you it. It\u2019s viewed as an emotional ideal and yet the source of untold pain and suffering. Ask any 10 people what love is and you\u2019re sure to get 10 different answers. Unsurprisingly, given that it is the stuff of romance, we tend to romanticise it. Millions of words have been spilled in trying to describe the feeling, but not many have been devoted to the biochemical processes that lie behind it. In their new book, Love Is the Drug, Oxford ethicists Brian Earp and Julian Savulescu point out that this neglected aspect of love is just as important as its social or psychological structures. Intuitively, perhaps, we\u2019ve always known this. After all, how do we explain the lack of interest felt on a new date? \u201cThere was no chemistry.\u201d Yet while we have largely come to accept that drugs that affect the brain have a part to play in treating psychological illnesses, the idea that the same approach could apply to love goes against the grain. We think of love as natural and healthy and therefore not something that is in need of what Earp and Savulescu delicately call \u201cbiomedical enhancement\u201d. The authors, however, argue that it\u2019s time to change our attitudes and explore the possibilities offered by breakthroughs in biomedicine and neuroscience. \u201cIf it becomes possible to safely target the underlying neurochemistry that supports romantic attachment, using drugs or other brain-level technologies,\u201d they write, \u201cthen there is reason to think this could help some people who really need it.\u201d They go further and suggest that such drugs have already been partially tested, have been used by huge numbers of people around the world, and should urgently become the subject of controlled research. The problem is the drugs they\u2019re talking about are illegal psychoactive substances such as psilocybin and, in particular, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the active ingredient in the rave drug ecstasy. They cite studies that show positive results for the use of MDMA in counselling those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and speculate that similar outcomes might be expected for couples whose relationships have hit the rocks. But isn\u2019t that a bit of an inductive stretch? What does the effect of, say, fighting in Iraq have to do with failing romances? Earp points out that there is already a small study showing how couples in which one partner has PTSD have benefited from the regulated use of MDMA. The way the drug is thought to work on PTSD sufferers, he says, is by breaking down the defence mechanisms that prevent their being able to open up. \u201cOur point is that trauma falls on a spectrum and relationships themselves can be traumatic,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat causes a lot of relationships to break down over time is traumatic or semi-traumatic events that take place either inside or outside the relationship. People start to close down and stop sharing with their partners. Insofar as love requires a certain kind of intimacy, the defence mechanism and the kneejerk fear responses that we build up around talking about certain issues with our partners are the very things that this drug directly enables us to overcome.\u201d As may be gathered from that response, Earp is not interested in bringing biomedical enhancement to first dates, for reasons of what he terms \u201cauthenticity\u201d. He wants to focus on those who have already passed that initial chemistry test and whose love has subsequently become worn and torn by the everyday rigours of life. \u201cIf you take a drug that all of a sudden makes you feel much closer to someone than you did five minutes ago, there\u2019s a risk that it\u2019s the drug doing the work rather than some sort of established compatibility between you and the other person,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was Timothy Leary who coined the term \u2018instant marriage syndrome\u2019, where people would meet someone at a dance and think, \u2018Ooh, I\u2019ve met my soulmate\u2019 and they\u2019d go and get married and as the drug wore off, and they got to know each other better, they found they didn\u2019t actually have good compatibility.\u201d Of course MDMA is best known in this country for its starring role in the so-called second summer of love in 1988, when a generation of rave-goers discovered ecstasy, got \u201cloved up\u201d and shared the mass euphoria of dancing all night in an urban warehouse or field. The social idealism glimpsed at the beginning of that social movement soon spiralled into hedonistic excess, and it wasn\u2019t long before stories of teenage deaths related to taking the drug ruined the utopian dream. Though largely unheard of in the UK before that summer, MDMA was already technically illegal for more than 10 years under umbrella legislation concerning phenethylamines. In the US, it was not made illegal until 1985. Earp and Savulescu are not now calling for its wholesale legalisation. They acknowledge its potential dangers, particularly if taken in the wrong situation with inadequate support, and argue that it should only be available in a therapeutic setting, under the guidance of a professional. Until 1985, as Love Is the Drug reminds us, MDMA had been used by many relationship counsellors in the US. In 1998, psychiatrists George Greer and Requa Tolbert wrote in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, of their experience of conducting MDMA-enhanced therapeutic sessions with about 80 clients in the first half of the 1980s. These clients had to give their informed consent and were selected after a pre-screening process. Then Greer and Tolbert would meet the clients in their homes, where they would administer a pure dose of between 77mg and 150mg of MDMA, with a 50mg booster if requested later on (the street drug in the UK is said to contain upwards of 150mg, and occasionally as much as 300mg). According to Greer and Tolbert, 90% of their clients benefited from MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, with \u201csome\u201d, as Earp and Savulescu write, \u201creporting that they felt more love toward their partners and were better able to move beyond past pains and pointless grudges\u201d. A cynic might say, what\u2019s left of love after that? But a more serious point is how to distinguish the relationships that are worth saving or enhancing from those that are fundamentally dysfunctional, when there might be a danger that the temporary high could help disguise the dysfunction. Earp and Savulescu are careful not to be too prescriptive in their definitions of love, allowing that it\u2019s pretty much whatever those who declare possession of it say it is. Equally, Earp is on guard for external paternalistic judgments of other people\u2019s relationships. His belief is that there is a monogamy/promiscuity spectrum along which we all fall and that no position on it is more \u201cnatural\u201d than any other. So one-size-fits-all classifications are destined to miss the mark. \u201cI think it would be a mistake to say everyone should be lifelong monogamists, no matter what, and we\u2019re going to enforce that through the criminal code,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would also be a mistake to say that we\u2019re all just bonobos and monogamy is a thing of the past and we should have as many sexual partners as we can find. In the world of meaning, subjective experience and how we relate to each other, there\u2019s a lot of room for diverse interpretations of what\u2019s valuable.\u201d History has a bad track record of deciding what the \u201cright\u201d relationship is, says Earp, noting that it was only very recently that homosexual love was brought within the fold of acceptability. But there is one objective criterion to which the pair do hold firm. \u201cWhen it comes to violent abuse, we\u2019ve drawn a pretty strong line in the sand collectively as a society,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a very strong signal that it\u2019s objectively a bad relationship.\u201d The book makes several bold claims that seem the product of marketing needs rather than hardcore scientific fact. For example, it states that the \u201cbiological underpinnings of romantic love are being revealed\u201d and that the prospect of real love drugs is upon us. But there remains a great deal of debate, not to say confusion, about the workings of even such fundamental biological constituents as the hormone testosterone regarding its role in the libido. And as you might expect from professional ethicists, the book is at its most impressive when considering the moral, social and pragmatic issues concerned with scientific development, rather than the details of the development itself. If and when the aforementioned biological underpinnings are revealed, and we are able to regulate emotions and behaviour through biomedical supplements, does that suggest we will become somehow less autonomous and, consequently, more like a programmable machine? \u201cThere are lots of ways we take steps to try to shape ourselves and our self-narratives,\u201d says Earp. \u201cThere are ones that we\u2019re comfortable with because they don\u2019t seem to involve the brain and we\u2019re a little bit scared of interacting with the brain directly.\u201d But the fact is, he says, even words can affect our brains. He cites the example of the Oedipus myth. One moment he\u2019s happily having sex with Jocasta, feeling love towards her, the next he discovers that she\u2019s his mother. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t taken any drugs but you can bet that all of a sudden his testosterone levels will plummet and his libido will drop.\u201d Our neurochemistry is changing all the time, says Earp, and one way that can happen is by the direct administration of drugs, which have their own benefits and risks. \u201cWe just need to identify those cases where intervening with drugs or psychology or changing our social circumstance will be likely to improve authenticity or autonomy rather than detract from it.\u201d He speaks with such reasoned composure on the subject that it comes as a surprise to learn that he has never taken MDMA himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in that experience but I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to go forward with that because it remains unjustly and inappropriately prohibited,\u201d he says. The solution, he insists, is open research. In the meantime, we\u2019ll just have to continue fumbling away in the dark, breaking up and making up, trying to understand not just ourselves but the other person \u2013 at least until the love drug arrives. Microdosing: the perfect prescription? In praise of ecstasy Small studies have found that doses of MDMA can have beneficial effects for ex-military and first-responder PTSD sufferers; however, treatment takes place in controlled environments assisted by psychotherapy. There is no good evidence that recreational microdosing is effective or advisable. Pot potential Quality research on the effects of microdosing cannabinoids \u2013 THC and CBD \u2013 is nascent. A 2017 study found that very low doses of THC reduce stress, yet higher doses increase anxiety. In other studies, CBD has shown potential in the treatment of insomnia and a range of anxiety disorders. Spore lore In a recent episode of Netflix\u2019s The Goop Lab, employees of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s \u201cwellness\u201d company decamped to Jamaica to microdose with magic mushrooms in order to solve various emotional or trauma issues.

      "body": "<p>From the age of 12, shortly after starting at what he calls a rough comprehensive in Finchley, north London, John Bercow was afflicted with severe acne. He tells us that he has never been \u201cworried or embarrassed about being short or lacking in physical strength. But I was utterly miserable about my skin.\u201d Cruel schoolmates dubbed him \u201cCrater Face\u201d. The affliction persisted through university. \u201cThe psychological damage, the damage to my self-confidence, was considerable and lasted for years.\u201d It was compounded by his parents breaking up after many years of terrible rows and acute bronchial asthma destroying his dreams of becoming a professional tennis player. The young Bercow was \u201can insecure, sad, lost soul\u201d and \u201can angry young man\u201d.</p> <p>It has often struck me that a large proportion of our senior politicians were psychologically wounded when young and seek out the political stage in the hope of gaining the approbation denied to them as children. In few is this as obvious as in the case of the former Speaker. This is memoir as both therapy and revenge. Vengeance on all those who have crossed him during a contentious career. Therapy by trumpeting to the world that \u201cCrater Face\u201d defied those bullying classmates by rising to occupy parliament\u2019s high chair for a decade.</p> <p>It was a peculiar journey. The young Bercow\u2019s first allegiance was to the repulsive right. In his late teens, he made what he now calls a \u201cshameful and obnoxious\u201d decision to join the Monday Club, an ugly outfit that shared his father\u2019s adoration for Enoch Powell and championed white minority dictatorship in South Africa and what was then Rhodesia. \u201cHere I was, a Jewish boy\u2026 sidling up to racists.\u201d</p> <p>He was less extreme, but still a man very much of the right, when he got to the Commons at his third attempt and adopted the role of attention-seeking, hyperactive backbench \u201cattack dog\u201d, barking loudly but ineffectively at the Labour government of Tony Blair. This is another period of his life that he now contemplates with mortification.</p> <p>Then a new Bercow emerged, one increasingly out of sympathy with the Tories. So much so that he was sounded out about defecting to Labour. He describes his transformation from Europe-hating \u201crightwing Thatcherite\u201d to \u201cliberal leftie\u201d more than he explains it. The reader is left unclear to what extent this unusual conversion was influenced by his tempestuous on-off relationship with the Labour-supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/feb/06/observer-profile-sally-bercow\" title=\"\">Sally</a>. She eventually became his wife only to later humiliate him by having an affair with one of his cousins.</p> <p>Though he doesn\u2019t explicitly acknowledge this, he redirected his ambitions towards the Speakership when he realised that he had little chance of frontbench advancement and secured the chair against the wishes of David Cameron and with the help of Labour MPs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can safely say that he has a temper, and it can be a nasty one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book argues persuasively that he was a reforming Speaker who strove to modernise the Commons. He overcame the resistance of the fogeyish tendency to establish a nursery for the use of MPs with small children. He joined the fight to improve staff pay and conditions. MPs on maternity leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/john-bercow-proxy-vote-brexit-house-of-commons-labour-tulip-siddiq\" title=\"\">gained the right to vote by proxy</a>. He played a critical role in the inspirational appointment of Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who became a charismatic ambassador for parliament as its first female and first non-white chaplain. This was one of several appointments that helped make Westminster look a little more like the country that it is supposed to represent. He claims deserved credit for being generous in the granting of \u201curgent questions\u201d, which the opposition can use to force ministers to answer to the Commons at times when they would prefer to hide from scrutiny.</p> <p>His Speakership was also a blighted one, accompanied by mounting allegations that there was a bullying culture in parliament on his watch and that he was guilty of it himself. He has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/02/pressure-grows-john-bercow-fresh-bullying-allegations\" title=\"\">bullying two of his private secretaries</a>, Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair. Lord Lisvane, who served as clerk of the Commons under Bercow, recently submitted a formal complaint to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which is understood to accuse him of bullying and humiliating staff. Lt-Gen David Leakey, a former Black Rod who clashed with Bercow, has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/05/john-bercow-peerage-scandal-black-rod-david-leakey\" title=\"\">further accusations</a> of intimidation and terrorising behaviour, saying: \u201cHe would fly into a rage, the red mist would descend\u2026 jumping up and down and bawling out.\u201d</p> <p>Bercow denies he is a bully and in this book presents himself as the victim of scheming officials. They, he claims, wanted to take over the Speaker\u2019s office to pack it \u201cwith their Oxbridge-educated clones\u201d and promote their own influence.</p> <p>We can safely say that he has a temper, and it can be a nasty one, because it was often displayed from the Speaker\u2019s chair. He made some unnecessary enemies among MPs by being spectacularly rude to those with whom he tangled in the chamber. This fed the accusation that he was less the Commons\u2019 neutral \u201cumpire\u201d and more a self-regarding showboater driven by a craving to be the star of the parliamentary show. Always quick to rebuke MPs and ministers who went on too long, this was not a rule he extended to his own frequent and windy interventions. \u201cMum would joke that Dad would never use one word where one hundred would do, and I have inherited that prolixity.\u201d You can say that again \u2013 and he does: \u201cBrevity is not my strong suit.\u201d The voice of this book will be familiar to those who have seen Bercow bloviating from the Speaker\u2019s throne: verbose, often repetitious, frequently mottled with rage and in love with the sound of himself. \u201cI make no apology for telling the truth\u201d is a typical example of self-puffing prose.</p> <p>The book is disappointingly short of stories about political life that might be revealing or amusing to the general reader. When he does tell an anecdote, it is invariably self-serving. There is a game of tennis with Boris Johnson. Bercow archly tells us: \u201cHe took his 6-0 6-0 6-0 defeat with very good grace.\u201d</p> <p><em>Unspeakable</em> is stronger when he defends his controversial procedural rulings during the long parliamentary battles over Brexit. He makes a compelling case that he had a duty as Speaker to help the legislature to assert its rights against an executive attempting to railroad Brexit legislation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic\">John Bercow: \u2018I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many in his former party hate him for that \u2013 and he hates them right back. While commending \u201cmoderation and good humour in the use of language\u201d, he displays neither quality in a series of poison pen portraits of senior Conservatives. William Hague is \u201cbuttoned-up, inscrutable, a cold fish\u2026 impersonal, mechanical\u2026 a weirdo\u2026 a hack and an ex-teenage nerd\u201d. Michael Howard\u2019s \u201cpeculiar distinction was to combine coldness and oiliness in equal measure\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, another to accuse him of bullying, is \u201cbigoted\u201d, \u201cdeluded\u201d, \u201cfeeble and sinister\u201d. Johnson is \u201ca passably adequate politician in an age not replete with them\u201d.</p> <p>He is most splenetic about Cameron: \u201cborn with a silver trolley service in his mouth\u201d. The former prime minister gets the wrathful loathing of a state-educated, prickly outsider towards a public school-educated, smoothie insider. \u201cInsubstantial, lightweight, someone who saw politics as a game that it was his inherited duty, and right, to play and win\u2026 sniffy, supercilious and deeply snobbish.\u201d</p> <p>These judgments on other politicians are as unsubtle as his loud neckwear. They would be a better read if they had been written with more wit and nuance. There\u2019s nothing original in the suggestion that Michael Gove is \u201coleaginous\u201d nor fresh about describing Theresa May as \u201cdull as ditchwater\u201d. And when he pronounces one rival guilty of \u201cmedal-winning pomposity\u201d, his fellow politicians will collapse with laughter at Bercow\u2019s epic lack of self-awareness.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Unspeakable: The Autobiography </em>by John Bercow is published by W&amp;N (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "From the age of 12, shortly after starting at what he calls a rough comprehensive in Finchley, north London, John Bercow was afflicted with severe acne. He tells us that he has never been \u201cworried or embarrassed about being short or lacking in physical strength. But I was utterly miserable about my skin.\u201d Cruel schoolmates dubbed him \u201cCrater Face\u201d. The affliction persisted through university. \u201cThe psychological damage, the damage to my self-confidence, was considerable and lasted for years.\u201d It was compounded by his parents breaking up after many years of terrible rows and acute bronchial asthma destroying his dreams of becoming a professional tennis player. The young Bercow was \u201can insecure, sad, lost soul\u201d and \u201can angry young man\u201d. It has often struck me that a large proportion of our senior politicians were psychologically wounded when young and seek out the political stage in the hope of gaining the approbation denied to them as children. In few is this as obvious as in the case of the former Speaker. This is memoir as both therapy and revenge. Vengeance on all those who have crossed him during a contentious career. Therapy by trumpeting to the world that \u201cCrater Face\u201d defied those bullying classmates by rising to occupy parliament\u2019s high chair for a decade. It was a peculiar journey. The young Bercow\u2019s first allegiance was to the repulsive right. In his late teens, he made what he now calls a \u201cshameful and obnoxious\u201d decision to join the Monday Club, an ugly outfit that shared his father\u2019s adoration for Enoch Powell and championed white minority dictatorship in South Africa and what was then Rhodesia. \u201cHere I was, a Jewish boy\u2026 sidling up to racists.\u201d He was less extreme, but still a man very much of the right, when he got to the Commons at his third attempt and adopted the role of attention-seeking, hyperactive backbench \u201cattack dog\u201d, barking loudly but ineffectively at the Labour government of Tony Blair. This is another period of his life that he now contemplates with mortification. Then a new Bercow emerged, one increasingly out of sympathy with the Tories. So much so that he was sounded out about defecting to Labour. He describes his transformation from Europe-hating \u201crightwing Thatcherite\u201d to \u201cliberal leftie\u201d more than he explains it. The reader is left unclear to what extent this unusual conversion was influenced by his tempestuous on-off relationship with the Labour-supporting Sally. She eventually became his wife only to later humiliate him by having an affair with one of his cousins. Though he doesn\u2019t explicitly acknowledge this, he redirected his ambitions towards the Speakership when he realised that he had little chance of frontbench advancement and secured the chair against the wishes of David Cameron and with the help of Labour MPs. The book argues persuasively that he was a reforming Speaker who strove to modernise the Commons. He overcame the resistance of the fogeyish tendency to establish a nursery for the use of MPs with small children. He joined the fight to improve staff pay and conditions. MPs on maternity leave gained the right to vote by proxy. He played a critical role in the inspirational appointment of Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who became a charismatic ambassador for parliament as its first female and first non-white chaplain. This was one of several appointments that helped make Westminster look a little more like the country that it is supposed to represent. He claims deserved credit for being generous in the granting of \u201curgent questions\u201d, which the opposition can use to force ministers to answer to the Commons at times when they would prefer to hide from scrutiny. His Speakership was also a blighted one, accompanied by mounting allegations that there was a bullying culture in parliament on his watch and that he was guilty of it himself. He has been accused of bullying two of his private secretaries, Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair. Lord Lisvane, who served as clerk of the Commons under Bercow, recently submitted a formal complaint to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which is understood to accuse him of bullying and humiliating staff. Lt-Gen David Leakey, a former Black Rod who clashed with Bercow, has made further accusations of intimidation and terrorising behaviour, saying: \u201cHe would fly into a rage, the red mist would descend\u2026 jumping up and down and bawling out.\u201d Bercow denies he is a bully and in this book presents himself as the victim of scheming officials. They, he claims, wanted to take over the Speaker\u2019s office to pack it \u201cwith their Oxbridge-educated clones\u201d and promote their own influence. We can safely say that he has a temper, and it can be a nasty one, because it was often displayed from the Speaker\u2019s chair. He made some unnecessary enemies among MPs by being spectacularly rude to those with whom he tangled in the chamber. This fed the accusation that he was less the Commons\u2019 neutral \u201cumpire\u201d and more a self-regarding showboater driven by a craving to be the star of the parliamentary show. Always quick to rebuke MPs and ministers who went on too long, this was not a rule he extended to his own frequent and windy interventions. \u201cMum would joke that Dad would never use one word where one hundred would do, and I have inherited that prolixity.\u201d You can say that again \u2013 and he does: \u201cBrevity is not my strong suit.\u201d The voice of this book will be familiar to those who have seen Bercow bloviating from the Speaker\u2019s throne: verbose, often repetitious, frequently mottled with rage and in love with the sound of himself. \u201cI make no apology for telling the truth\u201d is a typical example of self-puffing prose. The book is disappointingly short of stories about political life that might be revealing or amusing to the general reader. When he does tell an anecdote, it is invariably self-serving. There is a game of tennis with Boris Johnson. Bercow archly tells us: \u201cHe took his 6-0 6-0 6-0 defeat with very good grace.\u201d Unspeakable is stronger when he defends his controversial procedural rulings during the long parliamentary battles over Brexit. He makes a compelling case that he had a duty as Speaker to help the legislature to assert its rights against an executive attempting to railroad Brexit legislation. Many in his former party hate him for that \u2013 and he hates them right back. While commending \u201cmoderation and good humour in the use of language\u201d, he displays neither quality in a series of poison pen portraits of senior Conservatives. William Hague is \u201cbuttoned-up, inscrutable, a cold fish\u2026 impersonal, mechanical\u2026 a weirdo\u2026 a hack and an ex-teenage nerd\u201d. Michael Howard\u2019s \u201cpeculiar distinction was to combine coldness and oiliness in equal measure\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, another to accuse him of bullying, is \u201cbigoted\u201d, \u201cdeluded\u201d, \u201cfeeble and sinister\u201d. Johnson is \u201ca passably adequate politician in an age not replete with them\u201d. He is most splenetic about Cameron: \u201cborn with a silver trolley service in his mouth\u201d. The former prime minister gets the wrathful loathing of a state-educated, prickly outsider towards a public school-educated, smoothie insider. \u201cInsubstantial, lightweight, someone who saw politics as a game that it was his inherited duty, and right, to play and win\u2026 sniffy, supercilious and deeply snobbish.\u201d These judgments on other politicians are as unsubtle as his loud neckwear. They would be a better read if they had been written with more wit and nuance. There\u2019s nothing original in the suggestion that Michael Gove is \u201coleaginous\u201d nor fresh about describing Theresa May as \u201cdull as ditchwater\u201d. And when he pronounces one rival guilty of \u201cmedal-winning pomposity\u201d, his fellow politicians will collapse with laughter at Bercow\u2019s epic lack of self-awareness. \u2022 Unspeakable: The Autobiography by John Bercow is published by W&amp;N (\u00a320).

Xi has swept all enemies, real and imagined, aside since taking over as Communist party chief in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/15/xi-jinping-communist-party-chinese\" title=\"\">late 2012</a> and made many more along the way.</p> <p>Powerful families and moneyed interests toppled by his relentless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/31/37000-chinese-officials-punished-for-frugality-code-breaches\" title=\"\">anti-corruption campaign</a> will never forgive him and are lying in wait for revenge. Equally, many of the technocratic elite have been alienated by his illiberal economic policies and his assertiveness overseas, which they blame for triggering a concerted pushback in Washington.</p> <p>Much of their anger was captured in a single moment that embodied their fears that Xi is taking the country backwards \u2013 his decision in early 2018 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/china-reappoints-xi-jinping-as-president-with-no-term-limit\" title=\"\">do away with term limits</a> and make himself leader in perpetuity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Li was neither a dissident nor seeking to overthrow the communist party.

With the economy growing steadily before the virus hit, most Chinese are also still seeing their living standards rise.</p> <p>But Li\u2019s death and the mismanagement of the crisis have done more than just crystallise the elite\u2019s dislike of Xi. Over time, they could direct the anger of the wider populace against him as well.</p> <p>\u201cIn previous crises, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/12/china\" title=\"\">Wenchuan earthquake</a> [in Sichuan in 2008], the vast majority of Chinese citizens were spectators commenting on an event that angered them but was far away,\u201d said Bill Bishop, of <em>Sinocism</em>, a Washington-based China newsletter. \u201cIn this epidemic, no one is just a spectator \u2013 everyone is directly impacted.\u201d</p> <p>The spread of the virus, most likely starting from live animals in the Wuhan wet market late last year, has showcased both the party state\u2019s formidable strengths and corrosive weaknesses.</p> <p>The initial coverage of the virus focused on the authorities\u2019 abrupt order, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown\" title=\"\">issued at 2am on January 23</a>, to quarantine Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central Hubei province.</p> <p>\u201cTo my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million is new to science,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.who.int/china/about-us/head-of-who-office\" title=\"\">Gauden Galea</a>, a World Health Organization official, who seemed both in awe at the order and wryly unsure whether it would work.</p> <p>Once areas surrounding Wuhan were pulled inside the sealed-off zone days later, a total of 35 million people had been effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown\" title=\"\">put into lockdown</a> with the stroke of an administrative pen.</p> <p>The power of the Chinese state and its ability to mobilise resources overnight has long been admired by foreigners, be it in building a hospital in barely a week, as in Wuhan, or enforcing a cordon sanitaire containing tens of millions of people. But it is the chronic weaknesses in the political system that exacerbated the spread of the virus in the first place.</p> <p>The authoritarian strictures of the Chinese party state place a premium on the control of information in the name of maintaining stability. In such a system, lower-level officials have no incentive to report bad news up the line. Under Xi, such restrictions have grown tighter.</p> <p>In Wuhan, Li and seven of his fellow doctors had been talking among themselves in an internet chat group about a new cluster of viral infections. They stopped after being warned by police. By the time the authorities reacted and quarantined the city, it was too late.</p> <p>Li was neither a dissident nor a pro-democracy activist seeking to overthrow the Communist party.

      "bodyText": "Soon after Li Wenliang succumbed to the coronavirus in Wuhan early on Friday morning, a drawing of the Chinese doctor appeared on the internet, sleeping and being hoisted gently into heaven by an angel. From late in the evening until dawn yesterday, Chinese citizens stayed up, posting emotional tributes and venting their fury at the government over the treatment of the 34-year-old ophthalmologist, who had tried to warn the authorities about the virus in late December, only to be told by the police to shut up. The authorities, seemingly in a panic at the outpouring of grief and anger, announced that Li was still being treated before reposting confirmation of his death hours later. \u201cYou think we\u2019ve all gone to sleep?\u201d posted one netizen? \u201cNo. We haven\u2019t.\u201d In an interview with Chinese magazine Caixin before his death, Li delivered his own verdict on the government\u2019s handling of the issue: \u201cI think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society.\u201d It is wise to be cautious about the political impact of a single event or, in this case, one person\u2019s death, especially in China, which is ruled by an opaque Communist party. After all, can a virus that has so far claimed more than 700 lives, fewer than in a normal flu season in many countries, really hold the future of China in its thrall? However, the fallout from the spread of the potentially deadly coronavirus is already grim, most immediately in the form of a reeling Chinese economy that is having to temporarily sever supply lines to factories and retail outlets around the world. China has been responsible for about one-third of global growth in recent years, a greater share than the US, and any slowdown in its economy will be felt across the world. But the greatest focus is on what Li alluded to when he complained about the country being ruled by \u201cone voice\u201d, which Chinese people would immediately recognise as a barb directed at Xi Jinping. Xi has swept all enemies, real and imagined, aside since taking over as Communist party chief in late 2012 and made many more along the way. Powerful families and moneyed interests toppled by his relentless anti-corruption campaign will never forgive him and are lying in wait for revenge. Equally, many of the technocratic elite have been alienated by his illiberal economic policies and his assertiveness overseas, which they blame for triggering a concerted pushback in Washington. Much of their anger was captured in a single moment that embodied their fears that Xi is taking the country backwards \u2013 his decision in early 2018 to do away with term limits and make himself leader in perpetuity. Difficult as it is to measure public opinion in China, it is doubtless true that for many Chinese, the anti-corruption campaign \u2013 Xi\u2019s key initiative \u2013 has been highly popular. With the economy growing steadily before the virus hit, most Chinese are also still seeing their living standards rise. But Li\u2019s death and the mismanagement of the crisis have done more than just crystallise the elite\u2019s dislike of Xi. Over time, they could direct the anger of the wider populace against him as well. \u201cIn previous crises, like the Wenchuan earthquake [in Sichuan in 2008], the vast majority of Chinese citizens were spectators commenting on an event that angered them but was far away,\u201d said Bill Bishop, of Sinocism, a Washington-based China newsletter. \u201cIn this epidemic, no one is just a spectator \u2013 everyone is directly impacted.\u201d The spread of the virus, most likely starting from live animals in the Wuhan wet market late last year, has showcased both the party state\u2019s formidable strengths and corrosive weaknesses. The initial coverage of the virus focused on the authorities\u2019 abrupt order, issued at 2am on January 23, to quarantine Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central Hubei province. \u201cTo my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million is new to science,\u201d said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization official, who seemed both in awe at the order and wryly unsure whether it would work. Once areas surrounding Wuhan were pulled inside the sealed-off zone days later, a total of 35 million people had been effectively put into lockdown with the stroke of an administrative pen. The power of the Chinese state and its ability to mobilise resources overnight has long been admired by foreigners, be it in building a hospital in barely a week, as in Wuhan, or enforcing a cordon sanitaire containing tens of millions of people. But it is the chronic weaknesses in the political system that exacerbated the spread of the virus in the first place. The authoritarian strictures of the Chinese party state place a premium on the control of information in the name of maintaining stability. In such a system, lower-level officials have no incentive to report bad news up the line. Under Xi, such restrictions have grown tighter. In Wuhan, Li and seven of his fellow doctors had been talking among themselves in an internet chat group about a new cluster of viral infections. They stopped after being warned by police. By the time the authorities reacted and quarantined the city, it was too late. Li was neither a dissident nor a pro-democracy activist seeking to overthrow the Communist party. But he was risking jail to even discuss the virus. For in Xi\u2019s China, the professional classes \u2013 doctors, lawyers, journalists and the like \u2013 all must subsume their skills and ethics to the political directives of the moment. During the crisis, Xi has maintained an unusually low profile, perhaps because he doesn\u2019t want to step in publicly until it is clear the health authorities have gained control of the situation and new infections start to fall. For a man whose propaganda apparatus has recently begun to promote him as the \u201cpeople\u2019s leader\u201d, it has been a humbling moment.

Given my anxiety about Monday, that might sound weird \u2013 maybe it\u2019s about embracing the fear of the future. Do you drink? I gave it all up. Well, that\u2019s not completely true. I\u2019ve just finished making a documentary about holocaust denial for the BBC and I met a denier in Ireland. Afterwards it cuts to me having Guinness, saying: \u2018I don\u2019t normally drink, but I felt I had to have one.\u2019 A significant Sunday? Mum died on a Saturday \u2013 apparently that\u2019s quite common. Dad already had dementia, and my brother and I had to let him know the news. Forty-five minutes later we had to tell him again. We spent the whole of that Sunday reminding him over and over. That one really sticks out. Trolls: Not The Dolls is on tour until May (davidbaddiel.com)",

A nourishing cream to repair my skin barrier</h2> <p>I\u2019ve known aestheticians to disagree on a lot of things, but recently I\u2019ve found one thing they all agree on \u2013 too many of us are compromising our skin barrier. This is the outermost layer of skin, made up of fats, lipids and good bacteria. It enables skin to retain high levels of moisture and basic skin health. You know when it is compromised when it feels tight, dry, sore and, in some cases, begins to overproduce oil/sebum. Anything from overwashing to overusing active ingredients such as acids and retinols can cause this. Alas, by constantly putting products through their paces, even beauty editors commit crimes of beauty. And so, recently, my skin barrier has been out of whack. Sensitive, (everything stung), dry (I was shedding like a reptile), and producing enough oil to deep-fry a Mars Bar. So how do you build back your skin\u2019s barrier? By simplifying your regime. I swapped a foam wash for an oily cleanser, took a break from acids and slathered my face in Verso\u2019s Nourishing Cream. This product is incredible. It is buttery light yet deeply hydrating \u2013 it sinks into the skin as opposed to sitting on it. One of the key ingredients is niacinamide, which generally brightens and smooths and, because it is formulated with fatty acids and ceramides, it isn\u2019t harsh. Three days later, my skin barrier is back in business. <em>Verso Nourishing Cream \u00a395, <a href=\"http://cultbeauty.co.uk\">cultbeauty.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>On my radar: Cult curls, facials overnight and a fatigue-buster</h2> <p><strong>Curl power </strong>This cult haircare brand has long been a curly girl hair staple Stateside.

      "body": "<p>Valentine\u2019s week. Red roses incoming, but what to talk about when we talk about love? I am not here to tell you not to buy roses (well I am, but in bushes in season please). I thought instead to explore my love for gardening, how it happened. How, although I am attracted to its essential solitary nature, it can be enhanced when I am sharing its pleasure with someone.</p> <p>With Mary, who lets us grow on part of Plot 29. For my simple joy of working alongside her, without much time for chat, though humping manure helps, a little heavy lifting. And her quiet companionship.</p> <p>With Howard, a gardening hero. Gifted with a truthful eye, the ability to see beauty obscured by surroundings, an appreciation of becoming \u2013 the essence of gardening \u2013 encouraging seedlings to grow, to make a home.</p> <p>With Henri, who cleverly avoids the allotment, but has an architect\u2019s eye with plants, finding their place, an expression of space. We work harder together at the beach hut, reshaping, rewilding, planting trees, bushes, naturalising bulbs, pulling up brambles (though she\u2019s more impatient with weeds than me).

      "bodyText": "Valentine\u2019s week. Red roses incoming, but what to talk about when we talk about love? I am not here to tell you not to buy roses (well I am, but in bushes in season please). I thought instead to explore my love for gardening, how it happened. How, although I am attracted to its essential solitary nature, it can be enhanced when I am sharing its pleasure with someone. With Mary, who lets us grow on part of Plot 29. For my simple joy of working alongside her, without much time for chat, though humping manure helps, a little heavy lifting. And her quiet companionship. With Howard, a gardening hero. Gifted with a truthful eye, the ability to see beauty obscured by surroundings, an appreciation of becoming \u2013 the essence of gardening \u2013 encouraging seedlings to grow, to make a home. With Henri, who cleverly avoids the allotment, but has an architect\u2019s eye with plants, finding their place, an expression of space. We work harder together at the beach hut, reshaping, rewilding, planting trees, bushes, naturalising bulbs, pulling up brambles (though she\u2019s more impatient with weeds than me). The work of letting in light. One of the things that links gardening with these three is the lack of a need to talk (a weakness with me). Here, garden chatter is largely left to the birds. Looking back: with Dudley, my foster father, who worked us hard with rakes and sheers and mowing grass. More concerned with making his garden mark than me, but gifting his love of working with land. He was maybe better with inanimate objects than boys, but expert in making safe space. I owe him everything. Finally, with Christopher, my late brother, who haunts me.

In contrast to the downlit lobby, the 14th-floor space looks like some faux beachside cabin: floppy palm fronds, grubby, white-painted floorboards, huge raffia lampshades and rickety-looking bamboo-style furniture that makes a man of my size nervous. Music booms around the raw brick, concrete and wood space. The young people here do not seem to notice. We are first shown to armchair-style seating that makes us sink so low, we could shovel dinner straight off the table into our mouths without lifting it. We ask to move to a standard table. They oblige. It\u2019s not as if they\u2019re full.</p> <p>Which is where we meet our waiter. People complain when I criticise waiters, given the dismal pay and the misery of dealing with people in general and me in particular. I sympathise. We all hate people and I hate me. But service is a part of the deal and if it\u2019s administered with all the grace of an unlubricated colonoscopy, it has to be mentioned. He insists he will explain the menu, which mostly involves telling us what they do not have: such is the way of a seafood restaurant dependent on that day\u2019s catch. I start to order. He looks at me and nods. I ask if he\u2019s perhaps planning on taking notes. He replies with one word. \u201cNo.\u201d You\u2019re really not? \u201cNo.\u201d Fair enough. The first three dishes land about five minutes later before the wine has arrived. I ask politely if we might have our wine with our food. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"475a2ece804cd521e7f921cd3b7e487d45067900\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/475a2ece804cd521e7f921cd3b7e487d45067900/48_300_5473_3284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Light on crab, heavy on flour\u2019: crab bu\u00f1uelos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Light on crab, heavy on flour\u2019: crab bu\u00f1uelos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, when the mains turn up, a side dish of warm fava beans with grated egg and herbed breadcrumbs is missing. He looks baffled when I raise this. A suspicious soul might wonder whether perhaps, without a notebook, it had been forgotten. But that\u2019s unfair. He assures us he\u2019d told us it was not available. Both of us tell him he hadn\u2019t said any such thing. He doesn\u2019t offer to get something else. I do understand clams not being available, but what kitchen runs out of fava beans, breadcrumbs and eggs?</p> <p>As to that food, it brings a casual London violence to the knotty business of pricing: a small plate of sea bream crudo is \u00a318. It\u2019s a pleasant enough plate of raw fish, but reminds me of Coco Chanel\u2019s advice to stand in front of a mirror once dressed and remove one item before going out. It\u2019s decorated with the punch of romesco sauce, the saltiness of black olive tapenade and what they call a pepper tartar, another way of saying chopped up peppers. Two of those would have been fine; three is too many. Half a dozen small crab bu\u00f1uelos are \u00a312.50. I expected filled spheres of fried dough. These are more like b\u00e9chamel-filled croquetas. They are light on the crab and heavy on flour that hasn\u2019t quite been cooked out. Salvation comes in the form of French gillardeau oysters that are sweet and meaty and rewarding, as they should be at \u00a34 each.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0747917d869497f1cd8e6b4e1e1cc3b7745d4f85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0747917d869497f1cd8e6b4e1e1cc3b7745d4f85/0_194_5459_3276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A great piece of fish, but \u00a318\u2019: whole boned mackerel dressed with chilli and paprika.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A great piece of fish, but \u00a318\u2019: whole boned mackerel dressed with chilli and paprika.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s tiresome when I bang on about price, isn\u2019t it? Sorry, but it\u2019s not going to stop. Plaice on the bone with piri-piri sauce is \u00a326. How much of a fish would you expect for that? We get half a fish. I find myself wondering where the other half is. It comes away neatly from that bone and the big fiery stew with it has just enough kick. Ditto a whole boned mackerel, opened out and dressed with lots of fresh chilli and smoked paprika. It\u2019s a great piece of fish, with defined tension. It stands up well to the big flavours. It\u2019s \u00a318. By now I\u2019m proper grumpy. The music throbs, the beardy waiters rush around looking earnest and the \u00a332 bottle of godello isn\u2019t taking the edge off. It\u2019s the nearest thing to an affordable wine on a list which has massive choice, but only if you spend more than \u00a340.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef5740104fafa9896369723344380bfda94dc956\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef5740104fafa9896369723344380bfda94dc956/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Manchego is rarely the answer\u2019: a gluten-free manchego cheesecake in search of a base.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Manchego is rarely the answer\u2019: a gluten-free manchego cheesecake in search of a base.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so to dessert. A trio of filled, glazed doughnuts are a moment of joy. A gluten-free manchego cheesecake would have been great, perhaps with the addition of gluten. It really could have done with a base. Grating fresh manchego over the top didn\u2019t help. Manchego is rarely the answer to anything. Most weird is a delightfully sharp lemon granita, with scoops of Chantilly cream which, against the ice, are just so much claggy fat. On the side is a shot of Izarra liqueur, the kind of caustic spirit you drink too much of on a cheap summer holiday, before an ill-advised assignation leading only to regret and a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a503289165b2e0690220a54fbb8432f23b5cbe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a503289165b2e0690220a54fbb8432f23b5cbe2/0_118_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Moment of joy\u2019: a trio of doughnuts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Moment of joy\u2019: a trio of doughnuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At one point I try to move the stinky paraffin lamp away and burn my fingers on the glass. As I wince, I look up and spot the industrial sprinkler system across the ceiling. My fingers are sore, my ears are ringing and I\u2019m feeling like a shmuck for being here. All it would take to make everything stop is for the menu to accidentally catch alight on the lamp and the system to trigger. That at least would be an entertaining end to the evening.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>For somewhere serving great seafood without the rattling bass line, grasping prices and lousy service, head to <a href=\"https://oystermen.co.uk/\">Oystermen</a> Seafood Bar &amp; Kitchen in London\u2019s Covent Garden.

We are first shown to armchair-style seating that makes us sink so low, we could shovel dinner straight off the table into our mouths without lifting it. We ask to move to a standard table. They oblige. It\u2019s not as if they\u2019re full. Which is where we meet our waiter. People complain when I criticise waiters, given the dismal pay and the misery of dealing with people in general and me in particular. I sympathise. We all hate people and I hate me. But service is a part of the deal and if it\u2019s administered with all the grace of an unlubricated colonoscopy, it has to be mentioned. He insists he will explain the menu, which mostly involves telling us what they do not have: such is the way of a seafood restaurant dependent on that day\u2019s catch. I start to order. He looks at me and nods. I ask if he\u2019s perhaps planning on taking notes. He replies with one word. \u201cNo.\u201d You\u2019re really not? \u201cNo.\u201d Fair enough. The first three dishes land about five minutes later before the wine has arrived. I ask politely if we might have our wine with our food. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d Later, when the mains turn up, a side dish of warm fava beans with grated egg and herbed breadcrumbs is missing. He looks baffled when I raise this. A suspicious soul might wonder whether perhaps, without a notebook, it had been forgotten. But that\u2019s unfair. He assures us he\u2019d told us it was not available. Both of us tell him he hadn\u2019t said any such thing. He doesn\u2019t offer to get something else. I do understand clams not being available, but what kitchen runs out of fava beans, breadcrumbs and eggs? As to that food, it brings a casual London violence to the knotty business of pricing: a small plate of sea bream crudo is \u00a318. It\u2019s a pleasant enough plate of raw fish, but reminds me of Coco Chanel\u2019s advice to stand in front of a mirror once dressed and remove one item before going out. It\u2019s decorated with the punch of romesco sauce, the saltiness of black olive tapenade and what they call a pepper tartar, another way of saying chopped up peppers. Two of those would have been fine; three is too many. Half a dozen small crab bu\u00f1uelos are \u00a312.50. I expected filled spheres of fried dough. These are more like b\u00e9chamel-filled croquetas. They are light on the crab and heavy on flour that hasn\u2019t quite been cooked out. Salvation comes in the form of French gillardeau oysters that are sweet and meaty and rewarding, as they should be at \u00a34 each. It\u2019s tiresome when I bang on about price, isn\u2019t it? Sorry, but it\u2019s not going to stop. Plaice on the bone with piri-piri sauce is \u00a326. How much of a fish would you expect for that? We get half a fish. I find myself wondering where the other half is. It comes away neatly from that bone and the big fiery stew with it has just enough kick. Ditto a whole boned mackerel, opened out and dressed with lots of fresh chilli and smoked paprika. It\u2019s a great piece of fish, with defined tension. It stands up well to the big flavours. It\u2019s \u00a318. By now I\u2019m proper grumpy. The music throbs, the beardy waiters rush around looking earnest and the \u00a332 bottle of godello isn\u2019t taking the edge off. It\u2019s the nearest thing to an affordable wine on a list which has massive choice, but only if you spend more than \u00a340. And so to dessert. A trio of filled, glazed doughnuts are a moment of joy. A gluten-free manchego cheesecake would have been great, perhaps with the addition of gluten. It really could have done with a base. Grating fresh manchego over the top didn\u2019t help. Manchego is rarely the answer to anything. Most weird is a delightfully sharp lemon granita, with scoops of Chantilly cream which, against the ice, are just so much claggy fat. On the side is a shot of Izarra liqueur, the kind of caustic spirit you drink too much of on a cheap summer holiday, before an ill-advised assignation leading only to regret and a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic. At one point I try to move the stinky paraffin lamp away and burn my fingers on the glass. As I wince, I look up and spot the industrial sprinkler system across the ceiling. My fingers are sore, my ears are ringing and I\u2019m feeling like a shmuck for being here. All it would take to make everything stop is for the menu to accidentally catch alight on the lamp and the system to trigger. That at least would be an entertaining end to the evening. News bites For somewhere serving great seafood without the rattling bass line, grasping prices and lousy service, head to Oystermen Seafood Bar &amp; Kitchen in London\u2019s Covent Garden. There, the oysters come naked or dressed: with spicy buffalo sauce and kosho for example, or with smoked bacon, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco. Follow that with roasted halibut, whole marinated sea bream or get busy with the accessories and have the whole Devon brown crab with aioli (oystermen.co.uk). Nour Cash and Carry, a venerable shop in Brixton\u2019s covered Market Row, known for its massive range of cheap ingredients serving the area\u2019s diverse community, is being threatened with eviction by new landlords Hondo Enterprises. Hondo, run by wealthy Texan DJ Taylor McWilliams, insist they need the space for an electricity substation, but Nour, which has traded for over two decades, say they have not yet been offered an appropriate alternative. A petition is available to sign in store. Just three months after he opened Tandem, in Leicester\u2019s Highcross shopping centre, chef Cyrus Todiwala has withdrawn from the business, which has a menu of dishes from across the Indian sub-continent. \u201cUnfortunately, there were differences in vision,\u201d he told Caterer magazine, \u201cI decided it was best to pull back.\u201d Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

Yet against a backdrop of criticisms that the broadcaster has failed to keep pace with evolving lifestyles, it now faces an existential political threat: last week, Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/tv-licence-could-be-abolished-from-2027-says-nicky-morgan?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">floated the abolition of the licence fee</a> that funds it, from 2027 onwards.</p> <p>The case for investment in public service broadcasting is as strong today as it was a century ago. From the production of quality news, to the creation of shared cultural anchors, to the fostering of new British creative talent, the BBC has enriched the fabric of our cultural life over the decades, and through its reporting has helped to speak truth to power. Watched and admired around the globe \u2013 BBC One was rated <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmcumeds/315/315.pdf\" title=\"\">highest for quality</a> in an international survey of 66 television channels \u2013 it is an important source of soft power on the world stage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Although far from perfect, it is a hugely important  institution that helps hold the political establishment to account</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Its detractors argue that state-subsidised broadcasting simply crowds out other players that would flourish in a free market. That is wrong on many levels. Some of the BBC\u2019s most important output, including much of its news reporting, children\u2019s programming and local radio, would not be replicated by the free market, particularly at a time when advertising revenue is shrinking. The BBC\u2019s public service mission positively influences what gets produced by the rest of the market and <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/ourbeeb/case-for-bbc-research-underpinnings/#sdfootnote4sym\" title=\"\">economic research</a> shows that public service broadcasting boosts commercial production.</p> <p>Yet the BBC\u2019s great strength \u2013 its freedom to produce content that is not dictated purely by market forces \u2013 is also inevitably a weakness. It can use that freedom to create market-shaping programming ahead of its time, But it also lacks the short-term market pressure to evolve. Ofcom has warned that the BBC risks a \u201clost generation\u201d unless it can retain and engage younger viewers, who are consuming a shrinking amount of BBC content as they turn to streaming services on mobile devices. But it is <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0026/173735/second-bbc-annual-report.pdf\" title=\"\">struggling to do so</a>.

Attacks on the BBC fit neatly into the narrative that he is championing the interests of the people in the face of a corrupt elite and they have been amplified by the Brexit-supporting parts of the press that would stand to gain commercially from the BBC\u2019s demise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/01/bbc-attack-politicians-new-technology-survival-strategy\">Hostile politicians, cuts and controversy: why the BBC has never been so vulnerable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so, in the wake of David Cameron\u2019s 2015 decision to force the BBC to take on the cost of free TV licences for the over-75s \u2013 or scrap them itself \u2013 Johnson has launched <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-decriminalising-tv-licence-evasion/consultation-on-decriminalising-tv-licence-evasion\" title=\"\">a rushed consultation</a> on decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee.

      "body": "<p>The war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syria</a>, which will enter its 10th year next month, shames the world. Powerful western countries, namely the US, Britain and their European allies, could and should have done more to stop it. Instead, they have failed to act decisively as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\" title=\"\">Bashar al-Assad</a>\u2019s regime perpetrated countless repeat atrocities against the Syrian people, assisted by Russia and Iran. This butchery continues.</p> <p>The siege of rebel-held <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/eastern-mediterranean/syria/eleventh-hour-idlib-syrias-last-rebel-bastion\" title=\"\">Idlib city</a>, last refuge of 1 million civilians in north-west Syria, is approaching a climax. Relentless bombing by Syrian and Russian forces, directed by drones, takes a terrible toll. More than 200 people have died since the beginning of the year. Nearly 600,000 have been displaced. About <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/02/world/syria-idlib-children/index.html\" title=\"\">6,000 children fled</a> their homes each day last week. At least half a million people have <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/syria\" title=\"\">been killed</a> since 2011.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only governments that failed in their legal and moral duty to protect life and uphold international law. More than any other recent crisis, Syria has exposed the fatal impotence of a divided UN security council. Britain\u2019s parliament got Syria badly wrong. In 2013, the House of Commons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/30/cameron-mps-syria\" title=\"\">running scared</a> of another Iraq, blocked military intervention. The US Congress followed suit.</p> <p>A massive influx of war refugees shook Europe in 2015 and could do so again but still the EU cannot muster a humane collective approach. The UN\u2019s \u201cpeace process\u201d lacked energetic support and was sidelined by a self-interested rival effort involving Russia, Iran and Turkey. Unsurprisingly, ceasefire after ceasefire has broken down.</p> <p>The enormous scale of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/inquiry-strikes-blow-to-russian-denials-of-syria-chemical-attack\" title=\"\">Syrian catastrophe</a> can be measured in other ways, for example, by the damage done to the international consensus banning chemical weapons and to humanitarian law in general. Another dreadful consequence was the reprieve it provided Sunni jihadists defeated and dispersed by the Iraq \u201csurge\u201d. Syria gave the Islamists a <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/01/16/isis-after-baghdadi/\" title=\"\">new battlefront</a>. The result was Islamic State\u2019s caliphate.</p> <p>For Britain, which joined a coalition to crush Isis \u2013 but not to stop the wider war \u2013 the blowback from its incoherent, inconsistent policy continues, in the form of raised terrorist threat levels and increasing Islamophobia. The problem of below-the-radar Islamist radicalisation, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51364047\" title=\"\">highlighted</a> by the terrible Streatham and London Bridge attacks, is exacerbated by tensions fuelled by Syria\u2019s war.</p> <p>Respect for civil liberties in Britain has also been negatively affected, as shown by the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/shamima-begum-loses-appeal-against-removal-of-citizenship\" title=\"\">Shamima Begum</a>, a naive, British-born teenager of Bangladeshi descent who travelled to Syria to join the jihadists, got married and now wants to return home. Last week, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/shamima-begum-loses-appeal-against-removal-of-citizenship\" title=\"\">lost the initial stage</a> of her appeal against the Home Office\u2019s decision to revoke her UK citizenship.

      "bodyText": "The war in Syria, which will enter its 10th year next month, shames the world. Powerful western countries, namely the US, Britain and their European allies, could and should have done more to stop it. Instead, they have failed to act decisively as Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime perpetrated countless repeat atrocities against the Syrian people, assisted by Russia and Iran. This butchery continues. The siege of rebel-held Idlib city, last refuge of 1 million civilians in north-west Syria, is approaching a climax. Relentless bombing by Syrian and Russian forces, directed by drones, takes a terrible toll. More than 200 people have died since the beginning of the year. Nearly 600,000 have been displaced. About 6,000 children fled their homes each day last week. At least half a million people have been killed since 2011. It\u2019s not only governments that failed in their legal and moral duty to protect life and uphold international law. More than any other recent crisis, Syria has exposed the fatal impotence of a divided UN security council. Britain\u2019s parliament got Syria badly wrong. In 2013, the House of Commons, running scared of another Iraq, blocked military intervention. The US Congress followed suit. A massive influx of war refugees shook Europe in 2015 and could do so again but still the EU cannot muster a humane collective approach. The UN\u2019s \u201cpeace process\u201d lacked energetic support and was sidelined by a self-interested rival effort involving Russia, Iran and Turkey. Unsurprisingly, ceasefire after ceasefire has broken down. The enormous scale of the Syrian catastrophe can be measured in other ways, for example, by the damage done to the international consensus banning chemical weapons and to humanitarian law in general. Another dreadful consequence was the reprieve it provided Sunni jihadists defeated and dispersed by the Iraq \u201csurge\u201d. Syria gave the Islamists a new battlefront. The result was Islamic State\u2019s caliphate. For Britain, which joined a coalition to crush Isis \u2013 but not to stop the wider war \u2013 the blowback from its incoherent, inconsistent policy continues, in the form of raised terrorist threat levels and increasing Islamophobia. The problem of below-the-radar Islamist radicalisation, highlighted by the terrible Streatham and London Bridge attacks, is exacerbated by tensions fuelled by Syria\u2019s war. Respect for civil liberties in Britain has also been negatively affected, as shown by the case of Shamima Begum, a naive, British-born teenager of Bangladeshi descent who travelled to Syria to join the jihadists, got married and now wants to return home. Last week, she lost the initial stage of her appeal against the Home Office\u2019s decision to revoke her UK citizenship. As we\u2019ve said before, the government\u2019s treatment of British wives, children and orphans of jihadists is unfair and short-sighted. The correct approach to British citizens such as Begum, however abhorrent their views, is not to abandon our values or to junk due process. Begum should be allowed back to the UK and put on trial, if the evidence against her allows. The same approach should apply to captured fighters. Unchecked chaos in Syria has meanwhile allowed foreign state actors with no interest in stemming human suffering to exploit the situation. Russia\u2019s behaviour is unforgivable. Like Assad, Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, has a case to answer for alleged war crimes. Turkey and Qatar should sever links to anti-western Islamist groups. Israel must stop using Syria as a battleground for a not-so-covert war against Iran. Past failures should not discourage an urgent new effort to avoid impending calamity in Idlib and end the war. Idlib\u2019s doctors and medical staff are calling on Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, to intervene personally. Guterres should go there \u2013 and see for himself the wreck of humanity, the ruin of a nation and the shame of a once-proud international system of laws.",

And, let\u2019s not forget, he\u2019s trying to buy the presidency.</p> <p>America has had some talented and capable presidents who were enormously wealthy \u2013 Franklin D Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt, John F Kennedy, for example. The problem lies at the nexus of wealth and power, where those with great wealth use it to gain great power. This is how oligarchy destroys democracy.</p> <p>The word \u201coligarchy\u201d comes from the Greek word <em>oligarkhes</em>, meaning \u201cfew to rule or command\u201d. It refers to a government of and by a few exceedingly rich people or families who control the major institutions of society. Oligarchs may try to hide their power behind those institutions, or excuse their power through philanthropy and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/corporatesocialresponsibility\">corporate social responsibility</a>\u201d. But no one should be fooled. An oligarchy is not a democracy.</p> <p>Even a system that calls itself a democracy can become an oligarchy if power becomes concentrated in the hands of a corporate and financial elite. Their power and wealth increase over time as they make laws that favor themselves, manipulate financial markets to their advantage, and create or exploit economic monopolies that put even more wealth into their pockets.</p> <p>Since 1980, the share of America\u2019s wealth owned by the richest 400 Americans has quadrupled while the share owned by the entire bottom half of America has declined. The richest 130,000 families in America now own nearly as much as the bottom 90% \u2013 117 million families \u2013 combined. The three richest Americans own as much as the entire bottom half of the population. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/#6f889f317e2f\">According to Forbes,</a> Michael Bloomberg is the eighth richest.</p> <p>All this has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the political power of the super-wealthy and an equally dramatic decline in the political influence of everyone else. Unlike income or wealth, power is a zero-sum game. The more of it at the top, the less of it anywhere else.</p> <p>In the election cycle of 2016, the richest one-hundredth of 1% of Americans \u2013 24,949 extraordinarily wealthy people \u2013 accounted for a record 40% of all campaign contributions. By contrast, in 1980 the top 0.01% accounted for only 15% of all contributions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/08/real-power-is-fear-donald-trump-machiavelli-boucheron\">'Real power is fear': what Machiavelli tells us about Trump in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Make no mistake: the frustrations and insecurities that fueled Trump\u2019s rise \u2013 and are still the basis of his support \u2013 have their origin in this power shift, which has left most Americans with a small slice of the nation\u2019s prosperity and almost no voice in its politics.</p> <p>A half-century ago, when America had a large and growing middle class, those on the left wanted stronger social safety nets and more public investment in schools, roads and research. Those on the right sought greater reliance on the free market.</p> <p>But as power and wealth have moved to the top, everyone else \u2013 whether on the old right or the old left \u2013 has become disempowered and less secure. Today the great divide is not between left and right. It\u2019s between democracy and oligarchy.</p> <p>Bloomberg is indubitably part of that oligarchy. That should not automatically disqualify him but it should set off alarms. If the only way we can get rid of the sociopathic tyrant named Trump is with an oligarch named Bloomberg, we will have to choose the oligarch. Yet I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. Oligarchy is better than tyranny.

But he\u2019s also a champion of Wall Street. He fought against the milquetoast reforms following the near-meltdown of 2008. His personal fortune is every bit as opaque as Trump\u2019s. Through his dozen years as mayor of New York he refused to disclose his federal taxes. Even as a candidate for president, he still hasn\u2019t given a date for their release. And, let\u2019s not forget, he\u2019s trying to buy the presidency. America has had some talented and capable presidents who were enormously wealthy \u2013 Franklin D Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt, John F Kennedy, for example. The problem lies at the nexus of wealth and power, where those with great wealth use it to gain great power. This is how oligarchy destroys democracy. The word \u201coligarchy\u201d comes from the Greek word oligarkhes, meaning \u201cfew to rule or command\u201d. It refers to a government of and by a few exceedingly rich people or families who control the major institutions of society. Oligarchs may try to hide their power behind those institutions, or excuse their power through philanthropy and \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d. But no one should be fooled. An oligarchy is not a democracy. Even a system that calls itself a democracy can become an oligarchy if power becomes concentrated in the hands of a corporate and financial elite. Their power and wealth increase over time as they make laws that favor themselves, manipulate financial markets to their advantage, and create or exploit economic monopolies that put even more wealth into their pockets. Since 1980, the share of America\u2019s wealth owned by the richest 400 Americans has quadrupled while the share owned by the entire bottom half of America has declined. The richest 130,000 families in America now own nearly as much as the bottom 90% \u2013 117 million families \u2013 combined. The three richest Americans own as much as the entire bottom half of the population. According to Forbes, Michael Bloomberg is the eighth richest. All this has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the political power of the super-wealthy and an equally dramatic decline in the political influence of everyone else. Unlike income or wealth, power is a zero-sum game. The more of it at the top, the less of it anywhere else. In the election cycle of 2016, the richest one-hundredth of 1% of Americans \u2013 24,949 extraordinarily wealthy people \u2013 accounted for a record 40% of all campaign contributions. By contrast, in 1980 the top 0.01% accounted for only 15% of all contributions. Make no mistake: the frustrations and insecurities that fueled Trump\u2019s rise \u2013 and are still the basis of his support \u2013 have their origin in this power shift, which has left most Americans with a small slice of the nation\u2019s prosperity and almost no voice in its politics. A half-century ago, when America had a large and growing middle class, those on the left wanted stronger social safety nets and more public investment in schools, roads and research. Those on the right sought greater reliance on the free market. But as power and wealth have moved to the top, everyone else \u2013 whether on the old right or the old left \u2013 has become disempowered and less secure. Today the great divide is not between left and right. It\u2019s between democracy and oligarchy. Bloomberg is indubitably part of that oligarchy. That should not automatically disqualify him but it should set off alarms. If the only way we can get rid of the sociopathic tyrant named Trump is with an oligarch named Bloomberg, we will have to choose the oligarch. Yet I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. Oligarchy is better than tyranny. But neither is as good as democracy.

It tells the tale of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/wework\" title=\"\">WeWork</a>, the office-space company started by Adam Neumann in New York in 2010. WeWork\u2019s USP was that its office spaces were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jan/11/wework-transforming-office-life-and-home-life-carole-cadwalladr\" title=\"\">more than a collection of chichi hot desks</a> for trendy entrepreneurs trying to hustle a living. WeWork was a community, a place for those clever young people to meet like-minded others so they could all work together to make nice stuff. And nice money.</p> <p>Unfortunately \u2013 and you may be ahead of me here \u2013 the only people making proper money out of all this were Neumann and his business partner, Miguel McKelvey. Neumann was, and probably still is, possessed of a remarkable charisma. Tall, long-haired, good-looking, he not only persuaded small businesses to rent his spaces, but also sweet-talked a staggering amount of rich people into investing in his company, which just last year was valued at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a18aa1a0-e390-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59\" title=\"\">$47bn</a>.</p> <p>We\u2019re three episodes into this six-part show, and the sense of imminent failure is building. Also piling up is a huge amount of schadenfreude, the most satisfying emotional reward of such tales. It\u2019s fun. <em>WeCrashed</em>, like all Wondery series, is a lickety-split listen, pacy and slightly camp. (It\u2019s interesting how Wondery has broken with the standard clever-clever, vocally fried podcast presentation style of a few years back, and instead promoted a sort of TV biopic narration: cheesy but effective.) Presenter David Brown, who also hosts <a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/business-wars/\" title=\"\"><em>Business Wars</em></a>, conveys wryness as well as moral incredulity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Almost all of these scammers share the same modus operandi: they promise love, as well as cash</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the past year or so, we\u2019ve seen many of these rise-and-fall-of-the-huckster money podcasts, from Radio 5 Live\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\"><em>The Missing Cryptoqueen</em></a> to <a href=\"https://abcaudio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/\" title=\"\"><em>The Drop</em><em>out</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/07/escaping-nxivm-anatomy-loneliness-life-alone-music-of-spheres\" title=\"\"><em>Escaping NXIVM</em></a> (slightly different, though it is, in the end, about money).

      "bodyText": "WeCrashed (Wondery) The Price of Football (priceoffootball.com) I\u2019ve paid my tax bill, so now I\u2019m strong enough to listen to shows about money, and Wondery\u2019s WeCrashed is a how-did-they-get-away-with-it? cautionary financial tale that I\u2019ve been very much enjoying. It tells the tale of WeWork, the office-space company started by Adam Neumann in New York in 2010. WeWork\u2019s USP was that its office spaces were more than a collection of chichi hot desks for trendy entrepreneurs trying to hustle a living. WeWork was a community, a place for those clever young people to meet like-minded others so they could all work together to make nice stuff. And nice money. Unfortunately \u2013 and you may be ahead of me here \u2013 the only people making proper money out of all this were Neumann and his business partner, Miguel McKelvey. Neumann was, and probably still is, possessed of a remarkable charisma. Tall, long-haired, good-looking, he not only persuaded small businesses to rent his spaces, but also sweet-talked a staggering amount of rich people into investing in his company, which just last year was valued at $47bn. We\u2019re three episodes into this six-part show, and the sense of imminent failure is building. Also piling up is a huge amount of schadenfreude, the most satisfying emotional reward of such tales. It\u2019s fun. WeCrashed, like all Wondery series, is a lickety-split listen, pacy and slightly camp. (It\u2019s interesting how Wondery has broken with the standard clever-clever, vocally fried podcast presentation style of a few years back, and instead promoted a sort of TV biopic narration: cheesy but effective.) Presenter David Brown, who also hosts Business Wars, conveys wryness as well as moral incredulity. In the past year or so, we\u2019ve seen many of these rise-and-fall-of-the-huckster money podcasts, from Radio 5 Live\u2019s The Missing Cryptoqueen to The Dropout to Escaping NXIVM (slightly different, though it is, in the end, about money). Unlike these, WeWork\u2019s founders appear to be guilty of hubris and hype, rather than anything criminal, but it\u2019s noticeable that almost all of these set-ups share the same modus operandi: they promise love as well as cash. They give inspiring speeches that unite crowds while making each person feel an individual. They are, in short, cult leaders (literally, in the case of NXIVM\u2019s Keith Raniere), and there are two key quotes in WeCrashed that makes this clear. The first comes from someone whose company was taken over by WeWork, who says of Neumann: \u201cI\u2019m always suspicious of people who are charming, because my dad told me that Ted Bundy was charming\u201d; the second is a financial commentator who identifies the early 2000s as a time \u201cwhere disruptive or interesting ideas with a charismatic leader were attracting such insanely cheap capital that they could do insanely irrational things\u201d. It\u2019s amazing that even the very rich fall for high-wattage BS, but they clearly do. And, unless you\u2019re one of those who lost money, it\u2019s immensely enjoyable finding out just how the BS-ers do it. In Neumann\u2019s case, it involved actually banging a gong every time a WeWorker achieved something he thought was good. More money in another podcast, The Price of Football. Obviously, this one isn\u2019t for anyone who actively dislikes football, but for even a casual fan (me), it\u2019s a very interesting listen.

Day asks the right questions and Maguire is impressive with his research: in last week\u2019s show he pointed out that a newspaper financial football story was completely wrong, without being rude about it.

Only two episodes in and they\u2019ve zoomed straight up the iTunes chart, covering impeachment for dummies and the problem with boomers with much wit and joie de vivre. Swearing guaranteed. Americast Brexitcast was a smash success for the BBC, so what to do now it\u2019s over too? Well, two things. First, the Brexitcast crew will return soon with Newscast, covering UK politics.

And has been ever since Praxiteles\u2019s Venus/Aphrodite of Knidos, \u201cthe goddess of love \u2013 no, let\u2019s call her what it is, goddess of <em>sex</em>\u201d, in the fourth century BC. Pretty much since then, the story of the nude, especially in the religion-muddled west, has been the story of the male gaze.</p> <p>Ms Beard \u2013 and an equally enthralling quasi-companion piece the night before, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000f4d2\" title=\"\">The Story of the Nude</a></strong>, fronted by an equally splendid Kate Bryan \u2013 took us assiduously through the many weaselly ways in which men have sought to camouflage their right to look at women in the scud through the fig leaf, as it were, of \u201cart\u201d. From the first, the sculptures and the reclining nudes were depicted as innocently \u201ccaught\u201d, half-bathing or somehow sleepily compromised, often in faux-biblical/classical narratives. It was possibly only, as Bryan argued, with Goya\u2019s <em>Clothed Maja</em> and <em>Naked Maja</em> that the male gaze was dared to be confronted, even rebuked: a <em>real woman</em>, dark eyes gazing out defiant, arms thrown back, made the spectators no longer feel safe outside the frame.</p> <p>And this erotica/art fuzzy boundary was seldom better encapsulated than in Gustave Courbet\u2019s 1866 painting <em><a href=\"https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/the-origin-of-the-world-3122.html\" title=\"\">The Origin of the World</a></em>, called once \u201cthe Mona Lisa of vaginas\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ve just had to Google that to remember Courbet\u2019s spelling and wish I hadn\u2019t. Beard mused whether the critical talk, all the \u201cdelicate, amber colour scheme\u201d and the rest, and the very title, might blurrify the lines by laundering, in the name of aestheticism, the beady-eyed, erotic male gaze. \u201cWhereas if it was just called, say, Jeanette\u2019s Pussy\u2026 \u201d Although I don\u2019t know quite why she had to bring poor Jeanette into it.</p> <p>Alarming, charming, hugely instructive, not least in that we got to see (male) televisual art critics of the 1960s and 70s making utter pawing Benny Hills of themselves; and Mary Beard is always brave enough to admit her intellectual doubts, for nothing in this ongoing art/porn debate was left writ in stone.

This year, not everything works, or works together.</p> <p>The (LA) HORDE company literally kick off in <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesbOqMl5U8\" title=\"\">To Da Bone</a></em>. Their hardstyle movement came out of the Belgian and Dutch club scene and involves stamping, pivoting and running on the spot in time with 150bpm music. Its dance antecedents are tap, line dancing and traditional Irish, with a dash of martial arts and parkour. Here the whole thing grinds on in grim silence and the dancers look like stone-faced army recruits warming up for a jog.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/23Q9HgDNxHhMgt7DKK9wD4T/max-revell\" title=\"\">Max Revell</a>, winner of the 2019 BBC Young Dancer competition, offers a soft, pity-evoking routine, <em>Unstrung</em>. With his black braces, short trousers and white-painted face, his wrists and feet connected by stretchy resistance bands, Revell resembles a cross between a mime and Frankenstein\u2019s blundering monster. The elastics pull him down and impede his popping and locking with hunches, trips and limps. Yet they also transform into crutches, supports and guide ropes. The choreography, by <a href=\"http://www.dicksonmbi.com/\" title=\"\">Dickson Mbi</a>, plays to Revell\u2019s strength, which is vulnerability.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p076vr3v\" title=\"\">Shree Savani</a> looks out of place rigged up in silks, jewellery and brocade, enacting a 3,000-year-old narrative based on ancient scriptures from Tamil Nadu. The 21-year-old was a BBC 2019 Young Dancer finalist, representing classical Indian bharatanatyam dance. But she holds the stage with pleasure and power, thanks to the boldness of choreographer <a href=\"https://britindia.org/bhagya-lakshmi-thyagarajan-performing-arts-envoy/\" title=\"\">Bhagya Lakshmi Thyagarajan</a>. Her piece, <em>Devi</em>, harnesses Hindu goddess energy and gives Savani some good stark positioning, chin up and hands aloft as if lassoing a fleeing minion.

Hours of dance video were put through the system, which then suggested possible subsequent phrases. This high concept, designed to generate non-narrative abstraction, reaches the stage as something earthy and fluid. Dancers cluster, building each other up in sleek cheerleader throws, before breaking away for a split second of spotlight-stealing.</p> <p>The evening\u2019s standout act is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/21/q-and-a-botis-seva-dance-hip-hop\" title=\"\">Botis Seva</a>\u2019s hip-hop theatre collective <a href=\"http://www.farfromthenorm.com/\" title=\"\">Far From the Norm</a><em>. </em>Their Olivier award-winning piece <em><a href=\"https://www.blkdog.co.uk/about\" title=\"\">BLKDOG</a></em> is a deeply compelling work about trauma. The juddering dancers, in tracksuits with the hoods pulled tight around their heads, resemble child asylum inmates or the doppelgangers in Jordan Peele\u2019s film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/24/us-review-jordan-peele-lupita-nyongo\" title=\"\">Us</a></em>. Seva\u2019s physical language is extraordinary: cowed, hunched figures scuttle and putter blindly, writhing and knotted. They keel over or beetle along in a tiptoed crouch. The images throughout are of being felled, hobbled and tripped, restrained or shackled. Be sure to catch the full performance of <em>BLKDOG</em> when it <a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2020/botis-seva-far-from-the-norm-blkdog/\" title=\"\">comes to the same venue in October</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWSbuvaO-oU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gWSbuvaO-oU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWSbuvaO-oU\">Watch a trailer for BLKDOG.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Seva\u2019s pain finds a sweetener in Ezequiel Lopez and Camila Alegre\u2019s three tangos. Their joyful set transitions from frisky flirtation \u2013 showcasing Alegre\u2019s jaw-dropping triple-speed kicks and leg wraps \u2013 to slow, soulful concentration.</p> <p>The last company, G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Variable, was founded by hip-hop dancers Sadeck Berrabah and Ammar Benbouzid. Their piece <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1F8hF8AQyo\" title=\"\">Labora RD</a></em> features performers clad in black, with their sleeves rolled up, forming geometric shapes with their forearms: cubes, prisms, fractals.

      "bodyText": "The annual Sampled festival, a fixture at Sadler\u2019s Wells since 2007, showcases different kinds of international dance. This year, not everything works, or works together. The (LA) HORDE company literally kick off in To Da Bone. Their hardstyle movement came out of the Belgian and Dutch club scene and involves stamping, pivoting and running on the spot in time with 150bpm music. Its dance antecedents are tap, line dancing and traditional Irish, with a dash of martial arts and parkour. Here the whole thing grinds on in grim silence and the dancers look like stone-faced army recruits warming up for a jog. Max Revell, winner of the 2019 BBC Young Dancer competition, offers a soft, pity-evoking routine, Unstrung. With his black braces, short trousers and white-painted face, his wrists and feet connected by stretchy resistance bands, Revell resembles a cross between a mime and Frankenstein\u2019s blundering monster. The elastics pull him down and impede his popping and locking with hunches, trips and limps. Yet they also transform into crutches, supports and guide ropes. The choreography, by Dickson Mbi, plays to Revell\u2019s strength, which is vulnerability. Shree Savani looks out of place rigged up in silks, jewellery and brocade, enacting a 3,000-year-old narrative based on ancient scriptures from Tamil Nadu. The 21-year-old was a BBC 2019 Young Dancer finalist, representing classical Indian bharatanatyam dance. But she holds the stage with pleasure and power, thanks to the boldness of choreographer Bhagya Lakshmi Thyagarajan. Her piece, Devi, harnesses Hindu goddess energy and gives Savani some good stark positioning, chin up and hands aloft as if lassoing a fleeing minion. The crowd, openly tittering at first, is won over. Studio Wayne McGregor\u2019s project Living Archive has been conceived with Google\u2019s Arts and Culture Lab (has anything sounded more dystopian and oxymoronic?). Hours of dance video were put through the system, which then suggested possible subsequent phrases. This high concept, designed to generate non-narrative abstraction, reaches the stage as something earthy and fluid. Dancers cluster, building each other up in sleek cheerleader throws, before breaking away for a split second of spotlight-stealing. The evening\u2019s standout act is Botis Seva\u2019s hip-hop theatre collective Far From the Norm. Their Olivier award-winning piece BLKDOG is a deeply compelling work about trauma. The juddering dancers, in tracksuits with the hoods pulled tight around their heads, resemble child asylum inmates or the doppelgangers in Jordan Peele\u2019s film Us. Seva\u2019s physical language is extraordinary: cowed, hunched figures scuttle and putter blindly, writhing and knotted. They keel over or beetle along in a tiptoed crouch. The images throughout are of being felled, hobbled and tripped, restrained or shackled. Be sure to catch the full performance of BLKDOG when it comes to the same venue in October. Seva\u2019s pain finds a sweetener in Ezequiel Lopez and Camila Alegre\u2019s three tangos. Their joyful set transitions from frisky flirtation \u2013 showcasing Alegre\u2019s jaw-dropping triple-speed kicks and leg wraps \u2013 to slow, soulful concentration. The last company, G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Variable, was founded by hip-hop dancers Sadeck Berrabah and Ammar Benbouzid. Their piece Labora RD features performers clad in black, with their sleeves rolled up, forming geometric shapes with their forearms: cubes, prisms, fractals. It\u2019s interesting to see dance informed by graphic design, robotics and semaphore, but these dancers have no presence or chemistry and the piece has no soul. All griping is forgotten a few days later thanks to Michael Keegan-Dolan\u2019s exceptional M\u00e1m, which premiered in Ireland last autumn. Inspired by a community hall on the northern Dingle peninsula in County Kerry, the set features a low stage, from which the concertina player Cormac Begley and seven musicians from the Stargaze collective accompany 12 indefatigable dancers. The performers brilliantly enact an unstinting ritual summoning that changes from flirtation to combat, drunken morass to melancholy meandering. Keegan-Dolan and his company Tea\u010b Da\u1e41sa first came to prominence here in 2016 with his rapturously received take on Swan Lake. M\u00e1m more than vindicates that interest. His choreography constantly reverts to folk and communal forms: the round, the fling, the shindig, the square dance, the whirl. This could be a wedding party or a wake, a couples\u2019 dance or a competition, a rural disco or a witches\u2019 sabbath. The movement is frenetic and demanding, a head-messing flurry of spins, grabs, swoops, peevish strides and prowling flirtations leavened with blissed-out glides.

The Morrison government is attempting to balance competing forces within its party room by examining a proposal for a new coal-fired power station in north Queensland \u2013 a politically turbulent region for both major parties \u2013 while maintaining it is serious about reducing emissions.

I belong to the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C4%81puhi\"> Ng\u0101puhi</a> tribe, a tribe that descends from Waitangi and other parts of Northland. My ancestor is Hongi Hika, who was once a M\u0101ori rangatira (chief) of Ng\u0101puhi.</p> <p>The internal conflict I experienced as I stepped on to the grounds is one I have experienced my entire life.<em> </em>\u201cAm I M\u0101ori enough? Do I belong here? What if someone starts speaking te reo to me, what should I do? I should have been here years ago. I should be with other M\u0101ori, holding a banner, holding government accountable for all the wrongs and injustices M\u0101ori have suffered.\u201d</p> <p>My memories of past Waitangi days are this: a nice sleep in, a day out at the beach, hanging at some random festival, and in the evening I might turn the news on during dinner and see an army of angry M\u0101ori holding up a sign at Waitangi. And then I turn the TV off and never think about it until the next year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/06/new-zealands-waitangi-day-2020-celebrations-in-pictures\">New Zealand's Waitangi Day 2020 celebrations \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is nothing wrong with being at the beach on Waitangi Day but what <em>is </em>wrong is the general public, including many M\u0101ori, have no real understanding of the Treaty and how it affects us today. A covenant was made between Maori and Pakeha in 1840. That covenant was broken and the consequences have brutally traumatised Maori across generations, including my own family. This is not something that just happened in the past. This is affecting us now. As in today.</p> <p>I could easily talk about the impact of colonisation on our health. Maori statistically die earlier. My grandparents died in their fifties, before I was born. My understanding of Te Ao M\u0101ori was limited for a number of reasons. But one reason is, I missed out on sitting at my grandparents\u2019 feet and learning from them.</p> <p>Or I could talk about the over-representation of M\u0101ori in the criminal justice system.

      "bodyText": "This week, to mark Waitangi Day, the Guardian is publishing five pieces of commentary from M\u0101ori writers. I am ashamed to say this year was my first time at Waitangi. I am M\u0101ori, an indigenous person of New Zealand. I belong to the Ng\u0101puhi tribe, a tribe that descends from Waitangi and other parts of Northland. My ancestor is Hongi Hika, who was once a M\u0101ori rangatira (chief) of Ng\u0101puhi. The internal conflict I experienced as I stepped on to the grounds is one I have experienced my entire life. \u201cAm I M\u0101ori enough? Do I belong here? What if someone starts speaking te reo to me, what should I do? I should have been here years ago. I should be with other M\u0101ori, holding a banner, holding government accountable for all the wrongs and injustices M\u0101ori have suffered.\u201d My memories of past Waitangi days are this: a nice sleep in, a day out at the beach, hanging at some random festival, and in the evening I might turn the news on during dinner and see an army of angry M\u0101ori holding up a sign at Waitangi. And then I turn the TV off and never think about it until the next year. There is nothing wrong with being at the beach on Waitangi Day but what is wrong is the general public, including many M\u0101ori, have no real understanding of the Treaty and how it affects us today. A covenant was made between Maori and Pakeha in 1840. That covenant was broken and the consequences have brutally traumatised Maori across generations, including my own family. This is not something that just happened in the past. This is affecting us now. As in today. I could easily talk about the impact of colonisation on our health. Maori statistically die earlier. My grandparents died in their fifties, before I was born. My understanding of Te Ao M\u0101ori was limited for a number of reasons. But one reason is, I missed out on sitting at my grandparents\u2019 feet and learning from them. Or I could talk about the over-representation of M\u0101ori in the criminal justice system. Or how M\u0101ori lost 95% of their land in less than a hundred years. Now M\u0101ori are struggling to afford to rent a house, let alone buy one. How ironic is that? We can\u2019t even afford to live on our own land. These are all manifestations of the Treaty not being honoured. But this is not the worst part.

      "body": "<p>The new chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland will be hoping to make a mark when she unveils a fresh strategy next week for the 293-year-old lender alongside its annual earnings.</p> <p>Alison Rose, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/20/alison-rose-named-new-rbs-royal-bank-of-scotland-chief-executive\" title=\"\">appointed in November</a>, has already made history by becoming the first female boss at a major high street lender, but it\u2019s clear that she has ambitions beyond smashing the glass ceiling following a 27-year career at RBS.</p> <p>Rumours have been swirling for months about how far Rose will go in order to boost efficiency and coax the bank further into the 21st century. Last year RBS \u2013 bailed out during the financial crisis and still 62% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/02/rbs-to-hand-1bn-to-government-despite-gloomy-outlook\" title=\"\">admit </a>that it would miss cost-cutting goals and profitability targets of a 12% return on shareholders\u2019 funds in 2020.</p> <p>However, when results are published on Friday, headline profits are expected to surge, with consensus estimates among City analysts pointing to a 50% jump to \u00a32.5bn for 2019, driven by lower costs in some areas, as well as higher income generated by its mortgage business. If those estimates prove correct, Rose will be presiding over its third consecutive year of profit for the bank since its \u00a345bn state bailout in 2008.</p> <p>But there is more to be done, with RBS still trying to recover from its crisis-era fall from grace. Reports suggest that Rose has been mulling 3,700 job cuts at the high street retail bank, but analysts believe the NatWest Markets investment bank will come under the greatest scrutiny.</p> <p>NatWest Markets accounts for 5,100 of the group\u2019s 65,700 staff, and offers services such as currency trading, bonds, and loans for mergers and takeovers. But like most investment banks, its revenues have been hurt by a slowdown in fundraising and dealmaking by companies worried about global trade and wider political uncertainty. It helps to explain how NatWest Markets suffered a \u00a3193m loss in the third quarter, which, alongside provisions for payment protection insurance claims, pushed RBS to an operating loss of \u00a38m.</p> <p>RBS could cut its losses and ditch NatWest Markets altogether, but that would further diminish the UK\u2019s influence in the industry, with Lloyds and RBS already forced to slim down their operations following their respective government bailouts. As it stands, Barclays is considered the only British lender with a chance to challenge the dominance of US investment banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>In November, finance chief Katie Murray said the division was still \u201cstrategically important\u201d and that the leadership did not \u201csee a world with no NatWest Markets\u201d. Instead, analysts expect Rose to narrow its scope, which could mean exiting the rates-trading business that helps clients hedge against the ups and downs of financial markets.</p> <p>John Cronin, a financials analyst at stockbroker Goodbody, said Rose was also likely to spend more on technology, which could ultimately result in more job cuts.

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland will be hoping to make a mark when she unveils a fresh strategy next week for the 293-year-old lender alongside its annual earnings. Alison Rose, appointed in November, has already made history by becoming the first female boss at a major high street lender, but it\u2019s clear that she has ambitions beyond smashing the glass ceiling following a 27-year career at RBS. Rumours have been swirling for months about how far Rose will go in order to boost efficiency and coax the bank further into the 21st century. Last year RBS \u2013 bailed out during the financial crisis and still 62% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 was forced to admit that it would miss cost-cutting goals and profitability targets of a 12% return on shareholders\u2019 funds in 2020. However, when results are published on Friday, headline profits are expected to surge, with consensus estimates among City analysts pointing to a 50% jump to \u00a32.5bn for 2019, driven by lower costs in some areas, as well as higher income generated by its mortgage business. If those estimates prove correct, Rose will be presiding over its third consecutive year of profit for the bank since its \u00a345bn state bailout in 2008. But there is more to be done, with RBS still trying to recover from its crisis-era fall from grace. Reports suggest that Rose has been mulling 3,700 job cuts at the high street retail bank, but analysts believe the NatWest Markets investment bank will come under the greatest scrutiny. NatWest Markets accounts for 5,100 of the group\u2019s 65,700 staff, and offers services such as currency trading, bonds, and loans for mergers and takeovers. But like most investment banks, its revenues have been hurt by a slowdown in fundraising and dealmaking by companies worried about global trade and wider political uncertainty. It helps to explain how NatWest Markets suffered a \u00a3193m loss in the third quarter, which, alongside provisions for payment protection insurance claims, pushed RBS to an operating loss of \u00a38m. RBS could cut its losses and ditch NatWest Markets altogether, but that would further diminish the UK\u2019s influence in the industry, with Lloyds and RBS already forced to slim down their operations following their respective government bailouts. As it stands, Barclays is considered the only British lender with a chance to challenge the dominance of US investment banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. In November, finance chief Katie Murray said the division was still \u201cstrategically important\u201d and that the leadership did not \u201csee a world with no NatWest Markets\u201d. Instead, analysts expect Rose to narrow its scope, which could mean exiting the rates-trading business that helps clients hedge against the ups and downs of financial markets. John Cronin, a financials analyst at stockbroker Goodbody, said Rose was also likely to spend more on technology, which could ultimately result in more job cuts. In November RBS debuted its Monzo-style digital bank, B\u00f3, but it has yet to cause a stir. But if Rose plays her cards right, she could be leading RBS into the closest thing to a golden age for the lender since the 2008 crash. Joseph Dickerson, an equity analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cThis should be RBS\u2019s year. It\u2019s a year in which the UK economy should benefit from investment.\u201d Dickerson also expects the government to resume the sell-off of its holding in RBS, with hopes of bringing the stake below 50% as a start.
