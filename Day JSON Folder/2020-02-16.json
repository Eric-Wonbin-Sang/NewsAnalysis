Their capacity to bring people together, to share in an experience and achieve broader good, should be celebrated. To get 35,185 fans to a game, as Fremantle and West Coast did at Optus Stadium over the weekend, to help raise money for those affected by the bushfires is a good thing. So too to rally around a young female athlete when she uses her voice to challenge online trolling and abuse, or to continue to question a league about the future of a competition and use that as a broader conversation about women in sport and gender equality in general. They give a voice and help achieve change.</p> <p>When the term \u201cpolitical\u201d is used as a negative, as something that should stay out of the sports we love, it is used out of a fear of change. Sometimes maintaining the status quo would be so much easier, but being political in sport is not something to be afraid of. The issues that arise out of sport should be talked about so solutions can be found and this perfect ideal of what sports should look like can be achieved. Maybe then sports would not be so political.</p>",

Sporting organisations in this country are looked to by the general public for leadership on and off the field. Sports are an incredible driver for social change. Their capacity to bring people together, to share in an experience and achieve broader good, should be celebrated. To get 35,185 fans to a game, as Fremantle and West Coast did at Optus Stadium over the weekend, to help raise money for those affected by the bushfires is a good thing. So too to rally around a young female athlete when she uses her voice to challenge online trolling and abuse, or to continue to question a league about the future of a competition and use that as a broader conversation about women in sport and gender equality in general. They give a voice and help achieve change. When the term \u201cpolitical\u201d is used as a negative, as something that should stay out of the sports we love, it is used out of a fear of change. Sometimes maintaining the status quo would be so much easier, but being political in sport is not something to be afraid of. The issues that arise out of sport should be talked about so solutions can be found and this perfect ideal of what sports should look like can be achieved. Maybe then sports would not be so political.",

The ABC\u2019s news director, Gaven Morris, said the decision was \u201creally disappointing\u201d and a blow to press freedom and the public\u2019s right to know. \u201cFor all Australians who are interested in what goes on inside their democracy these sorts of rulings are a blow to the way Australians have access to information in their society,\u201d Morris said outside the court in Sydney. \u201cUrgent law reform is clearly required.\u201d The ABC is considering appealing the judgment, which found the AFP\u2019s raid on the ABC was legal. \u201cCompared to many other western democracies it is recognised that Australia\u2019s access to information is nowhere near the standard it should be,\u201d Morris said. The managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, said the ruling was further evidence of the urgent need for explicit protections for public interest journalism and for whistleblowers. Anderson said the accuracy of the stories that prompted this raid, the Afghan Files, which reported allegations of unlawful killings and misconduct by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, had never been challenged. \u201cNo one has been able to demonstrate a direct threat to national security as a result of those stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the AFP executed its search warrant here at the ABC last June 5th, its raid was seen \u2013 internationally \u2013 for exactly what it was: an attempt to intimidate journalists for doing their jobs. \u201cNot just the journalists named on the search warrant, but all journalists. \u201cThe ABC challenged the validity of the AFP\u2019s search warrant and we\u2019re disappointed by today\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis ruling highlights the serious problem with Australia\u2019s secrecy laws. Australia has by far the most onerous secrecy laws of any comparable western democracy \u2013 the UK, US, Canada, New Zealand. \u201cThis is at odds with our expectation that we live in an open and transparent society. \u201cWe are not saying journalists should be above the law. We\u2019re saying the public\u2019s right to know should be a factor that is taken into account \u2013 and legitimate journalism should not be criminalised. \u201cYet almost three years after those stories were published, investigative journalists Sam Clark and Dan Oakes remain in limbo. They could be charged and prosecuted at any time for doing their jobs.\u201d The ABC warrant named the reporters Oakes and Clark, as well as Morris. The ABC\u2019s chair, Ita Buttrose, said last year the raids by the AFP on its headquarters were \u201cdesigned to intimidate\u201d and warned the government she would fight \u201cany attempts to muzzle\u201d the national broadcaster. Federal court justice Wendy Abraham ordered the ABC to pay costs for both parties. In her reasons for the decision Abraham said the AFP asked the ABC to provide the documents that met the search conditions of the warrant but they declined. \u201cThat would have resulted in the AFP not physically conducting the search and therefore would limit its exposure to matters of concern to the applicant,\u201d she said. \u201cThat approach would have reduced if not alleviated the applicant\u2019s concerns.\u201d Abraham found the AFP tried not to be too intrusive in the execution of the warrant and allowed the ABC\u2019s lawyers to be present throughout the search, which was limited to one room, on a computer operated by ABC staff. \u201cNo other search of the premises was conducted,\u201d she said. Abraham said the federal police agreed to keep all the seized documents on sealed USB sticks and not access them pending a challenge to the validity of the warrant. \u201cFinally, given the communication between the parties, and events leading up to the execution of the warrant, there could have been no doubt that the focus of the warrant was in relation to offences related to the Afghan Files stories,\u201d she said. \u201cMoreover, as noted previously, there has been no challenge to the execution of the warrant. \u201cThe applicant has not established any of the grounds of the application. As such, the application is dismissed with costs.\u201d The decision follows the release on Friday of a review by a former Australian Crime Commission boss, John Lawler, of the AFP\u2019s handling of sensitive investigations which found police had \u201crecognised some shortcomings in investigational governance\u201d and were making changes. \u201cCommunity and stakeholder confidence in the AFP has been negatively impacted as a result of recent sensitive investigations,\u201d Lawler found. \u201cA clear objective of this review is to improve that confidence in, and support for, the AFP\u2019s actions in protecting Australians and Australia\u2019s interests.\u201d Journalist Peter Greste, a spokesman for the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom, said in the ABC case the AFP used a provision of the Defence Act which made it a criminal offence to receive stolen commonwealth property. \u201cWe acknowledge the important role of the security agencies in protecting national security,\u201d Greste said. \u201cIn seeking to enforce the narrow letter of the law, however, they have undermined the media\u2019s role in maintaining the health of our democracy, and as a result, made the entire system less transparent and less stable.\u201d The federal president of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Marcus Strom, said the decision was another blow to press freedom in Australia. \u201cThe AFP raid on the ABC, and on the home of a News Corporation journalist the day before, are attacks on the public\u2019s right to know about what our governments do in our name,\u201d Strom said. \u201cThe raids came up to two years after the relevant news stories were published and yet the pursuit of the truth tellers continues.\u201d The chair of the Senate inquiry into press freedoms, Sarah Hanson-Young, said whistleblowers and journalists needed proper protection. \u201cThe government should come out today and rule out charging the ABC journalists, and the News Corp journalists involved in other raids,\u201d the Greens senator said.",

      "bodyText": "Mining giant BHP has repeatedly applied and been granted approval to increase its emissions under an Australian government policy that promised to limit carbon pollution from big industry. Government data shows BHP exceeded its initial emissions limits, set under the scheme known as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, at eight of its 14 large Australian industrial sites since 2016-17. The increases continued as BHP\u2019s outgoing chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, last year called for drastic action to combat the climate crisis, and committed the company to keeping its emissions at or below 2017 levels by 2022 and reaching net-zero emissions in the latter half of the century. Across its Australian major facilities, BHP has been allowed a 13% increase in emissions limit in three years. If it emitted up to its new limit at each site it would increase national emissions by 425,689 tonnes a year. The company was also required to buy and submit more than 81,000 carbon credits for exceeding its new, increased pollution limits as two sites. The increase in BHP\u2019s emissions limits, known as baselines, was calculated by the Australian Conservation Foundation and confirmed by the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the scheme. The big miner is not alone. An analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation found the government had approved increases in industrial emissions over the past two years that could allow more than 7m tonnes of additional pollution each year, about 1.3% of annual national carbon pollution. The safeguard mechanism initially promised to limit emissions increases from big polluters to ensure they did not unreasonably cancel out cuts paid for by taxpayers through the Coalition\u2019s main climate policy, the emissions reduction fund. Suzanne Harter, climate change campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the BHP data again showed that the Morrison government\u2019s policy allowed big polluters to just emit more if they exceeded designated limits. \u201cThe government\u2019s safeguard mechanism is not safeguarding the climate we all share,\u201d she said. \u201cCompanies can make grand statements, but right now Australia has no meaningful policy to make sure companies cut emissions to protect our future.\u201d The government has adjusted how it describes the role played by the safeguard mechanism. In 2016, the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, said it would ensure emissions cuts contracted through the emissions reduction fund were not offset by significant increases above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. In response to questions on Sunday, the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said it was designed to support growth while encouraging businesses to lower their emissions intensity. BHP\u2019s increases come as the company faces pressure from activist investors to back up its climate pledges with concrete action. Almost 30% of shareholders last year backed a resolution that would have forced the company to quit industry bodies that hold positions at odds with its stance on global warming. A BHP spokeswoman told Guardian Australia the company was complying with government policy and regulations under the safeguard mechanism, and was committed to reducing its operational emissions globally. She said its total operational emissions were 3% lower in 2019 than in 2017 and it had a longer-term goal of achieving net-zero operational emissions \u201cin the latter half of this century, consistent with the Paris agreement\u201d. The safeguard mechanism started operating in 2016, imposing emissions limits on facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes. Emissions limits were initially based on either a facility\u2019s historic emissions or an independent forecast of future emissions. Companies that exceeded their baseline were expected to buy carbon credits to offset the additional emissions, or pay a penalty, but in practice this has applied in only some cases. Many facilities have applied for, and been granted, an increased limit. The Clean Energy Regulator said companies could have limits changed if it was found they were a poor indicator of future emissions, they had new or significantly expanded facilities or emissions had increased as a result of natural variability. Under changes being introduced this year, all facilities will be moved to limits based not on their total emissions, but on emissions intensity \u2013 how much they expect to emit per unit of production. It means if companies lift production they will be able to increase carbon pollution without penalty. In theory, these limits per unit of production could be reduced over time to cut emissions and encourage a shift to clean practice, a change Labor proposed without detail before the 2019 election. The Morrison government is divided on climate action and the future of coal-fired power. It has commissioned a review of its climate policies led by the businessman Grant King, and has promised it will this year release a technology investment roadmap, an electric vehicle policy and a long-term emissions strategy. It has also made it known to the owners of the Vales Point coal-fired power plant that they are likely to get an $11m grant to upgrade the facility, and is spending $4m on a feasibility study into a new coal generator in north Queensland. The Coalition has a 2020 climate target of a 5% cut in emissions below 2000 levels under Kyoto, but government data suggests emissions will be just 0.3% below what they were at the turn of the century. In an emailed response on Sunday, Taylor acknowledged emissions related to exports had grown in recent years, but said economy-wide emissions were 12.9% below 2005 levels. \u201cThat is the metric that counts towards our international targets, and Australia\u2019s efforts in reducing global emissions,\u201d he said. Official projections suggest the country will fall short of its 2030 target of a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels under current policies unless it uses carryover credits, a controversial accounting measure. Analysts have suggested Australia should be cutting pollution by at least 45% by 2030, en route to net zero emissions by 2050, to be playing its part in meeting the goals of the Paris deal. The former prime minister Kevin Rudd last week said the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015 should have triggered the adoption of a 25% emissions reduction target by 2020 but that instead the Coalition government opted to keep \u201cone of the lowest bars in the world\u201d of 5%. \u201cYet despite the low bar, the current government is still struggling to meet even that,\u201d Rudd said. The government is facing calls from business leaders and the energy industry to consider a climate action bill by the independent MP Zali Steggall that includes a proposal for a target of net zero emissions by 2050, an emissions budget, and assessments every five years of national climate change risk.",

      "bodyText": "Six months is an achingly long time in football and perhaps it is appropriate that Chelsea\u2019s last encounter with Manchester United now has an air of the uncanny about it. Chelsea had the lion\u2019s share of possession on the opening day of the season at Old Trafford, dominated midfield and saw two shots come back off the post. United, meanwhile, played on the counter and won 4-0. On Monday night the two teams come together again, and Frank Lampard hopes he has taken the right lessons from that strange day. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a 4-0 game\u201d, the Chelsea manager said when considering the rematch. \u201cI\u2019d be the first to criticise myself, or us, or to ask that we look at ourselves [if it was] and I was honest with the players afterwards. I said: \u2018Let\u2019s not walk away from the small details that made it a 4-0. But don\u2019t take this as a big kick in the teeth because, in terms of performance, it shouldn\u2019t be.\u2019 \u201cThree or four days later we went toe to toe with the best team in the country by a mile this season [Liverpool] and possibly should have won the [European] Super Cup,\u201d Lampard added. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t find the United result a seminal moment or think wow, we\u2019ve lost 4-0. It didn\u2019t feel nice on the day and it would be great to correct it on Monday, but at the same time I didn\u2019t take it as a huge hurtful thing.\u201d Chelsea have not had a perfect season but as they get ready to welcome United they remain in fourth place in the Premier League table, a position they have held for much of the season. Next week, they will return to Champions League action in their round of 16 tie against Bayern Munich. And, after enduring a transfer embargo for the summer window, Lampard also announced his first signing for the club this week, Hakim Ziyech from Ajax. For all the pressure that can come to bear on the west London club, there are still many reasons to be cheerful. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should speak about [the league table] too much because you end up with your eyes everywhere,\u201d Lampard added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst motivational tool for all of us to really understand the situation, because I have a deep sense of pride about wanting to get fourth place.\u201d That pride comes in part from a realisation that the challenges to Chelsea\u2019s current position come not just from United and Spurs, next weekend\u2019s visitors to Stamford Bridge. United are six points behind Chelsea with 13 games to play, and so are Wolves.

Research shows many of us are<a href=\"https://blog.euromonitor.com/meet-the-conscious-consumer/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> trying to make more conscious choices</a>, thinking about our impact and what we want from life.</p> <p>More and more, we\u2019re asking businesses such as our banks and super funds to better align with what we want, and to invest in things we can feel good about, that make a real and positive difference. We also want insurance that we can trust and a health fund that understands where we\u2019re at in life.</p> <p>The start of the year is a great time to evaluate your health insurance, shop around and optimise your life. And if you find a better fit, making the switch is easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how to choose a health fund that\u2019s the perfect fit.</p> <h2><strong>1. Know where you\u2019re at</strong></h2> <p>Products and the services covered by health funds can be vastly different, and what suits someone else may not be right for you. Life may have changed significantly since you joined your current fund years ago, or maybe you have just stayed with the same provider as your parents.</p> <p>Either way, before you switch, think about who you are and where you\u2019re at.

Composite: Guardian Labs/Getty Images.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>2. Be clear about what\u2019s really important</strong></h2> <p>Not all health funds have the same priorities. Health funds that are not-for-profit or part of a not-for-profit group are able to <a href=\"http://membershealth.com.au/about/about-members-health/\" rel=\"nofollow\">put members first</a>. On average, Members Health funds keep narrower margins and invest more of your paid premiums back into benefits. For-profit funds, on the other hand, have to maximise profits for investors and shareholders.</p> <p>Funds that make up Members Health return a higher proportion of member premiums back in benefits \u2013 on average it\u2019s 91%. It\u2019s no surprise that this is reflected in high satisfaction and high trust levels from members, who are also more likely to stick around.</p> <p>The health fund you choose can also have an impact on your community. Some <a href=\"http://membershealth.com.au/our-funds/find-a-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Members Health funds</a> are based in regional areas and support local charities, sporting clubs and health services. Or, they might be industry-based; for example, a fund that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.teachershealth.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tailored for teachers</a>, police, military, doctors, bank employees, transport and energy employees, emergency services, nurses or others. All these factors might influence your choice.</p> <h2><strong>3. Think about what you want your fund to deliver</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://membershealth.com.au/our-funds/why-our-funds-are-different/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Health funds that are run for people, not for profits, are designed to give back to members</a>, which can mean a better overall experience for you. Look for options that will have a direct benefit:</p> <p>- Customer service: support that\u2019s available and genuinely wants to help</p> <p>- Quality products: policies tailored to your individual health needs and stage of life, offering a combination of good-value prices, coverage and benefits</p> <p>- General wellbeing and preventative health: such as offers on dental, optical, osteo, chiro, physio and remedial massage</p> <p>- Complementary coverage: other high-quality insurance products, such as travel insurance</p> <p>- Convenience: digital tools, fast claims processing, and a caring person to speak to when you need it most</p> <p>- Strong values: a fund that aligns with your life, and puts you first</p> <p>No matter what insurer you decide to go with - big or small - all Australian health funds provide access to healthcare services across the entire country.</p> <h2><strong>4. Do your research</strong></h2> <p>More information is available than ever before. If you\u2019re looking at an industry-specific health fund, ask colleagues for their experiences. Funds run for people, not profits, can deliver better value while being tailored to members\u2019 needs.</p> <p>Website aggregators can help you compare your options. For example, the <a href=\"http://membershealth.com.au/our-funds/find-a-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Members Health</a> site allows you to filter funds by relevant criteria so you can find and research funds from one place - including some you may never have heard of.

In the fallout, the four prosecutors who had handled the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/11/trump-roger-stone-sentencing-reaction-criticism\">resigned in disgust</a>.</p> <p>The letter carries weight because its signatories are exclusively drawn from past DoJ public servants. Among them are several former US attorneys appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents and section chiefs of key elements of the justice department including its antiterrorism unit.</p> <p>They write that it is unheard of for top leaders of the justice department to overrule line prosecutors in order to give preferential treatment to close associates of the president. They say that amounts to political interference that is \u201canathema to the department\u2019s core mission and to its sacred obligation to ensure equal justice under the law\u201d.</p> <p>Barr\u2019s action amounted to an existential threat to the republic, the former officials say: \u201cGovernments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.\u201d</p> <p>Barr tried to squash the perception he had been leaned on by Trump by calling on the president to stop tweeting about criminal prosecutions. He told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/william-barr-trump-twitter-justice-department\">ABC News</a> such unrestrained comments were \u201cmaking it impossible for me to do my job\u201d.</p> <p>But speculation continued to swirl that Barr had kowtowed to the president. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/roger-stone-trump-william-barr-us-justice-system\">Demoralisation spread rapidly</a> through the DoJ, intensifying when it emerged that Barr has ordered outside prosecutors to re-examine criminal cases against Trump associates including former national security adviser <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-nyt-william-barr-michael-flynn-20200215-u55gsri47zfitdn34i3l72j2p4-story.html\">Michael Flynn</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The president thinks Andy McCabe should have been punished because he lied and lied several times to the investigators</p> <footer> <cite>Kellyanne Conway</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite palpable distress among both serving and former officials, and multiple warnings that Trump and Barr are threatening the very rule of law, the White House has continued to inflame the situation.

      "bodyText": "More than 1,000 former US justice department officials, including some of the top government lawyers in the country, have called on attorney general William Barr to resign in the wake of the Roger Stone scandal. Some 1,143 alumni of the Department of Justice posted to Medium on Sunday a group letter that tore into Barr for \u201cdoing the president\u2019s personal bidding\u201d in imposing on prosecutors the recommendation of a reduced sentence for Stone, a longtime friend of Donald Trump who was convicted of lying to and obstructing Congress and threatening a witness in the Russia investigation. Barr, the officials said, had damaged the reputation of the department for \u201cintegrity and the rule of law\u201d. The searing letter is the latest twist in a rapidly spiraling constitutional crisis that began earlier this week when Barr imposed his new sentencing memo, slashing a seven- to nine-year proposed prison term suggested by career prosecutors. In the fallout, the four prosecutors who had handled the case resigned in disgust. The letter carries weight because its signatories are exclusively drawn from past DoJ public servants. Among them are several former US attorneys appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents and section chiefs of key elements of the justice department including its antiterrorism unit. They write that it is unheard of for top leaders of the justice department to overrule line prosecutors in order to give preferential treatment to close associates of the president. They say that amounts to political interference that is \u201canathema to the department\u2019s core mission and to its sacred obligation to ensure equal justice under the law\u201d. Barr\u2019s action amounted to an existential threat to the republic, the former officials say: \u201cGovernments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.\u201d Barr tried to squash the perception he had been leaned on by Trump by calling on the president to stop tweeting about criminal prosecutions. He told ABC News such unrestrained comments were \u201cmaking it impossible for me to do my job\u201d. But speculation continued to swirl that Barr had kowtowed to the president. Demoralisation spread rapidly through the DoJ, intensifying when it emerged that Barr has ordered outside prosecutors to re-examine criminal cases against Trump associates including former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Despite palpable distress among both serving and former officials, and multiple warnings that Trump and Barr are threatening the very rule of law, the White House has continued to inflame the situation. Trump counsellor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday claimed the president was a victim of a \u201ctwo-tier criminal justice system\u201d that was actively undermining him and his associates. Conway used Fox News Sunday to pour fuel on the fire. The truth, she claimed, was that far from making a dangerous intervention in criminal cases involving his friends and perceived enemies, Trump himself is the victim of the politicisation of the justice system. \u201cIf you\u2019re President Trump or people associated with him there\u2019s prosecutions that have gone one way,\u201d Conway said, alluding to the original sentence recommended for Stone which she contrasted with the decision announced by the justice department on Friday to drop charges against former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Directly contradicting her own claim that Trump, despite his \u201cvast powers\u201d, was not engaging in political interference in criminal cases, Conway proceeded to interfere in a criminal case. She called McCabe a \u201cserial liar and leaker\u201d and went on: \u201cThe president thinks that Andy McCabe should have been punished because he lied and lied several times to the investigators.\u201d McCabe, a deputy to fired FBI director James Comey and a key figure in the Russia investigation, was fired by Trump in March 2018, two days shy of retirement. The furore over Trump ignoring protocols that have kept a distance between the White House and federal prosecutors since Watergate began when the president slammed the proposed sentence for Stone as \u201chorrible and very unfair\u201d. Hours later, Barr announced that he was imposing a reduced recommended sentence. Trump then made the constitutionally dubious claim that as president he has the \u201clegal right\u201d to stick his finger into any criminal case. On Saturday he duly re-entered the fray over McCabe, claiming falsely that DoJ inspector general Michael Horowitz recommended the former FBI man\u2019s firing. Horowitz referred criticisms of McCabe to prosecutors but did not recommend dismissal. On Sunday Marc Short, chief of staff to vice-president Mike Pence, made further contentious comments on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Like Conway, he claimed without evidence that criminal justice was skewed against the president. \u201cThe scales of justice aren\u2019t balanced any more,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen someone like Roger Stone gets a prosecution that suggests a nine-year jail sentence and candidly someone like Andy McCabe who also lied to federal investigators gets a lucrative contract here at CNN.

He said: \u201cSeeing the floods devastate our communities is truly heartbreaking. \u201cHomes &amp; businesses across the Rhondda have been affected by the winds and rain of Storm Dennis and many families will have lost everything. \u201cWe\u2019ve been inundated with offers of support and help. At present the emergency services are advising volunteers to stay safe but will require support in the aftermath.\u201d The search for a woman who went missing in Worcestershire has been called off until tomorrow, according to the BBC. The woman went missing in floodwater earlier today. The storm continues to affect train travel, with severe disruptions on services to and from Manchester due to overhead wire damage at Stafford. It\u2019s Clea Skopeliti here, taking over from Jessica as Storm Dennis continues to batter parts of the UK. New flood warnings have been issued along the River Avon: Here\u2019s a quick summary of how Storm Dennis has developed across the course of today, and some of the damage it has caused. The storm has led to a record number of flood alerts and warnings being put in place, with six severe flood warnings still in place for England and Wales. Police declared major incidents in south Wales, Herefordshire and Shropshire after flooding and landslide incidents. South Wales has received the brunt of the damage, with residents in a number of villages and towns evacuated via lifeboat as whole streets became submerged. This morning, the Met Office issued a red warning for rain - the highest level - for the first time sine 2015. A man in his 60s has died after falling into the River Tawe, in south Wales. According to the Press Association, the police force is not treating the death as suspicious or linking it to the bad weather. Flood hit areas could still feel the effects of the heavy rains brought by Storm Dennis after it has passed, experts have warned. The Environment Agency urged people to remain vigilant and said \u201csignificant\u201d river and surface water flooding is expected to continue into next week. Flood duty manager Caroline Douglass added: Storm Dennis will continue to bring disruptive weather into early next week, and there are flood warnings in place across much of England. We urge people to check the flood risk in their area and remain vigilant. An 80-metre cargo ship which had been abandoned and adrift in the mid-Atlantic for over a year has been swept ashore by Storm Dennis in Ireland. According to Paschal Sheehy, an editor for Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, the ship has run aground near Ballycotton in east Cork. \u201cThe ship was high and dry on rocks at low tide at 5pm,\u201d he said. Aerial images show the scale of the devastation caused by flooding in the village of Crickhowell in south Wales. Residents were evacuated from the village, which has become cut off after the River Usk burst its banks, by firefighters in inflatable rafts and helicopters were also deployed to assist with the rescue operation. While Wales has borne the brunt of the Storm Dennis damage today, other parts of the country are also feeling the effects. There are a number of power cuts across the south of England, which UK Power Networks says it is working tirelessly to fix. Meanwhile, there are 14,000 homes and businesses without power in Ireland, where orange wind warnings remain in place for many areas of the country. Some more information about the man who died after falling into a river in south Wales today. Dyfed-Powys police said a man in his 60s was seen entering the River Tawe near Gorsedd Park in Ystradgynlais, in south Wales, at about 10am on Sunday morning. The force said he was rescued further along the river near Trebanos Rugby Club but despite paramedics battling to save his life he was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious or being linked to the bad weather. Two bodies were pulled from rough seas on Saturday, before the worst of the storm hit. One man was found following a huge search operation off Margate after an early-morning distress call, while another was found at Herne Bay. Storm Dennis is set to move east overnight towards northern Scotland, the Met Office has said. It posted a satellite picture of the current position of the storm, which has caused severe flooding across Wales and Midlands, as well as northern England and the Scottish borders. The MP for Pontypridd has issued a statement saying she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to see more than 600 people evacuated from their homes and placed in emergency accommodation last night. Alex Davies-Jones said more than 1,000 homes have been damaged by the floods and there is damage to local infrastructure. South Wales is reeling from Storm Dennis, which has brought severe flooding and landslides to the region, and led police to declare a major incident. Streets have been evacuated by lifeboat in some of the worst-hit areas and people moved to emergency rescue centres after their properties and businesses were devastated by water from overflowing rivers. Jennifer Gilmer, assistant chief constable with south Wales police, said: I would like to reassure the public who have been affected that we are doing everything we can, and will continue to work tirelessly until all risks dissipate. I have very clear advice for everybody, which is not to panic, and to be sensible, stay well clear of any danger such as streams and rivers, and contact us in an emergency. The force have told people in affected areas to stay indoors unless a journey was necessary, avoid waterways, and monitor local and social media for updates. One of the worst-hit areas in south Wales was the village of Nantgarw, Rhondda Cynon Taff, near Cardiff, which has had entire streets left underwater since the early hours of Sunday morning. Emergency teams including firefighters and volunteers had been evacuating the village\u2019s Oxford Street since around 5am and were still working at midday on Sunday. Paul Mason, the group manager of south Wales fire and rescue service, said the scene his team had faced was the worst he had experienced in his 31-year career. We started getting calls at 5am. The water was up to the window sills in some instances, so we sent a number of boats and crews down here to assist with our partner agencies, systematically going through each of the houses, knocking on doors, trying to prioritise individuals. This weather is unprecedented. We haven\u2019t seen this, it\u2019s incredible, and it\u2019s right throughout the south Wales Valleys. In my 31 years in the service this is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before. He said some residents had refused to leave their homes despite being encouraged to, but would be monitored for their safety. Melanie Hughes, 38, who was evacuated by lifeboat with along with her husband and two daughters, said she was awoken by shouting and car alarms in the early hours, and said many of their family\u2019s possessions had been lost. She said: Everyone\u2019s safe, which is the main thing. We were lucky. But our cars, kitchen, furniture, it\u2019s all gone. It\u2019s going to be a couple of months of hard work, now. It was filthy, there was nothing to salvage. A number of Welsh rugby clubs have been severely affected by Storm Dennis. Bedwas RFC, a rugby union club near Caerphilly, south Wales, reported their lounge, function room, bar, cellar and rugby facilities have all been seriously damaged. Rival team Cross Keys RFC also ended up underwater after severe downpours caused flooding across south Wales. A man has died after falling into the River Tawe, in south Wales, police said. A tweet from the Ystradgynlais neighbourhood policing team at Dyfed Powys Police, said: A male has fallen into the river at Ystradgynlais at approximately 10am this morning and has sadly be found deceased further along the river in the Tebanos area. If you witnessed this incident please can you give us a call on 101. There are now six severe flood warnings in place across England and Wales, as Storm Dennis continues to bring rising water levels and landslides. A severe flood warning means there is danger to life. Hundreds more flood alerts and warnings are in place across the country, with it emerging earlier that this is the highest number of warnings in place on record. There are two severe flooding warnings in Wales, one in the south-west and one in the south-east. In England, the warnings are in place for areas across Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The flooding clean-up has begun in Newcastleton in the Scottish borders, where 80 homes were flooded and 12 streets left under water. Two people had to be rescued by emergency services after their car was swept off the road by flood waters near Newcastleton. They were taken to hospital and have since been discharged. Three rivers in the Borders reached the highest on the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s records and residents in Newcastleton reported experiencing some of the worst flooding in the village\u2019s history. Hawick\u2019s Slitrig Water, the Jed Water at Chesters and the Liddel Water at Newcastleton saw a rapid rise in water levels caused by Storm Dennis. Nearly 16cm of rainfall in 48 hours and wind speeds of 91mph have been recorded as Storm Dennis continues to cause chaos across the UK. The highest rainfall occurred in south Wales, where Crai Resr received 157.6mm of rainfall in 48 hours. The highest wind speeds of 91mph were recorded in Aberdaron on the Welsh coast. Dramatic footage has emerged of a landslide in Rhondda valley, south Wales. Earlier, South Wales police declared a major incident in the area after flooding and landslides caused by Storm Dennis. Chris Bryant, the MP for Rhondda, has set up a fundraiser for those affected by the flooding. The appeal reads: Seeing the floods devastate our communities is truly heartbreaking. Homes and businesses across the Rhondda have been affected by the winds and rain of Storm Dennis and many families will have lost everything. There are high river levels and flooding across Derbyshire, with the Environment Agency warning people against driving through flood water, and to take care when walking near rivers. A major incident has been declared in Herefordshire as flooding in the area escalates. Emergency response partners including Herefordshire council, West Mercia police, Herefordshire and Worcestershire Fire and Rescue, the Environment Agency and health partners are working to support residents and protect the most vulnerable. An evacuation centre has been set up at Holmer Leisure Centre on Holmer Road, Hereford. There is a severe flood warning in place for the River Teme at Little Hereford and Ashford Carbonel. The Red Cross has urged people to prepare \u201cshould the worst happen\u201d, as water levels are expected to peak in the coming days. Georgie Timmins, crisis response officer at British Red Cross, said: The storms are expected to continue, and water is anticipated to be at peak levels on Monday and Tuesday. It is important people are ready should the worst happen. It\u2019s a good idea to ensure your phone is fully charged and you have torches at hand. The Red Cross is working with local authorities around the country to support those affected by Storm Dennis. Timmins said: We are currently responding in Shropshire, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and Gloucestershire, and we are currently ready to help in Wales, Manchester, Buckinghamshire, Lancashire and Inverness. Our volunteers know that when people are caught up in a crisis, one person\u2019s needs are different to the next person. South Wales police have declared a major incident over flooding and landslides caused by Storm Dennis, with an emergency response dealing with \u201cserious disruption\u201d. They said: Due to this morning\u2019s flooding and severe weather-related incident which have occurred overnight and through the course of the morning, a major incident was declared and South Wales police is coordinating a major response. People have been evacuated from their homes in Monmouthshire and Neath, and a Met Office amber warning for rain remains in place across most parts of Wales until 3pm. There are four severe flood warnings in place in England and Wales, meaning there is a threat to life in those areas. This morning, the Met Office issued its first red rain warning since 2015. A building has partially collapsed on Canterbury Road in Herne Bay, Kent. There are no reports of casualties. The roof of the building partially gave way, leaving cars parked below buried under fallen bricks. A number of train services have been suspended across the country due to disruption caused by Storm Dennis. In Wales, the following lines are closed due to flooding: Ebbw Vale to Crosskeys. Gobowen to Wrexham. Conwy Valley Line. The Cambrian line. The Marches line. Lydney to Gloucester. Shrewsbury to Wellington. Passengers travelling into and out of Devon and Cornwall have been told to travel only if necessary, as flooding has closed lines between Exeter St Davids and Taunton and Exeter St Davids and Barnstaple. In the north, there will be no trains from Carlisle to Leeds, and no train or tram service at Rotherham Central today. The line between Hebden Bridge and Sowerby Bridge in west Yorkshire has reopened after heavy flooding, but disruption is still expected. You can find details information about train disruption at National Rail Enquiries. It\u2019s Jessica Murray here, taking over from Frances on the live blog as Storm Dennis continues to batter parts of the UK. There are now more flood warnings and alerts in force in England than any other day on record, according to John Curtin, executive director of flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency. There are a total of 594 warning and alerts, including two severe flood warnings which indicate a danger to life. Feel free to send updates on the situation where you are - jessica.murray@theguardian.com or via Twitter (@journojess_). Jeremy Parr, the head of flood and incident risk management for Natural Resources Wales, said in a statement: The forecast is for very significant levels of rain, especially in the eastern valleys of south Wales. Impacts could be severe overnight, and everyone should take the warnings extremely seriously. We are working hard to make sure communities are as prepared as possible and urge people to take care and make arrangements to be safe. People are advised to take great care if you need to travel. If you are out, take extreme caution and never drive or walk through flood waters. Keep an eye on the forecast and visit our website for the latest information on flood warnings. You can find practical advice on flooding on our website too. The Met Office has issued a new statement on the impact of Storm Dennis across the UK. The organisation\u2019s chief meteorologist, Andy Page, said: Whilst the heaviest rain has cleared from Northern Ireland and Scotland, England and Wales will continue to see heavy rain on Sunday, with a risk of severe flooding in places. In particular, heavy rain has led to severe flooding across parts of south Wales triggering a red rain warning, where around 140mm of rain in total could fall, before it gradually eases this afternoon. At Cray Reservoir, Powys, south Wales, 132.8mm of rain was recorded between 7am on Saturday 14 and 8am on Sunday 15. The average rainfall in Wales for the month of February is 110.8mm. Page continued: There is a risk of significant impacts from flooding in this area, including a danger to life from fast flowing water, extensive flooding to property and road closures. As such we are urging people to follow the safety advice from officials and to keep a close eye on the latest Met Office weather warnings. A search is under way for a woman who was seen going into the water at the beach in Brighton in the early hours of Sunday morning. A spokesman for Sussex police said: At 0245 on Sunday, today, 16 February, police received a report that a woman, believed to be in her early 20s, had been seen to enter the water from the beach at Brighton opposite Kings Road. She\u2019s not so far been found despite an extensive search during the hours of darkness in both sea and on shore by emergency services including Coastguard, Sussex police and Brighton beach patrol staff. The weather has been very bad, with rain and high winds. The circumstances are currently being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. Emergency service crews rescued two people \u201cin the nick of time\u201d after their car was swept from the road and pinned to a metal gate by a torrent of flood water, reports PA Media. Specialist fire crews waded into the fast-flowing water in the Scottish Borders to save the pair from the \u201cextremely dangerous situation\u201d after a river had burst its banks. Photos of the rescue and its aftermath show the Volkswagen Golf in a field, perpendicular to the Newcastleton road. The two people were taken to hospital by paramedics, but have since been discharged and were able to return home. MP Alex Davies-Jones and AM Mick Antoniw have set up this crowdfunder to raise money to help those affected by the flooding in Pontypridd. Seeing the floods devastate our communities is truly heartbreaking. Homes &amp; businesses across the Pontypridd constituency have been affected by Storm Dennis and we\u2019ve been inundated with offers of support and help. Welsh Water has posted this dramatic video of the \u201cdifficult conditions\u201d at Pontsticil reservoir in the Brecon Beacons national park. Sky News correspondent Dan Whitehead has tweeted this video from Pontypridd in south Wales. Alex Davies-Jones, the MP for Pontypridd, has tweeted that she is working with the authorities to see what can be done to help those affected by serious flooding in the area. The leader of Calderdale council, Tim Swift, has told the BBC the area has been let down by central government. The region is regularly affected by flooding. There are some real challenges here, but we have been hit by austerity which makes it much harder for us as a council to respond and although there is money available for flood defences, it\u2019s hard to get these schemes completed quickly. ... The thing that frustrates me the most is that this is the third serious storm we\u2019ve had in eight years \u2013 the first bad flooding being in 2012 and there was really no progress then on the government making money available into flood defences. It was only after the devastating floods on Boxing Day, so I feel to some extent the Environment Agency has been running to catch up since then. Highways England has said Storm Dennis is expected to affect all regions and that people should only travel if necessary. You can see a list of road closures on the agency\u2019s website here. People on social media are sharing photographs of what looks like serious flooding in Pontypridd, 12 miles north of Cardiff, and in Crickhowell near Abergavenny. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency\u2019s (Sepa) highest warning level remains in force for Newcastleton and Hawick in the Borders on Sunday after they advised some residents to leave their homes. Sepa flood duty manager Mark McLaughlin said on Saturday: Severe flood warnings for areas in the Scottish Borders have been issued tonight as we continue to see rivers respond to the impacts of Storm Dennis. These warnings mean that extensive flooding is expected to properties and businesses with many roads impassable. Some evacuations have been advised. The severe flood warnings have been issued for Teviot and Slitrig at Hawick and Newcastleton. We advise people to stay away from flood water and to not take unnecessary risks ... If you are affected or concerned about flooding please contact the emergency services. A red weather warning is in place in a part of south Wales until 11am today. The Met Office website has more detail about what that means and what you can do to stay safe in a storm. What to expect: Danger to life from fast flowing or deep floodwater. Extensive flooding to homes and businesses is likely. Collapsed or damaged buildings or bridges. Road closures and bus and train service delays and cancellations. Dangerous driving conditions because of spray and flooded roads. Loss of power and other essential services, such as gas, water and mobile phone service. Communities could be completely cut off by flood water, perhaps for several days. Hello and welcome to our Storm Dennis live blog as heavy winds and rain continue to hit the UK. Roads have been shut and train services suspended. The Met Office has issue a red weather warning for South Wales, meaning there is a likely risk to life. There are 224 flood warnings in place, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required. There are two severe flood warnings in place, meaning there is a danger to life, both at points along the river Teme in Worcestershire. There are a further 336 less serious flood alerts, covering an area from Scotland\u2019s River Tweed to the rivers of west Cornwall. The Met office forecaster Greg Dewhurst has said relief from Storm Dennis is still some distance away and that \u201cheavy rain and strong winds\u201d would continue across large parts of the UK on Sunday. \u201cSouth Wales will see a lot of rain fall before Dennis moves north later to Scotland and Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. We\u2019ll bring you updates as we have them.",

I\u2019d go so far as to say that the first iconic Cyber story was Peter Capaldi\u2019s chilling finale World Enough and Time \u2013 which brought back the 1960s Mondasian Cybermen. We can only hope for a continuation of that as the finale approaches. But things look promising with the body horror of this week\u2019s Lone Cyberman. The very sight of a half-exposed human face and a half-human voice provided exactly the required chills. The Doctor also gave one of the most potent descriptions of the Cybermen to the assembled intelligentsia of the villa: \u201cOrgans, flesh, surgically removed without consent. It drives them insane, so they turn off the brain too, [remove] all emotion.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Mysteries and questions</strong></h2> <p>With the two-part closer looming, there are still huge question marks over what became of Hot Camp Master and Doctor Ruth, but it seems impossible they won\u2019t feature. We do at least know more about the Lone Cyberman, and Chris Chibnall\u2019s most recent comments confirm that the Cyber threat will only escalate. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most epic space opera stories we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a big, big Cyberman story, that last two-parter. There are a lot of Cybermen coming in this series. It might start with one Cyberman, but you\u2019ll see a lot.

The BBC was forced to issue a statement following complaints about Graham\u2019s anxiety over his cancer returning, and the Doctor blaming \u2018social anxiety\u2019 for her inability to comfort him. The BBC said: \u201cWe never set out to upset our viewers with what we show and this episode tackled some sensitive themes \u2026 When Graham opened up to the Doctor about his fear of his cancer returning, her response was never meant to be dismissive.

The very sight of a half-exposed human face and a half-human voice provided exactly the required chills. The Doctor also gave one of the most potent descriptions of the Cybermen to the assembled intelligentsia of the villa: \u201cOrgans, flesh, surgically removed without consent. It drives them insane, so they turn off the brain too, [remove] all emotion.\u201d Mysteries and questions With the two-part closer looming, there are still huge question marks over what became of Hot Camp Master and Doctor Ruth, but it seems impossible they won\u2019t feature. We do at least know more about the Lone Cyberman, and Chris Chibnall\u2019s most recent comments confirm that the Cyber threat will only escalate. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most epic space opera stories we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a big, big Cyberman story, that last two-parter. There are a lot of Cybermen coming in this series. It might start with one Cyberman, but you\u2019ll see a lot. It\u2019s as epic and emotional as the opening two-parter.\u201d Deeper into the vortex \u2022 \u201cSave the poet, save the universe.\u201d Has somebody been watching a Heroes boxset? \u2022 The Doctor is distressed enough to take this personally \u2013 she won\u2019t lose anyone else to Cybernisation. Remember, it\u2019s not so long since s/he lost Bill Potts to a similar fate. \u2022 Some intriguing controversy followed last week\u2019s episode, Can You Hear Me? The BBC was forced to issue a statement following complaints about Graham\u2019s anxiety over his cancer returning, and the Doctor blaming \u2018social anxiety\u2019 for her inability to comfort him. The BBC said: \u201cWe never set out to upset our viewers with what we show and this episode tackled some sensitive themes \u2026 When Graham opened up to the Doctor about his fear of his cancer returning, her response was never meant to be dismissive. The Doctor\u2019s friend was scared, and we see her struggling to deal with the severity of the situation.\u201d \u2022 In the latest in an occasional series of related pop songs, T\u2019Pau\u2019s power ballad China In Your Hand was inspired by the events of Villa Diodati. Next time Though it feels like we\u2019ve barely got going, the two-part finale kicks off next week with the thrillingly titled Ascension of the Cybermen.",

Top stories The Coalition gave an \u201cunprecedented\u201d $400,000 grant to the administrators of a now-closed aged care home in the electorate of Nationals MP Damian Drum, prompting Labor to question why other financially stressed providers have missed out. In November, Drum, the MP for the Victorian seat of Nicholls, said the financial assistance from the federal government meant the centre was \u201cstaying open, end of story\u201d, claiming \u201cthere are no conversations about shutting the place down\u201d. But despite the financial injection, residents from the 40-bed home have been relocated and employees made redundant, with the home shutting its doors last week. A three-year-old Australian girl held in al-Hawl camp in Syria will likely lose her fingers to frostbite. Amirah is one of 47 Australian children being detained in the sprawling detention camp for the family members of Islamic State fighters, as the north-east of Syria endures a bitterly cold winter.

Other Australian children in the camp are reported to be suffering developmental disorders, diarrhoea, seizures, rickets and asthma. The youngest child in the Australian group is less than two months old. Questions are being raised over a decision to let cotton farms harvest first rainfall in years. New South Wales bureaucrats sought urgent advice from major cotton farmers about how recent rainfall might damage their water harvesting infrastructure, in an apparent effort to justify giving them the green light to retain the first rainfall in over a year, rather than letting it flow downstream. On 7 February the government announced it would restrict the harvesting of overland flows throughout the northern Murray-Darling Basin for the first time, because it was \u201cin the public interest\u201d. But within days, the government had lifted the ban for two valleys and part of a third. Australia The first cohort of Australian evacuees are set to leave quarantine on Christmas Island on Monday, with no reported cases of the new coronavirus among the 277 Australian citizens and permanent residents held on the island. Nationals leader Michael McCormack has declared he will lead the party to the next election, dismissing suggestions he will stand down within the next two years to ensure stability within the Coalition. Labor is accusing the government of shortchanging rural areas through the $150m sports fund, which was overwhelmingly spent in marginal seats during the election campaign.

The jury at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial in New York will begin deliberations on Tuesday, with the world\u2019s media and the expectations of the #MeToo movement bearing heavily upon them. Recommended reads Australian researchers are pondering the link between a rare venom and cat allergies. A recent study involving the incredibly cute but atypically venomous dreamy-eyed slow loris speculates the allergic reactions cats can trigger in humans are a defence mechanism that they unwittingly evolved to fend off enemies. The University of Queensland\u2019s Bryan Fry sequenced the protein contained in the slow loris venom and used a computer program to compare it to all other known protein sequences.

      "bodyText": "Mike Pompeo rose to prominence during investigations of the deadly attack on a US facility in Benghazi in September 2012. Now, as Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state, he is pressing to defund a diplomatic initiative named for the US ambassador who died there. Foreign Policy reported the move, contained in the 2021 state department budget proposal, to eliminate a $5m contribution to the Stevens Initiative. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans \u2013 Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods \u2013 died after a crowd attacked a US outpost in Benghazi, a port city in northern Libya, on 11 September 2012. Republicans in Congress investigated aggressively, at one point subjecting Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time of the attack and a presidential candidate at the time of the investigations, to an 11-hour grilling before a House committee. Pompeo, then a Tea party-backed congressman from Kansas, played a prominent role, accusing Clinton of putting \u201cpolitical expediency and politics ahead of the men and women on the ground\u201d. Clinton parried but in the 2016 election, Trump wielded Benghazi and her supposed culpability for it as a talking point at raucous campaign rallies. After Trump\u2019s victory, Pompeo became CIA director before moving to follow Clinton as America\u2019s most senior diplomat. On Sunday he was in Dakar, Senegal, meeting President Macky Sall. According to the state department, Stevens was the first US ambassador in 30 years to be killed in the line of duty and the sixth to be killed by militants. According to its website, the Initiative named after him was \u201cconceived and developed in close partnership\u201d with his family and \u201cinspired by the meaningful international exchange experiences \u2026 Stevens had as a young man\u201d. It aims to use technology to facilitate \u201clife-changing, cross-cultural experiences\u201d between young people across the world. The state department has been subject to extensive cuts since Trump took power. Nonetheless a US official who spoke to Foreign Policy on condition of anonymity said cutting funding for the Stevens Initiative and other cultural programmes, for a proposed total saving of $420.7m, ran counter to \u201ceverything [Stevens] stood for\u201d. \u201cPart of the reason his family made the argument in the first place they should name a programme after him is because he was very open in advocating for exchanges with other societies,\u201d the official said. State officials told Foreign Policy and the Washington Post the cut set out in the budget proposal did not mean the initiative or similar programmes would definitely lose all funding. Attempts to cut funding to the Stevens Initiative have been made before. Congress blocked them. Mohamed Abdel-Kader, executive director of the Stevens Initiative, told Foreign Policy it had \u201cenjoyed a great relationship with the state department, the work that we do has a lot of impact with the students we serve and the program has enjoyed bipartisan support from Congress\u201d.",

The scoreline was given a slightly flattering sheen by late goals from Mesut Ozil and a delighted Alexandre Lacazette.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-16T18:29:56.195Z\">at 6.29pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e4988b88f08e133247447f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-16T18:24:23.552Z\">6.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>90+5 min </strong>That goal meant so much to Lacazette, who celebrated like it was his first.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me. Thanks for your company, goodnight! In other news... Peep peep! That was an excellent second-half performance from Arsenal, whose increased intensity and quality was too much for Newcastle. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring with a quite superb header in the 54th minute, and the match was all but over when Pepe made it 2-0 three minutes later. The scoreline was given a slightly flattering sheen by late goals from Mesut Ozil and a delighted Alexandre Lacazette. 90+5 min That goal meant so much to Lacazette, who celebrated like it was his first. He actually screwed the shot onto his standing foot, from where it ricocheted into the top corner, not that he\u2019ll care. It\u2019s four! Lacazette gets his first goal in 10 games, miskicking Pepe\u2019s pass into the top corner, and the Arsenal players cavort by the corner flag. 90+2 min This win moves Arsenal up to tenth - but they are only six points behind Spurs in fifth. It\u2019s not beyond the realms, is it. 90+1 min Six minutes of added time. Ozil leaves to a very warm ovation and an embrace from Mikel Arteta. Joe Willock replaces him. Mesut Ozil seals a comfortable win for Arsenal, cushioning a close-range volley through Dubravka from a speculative cross by Lacazette. It was a goalkeeping error. 86 min Ritchie\u2019s outswinging corner is headed back towards goal by Lascelles and claimed by Leno. Arsenal break through Saka, whose stirring run ends with low cross that is just too far in front of Lacazette. 85 min Alexandre Lacazette replaces the full debutant Eddie Nketiah, who gets a warm round of applause from the home fans. He worked very hard - if anything he was overeager at times - and hit the bar early in the second half. 84 min Arsenal\u2019s next game is away to Olympiacos in the Europa League on Thursday. They then play Everton at home a week today. Newcastle\u2019s next match is away to Crystal Palace on Saturday. 83 min Ciaran Clark is unable to continue. Fabian Schar replaces him. 82 min Lucas Torreira comes on for Arsenal in place of Dani Ceballos, who had a decent game on his return to the side. 80 min Saka overruns the ball and ploughs through Clark, with both players ending up in a heap on the edge of the area. Saka is booked. 79 min Saint-Maximin is only 22. If his decision making improves, and there\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t, he will become a brilliant player. 76 min \u201cLacazette wouldn\u2019t be human,\u201d says Charles Antaki, \u201cif he wasn\u2019t thinking of Nketiah he Hasn\u2019t Done Enough.\u201d There\u2019s a Smiths lyric in that. 75 min: Saint-Maximin hits the post! That was a brilliant effort from Newcastle\u2019s most dangerous player. He picked up a loose ball 30 yards from goal, beat Bellerin with strength and Mustafi with skill before curling a lovely shot that flashed past the diving Leno and smacked off the far post. 74 min Newcastle make a double change, with Matt Ritchie and Isaac Hayden replacing Valentino Lazaro and Federico Fernandez. 72 min There\u2019s a break in play while Xhaka receives treatment. He injured himself while blocking a long-range shot from Sean Longstaff. 70 min Two-nil is a dangerous lead, according to the never-ending book of football cliches, but Arsenal look very comfortable right now. 67 min Aubameyang\u2019s teasing chipped cross, intended for Nketiah, bounces off the top of the crossbar and behind for a goalkick. 65 min \u201cI prefer to say such things after the two goals - how can Arteta play Nketiah, a not even really promising striker, push Auba wide and leave Martinelli on the bench?\u201d sniffs Hurley. As for Ceballos... One final groan - Saka, who is a wonderfully promising player, does all the work for the goal, and Pepe runs off to pose for the cameras. You remember the United and Arsenal players from 98/99, right?!\u201d 63 min: Clark misses a terrific chance! After a long spell of Newcastle possession, Saint-Maximin ran at Bellerin and found Clark eight yards from goal. He took a touch and scuffed a shot that hit David Luiz and deflected just wide of the far post. I don\u2019t think the original shot was going in anyway. 60 min Arsenal were abysmal for much of the first half. Since half-time, and I suspect an appreciable brollocking from Mikel Arteta, they have been electric. 59 min Another good chance for Arsenal. Pepe is fouled on the edge of the area but the ball runs through to Nketiah, with Lee Mason playing a good advantage. Nketiah declines the opportunitiy of a first-time shot, for reasons that aren\u2019t entirely clear, and is dispossessed. The goal was made beautifully by the young left-back Saka. He nutmegged Lazaro on the left wing, moved into the area and crossed low towards Mustafi and Pepe, who were both in space near the penalty spot. Pepe got there first to slide a first-time shot past Dubravka. Two in three minutes! Arsenal have been excellent since half-time and now they lead. Ozil and Ceballos worked the ball across the field to Pepe on the right. He came back inside and lofted a high, hanging cross to the far post, where Aubameyang got between two defenders and planted a superb header across Dubravka. There was no pace at all on the cross, so he had to concentrate on both power and placement. He managed both with aplomb. It\u2019s been coming. 50 min: Nketiah hits the bar! That\u2019s the closest either side has come to taking the lead. Ozil played a nice reverse pass to Pepe, who teased Clark and cut the ball back sharply to the edge of the six-yard box. Nketiah had to stretch slightly away from goal, however, which is why he belted his volley off the top of the crossbar rather than into the net. 50 min It\u2019s been a decent start to the second half from Arsenal, with Newcastle pinned back in their own half. 47 min Ceballos clips a nice pass over the top for Aubameyang, who hooks the bouncing ball wide of the far post. It was a half chance at best. 47 min \u201cMark Lawrenson said that Almiron \u2018looks like a player\u2019,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cbut I do think he looks more like Dr Seuss\u2019s Cat in a Hat.\u201d 46 min Peep peep! Newcastle begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! Newcastle will be the happier team at half-time. They dominated the first half an hour and, though Arsenal improved after an abysmal start, most of Martin Dubravka\u2019s work was straightforward. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min One added minute. 43 min Saint-Maximin reminds Arsenal of his threat with a scintillating 50-yard run down the left. Eventually he beats Bellerin and slides the ball right across the six-yard area. He should have gone for goal as he had nobody in support. 41 min Pepe\u2019s free-kick is tipped over acrobatically by Dubravka - an eyecatching but relatively straightforward. The corner brings a chance for Mustafi, whose shot is headed off the line by Joelinton. 41 min \u201cArsenal started the 2007-08 season with three DMs - Diarra, Flamini and Gilberto - and they were all gone within 18 months,\u201d says Norrie Hernon. \u201cWe haven\u2019t replaced them, or been the same since. 2008 was the last anywhere near complete Arsenal side.\u201d Yes, I\u2019d agree with that (though for a month or so in the spring of 2010 I thought you were going to win the league). It\u2019s just that I suspect many people think Arsenal never recovered from selling Vieira and then Henry, and forget how good that 2007-08 team was before the Birmingham match derailed them. 40 min Aubameyang\u2019s deflected long-range shot just clears the crossbar. Arsenal have been so much better in the last 10 minutes. 37 min Ozil plays a good pass to Nketiah, whose snapshot from 16 yards is a bit too close to Dubravka. It was a confident effort, though. 35 min This is a better spell for Arsenal, who have started to pass the ball to each other with something resembling regularity. 34 min Pepe\u2019s inswinging cross is headed away from goal by Nketiah, who mistimed his jump 12 yards from goal. It was a difficult chance anyway. 32 min Ozil waves an insouciant pass with the outside of the foot to find Aubameyang on the left. He moves infield, shifts the ball away from Fernandez and hits a fairly tame low shot that is comfortably saved by Dubravka at the near post. 30 min Saint-Maximin does really well to release the overlapping Rose, whose cutback towards Joelinton is cleared by David Luiz. Saint-Maximin is a serious talent. 29 min An excellent inswinging corner from Pepe skims the head of Mustafi at the near post and hits David Luiz on the edge of the six-yard box. He would have needed supernatural reactions to do anything with that. 28 min Here\u2019s Ian Copestake. \u201cI pray the VAR gods will be kind to you today, my son, and not see you headbutting the confessional.\u201d I\u2019m zen. VAR anger is so 2019. 25 min Almiron goes on a dangerous run from the halfway line to the edge of the Arsenal area. He looks round, realises he has no company except five Arsenal players, and dives. No foul. 25 min Arsenal have been absolutely swearword slangword. 24 min Another good break from Newcastle. The impressive Saint-Maximin finds the overlapping Bentaleb, whose low cross is too close to Leno. 22 min \u201cGod, this is depressing,\u201d says Norrie Hernon. \u201cWhen you say \u2018Arsenal haven\u2019t got going at all\u2019, do you mean a) this game b) this season c) since 2008 or d) existentially?\u201d 2008, you say. Interesting. Very ... interesting. 21 min An imaginative effort from Saka, curled towards the far top corner from the edge of the area, drifts a few yards wide. 20 min Sean Longstaff belts the free-kick miles over the bar. 19 min The lively Saint-Maximin is fouled 30 yards from goal by Ceballos. Newcastle have been much the better team in the first 20 minutes. 18 min Lazaro has been extremely impressive on his full debut. 15 min Saint-Maximin beats Ceballos with ease on the left of the area and cuts the ball back for Joelinton, who shoots just wide at the near post. The ball was slightly behind him, otherwise I think he\u2019d have scored. 14 min Leno makes a good save. Newcastle tried the old Beckham/Scholes corner, with Lazaro driving it to the edge of the D for Longstaff to volley. He didn\u2019t get hold of it but it took a big deflection, forcing Leno to scramble across his line and push it behind for a corner. 12 min Arsenal haven\u2019t got going at all. 9 min It\u2019s been a bright start from Newcastle, with Lazaro looking lively at right wing-back. Xhaka is booked for pulling him back off the ball. 6 min Saint-Maximin is fouled just outside the area by Xhaka. The referee waves play on. 5 min A good break from Newcastle. Joelinton runs at Mustafi down the left and hammers a cross that is controlled by Lazaro beyond the far post. He dances between two defenders and is about to shoot when Aubameyang stabs the ball behind for a corner. 3 min Bellerin wins an early corner for Arsenal. It\u2019s curled in by Pepe and volleyed clear at the near post. 1 min Peep peep! Arsenal kick off from right to left. The players emerge from the tunnel. It\u2019s a beautiful afternoon in north London. Little brisk. \u201cBellerin has been looking more than a bit tentative since coming back - I blame the haircut,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cIs it time, Rob, for a Joy of Six on footballers who have lost potency along with long locks? Bellerin, Fellaini, er, Gullit .. Samson \u2026. I\u2019m sure you can think of the remainder.\u201d KENNY SAMSON ROFL?!?!?!?!?!?! \u201cWell,\u201d says Patrick van IJzendoorn, \u201cat least Portadown managed to score.\u201d My favourite part of this clubt is the windmill celebration. Yep, you the man. \u201cAll to play for,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cLove the match programme cover with a vintage photo of Lee Dixon and Paul Gascoigne, back in the days when you didn\u2019t want too much starch in your shorts, or hair. Play up, play up!\u201d Pre-match entertainment Pre-match reading Eddie Nketiah makes his full Premier League debut for Arsenal, while Dani Ceballos plays in the league for the first time since the start of November.

      "body": "<p>That the government\u2019s apprenticeships programme in England is in trouble is generally accepted, even if it is not widely enough known. While the particular problem most likely to catch the government\u2019s attention is probably funding, since the scheme as currently organised is <a href=\"https://www.edsk.org/publications/runaway-training/\" title=\"\">predicted to go bust</a>, issues surrounding the low quality and patchy regulation of the whole system are arguably even more important.</p> <p>Low productivity in the UK has long been a problem, and the period since the 2008/09 crash has been particularly bad. In December, the Royal Statistical Society made the average annual increase over the past decade \u2013 just 0.3% \u2013 its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/23/statistic-of-decade-award-03-per-cent\" title=\"\">statistic of the 2010s</a>. Understood as an effect of skills shortages, this is the problem that apprenticeships were supposed to solve. That the plan isn\u2019t working is damaging to the economy as a whole, as well as to the people and businesses that apprenticeships are designed to support.</p> <p>While the scheme\u2019s critics do not agree about everything, most agree that it was flawed from the start. The basic idea, championed by George Osborne when he was chancellor, and introduced under Theresa May in 2017, was and remains a good one: larger businesses pay a levy (effectively a tax) to fund vocational training. The charge was set at 0.5% of salary bills in excess of \u00a33m, which meant less than 2% of employers would pay it. But in an attempt to sweeten the taste of this unpalatable new demand, while sending a Conservative \u201cbusiness knows best\u201d message, ministers gave employers too much say over what would happen next. They also made some highly questionable assumptions about how businesses would respond to the financial incentives created by the scheme, which have led to a situation in which the pot is too quickly being emptied out.</p> <p>There were 393,400 new apprentices in 2018/19, representing an increase of almost 18,000 on the previous year (in 2017/18, by comparison, <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/17-01-2019/sb252-higher-education-student-statistics/numbers\" title=\"\">548,000 students</a> started a first undergraduate degree course).

      "bodyText": "That the government\u2019s apprenticeships programme in England is in trouble is generally accepted, even if it is not widely enough known. While the particular problem most likely to catch the government\u2019s attention is probably funding, since the scheme as currently organised is predicted to go bust, issues surrounding the low quality and patchy regulation of the whole system are arguably even more important. Low productivity in the UK has long been a problem, and the period since the 2008/09 crash has been particularly bad. In December, the Royal Statistical Society made the average annual increase over the past decade \u2013 just 0.3% \u2013 its statistic of the 2010s. Understood as an effect of skills shortages, this is the problem that apprenticeships were supposed to solve. That the plan isn\u2019t working is damaging to the economy as a whole, as well as to the people and businesses that apprenticeships are designed to support. While the scheme\u2019s critics do not agree about everything, most agree that it was flawed from the start. The basic idea, championed by George Osborne when he was chancellor, and introduced under Theresa May in 2017, was and remains a good one: larger businesses pay a levy (effectively a tax) to fund vocational training. The charge was set at 0.5% of salary bills in excess of \u00a33m, which meant less than 2% of employers would pay it. But in an attempt to sweeten the taste of this unpalatable new demand, while sending a Conservative \u201cbusiness knows best\u201d message, ministers gave employers too much say over what would happen next. They also made some highly questionable assumptions about how businesses would respond to the financial incentives created by the scheme, which have led to a situation in which the pot is too quickly being emptied out. There were 393,400 new apprentices in 2018/19, representing an increase of almost 18,000 on the previous year (in 2017/18, by comparison, 548,000 students started a first undergraduate degree course). Apprenticeships, which are trainee positions governed by certain rules (such as 20% off-the-job learning, and a minimum period of one year) are a crucial component of our education and employment system. Yet while many businesses and individuals are benefiting under the current arrangements, there is growing evidence of the ways in which they are not working as planned. This includes the fact that the number of new starters has, despite last year\u2019s rise, fallen sharply since the levy started \u2013 and is nowhere near the original target of 3 million. Meanwhile the proportion of apprentices who are school-leavers \u2013 the age group with whom the term is most readily associated in people\u2019s minds \u2013 is less than a quarter of the total: in 2018/19, just 24.8% of new starters (97,700) were aged under 19. Nor do the problems end when people are taken on. Investigations have found instances of apprentices in low-skilled roles who do not know they are apprentices, and employers rebadging other kinds of training as a means to access funds. Meanwhile, official flexibility over the definition of an apprentice has led to the extraordinary situation whereby \u00a345m of funding over two years has been spent on employees studying for MBAs. Last month a highly critical report from EDSK, a thinktank, recommended that the classification of an apprenticeship should be reviewed, along with the system\u2019s buckling finances and regulation. Now that Gavin Williamson has been reinstalled as education secretary, these are suggestions he should urgently take up in combination with the Treasury, which has responsibility for the levy. British politicians\u2019 ingrained unwillingness to treat skills training as seriously as universities and schools has historically been a cause of social injustice as well as economic underperformance, and reflects badly on the nation as a whole \u2013 particularly when compared with other European nations such as Germany. If the government is serious about its \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda, a renewed focus on vocational training would be an excellent place to start. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly stated that between 2017 and 2019, just 7,100 under-19s began apprenticeships.

Emmett McConomy, whose older brother Stephen was shot in the back of the head with a plastic bullet, said the new Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, needed to understand the strength of feeling among families who had not yet seen cases involving British soldiers come to court. \u201cWe\u2019re asking that we be listened to, because we\u2019re not going away. Victims\u2019 families in Northern Ireland want to see justice, and they are asking for the truth to come out,\u201d McConomy said, 38 years after his brother, a Catholic, was killed on the street in April 1982. McConomy\u2019s remarks come amid fresh uncertainty, following last week\u2019s cabinet reshuffle, as to whether the UK will attempt to introduce a form of amnesty from prosecution for British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland. Stephen was playing in the street when he was shot at close range by a soldier using a plastic bullet from a Saracen armoured car in Derry, at a time when there was no ongoing disturbance. \u201cHe had his hands in his pockets, was walking away from the Saracen, and he was shot in the back of the head,\u201d his brother said. The 11-year-old lay on a grass verge critically injured for several minutes and the soldier \u201cthreatened to shoot other kids who came to his aid\u201d, McConomy said. The youngster was eventually rescued but died three days later, having suffered catastrophic brain damage. There was only a limited investigation by military police, with the soldier \u2013 whose name is known, as are those of the others who were with him in the armoured vehicle \u2013 saying he fired accidentally. An inquest was held the following year and returned an open verdict, but only after, said McConomy, \u201cthe jury had wanted to conclude there was no justification for the discharge, but the coroner told them \u2018you can\u2019t say that\u2019.

Shouldn\u2019t people be held accountable to what they did that day?\u201d More than 3,000 people were killed during the Troubles, and about 900 cases involving 1,200 people remain unresolved, even though the Good Friday agreement ending the conflict was signed over two decades ago. Most involve deaths attributed to republican or loyalist paramilitaries, but about 29% involve security personnel, including up to 200 soldiers. Julian Smith was sacked as Northern Ireland minister by Boris Johnson on Thursday and replaced by Brandon Lewis, amid restlessness in Conservative circles about creating a new historical investigations unit that would examine unresolved deaths during the three-decade long Troubles. There were indications last week that Downing Street had become nervous about Smith\u2019s approach and any concessions that may have been made to Sinn F\u00e9in to secure their long-term cooperation in the reconstituted Stormont administration. Meanwhile, several high-profile Conservative backbenchers, including Mark Francois, want proposals that would introduce a presumption against vexatious historic prosecutions for former military personnel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan to be extended to cover Northern Ireland. But on his first visit to Belfast on Friday, Lewis said he stood by commitments made as part of the Stormont deal. When asked if that included legacy investigations, the new minister said \u201cabsolutely\u201d. Some historic cases are coming to trial, including the case of Soldier F, a former paratrooper who is accused of two murders during Bloody Sunday, when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Derry in January 1972. McConomy said Smith had been a relatively effective Northern Ireland secretary. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of secretaries of state come and go,\u201d he said. \u201cMany have been a waste of space, but Smith looked like he was making progress and had been close to dealing with the legacy issue.\u201d",

Having become a father on Saturday, his tiredness could be excused. \u201cFunny game,\u201d mused Mourinho. \u201cIt is time to celebrate the goal he scores and forget the goal he scores in our goal.\u201d Meanwhile, his definitive central defender was in the Villa dugout. Either side could have benefited from John Terry in his Chelsea prime, in a team that only conceded 15 league goals in a season. Spurs have already let in 17 under Mourinho. But if he has not been Mourinho enough, an insufficiently pragmatic pragmatist, the table suggests the unlikely entertainer is upwardly mobile.",

      "body": "<p>As the Windrush scandal was breaking, it became clear that there were two parallel perceptions of the UK\u2019s immigration system. Those who had been mangled by the Home Office machine knew the truth: that the system was cruel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/12/home-office-tells-man-101-his-parents-must-confirm-id\" title=\"\">broken</a>. The other view, more popular but fabricated, was that the country\u2019s immigration policy was lax, gullible and open to abuse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The overall result is a climate unreceptive to the anxiety of students on British campuses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The same now applies to life on Britain\u2019s university campuses. Last week a report found a culture of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51447615\" title=\"\">non-disclosure agreement abuse</a>. NDAs, originally designed to prevent departing university staff from sharing professional secrets, are now being used to gag victims of sexual harassment, bullying and poor teaching in order to protect the abusers and, by extension, the universities themselves. Freedom of information requests by the BBC in 2019 revealed that UK universities had paid about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/17/uk-universities-pay-out-90m-on-staff-gagging-orders-in-past-two-years\" title=\"\">\u00a387m in NDA payoffs</a> in the previous two years. This suggests a nationwide and institutional failure to protect students from predatory abusers, a culture of exploitation of those who are vulnerable, and a failure to meet the needs of those with disabilities. In other cases, when universities failed to adequately investigate sexual assault allegations, students were pressured into signing NDAs without even receiving a payout, the BBC report found. This is likely to be only the latest instalment in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/universities-failing-to-address-thousands-of-racist-incidents\" title=\"\">series of revelations</a> exposing an unregulated culture of thuggery and malpractice in academic establishments. In October, an inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found that about a quarter of minority ethnic students, including non-British white students, said they had experienced racial harassment since the start of their course, and that not only did British universities not tackle the thousands of racist incidents experienced, they also refused to acknowledge the scale of the problem.</p> <p>It is also likely that students\u2019 negative experiences and any potential measures to address their widespread concerns will continue to be submerged by a fictional, popular narrative of British universities as a hotbed of woke culture populated by a snowflake generation wanting to eject from jobs or the public space anyone who in their sensitive eyes has offended them. Another word for this alleged behaviour is \u201ccancel culture\u201d. The term now has its own entry in the urban dictionary, which calls it a phenomenon perpetrated by those \u201c<a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cancel%20Culture\" title=\"\">quick to judge and slow to question</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Little is said of what is arguably more prevalent and more effective: what I call wokesmearing \u2013 the stigmatising and shaming of someone for crimes of extreme political correctness. Wokesmearing has a more powerful engine than worthy students. The rightwing press and tabloid media will fix on any incident that looks like it may be an example of progressive values overstepping the mark. If none or few of these incidents are found, they are made up. Scant details are tortured into solid stories, and before those stories can be challenged or even corrected, they have passed into the mainstream narrative.</p> <p>Take the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/26/cambridge-student-accuses-telegraph-of-inciting-hatred-in-books-row\" title=\"\">Lola Olufemi</a>. All she and her fellow Cambridge students wanted to do was introduce some new writers into their syllabus. In 2017, they sent an open letter to the literature faculty requesting that non-white authors be added to the curriculum. Four months later, after precisely zero complaints from fellow students or members of the faculty, and before any decision had been made, the Telegraph published Olufemi\u2019s picture on its front page with the headline: \u201cStudent forces Cambridge to drop white authors\u201d. Within days <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/essentials/daily-telegraph-student-forced-cambridge-drop-white-authors-story-wrong-518574\" title=\"\">the story</a> was given credibility when it was debated in earnest on BBC Radio 4. The very channel that broke the NDA story is frequently a useful tool for the promotion of stories that originate in less responsible outlets, a gullible eager consumer of fake outrage. When I spoke to Olufemi a few months later, she said the most frustrating thing, other than \u201cbeing called upon to address the lies as if they were legitimate\u201d, was that the artificial outrage obscured what was actually happening on the ground on campus, the abuse she was receiving and the chill that had been sent down the spines of other black students \u2013 many of whom were from disadvantaged backgrounds and could not afford loss of future employment prospects if they were seen as troublemakers. The whole effort to simply add more authors to a syllabus, not to replace any, had been successfully wokesmeared.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/14/market-universities-crisis-staff-strike\">Market economics has driven universities into crisis \u2013 and we\u2019re all paying the price | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And on it goes. As university campuses become increasingly unsafe for students and employees, a carousel of mythical stories is confected, amplified and recycled. So rich has this genre of reporting become that it now has its own formula: big, flashy, pearl-clutching headline followed by a quote from someone scandalised by the latest liberty-taking, then rounded off by a tiny detail, one buried at the end, that invalidates the whole story. One such example is a BBC news dispatch from October 2017. It starts with \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-41678937\" title=\"\">Cambridge Uni students get Shakespeare trigger warnings</a>\u201d, only to end with: \u201cSome lecturers indicate that some sensitive material will be covered in a lecture \u2026 this is entirely at the lecturer\u2019s own discretion and is in no way indicative of a faculty-wide policy.\u201d</p> <p>The same principle is applied to all the developments we now take as an integral part of British campus culture, such as safe spaces and no-platforming and terrified administrators cowed by leftie students. No-platforming in particular is frequently presented as a simple case of mob rule and of frightened faculties placating students, when they often, far less contentiously, involve college bureaucrats lacking the resources to responsibly curate controversial union debates and the associated right of protest that comes with that.</p> <p>The repercussions of the campaign by the cynical and the credulous are not just limited to point scoring in a culture war. The overall result is a climate unreceptive to the anxiety of students on British campuses. The fact that report after report states that universities are failing to act is down to more than just denial; it is a complacency and an impunity fostered by a rightwing culture that reinforces and perpetuates the myth that liberal spaces, especially universities, are dangerous, progressive playgrounds undermining tradition and common sense. Until that propaganda is acknowledged and combated, the calls of distressed students from the UK\u2019s campuses will continue to go unheard.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the Windrush scandal was breaking, it became clear that there were two parallel perceptions of the UK\u2019s immigration system. Those who had been mangled by the Home Office machine knew the truth: that the system was cruel and broken. The other view, more popular but fabricated, was that the country\u2019s immigration policy was lax, gullible and open to abuse. The same now applies to life on Britain\u2019s university campuses. Last week a report found a culture of non-disclosure agreement abuse. NDAs, originally designed to prevent departing university staff from sharing professional secrets, are now being used to gag victims of sexual harassment, bullying and poor teaching in order to protect the abusers and, by extension, the universities themselves. Freedom of information requests by the BBC in 2019 revealed that UK universities had paid about \u00a387m in NDA payoffs in the previous two years. This suggests a nationwide and institutional failure to protect students from predatory abusers, a culture of exploitation of those who are vulnerable, and a failure to meet the needs of those with disabilities. In other cases, when universities failed to adequately investigate sexual assault allegations, students were pressured into signing NDAs without even receiving a payout, the BBC report found. This is likely to be only the latest instalment in a series of revelations exposing an unregulated culture of thuggery and malpractice in academic establishments. In October, an inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found that about a quarter of minority ethnic students, including non-British white students, said they had experienced racial harassment since the start of their course, and that not only did British universities not tackle the thousands of racist incidents experienced, they also refused to acknowledge the scale of the problem. It is also likely that students\u2019 negative experiences and any potential measures to address their widespread concerns will continue to be submerged by a fictional, popular narrative of British universities as a hotbed of woke culture populated by a snowflake generation wanting to eject from jobs or the public space anyone who in their sensitive eyes has offended them. Another word for this alleged behaviour is \u201ccancel culture\u201d. The term now has its own entry in the urban dictionary, which calls it a phenomenon perpetrated by those \u201cquick to judge and slow to question\u201d. Little is said of what is arguably more prevalent and more effective: what I call wokesmearing \u2013 the stigmatising and shaming of someone for crimes of extreme political correctness. Wokesmearing has a more powerful engine than worthy students. The rightwing press and tabloid media will fix on any incident that looks like it may be an example of progressive values overstepping the mark. If none or few of these incidents are found, they are made up. Scant details are tortured into solid stories, and before those stories can be challenged or even corrected, they have passed into the mainstream narrative. Take the case of Lola Olufemi. All she and her fellow Cambridge students wanted to do was introduce some new writers into their syllabus. In 2017, they sent an open letter to the literature faculty requesting that non-white authors be added to the curriculum. Four months later, after precisely zero complaints from fellow students or members of the faculty, and before any decision had been made, the Telegraph published Olufemi\u2019s picture on its front page with the headline: \u201cStudent forces Cambridge to drop white authors\u201d. Within days the story was given credibility when it was debated in earnest on BBC Radio 4. The very channel that broke the NDA story is frequently a useful tool for the promotion of stories that originate in less responsible outlets, a gullible eager consumer of fake outrage. When I spoke to Olufemi a few months later, she said the most frustrating thing, other than \u201cbeing called upon to address the lies as if they were legitimate\u201d, was that the artificial outrage obscured what was actually happening on the ground on campus, the abuse she was receiving and the chill that had been sent down the spines of other black students \u2013 many of whom were from disadvantaged backgrounds and could not afford loss of future employment prospects if they were seen as troublemakers. The whole effort to simply add more authors to a syllabus, not to replace any, had been successfully wokesmeared. And on it goes. As university campuses become increasingly unsafe for students and employees, a carousel of mythical stories is confected, amplified and recycled. So rich has this genre of reporting become that it now has its own formula: big, flashy, pearl-clutching headline followed by a quote from someone scandalised by the latest liberty-taking, then rounded off by a tiny detail, one buried at the end, that invalidates the whole story. One such example is a BBC news dispatch from October 2017. It starts with \u201cCambridge Uni students get Shakespeare trigger warnings\u201d, only to end with: \u201cSome lecturers indicate that some sensitive material will be covered in a lecture \u2026 this is entirely at the lecturer\u2019s own discretion and is in no way indicative of a faculty-wide policy.\u201d The same principle is applied to all the developments we now take as an integral part of British campus culture, such as safe spaces and no-platforming and terrified administrators cowed by leftie students. No-platforming in particular is frequently presented as a simple case of mob rule and of frightened faculties placating students, when they often, far less contentiously, involve college bureaucrats lacking the resources to responsibly curate controversial union debates and the associated right of protest that comes with that. The repercussions of the campaign by the cynical and the credulous are not just limited to point scoring in a culture war. The overall result is a climate unreceptive to the anxiety of students on British campuses. The fact that report after report states that universities are failing to act is down to more than just denial; it is a complacency and an impunity fostered by a rightwing culture that reinforces and perpetuates the myth that liberal spaces, especially universities, are dangerous, progressive playgrounds undermining tradition and common sense. Until that propaganda is acknowledged and combated, the calls of distressed students from the UK\u2019s campuses will continue to go unheard. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney faces being hauled before parliament to answer questions about a embarrassing security breach that allowed hedge funds early access to an audio feed of market-moving press conferences.</p> <p>Mel Stride, the Conservative MP who is chair-elect of the Treasury select committee, said he would call in Carney and his incoming successor Andrew Bailey to explain the breach, which could have allowed hedge funds to make money by buying or selling sterling depending on Carney\u2019s sentiments on the economy.</p> <p>The misuse of the feed, which was unknown to the Bank until it was alerted by the press in December, could have given hedge funds a five seconds\u2019 edge over rivals in accessing market-sensitive information \u2013 a crucial and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/19/eight-seconds-illicit-audio-feed-mark-carney-press-conference\">potentially lucrative advantage</a> in an era of high-speed algorithmic trading.</p> <p>For example in February 2019, the pound slumped to a two-week low of $1.2854 and the Bank issued its worst growth forecast in a decade. But then it quickly rallied, spiking to $1.2997 after Carney said in a press conference that a reduction in Brexit uncertainty would help the economy.</p> <p>Stride said: \u201cThis is a worrying story on the integrity of the Bank\u2019s information security. When the new Treasury committee is formed, I\u2019d expect us to see the outgoing Mark Carney and incoming Andrew Bailey pretty swiftly. I\u2019ve no doubt that we\u2019ll have some searching questions for them to answer in order to get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p> <p>The security breach followed a restructuring of the Bank\u2019s security division that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/21/bank-of-england-audio-leak-followed-loss-of-key-cybersecurity-staff\">prompted a wave of senior departures</a>, first revealed by the Observer. Rob Elsey, an executive director who serves as chief information officer, will become the latest top-ranking security official to leave since the restructuring. He will leave the Bank by June to take up a new role, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>A Bank spokesman said Elsey\u2019s departure was not linked to the security breach under investigation.</p> <p>Elsey reports to Joanna Place, the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer with final responsibility for security, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/19/hedge-funds-hacked-into-bank-of-england-briefings\">faced calls to resign</a> because of the breach. The chief operating officer reports directly to the governor.</p> <p>Elsey said: \u201cAfter a hugely enjoyable and successful five years at the Bank I have decided to take up an exciting new role that offers the opportunity to relocate. This move has been in the works for a number of months, and while it is never easy to leave, the opportunity is one I couldn\u2019t say no to. I will be serving my full notice period, leaving the Bank on 1 June.\u201d</p> <p>The security lapse has cast a shadow over the final months of Carney\u2019s time as governor, and may cause problems for incoming governor Bailey, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/andrew-bailey-appointed-head-of-bank-of-england\">takes over at Threadneedle Street on 16 March</a>. Bailey has promised to recuse himself from all discussions on the breach to avoid a potential conflict of interest while his previous employer, the Financial Conduct Authority, investigates.</p> <p>David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank\u2019s influential monetary policy committee, reiterated his call for Place to resign. \u201cIt looks like the buck doesn\u2019t stop at the top,\u201d he said. \u201cThis needs to be fully investigated by the Treasury select committee.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian understands that the Bank commissioned internal and external assessments of the restructuring plans, some of which warned against the approach. Sam Woods, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, challenged the decision in November 2019 during a meeting of the executive risk committee. The Bank said this was a normal part of his duties as chair of the committee, and that he supported the decision.</p> <p>A Bank spokesman said: \u201cIn order to strengthen information security, the Bank overhauled its approach in 2019. The new design drew on third-party expertise and extensive consideration of different models in the private and public sector. The resulting structure clarified first-line accountability and consolidated it within the Bank\u2019s technology directorate. It also placed second-line challenge in the new, independent risk directorate.</p> <p>\u201cThe restructure has the full support of the executive risk committee, chaired by Sam Woods, and the Bank\u2019s audit and risk committee.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney faces being hauled before parliament to answer questions about a embarrassing security breach that allowed hedge funds early access to an audio feed of market-moving press conferences. Mel Stride, the Conservative MP who is chair-elect of the Treasury select committee, said he would call in Carney and his incoming successor Andrew Bailey to explain the breach, which could have allowed hedge funds to make money by buying or selling sterling depending on Carney\u2019s sentiments on the economy. The misuse of the feed, which was unknown to the Bank until it was alerted by the press in December, could have given hedge funds a five seconds\u2019 edge over rivals in accessing market-sensitive information \u2013 a crucial and potentially lucrative advantage in an era of high-speed algorithmic trading. For example in February 2019, the pound slumped to a two-week low of $1.2854 and the Bank issued its worst growth forecast in a decade. But then it quickly rallied, spiking to $1.2997 after Carney said in a press conference that a reduction in Brexit uncertainty would help the economy. Stride said: \u201cThis is a worrying story on the integrity of the Bank\u2019s information security. When the new Treasury committee is formed, I\u2019d expect us to see the outgoing Mark Carney and incoming Andrew Bailey pretty swiftly. I\u2019ve no doubt that we\u2019ll have some searching questions for them to answer in order to get to the bottom of this.\u201d The security breach followed a restructuring of the Bank\u2019s security division that prompted a wave of senior departures, first revealed by the Observer. Rob Elsey, an executive director who serves as chief information officer, will become the latest top-ranking security official to leave since the restructuring. He will leave the Bank by June to take up a new role, the Guardian can reveal. A Bank spokesman said Elsey\u2019s departure was not linked to the security breach under investigation. Elsey reports to Joanna Place, the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer with final responsibility for security, who has faced calls to resign because of the breach. The chief operating officer reports directly to the governor. Elsey said: \u201cAfter a hugely enjoyable and successful five years at the Bank I have decided to take up an exciting new role that offers the opportunity to relocate. This move has been in the works for a number of months, and while it is never easy to leave, the opportunity is one I couldn\u2019t say no to. I will be serving my full notice period, leaving the Bank on 1 June.\u201d The security lapse has cast a shadow over the final months of Carney\u2019s time as governor, and may cause problems for incoming governor Bailey, who takes over at Threadneedle Street on 16 March. Bailey has promised to recuse himself from all discussions on the breach to avoid a potential conflict of interest while his previous employer, the Financial Conduct Authority, investigates. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank\u2019s influential monetary policy committee, reiterated his call for Place to resign. \u201cIt looks like the buck doesn\u2019t stop at the top,\u201d he said. \u201cThis needs to be fully investigated by the Treasury select committee.\u201d The Guardian understands that the Bank commissioned internal and external assessments of the restructuring plans, some of which warned against the approach. Sam Woods, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, challenged the decision in November 2019 during a meeting of the executive risk committee. The Bank said this was a normal part of his duties as chair of the committee, and that he supported the decision. A Bank spokesman said: \u201cIn order to strengthen information security, the Bank overhauled its approach in 2019. The new design drew on third-party expertise and extensive consideration of different models in the private and public sector. The resulting structure clarified first-line accountability and consolidated it within the Bank\u2019s technology directorate. It also placed second-line challenge in the new, independent risk directorate. \u201cThe restructure has the full support of the executive risk committee, chaired by Sam Woods, and the Bank\u2019s audit and risk committee.\u201d",

Should it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking ahead of a talk at the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s annual meeting in Seattle, Feldman Barrett said the idea of universal facial expressions for happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust had gained traction in the 1960s after an <a href=\"https://www.paulekman.com/resources/universal-facial-expressions/\">American psychologist, Paul Ekman</a>, conducted research in Papua New Guinea showing that members of an isolated tribe gave similar answers to Americans when asked to match photographs of people displaying facial expressions with different scenarios, such as \u201cBobby\u2019s dog has died\u201d.</p> <p>However, a growing body of evidence has shown that beyond these basic stereotypes there is a huge range in how people express emotion, both across and within cultures.</p> <p>In western cultures, for instance, people have been found to scowl only about 30% of the time when they\u2019re angry, she said, meaning they move their faces in other ways about 70% of the time.</p> <p>\u201cThere is low reliability,\u201d Feldman Barrett said. \u201cAnd people often scowl when they\u2019re not angry. That\u2019s what we\u2019d call low specificity. People scowl when they\u2019re concentrating really hard, when you tell a bad joke, when they have gas.\u201d</p> <p>The expression that is supposed to be universal for fear is the supposed stereotype for a threat or anger face in Malaysia, she said. There are also wide variations within cultures in terms of how people express emotions, while context such as body language and who a person is talking to is critical.</p> <p>\u201cAI is largely being trained on the assumption that everyone expresses emotion in the same way,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s very powerful technology being used to answer very simplistic questions.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that companies claim can \u201cread\u201d facial expressions is based on outdated science and risks being unreliable and discriminatory, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the psychology of emotion has warned. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, said that such technologies appear to disregard a growing body of evidence undermining the notion that the basic facial expressions are universal across cultures. As a result, such technologies \u2013 some of which are already being deployed in real-world settings \u2013 run the risk of being unreliable or discriminatory, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how companies can continue to justify what they\u2019re doing when it\u2019s really clear what the evidence is,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some companies that just continue to claim things that can\u2019t possibly be true.\u201d Her warning comes as such systems are being rolled out for a growing number of applications. In October, Unilever claimed that it had saved 100,000 hours of human recruitment time last year by deploying such software to analyse video interviews. The AI system, developed by the company HireVue, scans candidates\u2019 facial expressions, body language and word choice and cross-references them with traits that considered to be correlated with job success. Amazon claims its own facial recognition system, Rekognition, can detect seven basic emotions \u2013 happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, calmness and confusion. The EU is reported to be trialling software which purportedly can detect deception through an analysis of micro-expressions in an attempt to bolster border security. \u201cBased on the published scientific evidence, our judgment is that [these technologies] shouldn\u2019t be rolled out and used to make consequential decisions about people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Feldman Barrett. Speaking ahead of a talk at the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s annual meeting in Seattle, Feldman Barrett said the idea of universal facial expressions for happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust had gained traction in the 1960s after an American psychologist, Paul Ekman, conducted research in Papua New Guinea showing that members of an isolated tribe gave similar answers to Americans when asked to match photographs of people displaying facial expressions with different scenarios, such as \u201cBobby\u2019s dog has died\u201d. However, a growing body of evidence has shown that beyond these basic stereotypes there is a huge range in how people express emotion, both across and within cultures. In western cultures, for instance, people have been found to scowl only about 30% of the time when they\u2019re angry, she said, meaning they move their faces in other ways about 70% of the time. \u201cThere is low reliability,\u201d Feldman Barrett said. \u201cAnd people often scowl when they\u2019re not angry. That\u2019s what we\u2019d call low specificity. People scowl when they\u2019re concentrating really hard, when you tell a bad joke, when they have gas.\u201d The expression that is supposed to be universal for fear is the supposed stereotype for a threat or anger face in Malaysia, she said. There are also wide variations within cultures in terms of how people express emotions, while context such as body language and who a person is talking to is critical. \u201cAI is largely being trained on the assumption that everyone expresses emotion in the same way,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s very powerful technology being used to answer very simplistic questions.\u201d",

And in that sense financial fair play, and whether you think it a reasonable defence against feckless owners/limitlessly wealthy interests or a scandalous defence to protect the existing elite, becomes largely irrelevant \u2013 albeit the regulations are closely enough related to the greater theme that City fans can cry conspiracy.

City have neither denied the veracity of the emails nor apologised for them, preferring to point out they were illegally obtained.</p> <p>The sense is of extraordinarily rich owners used to their wealth ensuring they get their own way, which is where City\u2019s response becomes so telling: \u201cThis is a case initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa.\u201d</p> <p>If they really believe financial fair play was, as the more paranoid fringe of City fans insists it is, a disgraceful mechanism designed to prevent their ascent, they could long before now have challenged it in the European courts.

When clubs submit their accounts to Uefa for ratification to be permitted to compete in a Uefa tournament, it is not clear who else they think should have jurisdiction. This is how sports are run.</p> <p>That problem, intriguingly, is one raised by the club\u2019s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, in his 2011 book Goal: The Ball Doesn\u2019t Go in By Chance. \u201cLike all industries,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfootball also has a regulatory body \u2026 that defines the competition rules and monitors their compliance. However, with an enormous, unique difference, this regulator also competes in the football market with some very advantageous conditions \u2026 They compete with the clubs for the audience \u2026 They also compete for sponsors \u2026 They exercise their powers in very favourable conditions: they fix the calendar, the competition. A more normal situation would be for Uefa and Fifa to concentrate on doing what a bakers\u2019 guild really does, which is to regulate and not to compete. But this is not possible.\u201d</p> <p>That sounds a lot like somebody who has been waiting for years to cut Uefa down to size. But Soriano does have a point. There is an inherent contradiction when the game\u2019s regulator is also a financial competitor. And it is precisely that fact that is so dangerous for Uefa.</p> <p>Uefa is not the only regulator/competitor. There is also Fifa, which through its promotion of the Club World Cup has already begun to try to challenge Uefa\u2019s control over the club game. Infantino, the Spiegel leaks revealed, helped negotiate a settlement when City and Paris Saint-Germain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/02/gianni-infantino-manchester-city-psg-positive-ffp-talks\" title=\"\">were first found to have breached FFP regulations</a>. Perhaps the Fifa president was acting for the good of the game. Perhaps he was simply smoothing a path so football could continue without endless legal wrangling. Or perhaps he saw the value in accruing political capital with two boundlessly wealthy clubs who were already chafing at Uefa\u2019s restrictions.</p> <p>This is not a straightforward problem. The divide between Uefa and the interests of the superclubs is not absolute. Uefa for decades has met the threat of a breakaway super league with reluctant compromises, yielding incrementally to the greed of the superclubs. Now it finally stands up to a superclub, it is in defence of a principle supported by other superclubs, and a principle in part designed to ensure their profits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the ramifications could still be seismic. What if City spend their two years out of Uefa competition playing lucrative friendlies around the world? What if they show that you don\u2019t actually need Uefa and its (already barely significant) concerns for smaller clubs to thrive? What if Fifa were willing to provide the umbrella of a new competition? That has always been the existential threat hanging over Uefa.</p> <p>Everywhere the old conventions are falling away, institutions that seemed inviolable proving impotent before those willing to ignore them. This could be football\u2019s moment.</p>",

It had seemed likely the Club World Cup would be the trigger, making clear the financial draw of the superclubs allowed them to operate without Uefa, Fifa offering the fig leaf that allowed them to accept vast sums from outside the game \u2013 just as this season\u2019s Spanish Super Cup permitted four La Liga clubs to take large payments to help sportswash the Saudi state under the guise of spreading the game. But Uefa has decided, whether through circumstance or design, that this should be the battleground. And in that sense financial fair play, and whether you think it a reasonable defence against feckless owners/limitlessly wealthy interests or a scandalous defence to protect the existing elite, becomes largely irrelevant \u2013 albeit the regulations are closely enough related to the greater theme that City fans can cry conspiracy. For this is, fundamentally, about power. What seemed most striking about hacked emails published by Der Spiegel in November 2018 was the contempt with which various City executives spoke of Uefa: the joking comment allegedly made by City\u2019s lawyer, Simon Cliff, when a member of Uefa\u2019s investigatory chamber died, \u201cone down, six to go\u201d, and the claim the club chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, had told the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, that City would rather \u201csue for the next 10 years\u201d than pay another fine. City have neither denied the veracity of the emails nor apologised for them, preferring to point out they were illegally obtained. The sense is of extraordinarily rich owners used to their wealth ensuring they get their own way, which is where City\u2019s response becomes so telling: \u201cThis is a case initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa.\u201d If they really believe financial fair play was, as the more paranoid fringe of City fans insists it is, a disgraceful mechanism designed to prevent their ascent, they could long before now have challenged it in the European courts. If they really believe there is a corrupt cartel of top clubs habitually getting away with FFP breaches, they could employ forensic accountants to expose them. It is not as though money is a problem. But instead they target the organisation and its processes, objecting to protocols to which they signed up. When clubs submit their accounts to Uefa for ratification to be permitted to compete in a Uefa tournament, it is not clear who else they think should have jurisdiction. This is how sports are run. That problem, intriguingly, is one raised by the club\u2019s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, in his 2011 book Goal: The Ball Doesn\u2019t Go in By Chance. \u201cLike all industries,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfootball also has a regulatory body \u2026 that defines the competition rules and monitors their compliance. However, with an enormous, unique difference, this regulator also competes in the football market with some very advantageous conditions \u2026 They compete with the clubs for the audience \u2026 They also compete for sponsors \u2026 They exercise their powers in very favourable conditions: they fix the calendar, the competition. A more normal situation would be for Uefa and Fifa to concentrate on doing what a bakers\u2019 guild really does, which is to regulate and not to compete. But this is not possible.\u201d That sounds a lot like somebody who has been waiting for years to cut Uefa down to size. But Soriano does have a point. There is an inherent contradiction when the game\u2019s regulator is also a financial competitor. And it is precisely that fact that is so dangerous for Uefa. Uefa is not the only regulator/competitor. There is also Fifa, which through its promotion of the Club World Cup has already begun to try to challenge Uefa\u2019s control over the club game. Infantino, the Spiegel leaks revealed, helped negotiate a settlement when City and Paris Saint-Germain were first found to have breached FFP regulations. Perhaps the Fifa president was acting for the good of the game. Perhaps he was simply smoothing a path so football could continue without endless legal wrangling. Or perhaps he saw the value in accruing political capital with two boundlessly wealthy clubs who were already chafing at Uefa\u2019s restrictions. This is not a straightforward problem. The divide between Uefa and the interests of the superclubs is not absolute. Uefa for decades has met the threat of a breakaway super league with reluctant compromises, yielding incrementally to the greed of the superclubs. Now it finally stands up to a superclub, it is in defence of a principle supported by other superclubs, and a principle in part designed to ensure their profits. But the ramifications could still be seismic. What if City spend their two years out of Uefa competition playing lucrative friendlies around the world? What if they show that you don\u2019t actually need Uefa and its (already barely significant) concerns for smaller clubs to thrive? What if Fifa were willing to provide the umbrella of a new competition? That has always been the existential threat hanging over Uefa. Everywhere the old conventions are falling away, institutions that seemed inviolable proving impotent before those willing to ignore them. This could be football\u2019s moment.",

As he has risen in the polls \u2013 as Biden has faltered as the standard-bearer of the party\u2019s moderate wing \u2013 he has attracted increasing attacks. This week, Bloomberg has been confronted with past comments about the stop-and-frisk policing policy which many deemed racist, questions over his analysis of the 2008 financial crisis and, on Saturday, a bombshell Washington Post report on his past comments about women and minorities while at the helm of his eponymous company.

I know I\u2019m not going to be able to beat him on the airways but I can beat him on the debate stage.\u201d Bloomberg has not appeared in any debates, his self-funding precluding him under rules set by the Democratic National Committee. Those rules have been changed, but if Bloomberg does appear he will face concentrated fire. On NBC, Biden said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to talk about with Michael Bloomberg. You all are going to start focusing on him like you have on me \u2026 the last six months. You\u2019re going to focus on him. His position on issues relating to the African American community, from stop-and-frisk to the way he talked about Obama. \u201cOn several issues, like guns, he was a real ally. He was a real ally. But if you notice, he wouldn\u2019t even endorse Barack in 2008. He wouldn\u2019t endorse him. You know, he endorsed Bush. He endorsed, you know, the Republican before that. All of a sudden he\u2019s his best buddy. You know \u2026 he would not endorse him.\u201d Bloomberg ran for mayor of New York as a Republican before becoming an independent. In his run for the Democratic nomination, he is attracting support from the centre of the party including, as the Guardian revealed on Saturday, prominent supporters of Obama. In commercial breaks on the talk shows, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign aired an ad featuring Obama praising the former mayor. \u201cYou take a look at the stop-and-frisk proposals,\u201d Biden continued \u201c\u2026 You take a look at what he\u2019s done relative to the African American community. I\u2019m anxious to debate Michael on the issues relating to, you know, what we\u2019re going to face in Super Tuesday.\u201d African American voters form a key bloc in the Democratic primary which will come firmly into play in South Carolina, the next state to vote after Nevada. Bloomberg and another billionaire, Tom Steyer, have begun to make inroads as Biden\u2019s backing has declined. In his NBC interview, the former vice-president claimed \u201coverwhelming support\u201d but said: \u201cYou can\u2019t take it for granted. Last time we ran it was basically taken for granted. I\u2019m the only one who has the record and has the background and has the support. They know me. They know who I am.\u201d Biden said he would have \u201cto do really well\u201d in South Carolina and added: \u201cWe\u2019re just getting to the meat of getting to the number of delegates you need to be able to win this election. And I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to be in good shape.\u201d Regarding Nevada, Biden took aim at Sanders over attacks by some supporters against female leaders of the Culinary Union, a key source of Democratic votes in a state dominated by the service and hospitality industries, which came out against the senator\u2019s Medicare for All healthcare plan. Sanders issued a statement condemning the attacks but Biden said: \u201cHe may not be responsible for it but he has some accountability \u2026 \u201cYou know me well enough to know if any of my supporters did that, I\u2019d disown them. Flat disown them. The stuff that was said online, the way they threatened these two women who are leaders in that Culinary Union. It is outrageous. \u201c\u2026I invite anybody to go and take a look, the things they said, the vicious, malicious, misogynistic things they said. The threats they put out. And to say \u2018I disassociate\u2019 is one thing. Find out who the hell they are, if any of them work for me. Fire them. Find out. See what\u2019s going on.\u201d",

The first match in this series ended in a win for South Africa by one run. The second ended in a win for England by two runs. So today\u2019s third and final game is obviously going to be a win for somebody by three runs. But whom?</p> <p>England, says our old friend Mo Mentum. England, say the bookies, more firmly than you might expect (they mostly have England at 4/7, South Africa 11/8). England, says experience \u2013 if you can come through a Super Over in a World Cup final, you can cope with anything. </p> <p>And yet... South Africa, says home advantage. South Africa, says youthful exuberance. South Africa, says the fact that, for three or four of England\u2019s stars, it\u2019s the last day of a long tour. South Africa, says the way that England, for all Eoin Morgan\u2019s steely leadership, keep on conjuring collapses out of nowhere. Expert conclusion: it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. </p> <p>These two teams have met once before in a T20 international at Centurion. It was ten years ago and <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/13436/scorecard/387564/south-africa-vs-england-2nd-t20i-england-tour-of-south-africa-2009-10\">England lost by 84 runs</a>, which is quite an achievement in a 20-over match. Remarkably, two of the bowlers who got battered that day by Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman are still in the team \u2013 a pair of contrasting leggies, Adil Rashid and Joe Denly. Morgan was there too, and so was Dale Steyn, now the father of the house of fast bowling. He will surely be recalled today after being rested on Friday. </p> <p>The forecast is for bright sunshine, so at least the series won\u2019t be decided by Duckworth-Lewis. Play starts at 2.30pm in Pretoria, which is 12.30 in the UK. I\u2019ll be back about 25 minutes before that with the toss and the teams.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-16T10:30:48.572Z\">at 10.30am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And finally ... here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s match report. \u201cWow!\u201d says Peter Barrett. \u201cUnfortunately I can only follow the match on my phone but your commentary is brilliant \u2013 thank you.\u201d It\u2019s a pleasure. \u201cBut not quite as brilliant as the game.\u201d Harsh but fair. \u201cWe truly have a magnificent side and as for Morgan!! - words fail me.\u201d I know the feeling: there were 448 runs scored today, including 28 sixes. Time for a breather... The match report will be with you shortly. Thanks for your company, as ever, and your excellent emails. \u201cIt was a hell of a game,\u201d Morgan says. He reckons you\u2019ve got to applaud the bowlers of both sides, which is a nice lateral thought. Chasing 220 was a big ask, \u201cbut going back to the 2016 World Cup, we chased down 230 against South Africa, so there was belief\u201d. Does he remember every game, or just have a good analyst? And that wasn\u2019t the only good news for England today. The Lions rattled up 600 in Australia, as if they\u2019d all decided to be Cook and Strauss from 2011. Also in Australia, England Women beat New Zealand in a warm-up for their T20 World Cup. Eoin Morgan is the player of the match. And of the series, which is less predictable but probably right \u2013 his leadership, give or take an over-harsh line on Malan, has been formidable. So England have come back from 1-0 down for the second time on this tour. They were 1-0 down in the ODI series too, but only managed a draw, with the Durban weather getting in the way. Nobody was ever-present in all formats but Stokes and Buttler did very well to rouse themselves today for one last fling. And credit to South Africa too \u2013 a new captain, a young side, a lot of spirit. They\u2019ve batted well in every game in this T20 series and competed well with the ball, but they paid the price today for a couple of dropped catches. If AB de Villiers really can be tempted back, they will take some beating in the T20 World Cup in November. Cricket, bloody hell. Morgan faced only 22 balls today, less than a fifth of a full T20 innings. Off 15 of those balls, he scored 15, in ones and twos, nothing special; off the other seven, he walloped 42. And those seven sixes settled the matter. An email from 20 minutes ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a shoo-in from here,\u201d wrote Colum Fordham. \u201cSome relaxed, cool-as-you-like six hitting from Morgan and Stokes rounded off by a superb cameo by Moeen and we\u2019re safely home. Seriously, Morgan\u2019s looking good and Stokes is...well...Stokes. And Mo has found his Mo-jo. Sorry.\u201d I can\u2019t even tell if you were joking. \u201cThis T20 thing,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cmight catch on.\u201d Moeen slaps the ball over mid-off, and England win the match and the series with five balls to spare. Phenomenal cricket from nearly all the senior players \u2013 Buttler, Bairstow, Stokes and above all Morgan. 19th over: England 222-5 (Morgan 57, Moeen 1) Moeen is dropped, first ball. It was a bouncer, he hooked it and Pretorius, running in, got there but couldn\u2019t hang on. \u201cThat\u2019s the match,\u201d says my son, joining me on the sofa. He may be right. Morgan rubs it in by whacking another six, and another. He raises his bat for 55 off 21 balls, and he hasn\u2019t bothered hitting a four yet. Then he skies it, and again poor old Pretorius can\u2019t cling on. So the scores are tied. We just need a maiden for a Super Over. Here comes the twist! Going for another legside six, Stokes can only pick out the sub fielder, who keeps his cool with the sun in his eyes. 18th over: England 206-4 (Morgan 40, Stokes 22) Phehlukwayo gets away with a near-wide, then restricts Morgan to a single, so England need something big. Cometh the hour, cometh the Sports Personality of the Year \u2013 Stokes just thumps two sixes in a row, the second of them going 100 metres. That\u2019s 16 off the over, and 17 left to get. But there hasn\u2019t been a successful chase yet in this series... 17th over: England 190-4 (Morgan 39, Stokes 9) Here\u2019s Ngidi, a fine death bowler, but Morgan just hits another six, and yet another. He\u2019s faced 15 balls and hit five of them into the crowd. Stokes, largely a spectator, chips in with a French-cricket chip over third man. That\u2019s beautiful. England need 33 off the last three overs. 16th over: England 170-4 (Morgan 24, Stokes 4) Dale Steyn is back and he befuddles Stokes with a slower ball, as Stokes is gracious enough to acknowledge with a rueful smile. Morgan picks the next slower ball and chips it for six over long-off. Meanwhile Bavuma has done his hamstring chasing a ball in the field. England are four runs behind where SA were after 16 overs. Is this going to be another classic? 15th over: England 161-4 (Morgan 17, Stokes 2) Morgan realises that someone has to grab the wheel and, as he\u2019s the boss, that someone is him. He slog-sweeps Pretorius for six, then walks across, exposes his leg stump and flicks six more. England need 62 from 30, which is feasible if Morgan stays there, or if Moeen goes languidly ballistic again. 14th over: England 147-4 (Morgan 4, Stokes 1) Never mind that catch, de Kock gets extra credit for sticking with Shamsi, whose first two overs had verged on the disastrous. Only four off that one. Another one! Malan\u2019s confident start turned to dust as he missed a couple of cut shots, and now he\u2019s bottom-edged one to the keeper, who does well to get down to it. SA are firm favourites \u2013 or would be if the man coming in wasn\u2019t called Ben Stokes. 13th over: England 143-3 (Malan 11, Morgan 2) So the fates have arranged that Malan should be joined by Morgan, who put him on the naughty step for one moment of selfishness in a match-winning hundred. This should be fun. Morgan gets away with a skier as the man at deep square can\u2019t quite run in to pouch it, but that\u2019s still a very good over for South Africa. England need 80 from 42 balls, with no wiggle room at all. Bairstow misses a straight one! As so often, but this wasn\u2019t his Achilles heel (through the gate on off). He went for a big pull and just timed it wrong. That was a lovely innings, occupying only 34 balls, but it wasn\u2019t the hundred that was calling to him. 12th over: England 138-2 (Bairstow 64, Malan 9) A stroke of genius from Bairstow, who shapes to fiddle Pretorius to leg, sees that the ball is too wide of off, and glides it past backward point for four. Stick that in your coaching book. And then Malan is dropped as Bavuma, at extra cover, spills one that was really not that tricky. Eleven from the over, up with the rate, which is now 10.62. 11th over: England 128-2 (Bairstow 58, Malan 5) With Roy and Buttler gone, Jonny B has the chance to run this chase. And he fancies it \u2013 he wallops Shamsi for four, four, six. The second four took him to fifty off 27 balls. Shamsi has 2-0-36-0, and may be considering becoming a specialist third man. 10th over: England 111-2 (Bairstow 42, Malan 4) In comes Dawid Malan, who is the fifth best batsman in T20 internationals according to the ICC rankings, but only the sixth best in England according to Eoin Morgan. He strokes a cover drive for four, but that\u2019s still an excellent over for South Africa, yielding a vital wicket and only seven runs. Buttler goes for the ramp, skies it over his right shoulder, and Shamsi takes another catch at third man, which is now an attacking position. That\u2019s a big, big scalp. 9th over: England 104-1 (Buttler 56, Bairstow 40) SA get another dose of their own medicine as Bjorn Fortuin comes on to be greeted by a six and a four from Bairstow. After that, England can afford a breather \u2013 a couple of singles, a two to Buttler, and even a dot. \u201cWonder woman,\u201d says Arabella Lyons. \u201cTim, why aren\u2019t we hearing about the female superheroes\u2019 invasion of the pitch?\u201d Because I\u2019ve got my hands full describing the cricket. But yes, there was a Wonder Woman in the middle, and Quinton de Kock seemed quite amused. 8th over: England 90-1 (Buttler 53, Bairstow 29) Another edge, from Buttler this time, another four, and he\u2019s back in business with 53 off 24 balls \u2013 nine fours, two sixes, nerves of steel. England are motoring along at 11.25 an over, which is a fraction more than they need. 7th over: England 81-1 (Buttler 48, Bairstow 25) Time for some spin as Tabraiz Shamsi comes on with his left-arm wristies. Buttler and Bairstow treat him the way the South African batsmen treated almost every England bowler. Buttler pulls for four, then shimmies for six; Bairstow adds six more with a slog-drive, and England are now ahead of SA at the same stage (81 to 77). The stand is worth 66 off 35 balls, so maybe these two do bat well after all. 6th over: England 62-1 (Buttler 33, Bairstow 17) Bairstow shovels Ngidi through midwicket for four, clunky but effective, and Buttler spots a slower ball early enough to thump it back down the ground. So England finish the PowerPlay only just behind SA, who were 62-1 at the same stage. \u201cHere I am again, Ian Wilson from Turkey,\u201d says an email. \u201dStayed quiet while SA were taking our bowling apart, but I am right apart from maybe the older Curran and Stokes. England need to look at a more mature fast bowling attack for the T20 World Cup, they are only bowling 4 overs in each game and that puts no pressure on the likes of Anderson and Broad.\u201d You may be right, but the chances of it happening seem slim. 5th over: England 53-1 (Buttler 33, Bairstow 12) It\u2019s still Steyn, and that\u2019s fine by Buttler, who\u2019s warmed up now. He straight-drives for six, then uses his wrists to whip for four. Bairstow edges but gets four for it, and the over goes for 16, so England are hanging in there. 4th over: England 37-1 (Buttler 22, Bairstow 7) Buttler spots Ngidi\u2019s slower ball and cracks it past midwicket for his fifth four in only 11 balls, but then he misses a couple outside off. Only six off the over. Time for Bairstow to go ballistic. 3rd over: England 31-1 (Buttler 17, Bairstow 6) Steyn continues as de Kock opts not to go mad wiht the bowling changes. Buttler flirts with danger, scooping a drive just over Nigidi\u2019s fingertips at short third man. Styen then keeps him quiet with a fine slower ball, an offbreak clocking in at 68mph, but Buttler square-drives the last ball for four. The commentators are saying there\u2019s \u201ca lot of talk\u201d that AB de Villiers may return for South Africa in the T20 World Cup. If he\u2019d been playing today, the score might have touched 300. 2nd over: England 22-1 (Buttler 9, Bairstow 5) So Roy, the man most likely to make this chase possible, has gone. Buttler and Bairstow, rivals with both bat and gloves, don\u2019t tend to bat well together, but Bairstow starts like he means business with a glide for four. So far, England are almost up with the required rate. First blood to South Africa! After hitting a superb six, Roy tries to do it again next ball, slices it, touches the sky and sees Shamsi take a fabulous tumbling catch at third man. 1st over: England 9-0 (Roy 1, Buttler 8) Buttler likes to play himself in, but there\u2019s no time for that. He jumps outside off, plays a lofted lap and gets four to fine leg, then pulls through mid-on for four more, without even timing it. Decent start. Which bowler would you choose to face, as you set off up the mountain called 11.15 an over? Possibly not Dale Steyn. Spare a thought for Bjorn Fortuin. On Friday, he batted in a T20 international for the first time, needing three to win off the last ball, and was caught at short fine leg. Today he came in with a full four balls to go, and faced none of them. David Miller even turned down a single off the second-last ball, to deny Fortuin a shot at redemption. 20th over: South Africa 222-6 (Miller 35, Fortuin 0) Miller hammers two fours off Wood\u2019s last few balls, and such has been the mayhem that England might even settle for that. It\u2019s been a scintillating display from South Africa, who came up with a simple policy: just blitz every bowler as soon as he comes on. Klaasen was the star with 66 off 33 balls, but Bavuma, de Kock and Miller were all excellent too. Only Curran, with 4-0-33-2, and Stokes, with 4-0-35-2, were able to keep the run rate in single figures. So England are left needing more than 11 an over to win the series. They have the firepower, but they will need a few other things \u2013 nerve, luck, and, I suspect, a sudden return to form from Jos Buttler. See you shortly. Wood has yet to manage a dot, but he picks up a consolation wicket as Phehlukwayo slogs to wide long-off and Stokes takes a formidable catch. 19th over: South Africa 210-5 (Miller 27, Phehlukwayo 1) Tom Curran has been playing the role of the teetotaller at a party, the only person trying to be sensible. But his last ball is a full toss which ends up in the crowd as Miller swings the bat and Curran finally concedes a six. It\u2019s going to be Mark Wood to bowl the last over. \u201cSadly there is only one Kraken,\u201d says NE Bluesman on Twitter, \u201cand that\u2019s Gary Sanchez - catcher for the @Yankees.\u201d Curran tries a cross-seam bouncer and it works as Pretorius flails and Buttler takes the catch. England celebrate like a football team scoring a late goal when they\u2019re six down \u2013 ie, not at all. 18th over: South Africa 195-4 (Miller 20, Pretorius 6) Dwaine Pretorius joins in the fun, clubbing Jordan\u2019s yorker straight enough to get four. Jordan manages another dot, to Miller, before bowling a wide so wide that it\u2019s called a no-ball (how does that work?). Morgan protests, the umps confer, and it\u2019s given as a wide after all. It was the wide of Steve Harmison\u2019s nightmares: Jos Buttler did very well to stop it, somewhere near gully. Miller, warming to the task, glances for four, then heaves for six. Sweet Caroline rings out, as well it may. Jordan finishes with the unfamiliar figures of 4-0-49-0. Who on earth is going to bowl the last over? 17th over: South Africa 179-4 (Miller 10, Pretorius 1) That\u2019s an exceptional over from Curran, the last-gasp hero of the other night. He can bowl the last over from his end, but Jordan only has one left, so either Wood or Moeen is going to have to reappear. Moeen (one over for 11) looks a marginally better option than Wood (two for 39), but will Morgan be willing to risk a spinner? The big one! Stokes and Curran, the combination that did for van der Dussen, swap places to see off Klaasen, who chips a slower ball to mid-off. That may just have kept England in the game, though Miller will fancy switching from second fiddle to first violin. 16th over: South Africa 174-3 (Klaasen 64, Miller 8) Back comes Jordan, even though it\u2019s not quite the death yet. His wide yorker is more meat and drink to Klaasen, who squeezes a sort of late drive past a startled third man. Amazingly, Jordan manages to finish with a dot, but that\u2019s still 10 off the over, with SA well on top. And here\u2019s John Starbuck, picking up on the 13th over. \u201c\u2018The Parson\u2019 calls up memories of Rev. David Sheppard, but he might not have been much of a short-form player.\u201d Ha. \u201cIf Klaasen turns out to be a monster hitter, how about \u2018The Kraken\u2019?\u201d 15th over: South Africa 164-3 (Klaasen 59, Miller 4) Stokes and Rashid are both done now, so Morgan turns back to Mark Wood. His first delivery is a slower ball, carved for four by Klaasen. His second may be a slower ball too, but it goes fast over midwicket for six. That\u2019s fifty for Heinrich Klaasen, off only 25 balls: a superb one-man counter-attack. Wood, understandably rattled, dishes up three wides, a yorker that is lofted for four over mid-off and a near-wide that\u2019s edged for four more. That\u2019s a nine-ball over and it\u2019s gone for 23. The partnership is 51, and Miller has four of them. South Africa\u2019s decision to call up Klaasen may well be deciding the series. 14th over: South Africa 141-3 (Klaasen 40, Miller 3) Morgan sticks with Stokes and perhaps regrets it as Klaasen kloonks yet another six. Again there\u2019s a smart catch in the crowd, this time by a young man in a white T-shirt, who is so pleased with himself that he gets a ticking-off from Rob Key. Harsh. 13th over: South Africa 129-3 (Klaasen 30, Miller 2) You\u2019d think South Africa\u2019s best hope of resuming the carnage would be Miller the Killer, but Klaasen (the Parson?) has other ideas. He swings Rashid away for yet another six, which is beautifully caught by the man in the sludge-green T-shirt. 12th over: South Africa 116-3 (Klaasen 18, Miller 1) Great stuff from Stokes, whose third over goes for only four. By hitting the pitch hard, and being Ben Stokes, he has figures of 3-0-23-2, while the other three seamers have 5-0-52-0. Stokes tucks up van der Dussen, whose attempted pull for six just presents Tom Curran with a comfortable catch at deep midwicket. South Africa, after that fizzing start, are doing an England here. 11th over: South Africa 112-2 (van der Dussen 11, Klaasen 15) Now Klaasen comes to the party, standing and delivering a straight six off Rashid. Has Mo Mentum changed sides again? 10th over: South Africa 100-2 (van der Dussen 9, Klaasen 7) The other night, when SA seemed to be about to seal the series, I said that England\u2019s best hope was to give van der Dussen the strike. Then he blossomed, and England squeezed over the line largely because they kept him off strike for the last ten balls of the innings. So Rassie, I take it all back. And he\u2019s started well here, working it around confidently and glancing Stokes for four. 9th over: South Africa 90-2 (van der Dussen 3, Klaasen 2) And suddenly it\u2019s a different game, as the two noobs settle for four singles off the rest of the over. Well bowled Rash. And now Rashid strikes too! It was his quicker ball, going straight on, and it surprised Bavuma. He had played beautifully for 49 off only 24 balls, but he\u2019s now left his team with two new batsmen at the crease. 8th over: South Africa 86-1 (Bavuma 49, van der Dussen 1) Stokes too went for six, but he made the vital breakthrough. Stokes! On he comes with England gasping for a wicket, and there it is as de Kock chips a slower ball to deep square. Good innings though \u2013 35 off 24 balls, four of which disappeared into the crowd. 7th over: South Africa 77-0 (Bavuma 41, de Kock 35) On comes Adil Rashid, the only England bowler today to have bowled here in a T20 international. He carries on where he left off ten years ago: his first ball goes for six, his second for four. Like Jordan, Rashid finds a way to salvage some self-respect, but Bavuma and de Kock have a policy of attacking every bowler as soon as he comes on, and it is working horribly well. \u201cI know this is a bit off topic,\u201d says Romeo, \u201cbut it\u2019s cricket and it\u2019s important. Could you plug the historic and hugely significant MCC tour to Pakistan? Kumar Sangakkara\u2019s side just lost to Pakistan Shaheens, effectively their \u2018A\u2019 team, in Lahore, after winning the first match at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday. There are two more matches, tomorrow and Wednesday. \u201cAll the matches are on Youtube, and here\u2019s the press conference before the first match with Wasim Khan (who is of course British), the chief executive of the PCB, together with Sangakkara, who these days doesn\u2019t just play for MCC but is also their actual president.\u201d 6th over: South Africa 64-0 (Bavuma 29, de Kock 34) After twisting with Wood and Curran, Morgan sticks with Jordan, who repays his faith with an over that goes 11..11. That\u2019s the T20 equivalent of a double-wicket maiden. So the PowerPlay ends with SA well on top, but not having it all their own way. \u201cDo you think England should just offer 60-0 to the opposition as a PowerPlay score, and then just start the innings in the seventh?\u201d asks Kevin Wilson. \u201cEngland\u2019s PowerPlay bowling is laughably dreadful. I can\u2019t see them winning the World Cup playing catch-up like this constantly.\u201d 5th over: South Africa 60-0 (Bavuma 27, de Kock 32) Morgan doesn\u2019t want to risk Wood again, so it\u2019s back to Tom Curran and his liquorice allsorts. Bavuma squeezes the first ball to wide third man, where Malan makes a fine stop to save two, but then de Kock slashes another imperious four. Curran resorts to yorkers outside off, which keep de Kock quiet but have little or no chance of taking a wicket. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at 250 here,\u201d says David Lloyd. 4th over: South Africa 52-0 (Bavuma 24, de Kock 27) Another bowling change, another pair of sixes as de Kock first flicks Chris Jordan, then pulls him. In fact it\u2019s six-six-six as another flick lands in the crowd. That\u2019s fifty up off only 22 balls. We are back in the land of the sublime and the ridiculous. Jordan keeps his cool to finish with two dots, but his first over has still gone for 19. \u201cAfternoon Tim.\u201d Ah, Mr Withington, we\u2019ve been expecting you. \u201cIn the fertile field of narrative determinism, whilst our old friend Mo Mentum often gets deserved mention [10:27], what about some of the other muckers in arms like the latent De Stiny and the inscrutable Fick le Fate?\u201d Love it. 3rd over: South Africa 33-0 (Bavuma 23, de Kock 9) Moeen is swiftly replaced by Mark Wood, whose first ball goes for six. It\u2019s a regulation loosener, length outside off, and de Kock just swishes it over long-off as if he was playing on the beach. Anything you can do, says Bavuma, I can do equally well, a so a shorter ball is flicked over deep square for six more. With every ball going for at least a single, that\u2019s 16 from the over. 2nd over: South Africa 17-0 (Bavuma 15, de Kock 1) For de Kock, Curran has a slip, which is bold from Morgan. And wise, as de Kock immediately plays and misses outside off. Bavuma, refusing to let England get a good over in, lashes the last ball past short extra for four. And here\u2019s Tom Curran, who is on a sort of hat-trick after that exemplary ending the other night. He almost gets another batsman caught at fine leg as Bavuma plays a ramp shot that goes close to Adil Rashid at short fine leg. 1st over: South Africa 11-0 (Bavuma 10, de Kock 1) Moeen starts with a long hop outside off, which Temba Bavuma cuts for four. After three better balls, Mo gets lofted for a straight four by Bavuma, who has come out dancing. It\u2019s going to be Moeen Ali to open the bowling again for England, even though he had a poor day with the ball on Friday. SA bring back the great Dale Steyn, as expected, and also drop Jon-Jon Smuts in favour of Heinrish Klaasen. England\u2019s only change is Malan for Denly, which surely makes them stronger. South Africa 1 Bavuma, 2 de Kock (capt, wkt), 3 van der Dussen, 4 Klaasen, 5 Miller, 6 Pretorius, 7 Fortuin, 8 Phehlukwayo, 9 Steyn, 10 Shamsi, 11 Ngidi. England 1 Roy, 2 Buttler (wkt), 3 Bairstow, 4 Malan, 5 Morgan (capt), 6 Stokes, 7 Moeen, 8 T Curran, 9 Rashid, 10 Jordan, 11 Wood. Joe Denly is ill, so Dawid Malan is finally let out of the doghouse. Eoin Morgan says he would have bowled anyway. Eoin Morgan calls wrong, so it\u2019s Quinton de Kock\u2019s decision and on balance he\u2019d rather not chase again. Well, the team batting first has won every game in this series. Morning everyone and welcome to the final act of a fabulous drama. The first match in this series ended in a win for South Africa by one run. The second ended in a win for England by two runs. So today\u2019s third and final game is obviously going to be a win for somebody by three runs. But whom? England, says our old friend Mo Mentum. England, say the bookies, more firmly than you might expect (they mostly have England at 4/7, South Africa 11/8). England, says experience \u2013 if you can come through a Super Over in a World Cup final, you can cope with anything. And yet... South Africa, says home advantage. South Africa, says youthful exuberance. South Africa, says the fact that, for three or four of England\u2019s stars, it\u2019s the last day of a long tour. South Africa, says the way that England, for all Eoin Morgan\u2019s steely leadership, keep on conjuring collapses out of nowhere. Expert conclusion: it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. These two teams have met once before in a T20 international at Centurion. It was ten years ago and England lost by 84 runs, which is quite an achievement in a 20-over match. Remarkably, two of the bowlers who got battered that day by Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman are still in the team \u2013 a pair of contrasting leggies, Adil Rashid and Joe Denly. Morgan was there too, and so was Dale Steyn, now the father of the house of fast bowling. He will surely be recalled today after being rested on Friday. The forecast is for bright sunshine, so at least the series won\u2019t be decided by Duckworth-Lewis. Play starts at 2.30pm in Pretoria, which is 12.30 in the UK. I\u2019ll be back about 25 minutes before that with the toss and the teams.",

So worried were City of the narrative shifting from the game that all post-match questions had to be directed through the press officers.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to give some players games and I was really happy for them and proud, particularly for the young ones,\u201d said the caretaker manager, Alan Mahon. \u201cWe probably could have had more, but that\u2019s just me being a little bit critical, I always want more goals.\u201d</p> <p>It took 25 minutes for Ipswich\u2019s dream to die. With the Tractor Girls\u2019 having set up with five at the back they had held out a swaggering City, just. But their first foray forward into their opponents\u2019 box and their shape was ripped apart. A corner kick from Paige Peake was scrambled clear and Kiera Walsh collected inside the City half, turned, waited for Laura Coombs to get onside and slid her through.

It was a sucker punch.\u201d</p> <p>Ipswich play in the fourth tier, National League Division One East, but this was far from being equivalent to Pep Guardiola taking his side to face a League Two team. In women\u2019s football the gap between leagues is much bigger. Instead this would be more akin to Kevin De Bruyne and co ripping apart the under-18 team of a League Two club. Six of Sheehan\u2019s squad study at the independent St Joseph\u2019s College sixth form as part of a dual careers programme.</p> <p>A tidy delivery from Lauren Hemp to Bremer led to City\u2019s second, with the German cutting inside and firing underneath Runnacles. Shortly after, in a rare start, Park got in on the action, switching on to her right foot on the edge of the area and striking low to the keeper\u2019s right.</p> <p>After the break the physical and technical superiority of City only got more prominent as Ipswich legs tired. Collecting the ball in the area Bremer fired high past Runnacles from a tight angle.

      "bodyText": "Three hat-tricks helped Manchester City to crush a youthful Ipswich Town 10-0 and cruise into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Pauline Bremer was the first to hit three, before the 18-year-old Jess Park and Georgia Stanway, who was shifted from her recent right-back berth into a more familiar forward role before the hour, joined her in the battle for the match ball. It was some good news to temper the bad couple of days City have had, with the men\u2019s team handed a two\u2011season ban from Europe and a a \u20ac30m fine for misleading Uefa and breaking financial fair play rules. So worried were City of the narrative shifting from the game that all post-match questions had to be directed through the press officers. \u201cI wanted to give some players games and I was really happy for them and proud, particularly for the young ones,\u201d said the caretaker manager, Alan Mahon. \u201cWe probably could have had more, but that\u2019s just me being a little bit critical, I always want more goals.\u201d It took 25 minutes for Ipswich\u2019s dream to die. With the Tractor Girls\u2019 having set up with five at the back they had held out a swaggering City, just. But their first foray forward into their opponents\u2019 box and their shape was ripped apart. A corner kick from Paige Peake was scrambled clear and Kiera Walsh collected inside the City half, turned, waited for Laura Coombs to get onside and slid her through. The forward fired low past Nikita Runnacles and the shaky defensive wall was breached. \u201cFirst 15-20 minutes I was quite pleased,\u201d the manager, Joe Sheehan, said. \u201cWe knew we\u2019d sacrifice possession. It just so happens that we get a corner and it was the first time we were out of shape and they score from it. It was a sucker punch.\u201d Ipswich play in the fourth tier, National League Division One East, but this was far from being equivalent to Pep Guardiola taking his side to face a League Two team. In women\u2019s football the gap between leagues is much bigger. Instead this would be more akin to Kevin De Bruyne and co ripping apart the under-18 team of a League Two club. Six of Sheehan\u2019s squad study at the independent St Joseph\u2019s College sixth form as part of a dual careers programme. A tidy delivery from Lauren Hemp to Bremer led to City\u2019s second, with the German cutting inside and firing underneath Runnacles. Shortly after, in a rare start, Park got in on the action, switching on to her right foot on the edge of the area and striking low to the keeper\u2019s right. After the break the physical and technical superiority of City only got more prominent as Ipswich legs tired. Collecting the ball in the area Bremer fired high past Runnacles from a tight angle. With the Portuguese right-back Matilde Fidalgo handed some rare minutes, Stanway moved into a more traditional forward role and the impact was instant as Janine Beckie slipped the ball across the face of goal for the No 10 to poke home at the back post. With 25 minutes still to play Bremer had her hat-trick, latching on to a through-ball and slotting into the far corner. She then turned provider, flicking on for Beckie who laid off for Stanway to smash in. Despite the pummelling, Runnacles played a part in keeping the score lower, diving low to her right to push out a powerful strike from distance. Park, though, had other ideas, first slotting home from Stanway\u2019s through-ball and then smacking a 25-yard effort high into the far corner to nab the game\u2019s second hat-trick. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I did all right,\u201d Parks said modestly. \u201cThree goals and a few assists is decent.\u201d Then came the third, with Stanway taking a chance to have a go from distance herself. It was a gruelling test for the Ipswich youngsters and amateurs. But it is also a place they can aspire to be. With the club holding a WSL academy licence in partnership with the FA a number of the squad ply their trade against the youth teams of WSL sides week\u2011in week\u2011out.

On 7 February the government announced it would restrict the harvesting of overland flows throughout the northern Murray-Darling Basin for the first time, because it was \u201cin the public interest\u201d. But within days, the government had lifted the ban for two valleys and part of a third. Emails obtained by the Guardian show the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment asked irrigator groups for \u201curgent\u201d advice on and examples of the sort of damage that their members might incur to levees, pumps and regulators if the water was allowed to flow across their land and then down the Barwon River to the Lower Darling. But by the time the emails were sent, the NSW government had already given the large cotton growing areas a three-day exemption from the embargo. That allowed several huge cotton properties between Walgett and Wee Waa, and west of Moree, to take the first flows in years. The Guardian understands the department received numerous representations from the cotton industry after the government declared the embargo. The government rarely uses its public interest powers and so it detailed the reasons for the embargo. These included \u201cto cope with a water shortage\u201d, to address a \u201cthreat to public health and safety\u201d caused by critically low town water supplies and to \u201cmanage water for environmental purposes\u201d, noting that the river system health was declining rapidly, putting aquatic biota at risk. The cotton properties have extensive water harvesting infrastructure such as levees and pumps, which are used to divert overland flows into massive on-farm storages. There is no information at this stage about how much water was harvested. However, the proliferation of this infrastructure \u2013 only some of which is approved \u2013 has had a major impact on how much rainfall reaches the rivers in the northern Basin. Some estimates say historical flows have been reduced to 40% or lower. The decision has angered farmers and communities in the lower Darling, where extremely dry conditions have led to mass fish deaths. Less water entering the river means it may not flow downstream and will instead seep into the dry riverbeds. The email was sent at 3.46 pm on 10 February by a bureaucrat involved in flood plain management to the heads of the Gwydir Valley irrigators, the Namoi Valley irrigators and Barwon Darling Irrigators. \u201cURGENT: requesting further details re: infrastructure risks from temporary FPH restrictions,\u201d the subject line read. \u201cCould you please provide some examples of properties in your valleys where landholders have reported risks to infrastructure from not being able to take floodplain harvesting? \u201cPlease supply; property name, contact details (if you have them handy) and a quick description of reported at risk infrastructure.\u201d The email was then forwarded by the irrigator bodies to the cotton growers. This appears to have been after the exemption had been granted. A spokesman for the department told the Guardian: \u201cFollowing concerns during the rain event that the restrictions were exacerbating localised flash flooding, the department decided to take a precautionary approach due to the potential safety and infrastructure risks, and temporarily lifted the embargo in a limited area.\u201d But the independent NSW MP Justin Field said claims that the decision was taken to reduce the risk to infrastructure didn\u2019t pass the pub test. \u201cThis infrastructure is designed to divert flood water into on-farm storages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minister has to explain what infrastructure was at risk, on whose request the decision was made, why such a large area was exempted from the embargo and how much water has been diverted,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for the minister, Melinda Pavey, said she had not played a role. The department said: \u201cWe began investigations as soon as practicable, including an aerial review as soon as it could be arranged.\u201d The Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR) said its officers had flown from Tamworth to Walgett after the most recent rainfall/flood event. \u201cOf the properties observed it appeared that most had managed the volume of water, with limited infrastructure damage,\u201d a spokeswoman said, noting this was not part of NRAR\u2019s normal compliance activities. \u201cThere was limited infrastructure damage to roads, channels, levee banks, and pumps,\u201d she said. The NSW Department of Primary Industry and previous ministers have come under scrutiny for providing preferential treatment to cotton interests in the past. In the wake of a Four Corners program in 2017 which revealed a tape of senior NSW bureaucrats offering irrigators information so they could attack the Murray-Darling Basin plan, the head of the water division resigned. An independent inquiry referred a number of matters to the NSW Independent Commission against Corruption. Despite two years of investigations there have been no findings to date. The department said it was continuing to monitor river flows. The embargo is now in place for all designated floodplains until 28 February. More rain is expected this weekend.",

My fears come from experience: I\u2019ve been to prison twice for the same crime, committed in 1996. They are fears I\u2019d met in the old sandstone cells at Berrima where I asked a guard what to do if there was a fire in the cell, and he said \u201cbreak out or burn\u201d. I thought he was joking at the time, but hearing about those prisoners left in Lithgow made me wonder if this is the official stance.</p> <p>My visits to prison were 13 years apart, and in between, I rehabilitated. I did exactly what I thought the system wanted me to do. I shook off a history of abuse and violence and somehow found my way to making a new life for myself. I got clean off drugs, went to university, got my son out of foster care and living back with me. I never committed another crime and was slowly starting to believe in myself.

      "bodyText": "There is one image from the bushfire crisis that I am still not able to shake. It has led to night terrors where I wake in a sweat, feeling embers on my face and a desperate need to walk outside and look at the sky. What haunts me is the image of the prisoners locked in at Lithgow Correctional Centre when others were evacuated from the path of a fire last year. The government said the prison was \u201cdefensible\u201d but I couldn\u2019t imagine them letting the crims out to man hoses. Too much risk of escape. Granted, this was back in that pre-history of late 2019 \u2013 before we knew the ferocity that was coming and before we saw those red-soaked images from inside the fire zones. We didn\u2019t know how bad it could get. We didn\u2019t truly know the risk we were leaving those prisoners to face. I have a very creative imagination, but not this creative. My fears come from experience: I\u2019ve been to prison twice for the same crime, committed in 1996. They are fears I\u2019d met in the old sandstone cells at Berrima where I asked a guard what to do if there was a fire in the cell, and he said \u201cbreak out or burn\u201d. I thought he was joking at the time, but hearing about those prisoners left in Lithgow made me wonder if this is the official stance. My visits to prison were 13 years apart, and in between, I rehabilitated. I did exactly what I thought the system wanted me to do. I shook off a history of abuse and violence and somehow found my way to making a new life for myself. I got clean off drugs, went to university, got my son out of foster care and living back with me. I never committed another crime and was slowly starting to believe in myself. But it wasn\u2019t enough to keep me out from behind bars. In my imagination, if that fire hit Lithgow prison, the inmates would be locked in their cells, helpless, while guards and firefighters defended the prison. Each would have only their cellmate for company and a tiny view of the horrific black, red or boiling sky through a window covered with bars. They might have a TV on, if the power was still going, but no internet \u2013 no Fires Near Me app or social media feed to keep them informed. They\u2019d have been smelling the smoke for days, seen the stories on TV about them. They\u2019d know that the fires were coming. But they wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. They\u2019d have to trust their safety to the same people who lock them in \u2013 trust their lives to the people whose job it was to break them. The \u201cknock up\u201d button would still work, but with guards also fighting fires, their typically brusque responses to fear or anxiety would turn aggressive under the torrent of complaints.

      "bodyText": "A three-year-old Australian girl held in al-Hawl camp in Syria will likely lose her fingers to frostbite, unable to be properly treated during a brutal winter in the squalid camp. Amirah is one of 47 Australian children being detained in the sprawling detention camp for the family members of Islamic State fighters, as the north-east of Syria endures a bitterly cold winter. The temperature has fallen consistently below zero this winter, snow has blanketed the camp, and many of the mattresses inside the tents where families live have become soaked with water and cannot be dried. There is a shortage of warm, dry clothes. The blackened fingers on Amirah\u2019s left hand (pictured above in December) have worsened since, and doctors believe it is likely they cannot be saved. She also suffers from pain in her kneecaps, and is suffering malnutrition. Amirah\u2019s five-month-old brother Yahya, who was born in the camp, is also malnourished. An older brother died before the family reached the camp. Amirah\u2019s mother is Melbourne woman Kirstie Rosse-Emile. Her father is Nabil Kadmiry, a former Isis fighter who had his Australian citizenship stripped last October. It is understood he also holds Moroccan citizenship. He is currently being held in a Kurdish jail. Other Australian children in the camp are reported to be suffering developmental disorders, diarrhoea, seizures, rickets and asthma. Across al-Hawl, where up to 70,000 women and children are guarded by Kurdish forces, conditions have grown steadily worse over winter. Food runs short, violence, including murder, is common, children die regularly from illness, and others have been injured when tents catch fire. Many observers have raised concern it is acting as an incubator for extremism and, if left to languish, a potential site of resurgence for Isis. Currently, there are 19 Australian women and 47 Australian children held in the al-Hawl camp. The Australian government is aware of their identities and the bona fides of their Australian citizenship or right to claim that citizenship. They are family members of former foreign fighters who have been captured or killed. None of the Australian women in the camp have been charged as being combatants, and many were coerced, forced or tricked into travelling to Syria. The youngest child in the Australian group is less than two months old, born on 30 November last year. Were the children and their mothers able to get to an Australian embassy or consulate, the Australian government would be legally obliged to provide them travel documents to return home. The families held in the camp have consistently pleaded with Australia to assist with their repatriation: the women in the camp have said they would submit to monitoring, such as control orders, if they were returned. But the Australian government has consistently refused to repatriate its citizens, despite the urgings of Kurdish forces running the camp, its ally America, and other countries such as the UK, German, Denmark and France repatriating their citizens. A small group of Australian orphans has been repatriated to Australia, but no family members with adults have been brought back since the Australians were taken to the camp a year ago. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has said the government was not prepared to risk other Australian lives in any repatriation effort. He said some of the Australians in the camp were \u201chardcore\u201d and \u201chave the potential and capacity to come back here and cause a mass casualty event\u201d. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it should come as a surprise when we say we\u2019re not going to send our soldiers to rescue people of this nature.\u201d On Sunday, Nine newspapers reported that Australian federal police had raided homes in Sydney and Melbourne of family members of those held in al-Hawl camp. It is the latest in a series of raids over months, which observers say is an attempted to gather evidence against anyone they believe may be planning to return to Australia. The government has already stripped 17 dual nationals of Australian citizenship, preventing their return. Save the Children\u2019s director of international programs and policy, Mat Tinkler, told the Guardian it was \u201ceminently possible\u201d to repatriate citizens out of al-Hawl, as demonstrated by the steady flow of foreign women and children out of the camp. Kurdish forces have been taking foreign citizens to and across the Iraqi border, without the involvement of third country troops or diplomatic staff. \u201cIt is eminently possible to repatriate these families, there is no practical barrier to it, all that is needed at the moment is the political will to do so,\u201d Tinkler said. He said the Australian families in al-Hawl were \u201cjust hanging on\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really drastic there are the moment, it\u2019s down to -3C in that part of Syria. We have seen a little girl who will likely lose her fingers because of frostbite, we see shrapnel wounds, we see mental health issues. It\u2019s our very real concern an Australian child will die in that camp.\u201d Tinkler said every day spent in the camp was doing children harm. \u201cThis is one of the worst places in the world to be a child. And Australia has an obligation to these women and children \u2013 these are Australian citizens at the end of the day. It\u2019s no use Australia trying to disown them \u2013 there is no capacity for Turkish or Kurdish authorities to deal with these people. Australia needs to put trust in its own criminal justice system, in its social services, to be able to bring these people home and reintegrate them into Australian society.\u201d A recent report by an independent commission to the powerful United Nations Human Rights Council \u2013 of which Australia is a member \u2013 said nations around the world should repatriate their children from camps in Syria and should stop stripping citizenship from nationals caught up in the war. The unflinching report details the indignities and punishments inflicted upon children during the Syrian conflict, including murder, torture, rape, arbitrary imprisonment, denial of food and water and of medicine, and forced conscription to fight. It said counties of origin should \u201ctake immediate steps for the simplified registration of their nationals born in Syria with the ultimate aim to repatriate them and their caregivers as soon as possible\u201d. \u201cCountries of origin should also refrain from stripping parents of their nationality in light of the impact on children.\u201d The report said \u201cmothers should be repatriated along with their children to ensure adherence with the best interests of the child principle.\u201d Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter and three grandchildren are in the camp, said it was entirely predictable that children would suffer illness and injury in al-Hawl camp. \u201cThe conditions are getting worse, and what we\u2019ve said would happen is happening. There will be more injuries, more illness, and an Australian child may die.\u201d",

The government said the grant, given to Murchison Community Care which operates the DP Jones aged care home, was for operating losses incurred while attempts were made to find an alternative provider.

But despite the financial injection, residents from the 40-bed home have been relocated and employees made redundant, with the home shutting its doors last week. The failure of the grant to stave off closure has devastated the Murchison community, but has also raised questions about the process that led to the grant being allocated, particularly given aged care homes in Labor seats have closed after missing out on government assistance. Labor\u2019s shadow aged care minister Julie Collins said it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that residents had been forced out of the Murchison nursing home despite the \u201cunprecedented funding\u201d. \u201cThe Morrison government must come clean on why it has provided this unprecedented funding while other nursing homes across the country at risk of closure have not,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWith so many nursing homes across rural and regional Australia at risk of closure the government must answer questions about this process. \u201cThe care of vulnerable older Australians in rural and regional Australia must be above politics.\u201d Collins pointed to two recent closures on the New South Wales central coast to highlight the financial difficulties facing homes in regional areas. According to data from the industry\u2019s benchmark survey, StewartBrown, 67% of aged care facilities in rural and regional Australia are operating at a loss. In October, the head of the agency overseeing the financial health of aged care in Australia told parliament he was concerned the sector was not financially viable or sustainable, with a \u201csizeable proportion\u201d of residential care providers making a loss. The Department of Health told the Senate the decision to provide financial assistance to the Murchison centre was made by the government, not the department. \u201cThis was a decision of government. The department has not provided funding of this specific nature before,\u201d the department said in response to a question on notice. It said the department was first alerted to financial viability concerns of the centre in August 2019, and the minister\u2019s office was advised in September 2019, after which the minister had sought \u201cregular advice\u201d about a range of matters relating to the facility since that time. A spokesman for the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said the \u201cprocess is ongoing\u201d to help the Murchison home, but his office would not comment on the nature of the one-off grant, nor why other at have missed out. \u201cThe Australian government is funding the administrator of Murchison Community Care Inc, of which DP Jones aged care facility is an asset, for operating losses incurred while attempts are made to find an alternative provider for the facility. This process is ongoing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment further about this funding while discussions occur with potential future operators.\u201d He said that in the future, aged care providers experiencing financial stress would be able to apply for assistance through the $50m Business Improvement Fund, which will be limited to those in \u201csevere financial difficulty\u201d. Drum did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for an interview on the centre\u2019s future, but told the Shepparton News the government was \u201cstill trying everything we can\u201d to reopen the centre.",

      "bodyText": "Read Paul Wilson\u2019s report from Villa Park: How about that, then? Jolly good fun. Son Heung-min\u2019s goal after 93 minutes and 34 seconds is Spurs\u2019 latest winning goal in the Premier League since August 2009, when Aaron Lennon netted after 94 minutes and 24 seconds against Birmingham. Fancy some more entertainment? Look no further: Some Spurs reaction. \u201cWe have a big week, Wednesday we have Champions League [against RB Leipzig] and I think it was important to get three points today,\u201d says Toby Alderweireld. \u201cIt was not my best performance. It was a beautiful week for me, with the birth of my son, I had to travel like eight hours and my legs were not sharp. But the lads helped me a lot today.\u201d Son, the match-winner, adds: \u201cWe were 1-0 down, and then 2-1 up, to 2-2, and I think we showed our character. I felt really bad because I missed a couple of chances to score the goal but then finally I did with a few seconds to play and it makes me very happy.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho cannot conceal his delight, smiling as he embraces John Terry at the final whistle. Bjorn Engels, who conceded a penalty, scored an equalised and then cocked up with seconds left to play, is consoled by Kortney Hause. Spurs climb into fifth place, while Villa remain precariously above the relegation zone. 90+5 min: Vertonghen replaces Bergwijn for the final seconds. Engels fails to trap a simple ball, Son runs through on goal and effortlessly bends the ball beyond Pepe Reina. Mourinho instantly calls for Jan Vertonghen. Mission shut up shop. 90+4 min: We\u2019re into the final minute at Villa Park ... 90+3 min: Marvelous Nakamba is booked for a not-so-marvellous challenge on Bergwijn. Villa clear the free-kick and then Lo Celso wallops it into Row L. 90+2 min: Reina punches it clear but the pressure is not over. Spurs continue to probe and Lo Celso gets a snapshot away after being fed by Aurier. It lacks conviction and Pepe Reina coolly gathers. Anyway, back come Spurs ... 90+1 min: Engels does well but concedes a corner ... 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 88 min: Spurs push for a winner but Son is flagged offside. That\u2019ll take the sting out of their latest attack. 85 min: Reina denies Son! Spurs work the ball into the box from a corner and Baston\u2019s first touch is to nudge the ball straight into the path of Son, who fires at goal, only for his strike to cannon into the Aston Villa goalkeeper. Spurs could have scored a dozen goals. As brilliantly as they began, Villa will be grateful for point. 84 min: Spurs pass up another golden chance! Tottenham fizz in a corner, the ball hangs for Moura to power at goal but it\u2019s a powder-puff effort. Lucas Moura should do a lot, lot better. His scruffy header bobbles wide. 83 min: Gedson Fernandes replaces Dele Alli, who should have left the pitch with the match ball. Borja Baston is on for his Villa debut, replacing Samatta. 81 min: Villa squander a half-chance! Aurier does superbly to get round on the cover and snuff the ball away from Trezeguet, who was picked out by a marvellous ball by, you\u2019ve guessed it, Jack Grealish. It was a delicious, curling cross but Trezeguet took too long to react and an alert Aurier hoovers it up. 80 min: ... Lloris punches clear Targett\u2019s corner. 79 min: Trezeguet selfishly goes for goal 25 yards out, despite the unmarked Douglas Luiz screaming for the ball to his right. Samatta was again influential in that move. Villa settle for a corner ... 77 min: There\u2019s plenty of life in this one but do pop over and get the team news from the Emirates when you get chance to catch your breath. Eddie Nketiah will lead the line for Mikel Arteta\u2019s side: 76 min: ... it comes in low and Son clears. 75 min: Winks is pulled up for a foul on Grealish. Villa earn a free-kick out on the right flank. Twenty-odd yards out. Targett and Grealish are stood over it ... 74 min: The chances keep coming for Tottenham, but again Alli is denied! He storms on to a through ball and bears down on goal but Reina makes himself big and Konsa eats away at the Spurs forward to make life difficult. Villa come away unscathed but they could do with stopping Tottenham at source. 70 min: Spurs go close! Nakamba flings himself in the way of Bergwijn\u2019s strike after Tottenham pour forward. Aurier ghosts in behind Matt Targett, darts into the box and supplies an inviting cross. Reina punches clear but only as far as Hause, who inadvertently helps the ball on to Bergwijn. The forward leathers it at goal \u2013 but across comes a sprawling Nakamba to get in the way. Backs-to-the-wall stuff. 69 min: \u201cThe keeper got his Engels all wrong,\u201d emails Andrew Champney. Keep \u2018em coming. Meanwhile, back to the action ... 68 min: Kortney Hause keeps another Villa corner alive before Sanchez wellies it clear. Spurs clear their lines and Trezeguet replaces Anwar El Ghazi. 64 min: Grealish\u2019s corner drops at the far post, where Villa are queuing up. Spurs\u2019 marking is selective at best. Engels gets something on it before El Ghazi nods at goal. Lloris clambers down to his right to scoop it up. Spurs have been all at sea defensively, as have Villa. That ensures plenty of fun, if nothing else. 63 min: Grealish buys a corner out of Alderweireld ... 61 min: Another chance goes begging for Spurs. Moura makes inroads down the right flank, driving inside before passing the baton over to Son. He steadies himself inside the box but his effort is tame, too central and comfortably gathered by Reina. Son slaps his thighs in frustration. Villa look dodgy in defence. 60 min: Giovani Lo Celso replaces Dier. 59 min: Bergwijn sends a rasping strike at Pepe Reina! The Dutchman has been lively for Spurs, who have not exactly struggled to carve out chances. Reina calmly collects. Meanwhile, Marvelous Nakamba replaces Drinkwater, who has been below par. 57 min: Engels off the Marx, says quick-witted colleague Tom Bryant. I\u2019m loving Engels instead etc etc. Any more for any more? 55 min: But back come Spurs \u2013 they could have scored a tonne on another day. Winks whips in a dangerous cross towards the back post, where Dele Alli is lurking. Alli nods the ball into the path of Eric Dier but Villa manage to intervene before its too late. Douglas Luiz was guilty of switching off, but Villa survive and clear. And now Engels redeems himself. Grealish\u2019s corner spins into the six-yard box and Engels rises above Alderweireld to nod in. That was oh so easy. Villa Park inevitably erupts. 51 min: El Ghazi stings the palms of Lloris! The Spurs goalkeeper is called into action after El Ghazi lets rip inside the box, latching on to a clever knockdown by Samatta, who has proved a handful for the Spurs defence. There\u2019s at least a goal in this. 49 min: Spurs break, Son tries to wriggle free and get a shot away but his indecision allows Villa to get bodies back behind the ball. Bang, and the dirt chance is gone. 48 min: \u201cWonderfully entertaining game of football so far, with composure nowhere to be seen,\u201d tweets Bobby Moore. \u201cReina, who won a few shootouts in his Liverpool days, was rightly furious that there were only white shirts chasing the penalty rebound. Looking forward to more fun in the second half.\u201d 47 min: The second half starts similarly to the first, with Grealish floored by a crude Moura challenge. Moura is booked for chopping down the Villa captain but Spurs steamroller forward on the counterattack. Bergwijn brushes off Danny Drinkwater and surges downfield to bear down on Pepe Reina. Guilbert ends up making a crucial interception. Spurs look lethal in the transition. 46 min: Douglas Luiz gets us back started. Earlier Celtic moved 13 points clear at the top: Some red-hot action to be abreast of: Son gives Spurs the lead on the brink of the interval. Toby Alderweireld made amends for an early own goal by smashing in an equaliser and Spurs had been knocking on the door ever since. Into three minutes of first-half stoppage time, Son stepped up to take a penalty after Engels was adjudged to have played the man and not the ball when he went to ground on Bergwijn. Pepe Reina saves the initial penalty low down to his right but Son pokes in the rebound from close range. Reina is livid at the lack of Villa helping hands, with Son and Alli charging into the box to feed on any rebounds. In the end Son is the beneficiary, nudging home after his spot-kick was saved. 45 min: Penalty to Tottenham! Engels is penalised. \u201cIt\u2019s not football anymore,\u201d is the chant from unhappy Villa fans. Son will take ... 44 min: Engels slides in on Bergwijn, but the Villa defender appears to make precious little contact with the ball. VAR check ... 41 min: Spurs are denied again! Dele Alli and Steven Bergwijn go close, and now it is Villa that are very much on the ropes. Alli tamely passes the ball at Hause after latching on to a low cross by Davies and then Bergwijn attempts to slam home the rebound from close range. There is a VAR check to assess whether Bjorn Engels handled Bergwijn\u2019s volley but the Villa defender is not penalised. In the end Harry Winks scoops over from outside the box. A flurry of opportunities, but Spurs fail to find the net. 38 min: Lloris makes a wild, and slightly erratic, save from El Ghazi! The Villa man tried his luck from distance and Lloris seemed caught in two minds but shoves the ball to safety. Spurs look mustard on the counter, but not much cop in defence. 36 min: Spurs should take the lead! Villa are caught ball-watching and Dele Alli picks up a wonderful hooked pass by Son out on the right flank. Alli gallops into acres of space behind the Villa back line and tries, with the outside of his right boot, to beat Pepe Reina. Alli may have been better off trying to locate a team-mate, or perhaps going for a more routine finish. Nice try nevertheless. 33 min: Spurs jet up the other end on the counterattack but Kortney Hause makes a thudding block to deny Lucas Moura taking aim. Brilliant defending, but another reminder of Tottenham\u2019s threat on the break. 32 min: Hugo Lloris makes a meal of a corner, eventually clawing the ball to safety after Eric Dier nodded the ball high into the air in the six-yard box! Davinson Sanchez had cut out a delicious ball into the box by Matt Targett and Villa know they can get at this Spurs defence, which has been unconvincing at best. 30 min: \u201cFootball is so cruel,\u201d emails Mary Waltz. \u201cVilla completely dominate the first 27 minutes and against the run of play we are all even.\u201d A half-decent summary of events at Villa Park. It has been lively, that\u2019s for sure. 29 min: \u201cYou\u2019re going down with the West Ham,\u201d sing the Spurs fans. Redemption for the Spurs defender \u2013 and what a sweet strike. Alderweireld nonchalantly swivels in the box after picking up the scraps of a corner and coolly thrashes the ball into the roof of the Villa net. The ball pinballs around in the box and Alderweireld slams home. Spurs have been dire defensively but they have looked a threat at the other end. Matt Targett did brilliantly to intercept a slick move, nicking the ball away from Aurier but Spurs strike from the subsequent corner. 24 min: Eric Dier erupts, up in arms at the state of the Spurs defending! His team is being run ragged, particularly by Jack Grealish. This time Matt Targett nudges the ball into the path of Grealish, who is played onside. Grealish unselfishly tries to pull the ball back for Samatta, but Dier intervenes. What a mess. 22 min: Samatta goes close! Villa play some neat triangles down the right flank and a crisp move culminates with El Ghazi delivering a wonderful ball into Hugo Lloris\u2019s front post. Tottenham are caught cold but Samatta is alert to it and gets across Davinson Sanchez to connect. But Sanchez eventually does just enough. 20 min: Spurs recover from that shambles by countering at speed, with Bergwijn serving up a delicious cross towards the back post. Alli bursts into the box and attempts a diving header \u2013 but it drops off target. Alderweireld, meanwhile, requires some treatment after getting caught up in that defensive chaos a moment ago. 18 min: A mammoth block by Ben Davies denies Villa a second! Magnificent work by Grealish, who effortlessly carries the ball upfield down the left. Grealish rolls the ball across the six-yard box where Villa are queuing up. Douglas Luiz is among those lurking towards the far post and Douglas Luiz smacks the ball goalwards. Davies \u2013 somehow \u2013 gets rid. Spurs are at sixes and sevens defensively. 17 min: Lucas Moura is invited to shoot on the edge of the box, with Engels backing off in the Villa defence. Moura arrows a shot a couple of yards wide. 14 min: Kortney Hause makes a timely block to deny Dele Alli! Spurs seize possession after El Ghazi\u2019s pass is loose and Lucas Moura had weaved his way through before laying the ball off to Alli inside the box. Alli did everything right, steering the ball across goal \u2013 but there was Hause to intervene. 13 min: Aurier gives away another free-kick, again giving Grealish an unceremonious bump. But somehow the Spurs defender avoids a booking. The free-kick comes to nothing but Spurs are rattled. 11 min: Trademark Grealish as the Villa skipper cuts inside on to his right foot and lashes a curling effort towards the far corner. Narrowly wide. That own goal has really revved up the hosts and deflated the visitors. Spurs are all over the place at the back. Alderweireld gets his bearings all wrong, making a mess of an El Ghazi cross from the right and inadvertently prods the ball beyond Hugo Lloris. El Ghazi easily eluded his marker, Ben Davies, raced towards the byline before whipping in a lovely curling cross from the right. The bouncing ball flummoxed Alderweireld, who was busy keeping Samatta at bay. But in the end the Spurs defender does the Villa\u2019s striker\u2019s work for him. 6 min: Douglas Luiz inadvertently stands on Moura\u2019s hand and, moments later, we have round two of Aurier v Grealish. Aurier left a little on the Villa captain. That ticking off by Martin Atkinson seems to resemble something of a final warning. 5 min: Anwar El Ghazi takes. It curls a yard or two over Lloris\u2019s goal. 3 min: Villa pour forward down the right through Samatta but Martin Atkinson is alerted to Serge Aurier crudely getting to grips with Jack Grealish on the opposite flank. After a quick whinge and moan, Villa earn a free-kick 25 yards from goal ... 1 min: Ezri Konsa makes a meaty but fair challenge on Son as the Spurs forward tries to break forward. The Tottenham man requires some early treatment but is soon back on his feet, shaking his head in the direction of the Villa defender. Dele Alli gets the ball rolling at Villa Park. Room for one more. \u201cThere\u2019s a negotiating technique where you try to consciously mirror the other person\u2019s mannerisms, but I fear Mourinho has taken things a bit too far in his quest to have Levy spend more money on transfers,\u201d emails Gustav Bj\u00f6rklund. We\u2019re about to get under way in the west Midlands ... Here we go! The teams trudge out at Villa Park ... Dean Smith talks about Mings\u2019s absence. \u201cIt\u2019s a blow because he is a very good player for us and he is adapted really well to the Premier League but he was ill yesterday so we knew he would be missing,\u201d Smith says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Bjorn Engels who has recently been called up by Belgium so we have strength in depth in that area. Time will tell if he [Mings] is missed or not. We\u2019ve had a half-decent season so far, we have had a big turnaround of personnel and I feel we\u2019re getting better now.\u201d Asked about picking assistant John Terry\u2019s brains for tips on how to get one over on Jos\u00e9, the Villa head coach adds: \u201cI\u2019ve been leaning on his knowledge for the last 18 months, but he certainly knows what makes Jos\u00e9 tick.\u201d More from Mourinho. \u201cWe recovered [Ben] Davies, who played with me just one match,\u201d he says of the boon of the winter break. \u201c[Giovani] Lo Celso is not ready to start the game but ready to help. [Steven] Bergwijn could not play in the cup replay but no problem from now so we have some more options. Other guys have had the opportunity to play but Ben is a proper left-back in his way of playing and I think we need him. In this moment we have more options than before going into a very difficult period where we play three different competitions at the same time. Next week hopefully we will have [\u00c9rik] Lamela back, and then we will have only [Moussa] Sissoko and [Harry] Kane in the injury list.\u201d Twenty minutes until kick-off, so now is as good as time as any to address the big talking point: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s hair, or lack of. \u201cThe reason behind the haircut is the barber was bad!\u201d the Tottenham Hotspur manager said. \u201cHe did a bad job and when I looked at myself in the mirror, I looked at him and said \u2018come on, bring out the [number] one and shave it.\u2019 I know it will take a little longer but it will grow and come back to normality.\u201d Pepe Reina is again between the sticks for Villa but Tom Heaton, who is out for the season with a knee injury, has been talking candidly to the BBC about the pressure that comes with pulling on an England shirt. \u201cWhen you\u2019re England\u2019s number one, you\u2019re held to a different standard to the other keepers,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a striker, if you miss three chances but score a goal then everyone says how good the goal was. When you\u2019re a keeper, you can make three world-class saves and let one in, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ll talk about. It comes with the territory, it\u2019s no surprise when that scrutiny comes when you\u2019re England\u2019s number one. Pickford knows that, he\u2019s aware of it and he\u2019ll be able to deal with it.\u201d Dean Smith has had his two pennies\u2019 worth on the winter break, and reckons it might have revitalised Villa. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough league, one in which it is difficult to build consistency because of the quality of the other teams in there, but I feel we\u2019ve just started to build that consistency,\u201d he says. \u201cAs everybody knows, we had a big turnaround [of players] in the summer and they\u2019re starting to gel. For the first time we\u2019ve had a mini break and we\u2019ve seen a positive side to it. It gave everybody a chance to have some time away from the place, and to clear their heads.\u201d Essential pre-match reading: When I heard Appie [Nouri] had brain damage, I just can\u2019t describe my feelings. At that time I didn\u2019t sleep so much. In the first weeks I was scared to play, scared to go on the pitch because Appie was a young boy and out of nowhere \u2026 It was difficult. I speak to his brother every day but it\u2019s still difficult. We\u2019re off to a good start. \u201cLooking at that pic gracing the MBM has me wondering when the hell Dominic Cummings took over Spurs,\u201d emails Speakeasy Ray. Any more for any more? Team news news: Aston Villa\u2019s frail defence will again be put under the spotlight, and they will have to cope without Tyrone Mings who is absent with tonsilitis, according to Sky. Bjorn Engels is promoted to the Villa starting lineup, while Danny Drinkwater also returns in place of Marvelous Nakamba. As for the visitors, Ben Davies returns to the Spurs starting XI, with the Wales defender making his first appearance since November after recovering from an ankle injury. Davies and Eric Dier both start as Giovani Lo Celso and Japhet Tanganga drop to the bench. Aston Villa (3-4-3): Reina; Hause, Konsa, Engels; Guilbert, Douglas Luiz, Drinkwater, Targett; El Ghazi, Samatta, Grealish Subs: Nyland, Elmohamady, Taylor, Nakamba, Hourihane, Trezeguet, Baston Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1): Lloris; Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Davies; Dier, Winks; Bergwijn, Alli, Son; Lucas Moura Subs: Gazzaniga, Vertonghen, Tangana, Skipp, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Fernandes Referee: Martin Atkinson Tottenham travel to a rainsoaked Villa Park in search of enhancing their push for Champions League qualification. Spurs start the day in sixth, behind Sheffield United. Spurs have not exactly been swashbuckling under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho but they are picking up points \u2013 only Manchester City and Liverpool have yielded more since the Portuguese returned to work in Enfield. Now then, Storm Dennis has already put paid to Witton Station, meaning home and away fans have been piling in via Aston, and a few car parks are flooded but the game is set to go ahead as planned. Fittingly, Danny Drinkwater is set to return to the Villa squad, while the visitors are primed to welcome back Ben Davies and Giovani Lo Celso. Exhilarating fare is unlikely in such conditions but it will at least be entertaining and, if nothing else, expect riveting weather updates. Kick-off: 2pm (GMT)",

In lieu of a title race \u2013 or indeed much football at all \u2013 in the Premier League, this weekend brings us the latest neck-and-neck japes from two countries who have become used to their top divisions becoming the sort of repetitive procession currently besmirching the English top flight. </p> <p><strong>Serie A\u2019s scramble for top spot</strong>, which was already a close-run thing, was blown even further open last weekend when, first, Cristiano Ronaldo and chums <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/european-football-roundup-bayer-leverkusen-borussia-dortmund-lars-bender-atalanta-getafe\">fell to a shock defeat</a> at Hellas Verona, and then Romelu Lukaku led Inter to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/09/internazionale-perform-dramatic-comeback-to-beat-milan-in-derby\">four-goal comeback win</a> in the Milan derby to leapfrog Juventus into first place on goal difference. Juve can banish that memory, at least for the few hours until Inter play, with a result against Brescia: a point will be enough for the winners of the last eight titles to reclaim top spot. At the other end of the table, Sampdoria and Fiorentina face off in a game that has the distinct look of a six-pointer.

      "bodyText": "And that, you\u2019ll be saddened to hear, is all from me. Thanks for reading \u2013 over and out! And the whistle sounds to confirm a result that was in no doubt from the second minute onwards. Bayern are back on top, a point ahead of Leipzig, and play rock-bottom Paderborn on Friday night before their title rivals \u2013 who travel to Spurs in midweek \u2013 are away to sixth-placed Schalke on Saturday afternoon. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Bayern had opened up some daylight at the top by the end of next weekend. Goal for Rangers! Scott Arfield latches on to a wonderful pass from Ianis Hagi to finish coolly. One-nil. In Cologne, former Blackburn Rovers legend Anthony Modeste has missed a chance to pull another one back against Bayern. He\u2019s clean through, one-on-one with Neuer, but the keeper stands his ground and saves well with his foot. Mildly diverting scenes in Switzerland, where St Gallen and Young Boys, the two clubs neck and neck at the top of the tables with 44 points each, are both losing 1-0. Elsewhere in the Women\u2019s FA Cup, Lucy Staniforth has enjoyed an eventful minute or so for Birmingham, scoring a late winner with a free-kick and then being sent off before the restart for reasons as yet unclear. But her team are through with a 1-0 win. And Man City declare at 10-0. Nothing more than a consolation, surely, but Cologne pull one back in tidy fashion, Mark Uth slotting home to cap a smart counterattack. Then Bayern go down the other end and Gnabry misses another sitter, side-footing wide after his teammates slice through the Cologne defence with a series of exuberant flicks. That would have been a glorious goal. And that\u2019s that. Juventus made slightly heavy weather of that but they go three points clear of Inter, who play away to Lazio this evening. Sampdoria\u2019s hammering at the hands of Fiorentina ends 5-1. A sensational goal from Gnabry, who picks up the ball on the left, shimmies through the challenge of two defenders and bends a sublime shot into the far corner from 25 yards. AND IT\u2019S 10! Georgia Stanway gets the third hat-trick of the game! Time to lay off now, eh. Nine-nil to Man City. Park completes her hat-trick. Ten minutes left\u2026 Gonzalo Higuain nods home a free-kick to make it 3-0 \u2013 or so he thinks: the flag is up. Meanwhile, Federico Chiesa makes a 5-0 to Fiorentina away at Sampdoria. And half-time is nearing at Ibrox, where Rangers are yet to find a way through Livingston. Possible double-figure goal-tally alert: Jess Park makes it eight for Man City against Ipswich. Twelve minutes to go\u2026 That woke them up. Juve promptly scamper down the other end where the ball is funnelled left to Cuadrado, who cuts inside, exchanges a tidy one-two with Matuidi and slots home at the near post. Lovely goal. How Bjarnason must be ruing that miss\u2026 Juventus are living dangerously \u2013 they\u2019re in control here against 10 men but haven\u2019t killed it off and, as Brescia make a rare venture forward, the ball breaks to Birkir Bjarnason in all sorts of space on the edge of the box, but he can only sidefoot haplessly over. Miralem Pjanic has also limped off with what looks like a groin injury. In sunny Cyprus, title hopefuls Omonia have fallen behind against AEL Limassol while top-of-the-table Anorthosis lead 2-1 again Nea Salamis. Speaking of big leads with half an hour to play, a flurry of second-half goal from Manchester City Women \u2013two each from Georgia Stanway and Pauline Bremer, who\u2019s completed a hattrick \u2013 has taken them into a stonking 7-0 lead over poor old Ipswich. Thomas Muller belts one just over the bar for a rampant Bayern, who are now filing off the pitch for half-time with their win in the bag. Dusan Vlahovic makes it 4-0 to Fiorentina: a healthy scoreline under any circumstances, let alone away from home, having had a man sent off, and with half an hour to play. And Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, a man who very much Knows Where The Goal Is, adds a late third for Ajax, who are six points clear at the top of the Eredivisie. It ends goalless between Leganes and Betis in La Liga, a result that leaves the hosts deep in the relegation mire. Higuain and Bonucci miss two huge chances to double Juventus\u2019s lead against Brescia. And plenty of fun happening over in Sampdoria, where Fiorentina lead 3-0 and it\u2019s 10-a-side, Nicola Murru and Milan Badelj have each gotten themselves sent off either side of half-time. Half-time in the Women\u2019s FA Cup and Man City lead Ipswich 3-0, Jessica Park having added to the two early strikes. Still goalless between Sunderland and Birmingham. Kevin Zohi equalises for Strasbourg against Lyon, 1-1. In Cologne, Serge Gnabry has produced a remarkable tribute to Ronny Rosenthal, being played clean through, rounding the keeper and with the open goal gaping, ballooning a left-footed shot against the bar. Marvellous. Trabzonspor have beaten Sivasspor 2-1, a win that sees them climb from third to first: a point ahead of Istanbul Bahaksehir and with a game in hand, too. Daniel Sturridge and John Obi Mikel won a title together back in 2010 \u2013 could they be set for another one a decade later? Sorloth, Suso, Macheda, Traore \u2013 and now Gervinho has joined the growing group of reformed Premier League flops helping themselves to goals today. The Ivorian has put Parma 1-0 up at Sassuolo. Whoever next? Marouane Chamakh? Helder Postiga? Karl-Heinze Riedle? Remember that third-choice keeper for Brescia? Well he\u2019s just made a superlative save, diving full length to claw a long-range striker from Dybala wide of the post. Magnificent stuff. A statement of intent. Serge Gnabry makes it three with a beautifully composed finish. Is there a player on the field, I wonder, who doesn\u2019t just want the game to end then and there? \u2026and tougher still. Paulo Dybala bends the resulting free-kick into the corner, the keeper rooted to the spot having taken a pre-emptive step the wrong way as the Argentine stepped up. Brescia down to 10 men! Florian Aye hauls down Aaron Ramsey, who is steaming clear, to pick up his second booking. A tough task just got even tougher. This looks ominous. Lewandowski turns provider, wriggling into the box and laying on a tap-in for Kingsley Coman. And that, you\u2019d have to think, is that. What is it they say about Germans and efficiency? A strong sense of \u2018no mucking about\u2019 here. Bayern takes precisely 113 seconds to reclaim their spot atop the Bundesliga, Robert Lewandowski exchanges passes with Thomas M\u00fcller and thunders a staggingly powerful left-footed finish past the Cologne goalkeeper. In Turin, Dybala misses a sitter for Juventus. Still 0-0. That fairytale FA Cup win for Ipswich at Man City, well, it doesn\u2019t look too likely. City are 2-0 up 20 minutes in, Laura Coombs and Pauline Bremer with the goals. Sunderland v Birmingham, the only other tie to go ahead, is still goalless. Bertrand Traore has been in miserable form for Lyon this season \u2013 20 games without a goal until today \u2013 but he\u2019s just broken the deadlock against Strasbourg with a close-range header. In Turin, Brescia venture forward and draw a desperate foul from Leo Bonucci \u2013 who just about escapes with a booking \u2013 and Balotelli lofts the resulting free-kick over the bar. Federico Macheda \u2013 formerly of Manchester United, Sampdoria, QPR, Stuttgart, Doncaster, Birmingham, Cardiff, Nottingham Forest and Novara Calcio \u2013 has scored for Panathinaikos. They\u2019re 3-0 up against Panetolikos, and will go fourth. Third-choice keeper alert! Brescia\u2019s goalie, Enrico Alfonso, who was only playing because of an injury to the No1 choice Jesse Joronen, has picked up an injury and been replaced after 10 minutes by Lorenzo Andrenacci, who comes on for his Serie A debut. His very first act is to scuff a truly woeful goal-kick straight to Juventus\u2019s Rodrigo Bentancur, who scurries forward and gets a shot away. This could be interesting. A first sniff of goal for Juventus, as Aaron Ramsey collects a Danilo pass inside the Brescia box but sees his shot blocked by a last-ditch lunge. A minute later, Gonzalo Higuain pokes a good chance wide after another Danilo cross. Mario Balotelli, up front for Brescia today, may be in for a long afternoon. Good news, Swansea fans! Your loanee striker Joel Asoro has put Groningen ahead at Sparta Rotterdam. Meanwhile, in Turin, game faces are affixed at Juventus and Brescia exchange their pre-match handshakes. The champions will have to do it without Cristiano Ronaldo, who sits out today with a knee injury \u2013 and has been in quiiiite good form recently\u2026 Full-time at Aberdeen, where Celtic have edged to a hard-fought win and taken a pretty big step towards a faintly ludicrous ninth successive title. Rangers really, really need a win at Livingston this afternoon to keep their hopes even vaguely alive. That didn\u2019t take long. Ajax go 1-0 up against rock-bottom Waalwijk thanks to a Dusan Tadic penalty on 13 minutes. Helluva penalty, too: thumped fiercely into the top corner. Their six-point lead at the top is re-established (for now). And speaking of former Premier League no-hopers, ex-Liverpool waif Suso scored his first goal for Sevilla earlier today, a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw at home to Espanyol. He\u2019s turned into quite the handy playmaker since leaving Anfield: Kristoffer Ajer has produced a cool finish to put Celtic 2-1 up at Aberdeen. A win there would take them a stinking 13 points clear of second-placed Rangers, albeit having played two games more. The afternoon\u2019s first Huge Goal comes from the Turkish Super Lig, where Trabzonspor have gone ahead against Sivasspor, and in so doing leapfrogged their opponents and Istanbul Basaksehir to the top of the table. The scorer? That would be former Crystal Palace no-hoper Alexander Sorloth, who seems to have emphatically learned how to hit a cow\u2019s arse with a banjo: having scored zero goals in 16 Premier League games has now scored 16 in 19 for Trabzonspor. Ahead of that Man City-Ipswich FA Cup tie, here\u2019s the estimable Nick Ames on the visitors who are chasing \u201cthe biggest upset ever\u201d: Gather round! Don\u2019t tell Manchester City, but right now Europe is where the fun\u2019s at. In lieu of a title race \u2013 or indeed much football at all \u2013 in the Premier League, this weekend brings us the latest neck-and-neck japes from two countries who have become used to their top divisions becoming the sort of repetitive procession currently besmirching the English top flight.

Scores of passengers who left the MS Westerdam, which had been at sea for two weeks after leaving Hong Kong on 1 February, have travelled on to other destinations. The director general of Malaysia\u2019s health ministry, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said he believed further precautions should have been taken when passengers disembarked. \u201cOnly 20 passengers had their tests done. That was what we were told,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact one case is positive, [means] all other passengers [have] exposure.\u201d Cambodia was praised by the head of the World Health Organization for receiving the ship, which had been turned away by five other countries despite there being no confirmed cases onboard at the time. The confirmation that an 83-year-old American passenger has since tested positive for the disease after travelling on to Malaysia has prompted questions about whether enough preventive measures have been taken. Cambodian authorities initially called for the test results to be reviewed by Malaysia, while the ship\u2019s operator, Holland America, described the tests as preliminary.

Instead it was Villa who found a second wind, levelling the scores just before the hour when Engels climbed above Alderweireld to head past Lloris from a Grealish corner. Reina kept out shots from Bergwijn and Son as the game continued to see-saw and was quick to deal with a Serge Aurier overlap after the impressive Bergwijn had played the full-back behind the Villa defence. Son broughtg another fingertip save from Reina as the game entered its closing stages, though the visitors\u2019 best chance of clinching victory in normal time was when a mistake by Ezri Konsa left Alli in the clear. The England forward was not decisive enough, allowing the defender time to recover, yet Villa relief was premature. An almost identical mistake from Engels, when there was no time left to do anything about it, proved their undoing.",

      "body": "<p>A cherished independent theatre in Uzbekistan is fighting eviction after realestate developers in the booming capital selected its historic location for a new business centre.</p> <p>The Ilkhom theatre of Mark Weil, which has provided a rare venue for experimental theatre and culture in Tashkent since the Soviet era, says it could be forced out of its home for up to two years because of renovations required by a new building owner, Ofelos Plaza. A prolonged disruption could prove a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d to the theatre, according to its directors, and that threat has ignited an international campaign to protect it under the social media hashtag #SaveIlkhom.</p> <p>With negotiations continuing, the theatre has issued a defiant message that it will not be closing its doors and this weekend premiered a new show called Zavtra, or \u201cTomorrow\u201d.</p> <p>Government intervention has already provided a reprieve, but employees and fans of the theatre say more should be done to preserve the Ilkhom as a cultural landmark, given its history of experimental theatre and social criticism from the Soviet period through the darkest days of dictatorship under Uzbekistan\u2019s former leader, Islam Karimov.</p> <p>\u201cAt first I thought it was a joke, that it couldn\u2019t be true,\u201d said Ashot Danielyan, a musician and poet who has collaborated with the Ilkhom. \u201cThere was this surprise \u2013 that one day your favourite theatre can be sold by someone. It belongs not just to someone. It belongs to the city, to the people, to the culture.\u201d</p> <p>Initially, Ofelos Plaza had demanded the Ilkhom permanently vacate the basement space it has occupied since 1976. In response, hundreds turned out to a public discussion about the theatre\u2019s future and members of Uzbekistan\u2019s government stepped in to handle negotiations with the building owner, which agreed not to permanently evict the theatre.</p> <p>\u201cI myself am a fan of the theatre and want to assure everyone that we won\u2019t forsake it! Ilkhom is the pride of our cultural life!\u201d wrote Saida Mirziyoyeva, the daughter of president Shavkhat Mirziyoyev, in an online post.</p> <p>The theatre was founded by Mark Weil, a Tashkent-born theatre director who used the artistic space to showcase local playwrights and develop a unique repertoire of original works and reimagined classics. He also established the Ilkhom as the only theatre in the Soviet Union that did not depend on state funding.</p> <p>\u201cMy memories of this theatre go back to my childhood, when my parents brought me here, the theatre was still mostly underground, and it was really considered lucky to come here,\u201d said Irina Bharat, Ilkhom\u2019s assistant general manager, who has worked at the theatre since 2005. \u201cIn those days, the shows started at nine or 10 in the evening, after all the other productions at the other theatres had ended. And the repertoire was completely different from Tashkent\u2019s theatres and the entire Soviet space. It is the first independent theatre of the entire Soviet space. There are no equivalents.\u201d</p> <p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, Weil made contacts in international theatre groups and continued to showcase foreign and controversial productions at the Ilkhom, despite increasing pressure from the government.</p> <p>In 2007, Weil was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/10/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">stabbed to death</a> near his home while returning from a dress rehearsal for the Oresteia, a tragedy by Aeschylus. Three men found guilty of the murder later called it an act of revenge for his portrayal of the prophet Muhammad in his play Imitating the Koran.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a principled position: we believe in the freedom of speech. We have had to pay for this in various ways,\u201d said Bharat. \u201cThe most tragic moment in the history of our theatre was the murder of Mark Weil in 2007. What\u2019s happening today is the second tragic story in the history of the theatre. But we feel a mountain of support behind us.\u201d</p> <p>The theatre\u2019s peril is also symbolic of wider changes.

      "bodyText": "A cherished independent theatre in Uzbekistan is fighting eviction after realestate developers in the booming capital selected its historic location for a new business centre. The Ilkhom theatre of Mark Weil, which has provided a rare venue for experimental theatre and culture in Tashkent since the Soviet era, says it could be forced out of its home for up to two years because of renovations required by a new building owner, Ofelos Plaza. A prolonged disruption could prove a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d to the theatre, according to its directors, and that threat has ignited an international campaign to protect it under the social media hashtag #SaveIlkhom. With negotiations continuing, the theatre has issued a defiant message that it will not be closing its doors and this weekend premiered a new show called Zavtra, or \u201cTomorrow\u201d. Government intervention has already provided a reprieve, but employees and fans of the theatre say more should be done to preserve the Ilkhom as a cultural landmark, given its history of experimental theatre and social criticism from the Soviet period through the darkest days of dictatorship under Uzbekistan\u2019s former leader, Islam Karimov. \u201cAt first I thought it was a joke, that it couldn\u2019t be true,\u201d said Ashot Danielyan, a musician and poet who has collaborated with the Ilkhom. \u201cThere was this surprise \u2013 that one day your favourite theatre can be sold by someone. It belongs not just to someone. It belongs to the city, to the people, to the culture.\u201d Initially, Ofelos Plaza had demanded the Ilkhom permanently vacate the basement space it has occupied since 1976. In response, hundreds turned out to a public discussion about the theatre\u2019s future and members of Uzbekistan\u2019s government stepped in to handle negotiations with the building owner, which agreed not to permanently evict the theatre. \u201cI myself am a fan of the theatre and want to assure everyone that we won\u2019t forsake it! Ilkhom is the pride of our cultural life!\u201d wrote Saida Mirziyoyeva, the daughter of president Shavkhat Mirziyoyev, in an online post. The theatre was founded by Mark Weil, a Tashkent-born theatre director who used the artistic space to showcase local playwrights and develop a unique repertoire of original works and reimagined classics. He also established the Ilkhom as the only theatre in the Soviet Union that did not depend on state funding. \u201cMy memories of this theatre go back to my childhood, when my parents brought me here, the theatre was still mostly underground, and it was really considered lucky to come here,\u201d said Irina Bharat, Ilkhom\u2019s assistant general manager, who has worked at the theatre since 2005. \u201cIn those days, the shows started at nine or 10 in the evening, after all the other productions at the other theatres had ended. And the repertoire was completely different from Tashkent\u2019s theatres and the entire Soviet space. It is the first independent theatre of the entire Soviet space. There are no equivalents.\u201d After the fall of the Soviet Union, Weil made contacts in international theatre groups and continued to showcase foreign and controversial productions at the Ilkhom, despite increasing pressure from the government. In 2007, Weil was stabbed to death near his home while returning from a dress rehearsal for the Oresteia, a tragedy by Aeschylus. Three men found guilty of the murder later called it an act of revenge for his portrayal of the prophet Muhammad in his play Imitating the Koran. \u201cWe have a principled position: we believe in the freedom of speech. We have had to pay for this in various ways,\u201d said Bharat. \u201cThe most tragic moment in the history of our theatre was the murder of Mark Weil in 2007. What\u2019s happening today is the second tragic story in the history of the theatre. But we feel a mountain of support behind us.\u201d The theatre\u2019s peril is also symbolic of wider changes. Tashkent has seen a wave of investment since Karimov\u2019s death in 2016, and the capital\u2019s rapid development has in part come at the expense of its citizens. Controversial regeneration projects have sparked a wave of grassroots activism, with residents protesting about rushed demolitions to make way for new buildings. Similarly, the management of the Ilkhom said they were not even aware that the building had been sold by the government to a developer when they received the order to vacate the building. When word of the eviction came, the Ilkhom was preparing for the debut of Zavtra. Danielyan, who composed the music for the production, described it as \u201canti-utopian\u201d and a \u201cmix of a rock concert and a play \u2026 it\u2019s like they\u2019re acting inside of a rock concert, and it\u2019s an experiment\u201d. The Ilkhom also provides a centre for lectures, art exhibitions and even a yearly Rock Fest, which welcomes musicians who would otherwise be prevented from putting on their own shows. \u201cIt\u2019s not welcome to play rock music in most places,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here, the theatre can do it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In August 2017, George was living in Glasgow when he received a call from his partner in South America. They had remained together despite the distance, a physical rather than emotional separation. George answered, and the voice on the other end of the phone dissolved into tears.</p> <p>\u201cHe had just been diagnosed with HIV,\u201d says George. \u201cI was worried about him. I was worried for myself and my future health. And I was worried about what my family would think.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/aids-and-hiv\" title=\"\">HIV</a> is no longer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/04/living-with-hiv-always-get-asked-are-you-going-to-die\" title=\"\">a death sentence</a>, and advances in treatment mean that most people on medication can expect a normal life expectancy and can\u2019t pass it on. But residual social stigma and the fear of parental rejection haunted George. \u201cIt would have confirmed to them their worst fears about having a gay son. You spend so much time and energy trying to reassure them about that when growing up that the thought of telling them ...\u201d He trails off.</p> <p>The call came on a Thursday evening. The local clinic had no Friday appointments. Over the weekend, sexual health services in the city shut down. \u201cI spent four days not knowing my HIV status after my boyfriend had just tested positive. The wait was dreadful,\u201d he recalls. The window for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) \u2013 a combination of drugs that if taken within 72 hours of exposure to HIV can halt transmission \u2013 was long past. \u201cI just assumed I must have it. If he did, I did.\u201d</p> <p>George\u2019s test came back negative. But the anxiety remained. He describes himself as cautious, and a regular condom user, but wanted to ensure that he would never again find himself in the dark about his HIV status. The sexual health nurse who delivered his results told him about pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP \u2013 a single pill, taken daily or on demand before sexual contact, that effectively eliminates the possibility of contracting HIV. It was the first time he had heard about it, but it offered a degree of security that appealed to him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e14b4c5385138eb7ef0327d4aaf03a3f4ab85037\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e14b4c5385138eb7ef0327d4aaf03a3f4ab85037/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018PrEP is just a way of guaranteeing I won\u2019t get HIV\u2019 ...

But George had moved to England, where PrEP was not \u2013 and still is not \u2013 freely available on the NHS. Instead, like thousands of others, George had to self-source through a website offering generic PrEP \u2013 an identical pill at a fraction of the price of Truvada, the branded PrEP pill developed by pharmaceutical company Gilead. \u201cSourcing it myself took time, but I could afford it. It was worth it to take care of myself and my partner,\u201d he says.</p> <p>George is now one of tens of thousands in the UK taking PrEP. Some believe it could herald the end of the world\u2019s HIV pandemic, and preliminary signs are positive: in January, Public Health England announced a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51122979\" title=\"\">71% drop</a> in the number of new HIV transmissions among gay and bisexual men since 2012. The dramatic decrease isn\u2019t due to PrEP alone \u2013 improved screening and the effect of regular medication stopping transmission of the virus have contributed significantly \u2013 but the drug seems to reach people that condoms alone do not. Yet with the drug only available on the NHS through a national trial set to end this year, PrEP users and campaigners are concerned that the greatest addition to HIV prevention in recent years isn\u2019t being prioritised by public health systems in England.</p> <p>That PrEP works is beyond reasonable doubt, say experts in the field. In 2015, two robust, large-scale studies reported their findings. In the UK, the Proud study announced an <a href=\"http://i-base.info/htb/27819\" title=\"\">86% reduction in new HIV transmissions</a> among those taking PrEP. The same year, <a href=\"https://www.aidsmap.com/news/feb-2015/pre-exposure-prophylaxis-also-stops-86-hiv-infections-ipergay-study\" title=\"\">a French study, Ipergay,</a> reported the exact same decrease in new transmissions. Analysis of those who had become infected while on the PrEP study revealed that they had not been taking the medication as prescribed.</p> <p>PrEP prevents HIV transmission by stopping the virus from replicating in cells. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop HIV entering the body, but it stops it taking hold,\u201d says Professor Sheena McCormach, the chief investigator of the 2015 Proud study.

I\u2019d lived through some of the worst years of HIV and Aids, and I didn\u2019t get it, so I didn\u2019t see why we needed it or, to be honest, why the NHS should fund it.\u201d</p> <p>But when Jack\u2019s relationship broke down, \u201cI moved to London, and realised I\u2019d be having a sex life again, with any luck.

For Jack, after 35 years of condom use, PrEP has facilitated new kinds of sex, free from old fears.</p> <p>Condom use is a common refrain among those sceptical of PrEP. The drug offers no defence against other sexually transmitted infections, and for those concerned that it encourages condomless sex \u2013 which some studies support \u2013 it\u2019s a poor alternative to using a condom. \u201cCondom use is always a negotiation,\u201d says Shorai, a bisexual woman whose name has been changed to protect her from stigma within her family and community. \u201cIf you are a married woman with an unfaithful partner, if you are with someone you cannot fully trust, or if you are in an abusive relationship, the power you have to demand the use of a condom is immediately limited.\u201d</p> <p>As a woman of African origin \u2013 she grew up in Zimbabwe \u2013 Shorai was informed she was, statistically, at increased risk of contracting HIV, and after an emotionally abusive relationship with a man she knew to be unfaithful, PrEP allowed her to protect herself discreetly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3eb8bcb33db32009b30074deab9ddff9aed2b6be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3eb8bcb33db32009b30074deab9ddff9aed2b6be/0_59_3745_2248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018People are getting infected every day\u2019 ... generic PrEP.

No longer does she rely on the honesty of her partner or overcoming the reluctance of men to use a condom. And the safety PrEP has provided has allowed her to explore polyamorous relationships and more open forms of intimacy without the fears of her childhood.</p> <p>\u201cPeople haven\u2019t used condoms since the beginning of time,\u201d says Phil Samba, a 27-year-old PrEP user who now works to improve PrEP uptake among queer men of colour. \u201cWhen straight men have sex without a condom, all they do is ask if the woman is on the pill. That\u2019s the end of the conversation. When gay men have condomless sex, it\u2019s suddenly \u2018barebacking\u2019 and there\u2019s something \u2018wrong\u2019 with it.\u201d Condomless sex among heterosexuals is treated as a fairly harmless slip-up which we make provision for in the form of the morning after pill. Sex between men doesn\u2019t seem to engender the same duty of care.</p> <p>\u201cIf HIV was an issue that primarily affected cis white straight men, we\u2019d have had PrEP on the NHS in nanoseconds,\u201d says Samba. \u201cHIV disproportionately affects black African heterosexual men and women, gay and bi men, sex workers, drug users \u2013 groups that don\u2019t fit the norm. It\u2019s [not been funded] because our health matters less, because we aren\u2019t seen as so important.\u201d</p> <p>When NHS England failed<strong> </strong>to commission PrEP, there was outrage across the HIV sector. Will Nutland, a doctor of public health and co-founder of PrEPster, a charity advocating for PrEP provision, originally thought the decision was born of a refusal to recognise the value of sex in people\u2019s lives and the importance of sexual autonomy, not the racism and homophobia identified by Samba. He has since changed his mind. When the high court ruled that PrEP was in NHS England\u2019s remit, the health agency put out a press release claiming the cost of PrEP would leave it unable to fund novel cystic fibrosis drugs for children \u2013 effectively pitting ill children against the deviance of LGBTQ people, in Nutland\u2019s reading.</p> <p>\u201cAll of the people most likely to benefit from PrEP are highly stigmatised. There was and remains a sense that the NHS can\u2019t be seen to be giving money to people living \u2018perverted\u2019 lives,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are getting infected every day while we have a drug that works just sitting in the lab.\u201d As a gay man who was born before homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967, who lived through the censorship of section 28, and lost friends and lovers during the worst years of Aids, his anger is palpable.</p> <p>NHS England has publicly committed to a \u201cseamless\u201d transition when Impact concludes. What that looks like has not yet been made clear to anyone in the sector, or PrEP users. Changes to local authority funding and years of austerity have made PrEP provision a logistical challenge. Since 2013, sexual health services have fallen under the remit of local authorities. But local authority public health budgets have been <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/additional-%C2%A332bn-a-year-needed-to-reverse-impact-of-government-cuts-to-public-helath\">slashed by \u00a3700m in real terms since 2014</a>. While research suggests PrEP would eventually <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/medication/hiv-prevention-drug-could-save-nhs-1-billion-over-80-years/\">save the NHS \u00a31bn over 80 years</a>, that benefit would not start to be seen for 30 years, and the costs of the quarterly STI checkups recommended to PrEP users would add strain to threadbare sexual health services.</p> <p>Among PrEP users, particularly those on the Impact trial, there is a degree of frustration and, for some, guilt that they have access to something others do not. \u201cI know healthcare workers who have wanted to prescribe PrEP but not been able to, or who have sat with people who cannot afford to pay for it and need it. There are people who are trying to protect themselves, but they aren\u2019t able to,\u201d George says. \u201cThat makes me angry.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In August 2017, George was living in Glasgow when he received a call from his partner in South America. They had remained together despite the distance, a physical rather than emotional separation. George answered, and the voice on the other end of the phone dissolved into tears. \u201cHe had just been diagnosed with HIV,\u201d says George. \u201cI was worried about him. I was worried for myself and my future health. And I was worried about what my family would think.\u201d HIV is no longer a death sentence, and advances in treatment mean that most people on medication can expect a normal life expectancy and can\u2019t pass it on. But residual social stigma and the fear of parental rejection haunted George. \u201cIt would have confirmed to them their worst fears about having a gay son. You spend so much time and energy trying to reassure them about that when growing up that the thought of telling them ...\u201d He trails off. The call came on a Thursday evening. The local clinic had no Friday appointments. Over the weekend, sexual health services in the city shut down. \u201cI spent four days not knowing my HIV status after my boyfriend had just tested positive. The wait was dreadful,\u201d he recalls. The window for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) \u2013 a combination of drugs that if taken within 72 hours of exposure to HIV can halt transmission \u2013 was long past. \u201cI just assumed I must have it. If he did, I did.\u201d George\u2019s test came back negative. But the anxiety remained. He describes himself as cautious, and a regular condom user, but wanted to ensure that he would never again find himself in the dark about his HIV status. The sexual health nurse who delivered his results told him about pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP \u2013 a single pill, taken daily or on demand before sexual contact, that effectively eliminates the possibility of contracting HIV. It was the first time he had heard about it, but it offered a degree of security that appealed to him. A few months before his test, in April 2017, Scotland became the first country in the UK to make PrEP available to eligible patients on prescription. But George had moved to England, where PrEP was not \u2013 and still is not \u2013 freely available on the NHS. Instead, like thousands of others, George had to self-source through a website offering generic PrEP \u2013 an identical pill at a fraction of the price of Truvada, the branded PrEP pill developed by pharmaceutical company Gilead. \u201cSourcing it myself took time, but I could afford it. It was worth it to take care of myself and my partner,\u201d he says. George is now one of tens of thousands in the UK taking PrEP. Some believe it could herald the end of the world\u2019s HIV pandemic, and preliminary signs are positive: in January, Public Health England announced a 71% drop in the number of new HIV transmissions among gay and bisexual men since 2012. The dramatic decrease isn\u2019t due to PrEP alone \u2013 improved screening and the effect of regular medication stopping transmission of the virus have contributed significantly \u2013 but the drug seems to reach people that condoms alone do not. Yet with the drug only available on the NHS through a national trial set to end this year, PrEP users and campaigners are concerned that the greatest addition to HIV prevention in recent years isn\u2019t being prioritised by public health systems in England. That PrEP works is beyond reasonable doubt, say experts in the field. In 2015, two robust, large-scale studies reported their findings. In the UK, the Proud study announced an 86% reduction in new HIV transmissions among those taking PrEP. The same year, a French study, Ipergay, reported the exact same decrease in new transmissions. Analysis of those who had become infected while on the PrEP study revealed that they had not been taking the medication as prescribed. PrEP prevents HIV transmission by stopping the virus from replicating in cells. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop HIV entering the body, but it stops it taking hold,\u201d says Professor Sheena McCormach, the chief investigator of the 2015 Proud study. The science, she says, is robust but its effectiveness \u2013 over 99% according to some studies \u2013 did not convince NHS commissioners to make the drug widely available. In 2016, NHS England announced they would not be commissioning PrEP, claiming that prevention was not their remit. The National Aids Trust took the government to court and won. But instead of making PrEP available, NHS England and Public Health England announced the Impact trial, which would initially make the drug available to 10,000 people at risk \u2013 predominantly gay and bisexual men, but also African women, sex workers and trans people \u2013 and has since been expanded to cover 26,000. But in regions across the country trial spaces are filled. As of October 2019, 15 men on the waiting list for PrEP have contracted HIV. Jack Ash, a 47-year-old enrolled on the Impact trial, was initially not convinced by the drug: \u201cWhen I first heard about PrEP, I didn\u2019t want to take it. I was in a long-term relationship, I\u2019d just adopted two kids, and I was living in rural Sussex.\u201dJack came out in 1985, over a decade before effective treatment options meant HIV was a manageable condition, not a fatal illness. \u201cI had always used a condom.

      "bodyText": "The death of Caroline Flack has once again focused attention on the behaviour of the British tabloids, who had followed every twist and turn of her private life \u2013 coverage, critics argue, that fed vicious online abuse of a clearly vulnerable woman. Within hours of the announcement, hundreds of celebrities and members of the public had backed calls for a \u201cCaroline\u2019s law\u201d against excessive media intrusion while Laura Whitmore, who succeeded Flack as host of Love Island for the current series, suggested media coverage contributed to her friend\u2019s death. \u201cTo the press, the newspapers, who create clickbait, who demonise and tear down success, we\u2019ve had enough,\u201d said Whitmore in an impassioned speech on her weekly BBC Radio 5 live show. \u201cI\u2019ve seen journalists and Twitter warriors talk of this tragedy and they themselves twisted what the truth is \u2026 Your words affect people. To paparazzi and tabloids looking for a cheap sell, to trolls hiding behind a keyboard, enough.\u201d Despite Whitmore\u2019s pleas, there is little sign that change is on the cards. Individuals who work at leading British tabloids privately pointed out on Sunday that many of the people now criticising press intrusion into Flack\u2019s life were likely to have been among the millions of readers who had previously rushed to click on articles about the presenter\u2019s arrest in December for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend. The attitude of many is that it was the public appetite for details about Flack\u2019s private life that drove the scale of the coverage, with articles about her death topping the \u201cmost-read\u201d lists. The exact circumstances of Flack\u2019s death remain unknown and the presenter had talked about her struggle with depression for many years. But as Britain\u2019s tabloids face substantial criticism, they have sought to focus attention elsewhere. MailOnline\u2019s report on Whitmore\u2019s tribute to Flack left out the comments about tabloid media, while the Sun has sought to point the finger of blame for her death at the Crown Prosecution Service and ITV bosses. Flack\u2019s high-profile relationships, combined with her role presenting one of the few television shows that attracts younger viewers, had made her catnip for tabloids. Stories about the presenter had delivered substantial numbers of readers for years but this ramped up enormously following the events of last December when police were called to her London home in the early hours after she allegedly assaulted her boyfriend after reading messages on his phone. Sources at the Sun, which on Saturday deleted a recently published negative story about the presenter when news of her death broke, pointed out that her death came shortly after a decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to press ahead with her trial. They said an article about a Valentine\u2019s Day card mocking Flack was deleted to stop it coming up in Google results for her name: \u201cWe would no doubt have been criticised if we hadn\u2019t taken a recent story down following a tragedy.\u201d The Sun, which in December obtained exclusive pictures of her bloodied bedroom following the alleged assault, used its leader column to point the finger at prosecutors rather than media coverage of the star: \u201cThe Crown Prosecution Service needs to take a long look in the mirror and ask why it pursued its course of action given what they knew about her vulnerability. We may never know exactly what drove Caroline over the edge. But we will always remember how, like the weather at the TV villa, she brought so much sunshine into our lives.\u201d Dan Wootton, the Sun\u2019s executive editor, went further and suggested the blame lay with ITV for dropping her from Love Island following the assault charges, even though the programme was being filmed in Cape Town as court proceedings were active: \u201cCaroline was hung out to dry by ITV. She was distraught they didn\u2019t stand by her. And distraught about the lack of support she was given. Caroline and I were devastated to attend the funeral of our friend Mike Thalassitis last year. I cannot believe we are here again.\u201d ITV is also facing questions about whether it did enough to support Flack after she left Love Island following the arrest, especially given the support it has shown to other high-profile presenters such as Ant McPartlin as he dealt with drug addiction. A spokesperson for ITV emphasised that Flack had chosen to step down from hosting duties of her own accord, said she was provided with support, and that \u201call of us are absolutely devastated at this tragic news\u201d. The broadcaster has already had to deal with renewed scrutiny of the support it offers to individuals associated with its reality TV shows, following the suicides of a participant on the Jeremy Kyle Show and the deaths of two former Love Island contestants who knew Flack. There will also be questions over whether the Love Island brand, which has become one of the broadcaster\u2019s cash cows, has been tarnished by multiple deaths. ITV said Love Island would be shown on Monday night, while Channel 4 has already announced it will cancel a forthcoming series called the Surjury presented by Flack about plastic surgery. One thing is clear: for all the public\u2019s anger at celebrity news outlets whom many are blaming for hounding a woman to her death, privately people are flocking to tabloid sites to read every possible detail about her.

Backlashes against the media\u2019s coverage often accompany deaths; after Princess Diana was killed in Paris in 1997, the Daily Mail went as far as to pledge it would never again use paparazzi pictures amid widespread anti-tabloid feelings that were soon forgotten as the British public took an interest in a new round of celebrities.

      "body": "<p>The reality TV presenter Caroline Flack, who has taken her own life aged 40, helped the ITV2 dating programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a> become a top-rating show that last year attracted audiences of more than 6 million. It had originally run as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/nov/24/ripcelebrityloveisland\" title=\"\">Celebrity Love Island</a> on ITV in 2005, with Patrick Kielty as the main host welcoming famous contestants to a villa on Armstrong Island, Fiji, but rarely drew more than 2 million viewers and was axed after two series.</p> \n<p>Then, five years ago, ITV decided to give Love Island a new lease of life on its second channel, with Flack as the sole presenter and Majorca as the host island. She described it as \u201ca social experiment\u201d and a dream job: \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a lot of fun.\u201d In its previous incarnation, the \u201cislanders\u201d had had the final say on evictions. This time, the viewers were firmly in control of the final vote after the various \u201ccouplings\u201d and \u201cre-couplings\u201d over the weeks, with a \u00a350,000 jackpot for the winning couple. Viewers related to Flack\u2019s warmth and infectious laugh, as well the support she gave to troubled contestants.</p> \n<p>Its success grew and grew. \u201cI think people just relate to the situations,\u201d Flack <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/love-islands-caroline-flack-thirties-not-married-think-having/\" title=\"\">told the Telegraph </a>in 2017. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you are, what you do, where you\u2019re from, how old you are, it doesn\u2019t matter how much experience you\u2019ve got in life, how educated you are: emotions are all the same.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fbb5b533d509fa8b3b10eae87972e8ff509e90f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fbb5b533d509fa8b3b10eae87972e8ff509e90f/0_489_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Flack during the filming of the Love Island promo in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Flack during the filming of the Love Island promo in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ford/ITV</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By 2018, the programme had broken through the 4 million viewers barrier, making it ITV2\u2019s most popular show ever \u2013 and winner of that year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C3y_EbhCwg\" title=\"\">Bafta</a> best reality TV award. Even George Osborne, the former chancellor, declared himself a fan.</p> \n<p>As a result of its success last year, ITV announced a second annual Love Island series would be screened from January 2020, live from South Africa, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/01/tv-shows-to-get-excited-about-2020-preview\" title=\"\">winter companion piece</a> to the regular summer series. However, in December, Flack announced that she would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/17/caroline-flack-quits-as-love-island-host-after-assault-chage\" title=\"\">stand down as presenter</a> after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend, the former professional tennis player Lewis Burton, at their home in London. Flack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/23/love-island-presenter-caroline-flack-pleads-not-guilty-to-assaulting-boyfriend\" title=\"\">pleaded not guilty</a> to the charge and faced a trial due to begin next month. </p> \n<p>She was born in Enfield, north London, to Ian Flack, a sales rep for Coca-Cola, and his wife, Christine (nee Callis). Caroline and her twin, Jody, had an older sister, Elizabeth, and brother, Paul. After the family moved to Norfolk to live near Thetford when she was still a baby, Caroline attended Wayland community high school, Watton, where she enjoyed dancing and appeared in village pantomimes. </p> \n<p>She went on to study dancing and musical theatre at Bodywork Company in Cambridge (1996-99). Her first showbiz break came with appearances in the comedy sketch show Bo\u2019 Selecta! (2002-04) as Bubbles. In a reality TV spoof, Leigh Francis played Michael Jackson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o8rdNR5tmE\" title=\"\">showing viewers around his home</a>, which he shared with his brothers and his \u201cpet monkey\u201d, Bubbles. Eventually it became apparent that Bubbles was totally human. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think Bubbles was a monkey, did you?\u201d asked Francis. </p> \n<p>Flack went from performing to presenting, beginning in 2003 with The International Pepsi Chart Show, a re-edited version of Britain\u2019s CD:UK, screened only in Norway and Tahiti, with her recording new links and interviews. \u201cWeek by week, I learned my craft away from the public gaze,\u201d she wrote in her 2015 autobiography, Storm in a C Cup. \u201cI was now a jobbing presenter picking up things here and there.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shows ranged from Fash FC (2003-04), following the former football star John Fashanu as he managed an amateur team, to the first three series (2006-08) of the Saturday morning CBBC show TMi, alongside the former Pop Idol contestants Sam Nixon and Mark Rhodes, as well as the same channel\u2019s Comic Relief Does Fame Academy (2007) and the first two runs (2008-09) of the Gladiators revival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1da7475d8b594fe3f6717c15f11c3ba69113638d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1da7475d8b594fe3f6717c15f11c3ba69113638d/0_127_4348_2608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Flack and Pasha Kovalev in Strictly Come Dancing, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Flack and Pasha Kovalev in Strictly Come Dancing, 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Flack presented the ITV2 spin-off shows I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2013 Get Me Out of Here!

She was also a backstage presenter on the main programme, The X Factor, for the 2013 run on ITV.</p> \n<p>Then, she and Murs stepped into the spotlight as joint presenters of The X Factor for the 2015 series. When Murs said that he would not continue the following year so that he could concentrate on his music, Flack decided to leave as well and both were replaced by Dermot O\u2019Leary.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd33486616dbbdc4bd3a571fb2fa3081b1088a46\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd33486616dbbdc4bd3a571fb2fa3081b1088a46/29_52_3441_2065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Flack on I\u2019m a Celebrity in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Flack on I\u2019m a Celebrity in 2009.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her celebrity status had already been confirmed by then with an appearance as a contestant in the 2014 series of Strictly Come Dancing, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/21/strictly-come-dancing-final-caroline-flack-wins\" title=\"\">she won</a> with the professional dancer Pasha Kovalev as her partner. This reignited her passion for performing and, in 2017, she starred as Irene in a touring stage production of George and Ira Gershwin\u2019s musical <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2887627/caroline-flack-cant-hide-her-excitement-after-revealing-shes-making-her-theatre-debut-in-crazy-for-you/\" title=\"\">Crazy for You</a>. </p> \n<p>Flack relished the role. \u201cShe\u2019s strong, she knows what she wants, but there\u2019s a vulnerability,\u201d she said. \u201cShe gets hurt the whole way through, but she\u2019s brilliantly defiant. She stays strong and doesn\u2019t give up. She\u2019s naughty as well. There\u2019s definitely bits of Irene that are quite like me.\u201d In 2018, she starred as Roxie Hart for a Christmas West End run of <a href=\"https://www.londontheatre.co.uk/theatre-news/news/caroline-flack-to-star-as-roxie-hart-in-chicago-at-the-phoenix-theatre\" title=\"\">Chicago</a> at the Phoenix theatre.</p> \n<p>Throughout her career, Flack made headlines for her relationships with other celebs, from the One Direction singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles\" title=\"\">Harry Styles </a>to the pop manager Jack Street and the Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Andrew Brady. She was also a friend of Prince Harry. \u201cOnce the story got out, that was it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to stop seeing each other.\u201d She said that her own experiences of being in the public eye helped her support and advise the Love Island contestants: \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be that victim online. And that\u2019s why I hate seeing it happen to them.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is survived by Burton, her parents and siblings.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Caroline Louise Flack, television presenter, born 9 November 1979; died 15 February 2020</p>",

However, in December, Flack announced that she would stand down as presenter after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend, the former professional tennis player Lewis Burton, at their home in London. Flack pleaded not guilty to the charge and faced a trial due to begin next month. She was born in Enfield, north London, to Ian Flack, a sales rep for Coca-Cola, and his wife, Christine (nee Callis). Caroline and her twin, Jody, had an older sister, Elizabeth, and brother, Paul. After the family moved to Norfolk to live near Thetford when she was still a baby, Caroline attended Wayland community high school, Watton, where she enjoyed dancing and appeared in village pantomimes. She went on to study dancing and musical theatre at Bodywork Company in Cambridge (1996-99). Her first showbiz break came with appearances in the comedy sketch show Bo\u2019 Selecta! (2002-04) as Bubbles. In a reality TV spoof, Leigh Francis played Michael Jackson showing viewers around his home, which he shared with his brothers and his \u201cpet monkey\u201d, Bubbles. Eventually it became apparent that Bubbles was totally human. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think Bubbles was a monkey, did you?\u201d asked Francis. Flack went from performing to presenting, beginning in 2003 with The International Pepsi Chart Show, a re-edited version of Britain\u2019s CD:UK, screened only in Norway and Tahiti, with her recording new links and interviews. \u201cWeek by week, I learned my craft away from the public gaze,\u201d she wrote in her 2015 autobiography, Storm in a C Cup. \u201cI was now a jobbing presenter picking up things here and there.\u201d The shows ranged from Fash FC (2003-04), following the former football star John Fashanu as he managed an amateur team, to the first three series (2006-08) of the Saturday morning CBBC show TMi, alongside the former Pop Idol contestants Sam Nixon and Mark Rhodes, as well as the same channel\u2019s Comic Relief Does Fame Academy (2007) and the first two runs (2008-09) of the Gladiators revival. Flack presented the ITV2 spin-off shows I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2013 Get Me Out of Here! NOW! for two series (2009-10) and The Xtra Factor from 2011 to 2013, with the singer Olly Murs co-hosting some editions. She was also a backstage presenter on the main programme, The X Factor, for the 2013 run on ITV. Then, she and Murs stepped into the spotlight as joint presenters of The X Factor for the 2015 series. When Murs said that he would not continue the following year so that he could concentrate on his music, Flack decided to leave as well and both were replaced by Dermot O\u2019Leary. Her celebrity status had already been confirmed by then with an appearance as a contestant in the 2014 series of Strictly Come Dancing, which she won with the professional dancer Pasha Kovalev as her partner. This reignited her passion for performing and, in 2017, she starred as Irene in a touring stage production of George and Ira Gershwin\u2019s musical Crazy for You. Flack relished the role. \u201cShe\u2019s strong, she knows what she wants, but there\u2019s a vulnerability,\u201d she said. \u201cShe gets hurt the whole way through, but she\u2019s brilliantly defiant. She stays strong and doesn\u2019t give up. She\u2019s naughty as well. There\u2019s definitely bits of Irene that are quite like me.\u201d In 2018, she starred as Roxie Hart for a Christmas West End run of Chicago at the Phoenix theatre. Throughout her career, Flack made headlines for her relationships with other celebs, from the One Direction singer Harry Styles to the pop manager Jack Street and the Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Andrew Brady. She was also a friend of Prince Harry. \u201cOnce the story got out, that was it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to stop seeing each other.\u201d She said that her own experiences of being in the public eye helped her support and advise the Love Island contestants: \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be that victim online. And that\u2019s why I hate seeing it happen to them.\u201d She is survived by Burton, her parents and siblings. \u2022 Caroline Louise Flack, television presenter, born 9 November 1979; died 15 February 2020",

But Beckham\u2019s influence \u2013 as a designer and a much-photographed celebrity \u2013 having been key in making longer skirts into a mainstream trend, her volte-face may signal the beginning of a wider trend. \u201cI broke my own rules today,\u201d said Beckham backstage after her show. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do something shorter for a while \u2013 I know that I still want to wear a shorter length sometimes. So I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how do I do that in a cool way. And I\u2019m a minimalist, so I\u2019m always looking for ways to make clothes that are exciting but still wearable. I want to challenge myself, not challenge the customer. Clothes shouldn\u2019t make life difficult.\u201d What Beckham called the \u201cgently rebellious\u201d mood of her show extended to the Little Simz soundtrack. With her family attending, Beckham said she had warned her eight-year-old daughter, Harper, that \u201cthere might be rude words that you wouldn\u2019t normally hear\u201d. Tailored culottes, or vented tweed skirts, finished just above the knee. Pie-frill collar blouses, velvet blazers and chain belts added to the bourgeois-chic effect, while tight thigh-high boots \u201cmake the look sexy and tough at the same time\u201d. For evening, a midnight blue fluid silk dress to mid-thigh with high, draped neckline and full sleeves represented \u201cmy version of a modern party dress,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been a typical \u2018party dress\u2019 person for a long time, actually. If I go out at night I am more likely to wear some kind of tuxedo. But I want to wear this. I like how the volume on the sleeve offsets the shorter length.\u201d Richard Avedon\u2019s dynamic 1960s portraits of a leaping Penelope Tree were on Beckham\u2019s mood board this season \u2013 \u201csomething about the spirit and the freedom, more than the clothes\u201d \u2013 along with images of Marisa Berenson, who \u201cused to wear the same clothes for day and evening, but put more makeup on at night,\u201d said Beckham. \u201cI think that\u2019s quite cool.\u201d The all-American fashion powerhouse Tommy Hilfiger is making a guest appearance at this London fashion week with a show co-designed with Lewis Hamilton and the Grammy-award winning R&amp;B singer HER. But Hilfiger \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in traditional fashion shows\u201d, he says. \u201cWhat I believe in are unforgettable experiences, where you show clothes. It has to be truly memorable, otherwise it\u2019s just not relevant.\u201d Hilfiger lays claim to be the godfather of streetwear. \u201cWe created streetwear in the late 1980s before streetwear existed,\u201d he said at a preview before his Tate Modern show. \u201cWe started out as a preppy brand, and then we added sport. Not sportswear as it had been seen in fashion before, but the clothes real athletes wore to play basketball, football, hockey \u2013 oversized clothes, bright colours, big type and numbers. The fashion writers at the time called it hip-hop wear, but we said no, hip-hop kids are wearing our look, which is called streetwear.\u201d Hilfiger pointed to a tracksuit in setting-plaster pink with tonal embossed logo as a look showing Lewis Hamilton\u2019s influence. \u201cIt\u2019s elegant, luxe street style \u2013 that whole Kanye-in-California vibe,\u201d Hilfiger said. HER brought her \u201cunisex, utility, oversized\u201d style to boilersuits with neon ring pulls on the zips. The three-way collaboration is the latest in a series 68-year-old Hilfiger has done with young fashion influencers including Zendaya and Gigi Hadid. \u201cI was afraid to grow up, I guess,\u201d he explained.",

      "bodyText": "The UK government has not spoken to China about helping to build the troubled HS2 high-speed railway, according to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. Shapps dismissed reports that he spoken to Beijing\u2019s state-owned railway-builder about a role in the construction of the rail link. \u201cThey have clearly had a letter sent to HS2 Ltd, there has been no conversation with me as a minister, as the secretary of state,\u201d Shapps said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cWe should be talking to anyone we can learn from,\u201d he said, adding that the government would be \u201cfools\u201d not to have a conversation about whether the project could be built more quickly. According to a report in the Financial Times, the China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) wrote to HS2 Ltd\u2019s chief executive last month, saying it could build the line in five years (compared with the planned 15 years) and at a much lower cost than forecast. CCRC has transformed China\u2019s transport system and built most of the country\u2019s 15,500-mile rail network. Shapps acknowledged the speed with which projects are built in China, but said: \u201cI would say they don\u2019t have our planning system, they don\u2019t have our legal system, they don\u2019t have to respect people\u2019s property rights in the same way.\u201d Boris Johnson controversially gave the green light for the HS2 scheme earlier this month, despite it being billions of pounds over budget. An official review has warned that costs could reach over \u00a3100bn, against a budget of \u00a362bn. Under current plans the final stretch of the line is not due to be completed until 2040, although Johnson has said he wants that brought forward to 2035. Department for Transport (DfT) officials had previously confirmed \u201cpreliminary discussions\u201d had taken place between CCRC and HS2 Ltd, but said no \u201cconcrete commitments\u201d had been made. British officials have expressed concerns over a potential role for Beijing in infrastructure building. The US president, Donald Trump, reportedly reacted angrily to Johnson\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese tech giant Huawei to supply equipment for the UK\u2019s 5G mobile network.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog; I\u2019ll leave you with a match report from Pittodrie. Thanks for your company - bye! Still want more? Bet you do. Peep peep! Celtic go 13 points clear with a seriously hard-fought win at a gusty Pittodrie. It\u2019s harsh on Aberdeen, who were on the front foot for most of the game, but Celtic showed their superior class with an excellent winning goal from Kristoffer Ajer. In the circumstances it\u2019s a quite brilliant win for Celtic, the sort that makes a team think they are going to be champions. 90+1 min Three minutes of added time. 90+1 min Although the scoreline is flattering, Celtic have been much better since Neil Lennon switched to a back four early in the second half. 90 min That second goal has flattened Aberdeen, who are struggling to rouse themselves to push for an equaliser. Celtic have had their best spell of the match since going ahead. 87 min: What a miss from Edouard! That should have been a third for Celtic. Forrest\u2019s cross came to Edouard in the six-yard box; he missed his first attempt at a shot and then hoofed his second straight at the feet of Lewis, who had already dived in an attempt to block the first shot that Edouard muffed. All Edouard had to do was lift the ball over the keeper\u2019s legs. 86 min Bitton is booked for an off-the-ball shove on Cosgrove. 84 min I should also give credit to Odsonne Edouard, who started the move for the goal with a superb bit of control and a backheel to Callum McGregor. 83 min Sam Cosgrove replaces Funso Ojo for Aberdeen. It\u2019s been such a difficult afternoon for Celtic, but they won\u2019t care if the score stays like this. The goal was made by Forrest, who scurried infield from the left and played an excellent angled pass to find Ajer in space on the right side of the area. He controlled the ball, looked up and sidefooted an emphatic shot over the left shoulder of the outrushing Lewis. That was a belting finish. Celtic have mugged Aberdeen! 79 min Tom Rogic replaces Olivier Ntcham. 78 min Main was right behind McKenna, and would have had a much easier chance. McKenna didn\u2019t realise. 77 min McGinn\u2019s inswinging cross from the left is headed on at the near post by Considine, but McKenna can\u2019t get any power in his header at goal and Forster makes an easy save. 75 min For the umpteenth time this afternoon, Jullienm complains after being manhandled by Main. Aberdeen win a corner, which is punched away by Forster. 74 min: Fine save by Lewis! Celtic almost take the lead against the run of play. The left-back Hayes plays a one-two with Edouard, scurries into the area and smacks a shot that is well blocked by the outrushing Lewis. He could have cut it back to the unmarked Ntcham but only had eyes for a goal against his old club. 73 min It\u2019s been a really unpleasant afternoon for the Celtic defenders, who have been buffetted by the front pair of Curtis Main and Storm Dennis. 71 min McGinn\u2019s brilliant cross is headed up in the air by Bitton in his own six-yard box. It swirls around and is eventually shovelled behind, less than convincingly, by Forster. 70 min If it stays like this, Celtic will be 11 points clear of Rangers having played two games more. Rangers play at home to Livingston at 3pm. 69 min The stretching Jullien makes a terrific tackle on McGinn in his own penalty area. 67 min An Aberdeen change: Craig Bryson replaces Matty Kennedy. 67 min To the great delight of the Aberdeen fans, an abysmal cross from Hayes goes straight out of play. 65 min Celtic have had a bit more of the ball since bringing on Christie, though they still look miles off their exhilarating best. 64 min \u201cHard to see both Edouard and Griffiths not scoring for a second successive match,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cMind you, if it can happen to Lawrence Shankland\u2026\u201d 63 min Jullien is booked for a tackle from behind on Main. He got the ball but the referee decided he went through Main to get to it. 61 min Brown and Main are starting to rub each other up the wrong way, which could make the next few minutes particularly entertaining. 59 min Celtic have switched to the old 4-3-3 formation, with Ajer at right-back, Christie wide right and Forrest on the left. 58 min Celtic make an early change, with Leigh Griffiths replaced by Ryan Christie. Griffiths has had a frustrating afternoon. 56 min Main\u2019s harmless long-range shot is comfortably held by Forster. For all Aberdeen\u2019s superiority, he hasn\u2019t had a huge amount of work to do. 53 min Scott Brown maintains his popularity levels at Pittodrie by running into McGinn and sending him to the floor. 51 min After a sustained spell of Aberdeen pressure, Bitton does well to usher Kennedy out of play. But Celtic are really struggling to get on the ball. 49 min Aberdeen continue to harass Celtic, with and without the ball. They\u2019ve been terrific today. 46 min Peep peep! Aberdeen begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! Celtic\u2019s winning run is under threat. They haven\u2019t settled at a windy Pittodrie, and Aberdeen fully deserved Ash Taylor\u2019s emphatic equaliser. Callum McGregor gave Celtic an early lead, but the Aberdeen keeper Joe Lewis has had the square root of bugger all to do since then. See you in 15 minutes for the second half. 45 min Ash Taylor is booked for taking a shortcut through the back of Edouard. Having seen the replay, that was a fair enough challenge from Jullien - he leaned in with his arm rather than using his hands to push Main out of the way. 45 min Main goes over in the area after a shove from behind by Jullien. No penalty is given, but that looked clumsy at best. 44 min Griffiths gives away a silly free-kick and then gets himself booked for dissent. 42 min A free-kick is headed away as far as McGinn, 25 yards from goal. He launches into a volley but it\u2019s miles off target and hits one of his teammates before going behind. 39 min McLennan is booked for diving in the Celtic area. And quite right too; it was a risible bit of simulation. 38 min A stinging long-range shot from Ojo is beaten away by Forster. It was a comfortable enough save, and he probably would have tried to catch it but for the wind. 37 min Bitton shoots from 25 yards. Goalkick to Aberdeen. 36 min Some lovely sleight of shoulder from Forrest, who beats Kennedy without touching the ball and then clips a dangerous ball that bounces right across the six-yard line. 35 min Ntcham flicks a dangerous through pass towards Griffiths, who is beaten to the ball by McKenna. Good defending. 33 min Nothing comes of the corner. Not a thing. 32 min A snapvolley from Main hits Jullien and goes behind for a corner. This is an excellent spell for Aberdeen. 32 min ... nowt happens. 31 min McGinn is fouled on the left wing by Forrest. Ferguson wanders over to take the free-kick. From which... 29 min Celtic have been nowhere near their best so far. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the conditions or just one of those first half hours. It was a really good finish from the big centre-half Ash Taylor. A nothing cross from the right somehow bounced through to him in space at the far post. He took the ball down on the chest and rifled a half-volley past Forster from 10 yards. I told you Aberdeen didn\u2019t look like scoring! 25 min Former Aberdeen player Jonny Hayes replaces Greg Taylor, and is booed onto the field. 24 min There\u2019s a break in play while Greg Taylor receives treatment. He\u2019s struggling and is going to come off. 23 min As if to prove the point, Main shoots miles over the bar from distance. 22 min Main, Aberdeen\u2019s lone striker, is doing a lot of grunt work in the channels, and has linked play neatly as well. There\u2019s a lot to like about Aberdeen, but they don\u2019t really look like scoring. 20 min A decent cross from Ferguson flashes right across the Celtic area. Aberdeen have played some nice stuff but, as so often this season, are lacking penetration. 19 min \u201cVery important question,\u201d says Jim Crane. \u201cWhere would you place Scott Brown in the pantheon of modern sporting irritants (the Nause Scale, if you will)? I always feel he\u2019d have fit in well with the turn of the century Australian Test team; part of a superior and dominant side, but constantly on the wind-up anyway because (\u2018Scorpion and Frog\u2019-like) it\u2019s just in his nature.\u201d I\u2019m not sure where he fits on the scale, but I can\u2019t get enough of his comedy masculinity. He\u2019s the gift that keeps on niggling. 15 min The scoreline is a bit harsh on Aberdeen, who have been the better team. Ferguson plays a one-two with Main and is flattened by Jullien, just outside the area on the right. McGinn\u2019s free-kick drifts harmlessly across the penalty box. 12 min Aberdeen were unhappy that Griffiths eased McKenna off the ball in the build up to the goal. It was a subjective decision that could have gone either way, although it would have been a softish free-kick. 11 min \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cBonus Scottish football, and VAR- free, too. You\u2019re welcome!\u201d Griffiths surged down the inside-left channel and squared the ball to Edouard in the area. He teed up Forrest, whose shot was slapped away by the diving Lewis. The rebound fell perfectly for McGregor, who steered it into the net with not inconsiderable glee. Celtic pinch the lead with their first decent attack! 7 min Aberdeen are starting to cause a few problems with crosses, particularly from the right. But the match hasn\u2019t really settled down. 5 min It\u2019s been a scruffy start, with both teams trying to get used to the swirling wind. 2 min Logan\u2019s right-wing cross bounces around the Celtic area for a while before Considine heads off target from the edge of the area. Celtic break quickly and Ntcham drives well wide from 20 yards. 1 min Peep peep! Celtic kick off from left to right. Stormwatch It\u2019s very windy at Pittodrie; it\u2019s also sunny and dry. Scott Brown has his top on. Aberdeen (4-1-4-1) Lewis; Logan, Taylor, McKenna, Considine; Ojo; McLennan, Ferguson, McGinn, Kennedy; Main. Substitutes: Cerny, Hernandez, Campbell, McGeouch, Bryson, Anderson, Cosgrove Celtic (3-4-1-2) Forster; Bitton, Jullien, Ajer; Forrest, Brown, McGregor, Taylor; Ntcham; Griffiths, Edouard. Substitutes: Bain, Frimpong, Hayes, Rogic, Christie, Elyounoussi, Bayo. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Aberdeen v Celtic from Pittodrie.

      "body": "<h2>Figure out the underlying cause</h2> <p><a href=\"https://clareevans.co.uk\" title=\"\">Clare Evans</a>, a productivity coach and author of Time Management For Dummies, says the main reasons for procrastinating are fear, perfectionism and not knowing where to start, or feeling overwhelmed or unmotivated. If it is fear, whether unfounded or founded, Evans says to confront the worst-case scenario:<strong> </strong>\u201cIt may not be as bad as we think.\u201d Figure out what knowledge or skills you are lacking, and delegate if you can. If you\u2019re paralysed by the need to get it right, Evans suggests honestly confronting whether \u201c\u2018perfect\u2019 is really what\u2019s needed\u201d \u2013 or if it is more important just to get it done. \u201cSometimes we procrastinate over tasks that aren\u2019t really that important.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Start with one small step</strong></h2> <p>Tim Pychyl, founder of the <a href=\"http://procrastination.ca/\" title=\"\">Procrastination Research Group</a> and associate professor of psychology at Carleton University, Ottawa, says procrastination boils down to an \u201cemotion-focused coping response\u201d: by putting off the task, we get rid of the bad feeling. Start by simply identifying the first step: \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018What is the next action I would take on this task, if I was going to do it?\u2019\u201d And make it really tiny. The idea is to move your focus away from how you\u2019re feeling, and towards what Pychyl calls a \u201clow-threshold entry to action\u201d: \u201cWe can\u2019t deny our feelings, but we can pay less attention to them \u2026 and our research has shown that getting started is key.\u201d Evans suggests working on the task for 10 to 15 minutes and no more, just so as to have made a start.</p> <h2><strong>Picture your future self</strong></h2> <p>\u201cGiving yourself a hard time only makes it worse,\u201d says productivity expert <a href=\"https://www.thensomehow.com/\" title=\"\">Moyra Scott</a>. \u201cIn order to beat procrastination you have to realise that it is very common. We are human. We procrastinate.\u201d It can help to clarify or visualise what \u201cdone\u201d looks like, she says: \u201cWhat is the finish line you are aiming at?\u201d Hal E Hershfield, an associate professor of marketing and behavioural decision making at UCLA Anderson School of Management, pictures himself having to do a task today that he actually completed yesterday.\u201c That\u2019s most likely how I\u2019ll feel tomorrow if I push off something that I\u2019m meant to do today. The idea is to try to connect with the person I\u2019ll be in the future and the emotions that I will eventually feel.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Break the cycle</strong></h2> <p>Judson A Brewer, a neuroscientist and director of Research and Innovation at the <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/public-health/mindfulness/\" title=\"\">Mindfulness Centre</a> at Brown University, says procrastination has its origins in reward-based learning: a trigger (think about a deadline), a behaviour (scroll social media), then a reward (distract from the unpleasant thought). Willpower alone is often not enough to overcome such a powerful impulse, evolved to help us remember where to find food. But by making ourselves aware of our habit loops, says Brewer, we give ourselves the opportunity to break them. \u201c<a href=\"https://drjud.com/curiosity-superpower/\" title=\"\">Curiosity</a> is like a superpower that can help us notice these urges simply as thoughts, emotions and body sensations, and then move on to the task at hand.\u201d The reward can be reframed as the feeling of accomplishment, instead of the relief (tempered by guilt and building anxiety) of a momentary distraction. \u201cReflecting on the rewarding properties of not procrastinating builds healthy habits that become stronger than procrastination itself \u2013 hacking our brain in the process.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stop trying to fight the monkey</strong></h2> <p>Productivity coach <a href=\"http://www.grace-marshall.com/\" title=\"\">Grace Marshall</a> says one common misconception about productivity is that it is \u201cjust about nailing yourself to the seat, and getting it done\u201d. While that is sometimes effective (and, if a deadline is looming, necessary), it can be a stressful approach, she says \u2013 \u201cand as willpower is a depleting resource, it\u2019s not sustainable\u201d. Her suggestion is to stop trying to overpower or ignore the primitive part of our brain driving procrastination, and instead try to distract it. Tell yourself: \u201cI\u2019m not really going to work on this right now, I\u2019m just going to open the file and make some notes.\u201d Play \u2013 turning the task into a game or an experiment \u2013 can also be an effective diversion. As Marshall writes: \u201cFighting the monkey is exhausting, and it doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d</p>",

We procrastinate.\u201d It can help to clarify or visualise what \u201cdone\u201d looks like, she says: \u201cWhat is the finish line you are aiming at?\u201d Hal E Hershfield, an associate professor of marketing and behavioural decision making at UCLA Anderson School of Management, pictures himself having to do a task today that he actually completed yesterday.\u201c That\u2019s most likely how I\u2019ll feel tomorrow if I push off something that I\u2019m meant to do today. The idea is to try to connect with the person I\u2019ll be in the future and the emotions that I will eventually feel.\u201d Break the cycle Judson A Brewer, a neuroscientist and director of Research and Innovation at the Mindfulness Centre at Brown University, says procrastination has its origins in reward-based learning: a trigger (think about a deadline), a behaviour (scroll social media), then a reward (distract from the unpleasant thought). Willpower alone is often not enough to overcome such a powerful impulse, evolved to help us remember where to find food. But by making ourselves aware of our habit loops, says Brewer, we give ourselves the opportunity to break them. \u201cCuriosity is like a superpower that can help us notice these urges simply as thoughts, emotions and body sensations, and then move on to the task at hand.\u201d The reward can be reframed as the feeling of accomplishment, instead of the relief (tempered by guilt and building anxiety) of a momentary distraction. \u201cReflecting on the rewarding properties of not procrastinating builds healthy habits that become stronger than procrastination itself \u2013 hacking our brain in the process.\u201d Stop trying to fight the monkey Productivity coach Grace Marshall says one common misconception about productivity is that it is \u201cjust about nailing yourself to the seat, and getting it done\u201d. While that is sometimes effective (and, if a deadline is looming, necessary), it can be a stressful approach, she says \u2013 \u201cand as willpower is a depleting resource, it\u2019s not sustainable\u201d. Her suggestion is to stop trying to overpower or ignore the primitive part of our brain driving procrastination, and instead try to distract it. Tell yourself: \u201cI\u2019m not really going to work on this right now, I\u2019m just going to open the file and make some notes.\u201d Play \u2013 turning the task into a game or an experiment \u2013 can also be an effective diversion. As Marshall writes: \u201cFighting the monkey is exhausting, and it doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d",

That \u201cmap\u201d became this luminous curiosity, less a cartographic aid than a chapterless, hybrid text pulling together snippets of personal essay, some scientific, sociological and historical research, and healthy doses of humour. Crying may be universal but as Christle reveals, it can take many forms, parallel crying, \u201ccry-hustling\u201d, and \u201cwhite tears\u201d being but a few. A literary lachrymatory, both consoling and surprisingly uplifting.</p> <h2>Right After the Weather<br>Carol Anshaw <br></h2> <p><em>Fig Tree, \u00a314.99, 288pp</em></p> <p>Cate, a theatre set designer, has arrived in her early 40s with a career that\u2019s still merely promising and a heart worn out from a long affair with a woman who is never going to leave her live-in-lover. She\u2019s now intent on closing the chasm between who she is and who she wants to be, but when her lucky break comes, it coincides with violent calamity. Set in Chicago in 2016, Carol Anshaw\u2019s fifth novel is an exquisitely observed story of passion and friendship, dogs and decor. Expect droll conversation, poetic frissons (from the darkness of backstage on an opening night we hear \u201cthe satin shiver of coats being shed\u201d out front), and one of the most uncomfortable fine-dining dates you could wish to read about.</p> <h2>The Lost Properties of Love<br>Sophie Ratcliffe <br></h2> <p><em>William Collins, \u00a39.99, 304pp</em></p> <p>The first two pages of Sophie Ratcliffe\u2019s intricate, fiercely intelligent memoir punch with the might of an entire book, distilling its central loss \u2013 the death of her father when she was 13 years old \u2013 into a series of indelible impressions saturated in 80s pop culture. The narrative then lurches forward almost three decades, and Ratcliffe \u2013 now an Oxford academic and married mother of two \u2013 is on a train, obsessing about a much older ex-lover who is dying. This train journey frames the pages that follow, freeing Ratcliffe\u2019s mind to flit back and forth in time to understand her own messy, very human heart.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>To order<em> </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-crying-book-9781472154705.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Crying Book</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/right-after-the-weather-9780241392805.html\" title=\"\"><em>Right After the Weather</em></a><em> </em>or<em> </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-lost-properties-of-love-9780008225902.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Lost Properties of Love</em></a> go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a><em>. </em>Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Crying Book Heather Christle Corsair, \u00a314.99, 207pp While struggling with depression, mourning the death of a dear friend, and preparing for motherhood, award-winning poet Heather Christle found herself wondering what a map of every place in which she\u2019d ever cried would look like. That \u201cmap\u201d became this luminous curiosity, less a cartographic aid than a chapterless, hybrid text pulling together snippets of personal essay, some scientific, sociological and historical research, and healthy doses of humour. Crying may be universal but as Christle reveals, it can take many forms, parallel crying, \u201ccry-hustling\u201d, and \u201cwhite tears\u201d being but a few. A literary lachrymatory, both consoling and surprisingly uplifting. Right After the Weather Carol Anshaw Fig Tree, \u00a314.99, 288pp Cate, a theatre set designer, has arrived in her early 40s with a career that\u2019s still merely promising and a heart worn out from a long affair with a woman who is never going to leave her live-in-lover. She\u2019s now intent on closing the chasm between who she is and who she wants to be, but when her lucky break comes, it coincides with violent calamity. Set in Chicago in 2016, Carol Anshaw\u2019s fifth novel is an exquisitely observed story of passion and friendship, dogs and decor. Expect droll conversation, poetic frissons (from the darkness of backstage on an opening night we hear \u201cthe satin shiver of coats being shed\u201d out front), and one of the most uncomfortable fine-dining dates you could wish to read about. The Lost Properties of Love Sophie Ratcliffe William Collins, \u00a39.99, 304pp The first two pages of Sophie Ratcliffe\u2019s intricate, fiercely intelligent memoir punch with the might of an entire book, distilling its central loss \u2013 the death of her father when she was 13 years old \u2013 into a series of indelible impressions saturated in 80s pop culture. The narrative then lurches forward almost three decades, and Ratcliffe \u2013 now an Oxford academic and married mother of two \u2013 is on a train, obsessing about a much older ex-lover who is dying. This train journey frames the pages that follow, freeing Ratcliffe\u2019s mind to flit back and forth in time to understand her own messy, very human heart. \u2022 To order The Crying Book, Right After the Weather or The Lost Properties of Love go to guardianbookshop.com.

The consumer group Which? found that many suppliers are misleading eco-conscious customers by claiming to offer renewable energy tariffs without ever investing in renewable energy projects. Which? said that \u201cpale green\u201d suppliers are boasting green credentials by exploiting an industry loophole enabling them to buy cheap renewable energy certificates to match the electricity they supply to customers, while buying the power from another source. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said earlier this month that it was aware of growing concerns about greenwashing in the energy market and would take action to ensure consumers were not misled. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said: \u201cWith an increasing number of green tariffs in the market, it\u2019s important that consumers understand how \u2018green\u2019 their tariff is in terms of supporting the UK renewables industry.\u201d Green energy developers typically sell renewable certificates alongside their electricity supply deals so that buyers can prove the origins of their energy. But industry rules mean the initial buyer is free to sell the certificates, without selling the green energy, to a second buyer. \u201cThere are lots of suppliers running around, slapping a bit of green paint on their logo and trading bits of paper to claim they\u2019re green. But buying and selling certificates doesn\u2019t help tackle climate change \u2013 building wind farms and solar projects is what we need to do,\u201d Anderson added. Scottish Power sold off all its fossil fuel projects in 2018 to focus on growing its stable of onshore and offshore wind farms, and developing a portfolio of solar power projects. Anderson said the company would reinvest money made from the green tariffs in a new renewable generation, \u201cmeaning the more people who take up the tariff, the more investment in green energy there will be\u201d. He added: \u201cAs the UK\u2019s only end-to-end energy provider, we\u2019re unique in being able to make this commitment. From today, anyone who signs up for our electricity on a fixed-price tariff can be confident that they are buying electricity from truly green sources.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 February 2020 to remove a reference to small green energy companies being able to supply customers with electricity sourced exclusively from their own wind and solar farms.",

He said it was normal in negotiations for each side to protect their interests. Britain formally left the EU two weeks ago but still trades as a full member during the one-year transition period. The remaining 27 EU states are drawing up their mandate for the talks on the future relationship, and France, determined to bring about greater European Union integration, is likely to be leading calls for a tough stance on issues such as financial services and fishing.

She said absolute transparency about the commission\u2019s objectives had been critical to retaining that unity, and said the same would happen in the second round of talks. Le Drian\u2019s remarks were made in the context of his appeal as a former defence minister for continued British co-operation on security and defence issues with Europe after Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Dozens of previously unpublished Andy Warhol drawings on the theme of love, sex and desire are to be seen for the first time. The pop artist\u2019s foundation is releasing a major study of his depictions of young men in private moments, whether in a loving embrace or more explicit acts. They date from the 1950s, when Warhol was a successful commercial illustrator but struggling to find recognition as a fine artist, long before he created paintings and prints of movie stars, soup cans and soap-pad boxes that turned him into one of the world\u2019s most famous artists. When he tried to exhibit his drawings in 1950s New York, Warhol encountered homophobic rejection from gallery owners, the latest research reveals. Michael Dayton Hermann, of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, said he had been \u201cmesmerised\u201d by images that are a precursor to the obsessive way in which Warhol was later to capture people and moments with his Polaroid and 35mm cameras. He added that they showed an \u201cemotional vulnerability in a way that a camera just doesn\u2019t\u201d and that \u201ca lot of times you don\u2019t see in Warhol\u2019s work\u201d. He observed that Warhol declared that he wanted to be a machine and created works which were machine-like: \u201cWhen you have a drawing of someone, the artist\u2019s hand is there. There isn\u2019t a barrier between the artist and the subject \u2026 It\u2019s a much more personal and intimate way to capture someone and it tells you a lot about the artist as much as the subject.\u201d Hermann\u2019s forthcoming book, Andy Warhol: Early Drawings of Love, Sex and Desire, will be published by Taschen this summer. It will include hundreds of drawings, of which \u201ca good portion have previously not been seen\u201d, Hermann said. \u201cThis is the first time that one monograph has been dedicated to comprehensively illustrating and reproducing these works.\u201d About 20 of the drawings will also feature in a forthcoming Warhol retrospective at Tate Modern in London, which opens in March. Research for the book included interviews with artists and others who recalled Warhol\u2019s rejection by galleries in the 1950s when he tried to show these drawings. None of them could have imagined that, in 2013 his celebrated 1963 work Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) would sell for $105m (\u00a365m).

      "body": "<p>If your aim for 2020 was to learn a new skill, you may be at the point of giving up. Whether you are mastering a new language or a musical instrument, or taking a career-changing course, initial enthusiasm can only take you so far, and any further progress can be disappointingly slow.</p> <p>From these struggles, you might assume that you simply lack a natural gift \u2013 compared to those lucky people who can learn any new skill with apparent ease.</p> <p>However, it needn\u2019t be this way. Many polymaths \u2013 including Charles Darwin and the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman \u2013 claimed not to have exceptional natural intelligence. Most of us have more than enough brainpower to master a new discipline, if we apply it correctly \u2013 and the latest neuroscience offers many strategies to do just that.</p> <p>Much research in the field hinges on the idea of <a href=\"https://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/04/EBjork_RBjork_2011.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201cdesirable difficulties\u201d</a>, pioneered by Profs Robert and Elizabeth Bjork at the University of California, Los Angeles. The aim is to deliberately create a slight feeling of frustration as you learn, which leads the brain to process the material more deeply, creating longer-lasting memories. It\u2019s like physical exercise: you need to feel a bit of resistance to make significant long-term gains.</p> <p>Unfortunately, many of our preferred learning techniques \u2013 such as reading and highlighting textbooks, or the drawing of colourful \u201cmind maps\u201d to summarise material \u2013 don\u2019t offer enough mental challenge to make the information stick, leading to disappointing results. \u201cOur judgment about our learning is often biased towards strategies that feel easy and effortless,\u201d says Dr Carolina Kuepper-Tetzel, a psychologist at the University of Glasgow and member of the <a href=\"https://www.learningscientists.org/\" title=\"\">Learning Scientists</a> website. \u201cBut they don\u2019t translate into long-term retention of knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>The following strategies will help you overcome these bad habits.

      "bodyText": "If your aim for 2020 was to learn a new skill, you may be at the point of giving up. Whether you are mastering a new language or a musical instrument, or taking a career-changing course, initial enthusiasm can only take you so far, and any further progress can be disappointingly slow. From these struggles, you might assume that you simply lack a natural gift \u2013 compared to those lucky people who can learn any new skill with apparent ease. However, it needn\u2019t be this way. Many polymaths \u2013 including Charles Darwin and the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman \u2013 claimed not to have exceptional natural intelligence. Most of us have more than enough brainpower to master a new discipline, if we apply it correctly \u2013 and the latest neuroscience offers many strategies to do just that. Much research in the field hinges on the idea of \u201cdesirable difficulties\u201d, pioneered by Profs Robert and Elizabeth Bjork at the University of California, Los Angeles. The aim is to deliberately create a slight feeling of frustration as you learn, which leads the brain to process the material more deeply, creating longer-lasting memories. It\u2019s like physical exercise: you need to feel a bit of resistance to make significant long-term gains. Unfortunately, many of our preferred learning techniques \u2013 such as reading and highlighting textbooks, or the drawing of colourful \u201cmind maps\u201d to summarise material \u2013 don\u2019t offer enough mental challenge to make the information stick, leading to disappointing results. \u201cOur judgment about our learning is often biased towards strategies that feel easy and effortless,\u201d says Dr Carolina Kuepper-Tetzel, a psychologist at the University of Glasgow and member of the Learning Scientists website. \u201cBut they don\u2019t translate into long-term retention of knowledge.\u201d The following strategies will help you overcome these bad habits. Whatever you plan to learn, they will make your memory the envy of others. Fail productively Let\u2019s begin with the pre-test \u2013 a strategy that is perhaps best explained with an example. How do you say \u201cthank you\u201d in Finnish? The answer is \u201ckiitos\u201d \u2013 and I\u2019m guessing that most readers who aren\u2019t Finnish won\u2019t have had any hope of answering this correctly. But thanks to that initial struggle, you will now be more likely to remember the answer in the future. Psychological studies show that a \u201cpre-test\u201d quiz \u2013 taken before you have studied the material \u2013 primes the brain to absorb the information afterwards, even if you failed to answer a single question correctly. This is true for both the memorisation of simple trivia and the deeper understanding of more complicated material. In one study, participants were quizzed on the neuroscience of vision before reading an Oliver Sacks essay on the subject. They ended up learning 10 to 15% more than students who had instead been given extra time to read the text. Whatever you are learning, try to gauge your current understanding of the topic \u2013 even if it is nonexistent. Teach it to someone else After taking the pre-test, you also want to continue quizzing yourself on what you\u2019ve just learned. To psychologists, this is called \u201cretrieval practice\u201d and it is one of the most reliable ways of building stronger memory traces.

As Dr Kuepper-Tetzel explains: \u201cTesting is usually seen as a way to assess knowledge.

      "body": "<p>The fictional worlds of <a href=\"https://www.mennavanpraag.com/\" title=\"\">Menna van Praag</a> have often whispered with voices of the fantastic. Her first novel, <em>The House at the End of Hope Street</em> (2013), is the story of a woman who finds sustenance from a building whose former inhabitants include Dorothy Parker, Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie.

      "bodyText": "The fictional worlds of Menna van Praag have often whispered with voices of the fantastic. Her first novel, The House at the End of Hope Street (2013), is the story of a woman who finds sustenance from a building whose former inhabitants include Dorothy Parker, Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie. In The Witches of Cambridge (2016), Van Praag\u2019s protagonist is able to intuit the silent aspirations of those around her. Her latest novel confronts these elements of metaphysical apprehension in a more concerted way. The Sisters Grimm follows the fortunes of a quartet of half-sisters \u2013 Goldie, Bea, Scarlet and Liyana \u2013 who have never met, other than in their childhood dreams of visiting a land named Everwhere. None of the sisters \u2013 all living in Cambridge, where they are approaching their 18th birthdays \u2013 has a firm recollection of the elemental powers they possessed in their childhood reveries. And none has a clear awareness of their demonic shared father, Wilhelm Grimm, whose army of soldiers now seek their death. As his forces close in on the four girls, the supernatural gifts of their youthful dreams \u2013 inflicting injury in sublunary life by the power of thought \u2013 re-emerge. Into the mix is stirred Leo, another of Grimm\u2019s soldiers and a fallen star in the guise of a human. Unfortunately Leo finds his homicidal resolve compromised when he falls in love with the prime target of his hunt, Goldie. The story now turns on Leo\u2019s attempts to accommodate this dilemma and the conflicting desires that Goldie, Bea, Scarlet and Liyana each feel for a global environment of benevolence or pain.

      "bodyText": "A young and highly vulnerable British sex trafficking victim was re-trafficked by county lines drug gangs on multiple occasions after the Home Office repeatedly refused to fulfil its legal obligation to provide her with safe accommodation. A high court judge was forced to intervene to compel the Home Office to house the woman, who was about to become street homeless. The 22-year-old has a history of sexual and drug abuse and exploitation and grew up in the care system; she was allegedly sexually abused while in foster care. She has complex physical and mental health issues and has attempted suicide on multiple occasions. As a teenager she fell under the control of county lines gangs who advertised her for sex on escort websites and used her as a drugs mule. She was also forced to commit petty crimes and her social media account was used to advertise sexual services. In June 2019, she was identified as a potential victim of trafficking by the Home Office. At this point she should have been provided with safe accommodation and mental health support, yet the Home Office failed to find her somewhere safe to stay. Shortly after this she was re-trafficked by criminal gangs and was again forced into prostitution in various locations in London.

Yet despite repeated appeals, she was left at the hospital for a further two months. On 2 January this year, the Home Office replied to the hospital, saying the woman\u2019s complex mental health needs made her a danger to herself and others and that there were no appropriate safe-house places available. Hours before she was due to be discharged on to the street, a high court judge forced the Home Office to act, and 24-hour support was found. \u201cThe failure to provide our client with the specialist support and accommodation to which she was legally entitled has had devastating consequences, including her having been repeatedly re-trafficked, sexually assaulted and financially exploited,\u201d said Rachael Davis, a solicitor at Duncan Lewis. \u201cOur client was recognised as a victim of modern slavery as long ago as June 2019, yet she was not provided with a safe place to live until January 2020 \u2013 and only once we had obtained a court order compelling the secretary of state for the home department to do so. \u201cIt is wholly unacceptable to refuse to provide specialist support and accommodation to a victim of modern slavery because their needs are too complex.

      "body": "<p>Amid the many hellish images and stories that have emerged from Australia\u2019s apocalyptic wildfire season, the fate of the country\u2019s wine business will have come some way down the list of most observers\u2019 concerns.</p> <p>That\u2019s only as it should be. When we are talking about the loss of human and animal life and habitats \u2013 when we are seemingly witnessing extreme predictions for a distant post-climate emergency future happening right now \u2013 fretting about the viability of a branch of the booze business can seem trivial.</p> <p>As the country counts the costs of the conflagration, however, concerns about the long-term viability of what has become one of its most significant exports have come into focus. According to Wine Australia, about 1% (or 1,500 hectares) of vines were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/23/sa-fires-adelaide-hills-wine-industry-devastated-as-bushfires-sweep-through\" title=\"\">in the heart of the fire-affected zones</a>, with the worst-hit region being the Adelaide Hills. That\u2019s the site of some of Australia\u2019s most exciting cooler-climate wines, and it lost as much as 30% of its vineyards, including Henschke\u2019s renowned Lenswood vineyard, and land and buildings belonging to the cult star producer, Vinteloper.</p> <p>Similar soul-searching has been taking place in California, where October\u2019s Kincade fire <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-03/la-me-kincade-fire-wine-country-disaster\" title=\"\">burned through</a><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-03/la-me-kincade-fire-wine-country-disaster\" title=\"\"> Sonoma County</a>, the latest in a series of increasingly devastating wildfires to engulf California wine country. In the past two years, we\u2019ve also seen prime vineyard land in Chile, South Africa, the south of France, Portugal, Spain and Greece go up in flames with more intensity and regularity than before.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the expensive loss of vines and infrastructure. There are after-effects stored in any grapes that might be salvaged at vintage time, even on vines that were some distance from the frontline. Once they\u2019ve been through the veraison process (when the grapes change colour), the closer the grapes are to being ready for harvest the more they are prone to \u201csmoke taint\u201d, with the absorption of smoke particles leading to flavours akin to a chemical fire in the finished wine.</p> <p>This problem has been the subject of considerable research in Australia and California \u2013 although so far, it seems, the only action available is to ameliorate rather than eliminate the aromas. By allowing less contact between juice and skins, by fining and filtering, and by adding distracting flavours such as oak and tannins, you can produce a wine where the effect of the smoke taint is dialled down.</p> <p>None of those options are attractive for winemakers, and many simply take the expensive decision to dump the crop.

      "bodyText": "Amid the many hellish images and stories that have emerged from Australia\u2019s apocalyptic wildfire season, the fate of the country\u2019s wine business will have come some way down the list of most observers\u2019 concerns. That\u2019s only as it should be. When we are talking about the loss of human and animal life and habitats \u2013 when we are seemingly witnessing extreme predictions for a distant post-climate emergency future happening right now \u2013 fretting about the viability of a branch of the booze business can seem trivial. As the country counts the costs of the conflagration, however, concerns about the long-term viability of what has become one of its most significant exports have come into focus. According to Wine Australia, about 1% (or 1,500 hectares) of vines were in the heart of the fire-affected zones, with the worst-hit region being the Adelaide Hills. That\u2019s the site of some of Australia\u2019s most exciting cooler-climate wines, and it lost as much as 30% of its vineyards, including Henschke\u2019s renowned Lenswood vineyard, and land and buildings belonging to the cult star producer, Vinteloper. Similar soul-searching has been taking place in California, where October\u2019s Kincade fire burned through Sonoma County, the latest in a series of increasingly devastating wildfires to engulf California wine country. In the past two years, we\u2019ve also seen prime vineyard land in Chile, South Africa, the south of France, Portugal, Spain and Greece go up in flames with more intensity and regularity than before. It\u2019s not just the expensive loss of vines and infrastructure. There are after-effects stored in any grapes that might be salvaged at vintage time, even on vines that were some distance from the frontline. Once they\u2019ve been through the veraison process (when the grapes change colour), the closer the grapes are to being ready for harvest the more they are prone to \u201csmoke taint\u201d, with the absorption of smoke particles leading to flavours akin to a chemical fire in the finished wine. This problem has been the subject of considerable research in Australia and California \u2013 although so far, it seems, the only action available is to ameliorate rather than eliminate the aromas. By allowing less contact between juice and skins, by fining and filtering, and by adding distracting flavours such as oak and tannins, you can produce a wine where the effect of the smoke taint is dialled down. None of those options are attractive for winemakers, and many simply take the expensive decision to dump the crop. No wonder they are weighing up whether wildfires have gone beyond occupational hazard to become a threat to their viability. For now, smoke-tainted wines are relatively rare. And, as with many symptoms of the climate emergency, there\u2019s still just about time to act rather than merely accepting that burnt has to be the taste of the new normal. Support the wine makers by trying these\u2026 Henschke Giles Pinot Noir Adelaide Hills, Australia 2017 (from \u00a331.80 vinvm.co.uk; ozwines.co.uk) The Henschkes are best known for superlative shiraz from the Eden Valley, but, before it was badly damaged in the 2019 bushfires, their Lenswood vineyard had earned a reputation for luxuriously silky, bright red berry-fruited pinot noir. Vinteloper If Life Gives You Lagrein Langhorne Creek, Australia 2017 (from \u00a314.80, fieldandfawcett.co.uk; thewhiskyexchange.com) Vinteloper\u2019s David Bowley had his entire 30-hectare Adelaide Hills property destroyed by bushfire. Buying a bottle of this thirst-quenchingly tangy red from a plot of the north Italian variety lagrein in Langhorne Creek is a great way to help him stay in business. Casa de Mouraz Branco D\u00e3o, Portugal 2017 (\u00a317, highburyvintners.co.uk) The team at Casa de Mouraz, one of the best producers in central Portugal\u2019s D\u00e3o region, had only just harvested the grapes for this typically luminous, textured, pithy dry white before wildfire swept through its vineyards and winery in October 2017.

The review by London\u2019s victims\u2019 commissioner, Claire Waxman, comes amid precipitous falls in the number of rape prosecutions nationally and fears that intrusive methods are deterring complainants from reporting attacks or pursuing cases. Waxman coordinated the groundbreaking London rape review last year which found that only 3% of rape allegations in the capital resulted in convictions. Civil liberty organisations have said police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) requests to download the contents of victims\u2019 mobile phones amount to a \u201cdigital strip search\u201d and are unlawful. Women\u2019s organisations also complain that officers frequently demand victims\u2019 phones even where the reported assault involves someone who was a stranger. Police and the CPS deny that complainants are asked to hand over their phones when it is inappropriate but acknowledge that the explosion in the quantity of digital evidence is complicating investigations at a time of cuts to their resources. They have also said victims of rape and serious sexual assault who refuse to give police access to their mobile phone contents may allow suspects to avoid charges. Waxman\u2019s investigation is timely and will provide detailed evidence to inform one of the most contentious areas of public debate over rape and the underfunded criminal justice system.

Two months later, when the first video (of Karim briefly describing the elephant enclosure at the San Diego Zoo) was uploaded, a platform was launched that has gone on to change the world.</p> <p>Today, more than 2bn of us visit YouTube monthly, and 500 hours of footage is uploaded every minute. That\u2019s a far cry from the 18-second video that started it all. Its stars are multi-millionaires: YouTube\u2019s highest earner in 2019 was an eight-year-old called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/20/youtube-highest-earner-eight-year-old-guan-ryans-world\" title=\"\">Ryan</a>, who netted $26m. The number of creators earning five or six figures has increased by more than 40% year on year. At first, users earned a few hundred pounds for mentioning products in their videos; now they can make hundreds of thousands, and much more through exclusive brand deals. Not many like talking about their income: it makes them less relatable.</p> <p>The scale of viewership has increased, too. It took eight years for the site to get to 1bn monthly users, and another seven to reach 2bn. There are 65% more channels with more than 1m subscribers than a year ago; the number of channels with more than 1bn views grew five times in the past three years.</p> <p>As more money and more eyeballs have entered the frame, the level of competition has increased. What was once a site for hobbyists has turned into a mini-Hollywood, with huge teams of staff churning out content for demanding fans.</p> <p>As the website celebrates its 15-year anniversary, five of its significant early stars explain how their relationship with the site has evolved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6efeea7c212dc90c0c6bb5fb83237f4edce552e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6efeea7c212dc90c0c6bb5fb83237f4edce552e1/0_133_1125_1405/801.jpg\" alt=\"Olga Kay\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Olga Kay, 37</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I created a character a lot of girls could relate to\u2019</strong></p> <p>A friend uploaded some videos on to YouTube in 2006, and he asked me to make an account so I could support him. The site was only a year old then, and I didn\u2019t understand the concept. I used to think it was called \u201cU2.com\u201d \u2013 I couldn\u2019t understand why a band would have a website that hosted videos. Finally, someone spelled it out for me, so I logged in and created an account. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/olgakay\" title=\"\">OlgaKay</a>\u201d was the password to my bank account at the time, so I used that. It was the first thing that came to mind.</p> <p>I was mesmerised by these people talking to the camera. I\u2019d never seen that before. I was so inside their world. I remember thinking: I have a personality I could share, maybe I could do this. Maybe I could do it better\u2026</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hITFoHYJUg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8hITFoHYJUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The problem was that back then I didn\u2019t know how to create content. My background was in the circus. I was a juggler, somewhat familiar with live performances, but I didn\u2019t know how to be on camera. It was a huge learning curve, trying to figure out what this whole thing was about, and building a career. I created this character of an emo girl who hated everything about her life. I played that character, then I played myself as her roommate. One character was positive, one was negative. I think a lot of young girls could relate to that.</p> <p>By 2014 I had 1m subscribers and<strong> </strong>was producing 23 videos a week. My main channel was scripted content, highly produced. The second channel was a daily documentary, to which I uploaded at least five videos a week, and then I had a fashion and beauty channel (three videos a week) and a gaming channel (14 videos a week). I covered all the bases and all the genres on YouTube, but I was making so many videos that I was burned out. I realised that to continue to be successful on YouTube I had to keep pumping out content. I felt like my creativity was slipping away. I pictured myself running a production company, creating more and more content, trying to stay relevant among teenagers. I thought: I don\u2019t want to be a 40-year-old woman still making content. I didn\u2019t want to be someone who has to wake up every morning and put makeup on to go in front of the camera.</p> <p>In 2016, I stepped away and took a long hiatus, during which time my audience disappeared. I wasn\u2019t uploading regularly enough. In that time I read a lot of books. I read <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-success-principles-9780007195084.html\" title=\"\">The Success Principles</a></em> by Jack Canfield four times, which rewired my brain.</p> <p>I woke up one day thinking, \u201cI am an entrepreneur, I want to create a business.\u201d That business became <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC90lcCeyjOhvMfMafn151LA\" title=\"\">Moosh </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC90lcCeyjOhvMfMafn151LA\" title=\"\">Walks</a>: knee-high socks with ears. That same year I opened a pop-up shop in Los Angeles, where I live, to see how my product performed outside my fanbase. Now we\u2019re in 130 stores across America, and we\u2019re on Amazon, and we\u2019re growing. YouTube gave me this. It gave me knowledge and experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4de3008f9ed2ce4d6896e458d2c3a79ea926af2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4de3008f9ed2ce4d6896e458d2c3a79ea926af2b/1024_0_1622_2027/800.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie McDonnell\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Charlie McDonnell, 29</h2> <p><strong>\u2018My first film was 6 minutes long. It was just a rambly mess\u2019</strong></p> <p>I got on to YouTube in 2007 by procrastinating. This was when nobody was making any real money from YouTube. It hadn\u2019t started its partnership programme. I started my own channel because I wanted to make a short film with a friend, a parody of one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda\" title=\"\">Legend of Zelda</a> games. We never actually made it, but we made a bad trailer for it \u2013 Windows Movie Maker titles, copy- righted music. Then I set up a series called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEB92E275F78C7301\" title=\"\">Fun Science </a>and tried to answer questions about the world.</p> <p>After I launched the channel, I found other video bloggers and realised that this was a thing people were doing. The webcam I had then cost \u00a315, and the videos were awful quality. The first video blog I made was six minutes long, which at the time was a silly length. You\u2019d never make one that long now. It was just a rambly mess.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTuzmFM9Ru0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LTuzmFM9Ru0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When I started, I think [sketch comedy channel] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/smosh\" title=\"\">Smosh</a> was the site\u2019s most subscribed-to channel, with maybe 100,000 subscribers. So it feels weird to hear that so many kids these days see becoming a YouTuber as one of their main career aspirations. That didn\u2019t exist back in 2007.<strong> </strong>People saw it as a hobby. That\u2019s been one of the major, weirder shifts.</p> <p>In 2017 I moved to Canada with my girlfriend. I was ready to leave the UK. There\u2019s that phrase: if you\u2019re sick of London, you\u2019re sick of life. I was honestly sick of London. I\u2019d kind of stopped video blogging by that point, even though I had millions of subscribers. I\u2019d already burned out once before, in 2013, and then found it hard to upload a new video every week. I realised I felt much happier not being on camera, and I felt increasingly as if I was putting on a mask and being somebody else. Viewers equated my digital presence with my real-life one. That\u2019s one of the things I know about myself now: I find it much more creatively fulfilling to be working behind the scenes.</p> <p>Around the time I moved to Toronto, I began working with New Form, a production company that works with video bloggers who are interested in filmmaking. A show I made was picked up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeffrey-katzenberg\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Katzenberg</a>, a Hollywood bigwig, who has no idea who I am in terms of my YouTube career. (It stars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/don-cheadle\" title=\"\">Don Cheadle</a>, and will be out next year.)</p> <p>I have a few different feature scripts I\u2019m working on, ideas for TV pilots. I\u2019m working the filmmaker grind. I haven\u2019t ruled out coming back to YouTube entirely, but I think if I ever do come back, I want it to be what it used to be \u2013 more of a hobby, a creative outlet. I\u2019d have a proper job elsewhere. I definitely used to see YouTube as my proper job. I had 2m subscribers! But I guess it isn\u2019t for me any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd89418b09ad4a3111b5d50b692c9f72648666eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd89418b09ad4a3111b5d50b692c9f72648666eb/247_175_1672_2090/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sapphire\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Sapphire, 17</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Without YouTube I wouldn\u2019t be making my own music\u2019</strong></p> <p>I started on YouTube 10 years ago, when I was seven. All I did back then was sing \u2013 my dream at the time was to become the next Adele \u2013 but I never really had a platform. My mum suggested doing YouTube. It was only a few years old at that point, and I was over-the-moon excited about it. I drew pictures of what I would look like on screen.</p> <p>I did my first video and just got hooked, and then did it again and again and again. Here we are, 350 videos later. When I filmed that first video, I was really nervous. I thought that if I wore the same outfit out in the street people would recognise me instantly, even though I had, like, three subscribers. I got more than 100 views on that first video in a week, and it just went up from there. I had my first viral video three videos later, a cover of Hallelujah. It grew and grew.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2M8oqGs-cw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G2M8oqGs-cw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It started turning serious when I was nine. We went from using an old Canon camcorder to a proper, professional camera, and we\u2019ve upgraded again to a completely new one, though it\u2019s still a family production. My videos go out on a Friday. On Monday I\u2019ll pick a track, one with the most views at that moment, or a classic song everybody knows. Then we\u2019ll get a track made \u2013 it will take me a few hours to record \u2013 and every Wednesday we film a video. That will either be a whole day or half a day. Then we\u2019ll edit it the next day and it\u2019s straight out for Friday. Sometimes we\u2019ll do full production videos with dancers and all sorts. They\u2019re big, two-day shoots.</p> <p>I\u2019m not interested in being a superstar or whatever. I just like making music and content, and making people happy. But we\u2019ve done so much. I got to perform at Wembley Arena when I was about 11. That was definitely one of my favourite moments: getting to walk out on the stage and say \u201cHello, Wembley!\u201d In Germany I performed in front of 17,000 people, which was insane.</p> <p>YouTube\u2019s helped me get to the point where I can write and produce my own music and release it to the public. That\u2019s just the best feeling in the world. Without YouTube I never would have got to that point, never would have had those opportunities. Without it I\u2019d be nothing right now. I can\u2019t imagine a life without YouTube. It has its ups and downs, when there\u2019s too much going on, when you\u2019re juggling school and your digital presence, and you have to try to fit everything in. But at the end of the day it\u2019s all moving me towards this one goal \u2013 to one day tour the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"39f6c16f99f853c52282f13c67b45cdb7fe99ae7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39f6c16f99f853c52282f13c67b45cdb7fe99ae7/102_0_681_850/401.jpg\" alt=\"Manny Brown\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Emmanuel \u201cManny\u201d Brown, 23</h2> <p><strong>\u2018It was embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online\u2019</strong></p> <p>When I was younger, it was a cool thing to record and capture the video games you were playing. I remember asking my mum for an HD PVR, which captured game console footage and uploaded it to the internet. It was \u00a3175 back then \u2013 a lot of money \u2013 but she said yes. My brother Tobi [YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/TBJZL\" title=\"\">Tobjizzle</a>] ended up taking it first and recording stuff. He knew more about it. I joined about a year later, in 2013. I was 17.</p> <p>I thought it would be easy, but I quickly learned it was a grind. You had to get your own content out, have your own ideas, develop your own personality. When I was on 2,500 subscribers I was walking through school and a kid said to me: \u201cAren\u2019t you Manny from YouTube?\u201d That shook me. It was almost embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online, especially in sixth form. I don\u2019t know when I realised I was popular.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FitfNwWRPFk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FitfNwWRPFk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When I had 7,500 subscribers I made around \u00a310 per video from Fifa sponsorships. But in August 2015 I started getting more views and more brand deals. I remember [fellow YouTuber] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/miniminter\" title=\"\">Miniminter</a> saying to me: \u201cIn six months you\u2019ll be earning a lot.\u201d I never thought of it that way, but he was more experienced, and knew the levels I could get to.</p> <p>I dropped out of an accounting and finance course at university when I got to 60,000 subscribers. The accounting and finance skills would come in useful now, but I didn\u2019t stay long enough \u2013 balancing uni and YouTube was difficult. Within a month of dropping out I hit 100,000 subscribers, and from there it grew rapidly \u2013 30,000 new subscribers a month. Now I have 1.7m.</p> <p>At the start of every year I ask: can I do this for another 12 months? Most years, the answer is no. It\u2019s getting tough \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to keep up the consistency. At times I\u2019ve stopped posting every day, and sometimes I fall out of love with it. But my videos are seen by 250,000 people a day. I\u2019m back to my most consistent now, almost doing daily uploads. My last 50 videos have been posted in the last 57 days. It can be draining, but I\u2019m trying to find a balance.</p> <p>YouTube has changed in many ways. There\u2019s a lot of things I do now that get half the number of the views it would have got when I started. It was a lot easier to get views with less back then. Now, it\u2019s all about the titles and the thumbnails and making sure everything\u2019s clickable. If it\u2019s not clickable, it won\u2019t get the views. You don\u2019t need to make good content to get views on YouTube these days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c3ff8dcd0ef5bfa7251ba62cd8045e2e8d4b41fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3ff8dcd0ef5bfa7251ba62cd8045e2e8d4b41fe/1319_394_2814_3517/800.jpg\" alt=\"Caspar Lee\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Caspar Lee, 25</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I decided to help others who were doing their own videos\u2019</strong></p> <p>I started in a small town called Knysna, in South Africa. It was 2010 and I was 16. I did it because I wanted to impress the other kids at school; I thought it would be cool for them to watch videos I\u2019d made. But it had the opposite effect \u2013 everyone thought it was lame. For two years I was <em>that weird YouTube kid</em>, creating weird videos about my life.</p> <p>In 2012, my final year of school, I\u2019d earned enough to become a full-time YouTuber and move to London. The goal wasn\u2019t to stay there for very long \u2013 it was just to work with other creators and build an audience. But it eventually evolved into the place I spend most of my time. Now I\u2019ve got 7m subscribers. People watch me do challenges: bleach my hair, or live in my car. If you\u2019d asked me when I started, I wouldn\u2019t have thought that many people would even be using YouTube. A big channel used to have 1m subscribers. Now they have 100m.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QodKk0NQFCQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QodKk0NQFCQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s always a natural insecurity when it comes to doing well in something. You ask yourself: how long can this last? So a way of protecting myself was to diversify away from just making my own content. As someone with experience on the platform, I decided to help other creators who were beginning to monetise their videos. I set up a company called Influencer with a guy called Ben Jeffries.</p> <p>A girl I went on a Tinder date with introduced me to Ben \u2013 so I guess you could say we were a Tinder success story. We started Influencer with the goal of providing creators with another form of income \u2013 it allows people to earn money from product mentions in their content. We have more than 7,000 creators on our platform.</p> <p>I also set up a talent management company called <a href=\"https://www.margravinemanagement.com/\" title=\"\">Margravine Management</a>, with Joe Sugg, my business partner and good friend, and the <a href=\"https://creativeinvestmentclub.com/\" title=\"\">Creative Investment Club</a>, which invests in startups alongside some of the best venture capitalists in the UK. (I know a lot of creators who want to invest in startups.)</p> <p>I\u2019m not the chief executive of all these companies. I find someone who can fulfil that role who is really good \u2013 and then I go into business with them. It\u2019s similar to the early days of YouTube \u2013 you meet people and find a way to collaborate.</p> <p>I still consider myself as more of a creator. But in terms of how I spend my time, it\u2019s three days a week on the business stuff, two days on YouTube. I really want to find a way to combine the two. My content hasn\u2019t really been so much about the business side of my life. But I\u2019d love to be able to speak more about it with my audience \u2013 and develop a new audience interested in becoming entrepreneurs or starting a company.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 21 February 2020 to remove some personal information.<br></p></li> </ul>",

Two months later, when the first video (of Karim briefly describing the elephant enclosure at the San Diego Zoo) was uploaded, a platform was launched that has gone on to change the world. Today, more than 2bn of us visit YouTube monthly, and 500 hours of footage is uploaded every minute. That\u2019s a far cry from the 18-second video that started it all. Its stars are multi-millionaires: YouTube\u2019s highest earner in 2019 was an eight-year-old called Ryan, who netted $26m. The number of creators earning five or six figures has increased by more than 40% year on year. At first, users earned a few hundred pounds for mentioning products in their videos; now they can make hundreds of thousands, and much more through exclusive brand deals. Not many like talking about their income: it makes them less relatable. The scale of viewership has increased, too. It took eight years for the site to get to 1bn monthly users, and another seven to reach 2bn. There are 65% more channels with more than 1m subscribers than a year ago; the number of channels with more than 1bn views grew five times in the past three years. As more money and more eyeballs have entered the frame, the level of competition has increased. What was once a site for hobbyists has turned into a mini-Hollywood, with huge teams of staff churning out content for demanding fans. As the website celebrates its 15-year anniversary, five of its significant early stars explain how their relationship with the site has evolved. Olga Kay, 37 \u2018I created a character a lot of girls could relate to\u2019 A friend uploaded some videos on to YouTube in 2006, and he asked me to make an account so I could support him. The site was only a year old then, and I didn\u2019t understand the concept. I used to think it was called \u201cU2.com\u201d \u2013 I couldn\u2019t understand why a band would have a website that hosted videos. Finally, someone spelled it out for me, so I logged in and created an account. \u201cOlgaKay\u201d was the password to my bank account at the time, so I used that. It was the first thing that came to mind. I was mesmerised by these people talking to the camera. I\u2019d never seen that before. I was so inside their world. I remember thinking: I have a personality I could share, maybe I could do this. Maybe I could do it better\u2026 The problem was that back then I didn\u2019t know how to create content. My background was in the circus. I was a juggler, somewhat familiar with live performances, but I didn\u2019t know how to be on camera. It was a huge learning curve, trying to figure out what this whole thing was about, and building a career. I created this character of an emo girl who hated everything about her life. I played that character, then I played myself as her roommate. One character was positive, one was negative. I think a lot of young girls could relate to that. By 2014 I had 1m subscribers and was producing 23 videos a week. My main channel was scripted content, highly produced. The second channel was a daily documentary, to which I uploaded at least five videos a week, and then I had a fashion and beauty channel (three videos a week) and a gaming channel (14 videos a week). I covered all the bases and all the genres on YouTube, but I was making so many videos that I was burned out. I realised that to continue to be successful on YouTube I had to keep pumping out content. I felt like my creativity was slipping away. I pictured myself running a production company, creating more and more content, trying to stay relevant among teenagers. I thought: I don\u2019t want to be a 40-year-old woman still making content. I didn\u2019t want to be someone who has to wake up every morning and put makeup on to go in front of the camera. In 2016, I stepped away and took a long hiatus, during which time my audience disappeared. I wasn\u2019t uploading regularly enough. In that time I read a lot of books. I read The Success Principles by Jack Canfield four times, which rewired my brain. I woke up one day thinking, \u201cI am an entrepreneur, I want to create a business.\u201d That business became Moosh Walks: knee-high socks with ears. That same year I opened a pop-up shop in Los Angeles, where I live, to see how my product performed outside my fanbase. Now we\u2019re in 130 stores across America, and we\u2019re on Amazon, and we\u2019re growing. YouTube gave me this. It gave me knowledge and experience. Charlie McDonnell, 29 \u2018My first film was 6 minutes long. It was just a rambly mess\u2019 I got on to YouTube in 2007 by procrastinating. This was when nobody was making any real money from YouTube. It hadn\u2019t started its partnership programme. I started my own channel because I wanted to make a short film with a friend, a parody of one of the Legend of Zelda games. We never actually made it, but we made a bad trailer for it \u2013 Windows Movie Maker titles, copy- righted music. Then I set up a series called Fun Science and tried to answer questions about the world. After I launched the channel, I found other video bloggers and realised that this was a thing people were doing. The webcam I had then cost \u00a315, and the videos were awful quality. The first video blog I made was six minutes long, which at the time was a silly length. You\u2019d never make one that long now. It was just a rambly mess. When I started, I think [sketch comedy channel] Smosh was the site\u2019s most subscribed-to channel, with maybe 100,000 subscribers. So it feels weird to hear that so many kids these days see becoming a YouTuber as one of their main career aspirations. That didn\u2019t exist back in 2007. People saw it as a hobby. That\u2019s been one of the major, weirder shifts. In 2017 I moved to Canada with my girlfriend. I was ready to leave the UK. There\u2019s that phrase: if you\u2019re sick of London, you\u2019re sick of life. I was honestly sick of London. I\u2019d kind of stopped video blogging by that point, even though I had millions of subscribers. I\u2019d already burned out once before, in 2013, and then found it hard to upload a new video every week. I realised I felt much happier not being on camera, and I felt increasingly as if I was putting on a mask and being somebody else. Viewers equated my digital presence with my real-life one. That\u2019s one of the things I know about myself now: I find it much more creatively fulfilling to be working behind the scenes. Around the time I moved to Toronto, I began working with New Form, a production company that works with video bloggers who are interested in filmmaking. A show I made was picked up by Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Hollywood bigwig, who has no idea who I am in terms of my YouTube career. (It stars Don Cheadle, and will be out next year.) I have a few different feature scripts I\u2019m working on, ideas for TV pilots. I\u2019m working the filmmaker grind. I haven\u2019t ruled out coming back to YouTube entirely, but I think if I ever do come back, I want it to be what it used to be \u2013 more of a hobby, a creative outlet. I\u2019d have a proper job elsewhere. I definitely used to see YouTube as my proper job. I had 2m subscribers! But I guess it isn\u2019t for me any more. Sapphire, 17 \u2018Without YouTube I wouldn\u2019t be making my own music\u2019 I started on YouTube 10 years ago, when I was seven. All I did back then was sing \u2013 my dream at the time was to become the next Adele \u2013 but I never really had a platform. My mum suggested doing YouTube. It was only a few years old at that point, and I was over-the-moon excited about it. I drew pictures of what I would look like on screen. I did my first video and just got hooked, and then did it again and again and again. Here we are, 350 videos later. When I filmed that first video, I was really nervous. I thought that if I wore the same outfit out in the street people would recognise me instantly, even though I had, like, three subscribers. I got more than 100 views on that first video in a week, and it just went up from there. I had my first viral video three videos later, a cover of Hallelujah. It grew and grew. It started turning serious when I was nine. We went from using an old Canon camcorder to a proper, professional camera, and we\u2019ve upgraded again to a completely new one, though it\u2019s still a family production. My videos go out on a Friday. On Monday I\u2019ll pick a track, one with the most views at that moment, or a classic song everybody knows. Then we\u2019ll get a track made \u2013 it will take me a few hours to record \u2013 and every Wednesday we film a video. That will either be a whole day or half a day. Then we\u2019ll edit it the next day and it\u2019s straight out for Friday. Sometimes we\u2019ll do full production videos with dancers and all sorts. They\u2019re big, two-day shoots. I\u2019m not interested in being a superstar or whatever. I just like making music and content, and making people happy. But we\u2019ve done so much. I got to perform at Wembley Arena when I was about 11. That was definitely one of my favourite moments: getting to walk out on the stage and say \u201cHello, Wembley!\u201d In Germany I performed in front of 17,000 people, which was insane. YouTube\u2019s helped me get to the point where I can write and produce my own music and release it to the public. That\u2019s just the best feeling in the world. Without YouTube I never would have got to that point, never would have had those opportunities. Without it I\u2019d be nothing right now. I can\u2019t imagine a life without YouTube. It has its ups and downs, when there\u2019s too much going on, when you\u2019re juggling school and your digital presence, and you have to try to fit everything in. But at the end of the day it\u2019s all moving me towards this one goal \u2013 to one day tour the world. Emmanuel \u201cManny\u201d Brown, 23 \u2018It was embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online\u2019 When I was younger, it was a cool thing to record and capture the video games you were playing. I remember asking my mum for an HD PVR, which captured game console footage and uploaded it to the internet. It was \u00a3175 back then \u2013 a lot of money \u2013 but she said yes. My brother Tobi [YouTuber Tobjizzle] ended up taking it first and recording stuff. He knew more about it. I joined about a year later, in 2013. I was 17. I thought it would be easy, but I quickly learned it was a grind. You had to get your own content out, have your own ideas, develop your own personality. When I was on 2,500 subscribers I was walking through school and a kid said to me: \u201cAren\u2019t you Manny from YouTube?\u201d That shook me. It was almost embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online, especially in sixth form. I don\u2019t know when I realised I was popular. When I had 7,500 subscribers I made around \u00a310 per video from Fifa sponsorships. But in August 2015 I started getting more views and more brand deals. I remember [fellow YouTuber] Miniminter saying to me: \u201cIn six months you\u2019ll be earning a lot.\u201d I never thought of it that way, but he was more experienced, and knew the levels I could get to. I dropped out of an accounting and finance course at university when I got to 60,000 subscribers. The accounting and finance skills would come in useful now, but I didn\u2019t stay long enough \u2013 balancing uni and YouTube was difficult. Within a month of dropping out I hit 100,000 subscribers, and from there it grew rapidly \u2013 30,000 new subscribers a month. Now I have 1.7m. At the start of every year I ask: can I do this for another 12 months? Most years, the answer is no. It\u2019s getting tough \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to keep up the consistency. At times I\u2019ve stopped posting every day, and sometimes I fall out of love with it. But my videos are seen by 250,000 people a day. I\u2019m back to my most consistent now, almost doing daily uploads. My last 50 videos have been posted in the last 57 days. It can be draining, but I\u2019m trying to find a balance. YouTube has changed in many ways. There\u2019s a lot of things I do now that get half the number of the views it would have got when I started. It was a lot easier to get views with less back then. Now, it\u2019s all about the titles and the thumbnails and making sure everything\u2019s clickable. If it\u2019s not clickable, it won\u2019t get the views. You don\u2019t need to make good content to get views on YouTube these days. Caspar Lee, 25 \u2018I decided to help others who were doing their own videos\u2019 I started in a small town called Knysna, in South Africa. It was 2010 and I was 16. I did it because I wanted to impress the other kids at school; I thought it would be cool for them to watch videos I\u2019d made. But it had the opposite effect \u2013 everyone thought it was lame. For two years I was that weird YouTube kid, creating weird videos about my life. In 2012, my final year of school, I\u2019d earned enough to become a full-time YouTuber and move to London. The goal wasn\u2019t to stay there for very long \u2013 it was just to work with other creators and build an audience. But it eventually evolved into the place I spend most of my time. Now I\u2019ve got 7m subscribers. People watch me do challenges: bleach my hair, or live in my car. If you\u2019d asked me when I started, I wouldn\u2019t have thought that many people would even be using YouTube. A big channel used to have 1m subscribers. Now they have 100m. There\u2019s always a natural insecurity when it comes to doing well in something. You ask yourself: how long can this last? So a way of protecting myself was to diversify away from just making my own content. As someone with experience on the platform, I decided to help other creators who were beginning to monetise their videos. I set up a company called Influencer with a guy called Ben Jeffries. A girl I went on a Tinder date with introduced me to Ben \u2013 so I guess you could say we were a Tinder success story. We started Influencer with the goal of providing creators with another form of income \u2013 it allows people to earn money from product mentions in their content. We have more than 7,000 creators on our platform. I also set up a talent management company called Margravine Management, with Joe Sugg, my business partner and good friend, and the Creative Investment Club, which invests in startups alongside some of the best venture capitalists in the UK. (I know a lot of creators who want to invest in startups.) I\u2019m not the chief executive of all these companies. I find someone who can fulfil that role who is really good \u2013 and then I go into business with them. It\u2019s similar to the early days of YouTube \u2013 you meet people and find a way to collaborate. I still consider myself as more of a creator. But in terms of how I spend my time, it\u2019s three days a week on the business stuff, two days on YouTube. I really want to find a way to combine the two. My content hasn\u2019t really been so much about the business side of my life. But I\u2019d love to be able to speak more about it with my audience \u2013 and develop a new audience interested in becoming entrepreneurs or starting a company.

      "body": "<p>Sarah Batts shows me up a narrow staircase and into her one-bedroom flat. It\u2019s in the converted roof space in a not-great area of Eastbourne. The flat is crammed full of baby equipment for her 15-month-old daughter, Scarlette. Stiflingly hot in late summer, there\u2019s nowhere to sit and eat a meal, partly because the place is tiny and partly because, in common with households with small children across the land, every flat surface including the dining table is covered with stuff.</p> <p>After working in a pet shop for 14 years, Batts, 38, now can\u2019t hold down a job due to poor health. In any case, since her daughter\u2019s birth she has looked after Scarlette on her own. She is dependent on benefits and gets around \u00a3250 per week. Her monthly rent is \u00a3580, then there\u2019s bills, and she usually allows \u00a325 for her weekly food shop. Budgeting, she says, \u201cis pretty hard, because you don\u2019t get that much. I probably do spend way too much on food.\u201d She orders groceries online because she can\u2019t drive and her illness means she struggles to leave her flat. \u201cI worry about money pretty much all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI always end up with nothing at the end of the month.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My daughter has been round her friends and says they\u2019ve had treats and things. I just say there\u2019s nothing I can do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than four million children in one of the richest countries in the world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/16/new-study-finds-45-million-uk-children-living-in-poverty\" title=\"\">are growing up in poverty</a>, their access to adequate nutrition compromised. Beyond the misery and stress of not knowing where the next meal is coming from, it is well established that <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32207-4/fulltext\" title=\"\">poor diet is linked to coronary heart disease, obesity</a>, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. The situation is now so dire that after declaring that food insecurity is significant and growing in the UK, with levels among the worst in Europe, particularly for children, parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee last year recommended that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46810707\" title=\"\">the government should appoint a minister for hunger</a>.</p> <p>Schools, charities and groups of concerned citizens have been trying to tackle the issue by offering free dinners for pupils who may not even be getting one square meal a day in the holidays, community lunch clubs and, of course, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/25/food-bank-network-hands-out-record-16m-food-parcels-in-a-year\" title=\"\">record high in use of food banks</a>. With a lot of thought and careful planning, feeding a family on a severely restricted budget \u201cis possible if money\u2019s tight for a few weeks \u2013 but not for years on end\u201d, says Clare Hackney, co-founder with her friend, Sue Morris, of the not-for-profit company, <a href=\"https://communitystuff.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Stuff</a>. The two women met six years ago while running the Eastbourne public consultation for Big Local, a nationwide initiative that puts people in charge of a million pounds of Lottery money to spend on issues that they decide are local priorities \u2013 it has since funded Community Stuff to put on cookery classes for individuals trying to eat on punishingly low incomes, as well as most recently a Friday lunch club for people who are socially isolated.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re on minimum wage with a zero-hours contract, or you\u2019re disabled, or have learning difficulties or mental health issues, then providing decent food day in, day out is difficult,\u201d Hackney continues. \u201cIt only takes one emergency \u2013 your cooker or fridge breaking down, for instance \u2013 and then what? You haven\u2019t got any savings as saving isn\u2019t possible, so you\u2019re now in crisis and you\u2019re tempted to take out loans at exorbitant rates to fix the problem. The other option is to not heat your home, not pay the rent or not buy food. Things can very quickly spiral out of control.\u201d</p> <p>Batts recently went on a Community Stuff cookery course. She is now trying out the six-week \u201cempty cupboard plan\u201d chapter from the recipe book Hackney and Morris published called <em>Beyond the Foodbank</em>.</p> <p>The recipes are designed to help people trying to feed themselves in straitened circumstances \u2013 including living in emergency or temporary hostel accommodation \u2013 to make creative use of the often uninspiring dried and tinned goods given out by food banks. The empty cupboard plan assumes \u00a316 for a week\u2019s shop for one person; this has just been revised upwards from an initial sum of \u00a314 to allow for more fresh fruit and veg. It also assumes a kitchen cupboard with not a single ingredient in it at the start, and provides week-by-week, costed shopping lists with accompanying recipes that provide varied, nutritionally balanced meals. These include spaghetti with tomato sauce and fried bacon pieces; potato, onion and carrot bake; fish pie; sausage meatballs; and chicken and broccoli risotto. The dishes focus on simplicity and taste, but you don\u2019t get any culinary thrills on \u00a316 a week. You don\u2019t get puddings either. The nutritionist who was consulted banned the inclusion of a pot of jam because sugar is empty calories. Hackney rolls her eyes. She knows treats matter. I suspect she might sneak some jam into the next edition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2ad4c321bed6fce64a4643eb94641a1e629dabc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2ad4c321bed6fce64a4643eb94641a1e629dabc/0_474_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Morris and Clare Hackney, directors of Community Stuff, Eastbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Morris and Clare Hackney, directors of Community Stuff, Eastbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While clearly delighted that local food banks are now giving out the recipe book to clients she hopes will benefit, Morris emphasises that the answer to food poverty is not ever niftier budgeting, better meal planning or homilies on cooking from scratch. \u201cLots of people have poor mental health, or they\u2019re living in just one room,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have a car to get to the shops and public transport is expensive. You can\u2019t count on someone having a freezer or even a fridge. Sometimes they\u2019ve only got two rings to cook on, or just a microwave.\u201d</p> <p>The situation for some people in Eastbourne, an elegant seaside town generally known as a desirable retirement destination for affluent pensioners, is becoming increasingly desperate, confirms Howard Wardle, founder and manager of Eastbourne Foodbank. \u201cCounterintuitively, because overall it\u2019s a wealthy town, there are poor services for those in most need,\u201d he says. \u201cI talked to a mum the other day. She\u2019d been found rummaging in a bin for food \u2013 and collapsed. She was taken to hospital and diagnosed with malnutrition.\u201d</p> <p>Hackney grimaces. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably be worried about losing her children [to social services],\u201d she says. Social workers and families have told me that it is standard for a welfare check to include social workers looking through parents\u2019 fridges and kitchen cupboards. The three of us ponder the notion that poverty is making families terrified that local authorities will consider that the threshold of \u201csignificant harm\u201d has been reached, and fear their children could be removed because there\u2019s not enough food in the house.</p> <p>Wardle has just helped to launch a <a href=\"https://z-m-www.facebook.com/eastbournefoodbank/videos/vb.204392299601430/459717977975585/?type=2&amp;theater\" title=\"\">Poverty Commission in Eastbourne</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at fuel poverty, transport poverty, food poverty, education, find out where are the gaps, and how can we plug them, to stop this crazy business of food banks,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we want to close this food bank. I think it\u2019s disgusting in the 21st century, to be banging out 10 tonnes of food a month, in a rich town.\u201d</p> <p>The kitchen at the end of Batts\u2019s living room is almost too small to turn around in. She does have a cooker and a fridge-freezer, but there\u2019s barely any work surface on which to chop an onion let alone assemble ingredients. Undaunted, she\u2019s done her best to follow the recipes. \u201cDoing the three meals a day was the hardest thing, and getting into a routine,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve not eaten breakfast since I was at primary school. It\u2019s made me eat properly.\u201d Nodding at her sleeping daughter whose eyes are starting to flutter open after her nap, she adds: \u201cI only used to feed her.\u201d</p> <p>Scarlette\u2019s favourite recipes, it turns out, have been the bean burgers, the frittata and the blueberry porridge. \u201cShe\u2019s good at trying things,\u201d says Batts.

The strictness of the discipline required to survive on a tiny budget for years is wearing, she explains \u2013 she regularly checks comparison sites for offers and has noticed prices going up. \u201cThere are times I wish I could just go and buy a cake,\u201d she says. Does she ever? \u201cSometimes. But not often. Luxuries don\u2019t often happen these days.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s a luxury?</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cA chocolate bar. A packet of crisps. I\u2019ve missed those.

Not that I wouldn\u2019t enjoy being able to have a glass of wine. I stopped because of the cost.\u201d</p> <p>Then Kath says something that leaves me speechless. \u201cI drink tea, and as a luxury I\u2019ll buy PG Tips or Tetley.

Involuntarily, my eyebrows jump. Kath looks at me steadily. \u201cThey\u2019re rescues.\u201d She couldn\u2019t let them starve. She spends about a tenner a week feeding her cats. It is, she says, her choice. And the cats are a comfort. \u201cThey\u2019re company. You\u2019re never alone when you\u2019ve got cats,\u201d she says. \u201cThey bring calmness when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d Enduring a chronic illness on a very low income is clearly tough. \u201cI\u2019m basically fine,\u201d she says reassuringly. But there have been times she\u2019s had to use the food bank, when her money\u2019s run out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/23/the-poor-deserve-more-than-ration-book-food-staples\">Food-bank users deserve luxuries as well as lentils \u2013 just like everyone else</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Emergency food parcels can only address the symptoms, not the causes, of food poverty. The End Hunger UK coalition of charities, faith groups, academics and frontline organisations has just launched a campaign calling on government to halve household food insecurity by 2025, as a benchmark on the way to eradicating it by 2030. This is one of the sustainable development goals, adopted by the UN, that the UK signed up to in 2015. It will not be achieved by doling out emergency food parcels. It will only happen, says Cooper, if government decides to address the underlying causes of poverty and destitution. He means wages not being enough. Benefits not being enough. The money people have to exist on just\u2026 not being enough. \u201cPart of the long-term vision is that people should be able to buy food for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThat has to be core to solving the problem.\u201d</p> <p>At the Eastbourne food-bank depot, a warehouse on an industrial estate, Wardle points me to a graph showing that the number of parcels given out has almost doubled in the last year. But donations from the public have dropped, so he\u2019s had to buy in extra supplies. He\u2019s reliant on what people drop in collection bins and he\u2019s 10 tonnes down on what he needs, so he\u2019s worried.</p> <p>Can he ask the supermarkets for more? \u201cThey have never given us anything apart from their chuck-out stuff, when their shelving plan changes,\u201d he says acidly. Some are \u201cbrilliant at giving us things nobody wants to eat. Anchovies. Duck p\u00e2t\u00e9,\u201d he adds. He points at huge tins of artichokes and olives. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d Hackney says she\u2019ll take some of the catering-sized tins off his hands for her cookery classes. She and Morris have launched a new food skills course which works in tandem with their book, and will be training grassroots organisations around the UK to deliver it to anyone needing help to feed themselves on a limited income. \u201cLiving on a tight budget, in the long term it\u2019s crippling because you feel trapped,\u201d says Hackney. \u201cBut if you have practical cooking skills and some organisation in the way you plan your finances, you gain some limited sense of control. If you have virtually no money, you can\u2019t make mistakes. Otherwise you end up hungry.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sarah Batts shows me up a narrow staircase and into her one-bedroom flat. It\u2019s in the converted roof space in a not-great area of Eastbourne. The flat is crammed full of baby equipment for her 15-month-old daughter, Scarlette. Stiflingly hot in late summer, there\u2019s nowhere to sit and eat a meal, partly because the place is tiny and partly because, in common with households with small children across the land, every flat surface including the dining table is covered with stuff. After working in a pet shop for 14 years, Batts, 38, now can\u2019t hold down a job due to poor health. In any case, since her daughter\u2019s birth she has looked after Scarlette on her own. She is dependent on benefits and gets around \u00a3250 per week. Her monthly rent is \u00a3580, then there\u2019s bills, and she usually allows \u00a325 for her weekly food shop. Budgeting, she says, \u201cis pretty hard, because you don\u2019t get that much. I probably do spend way too much on food.\u201d She orders groceries online because she can\u2019t drive and her illness means she struggles to leave her flat. \u201cI worry about money pretty much all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI always end up with nothing at the end of the month.\u201d More than four million children in one of the richest countries in the world are growing up in poverty, their access to adequate nutrition compromised. Beyond the misery and stress of not knowing where the next meal is coming from, it is well established that poor diet is linked to coronary heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. The situation is now so dire that after declaring that food insecurity is significant and growing in the UK, with levels among the worst in Europe, particularly for children, parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee last year recommended that the government should appoint a minister for hunger. Schools, charities and groups of concerned citizens have been trying to tackle the issue by offering free dinners for pupils who may not even be getting one square meal a day in the holidays, community lunch clubs and, of course, the record high in use of food banks. With a lot of thought and careful planning, feeding a family on a severely restricted budget \u201cis possible if money\u2019s tight for a few weeks \u2013 but not for years on end\u201d, says Clare Hackney, co-founder with her friend, Sue Morris, of the not-for-profit company, Community Stuff. The two women met six years ago while running the Eastbourne public consultation for Big Local, a nationwide initiative that puts people in charge of a million pounds of Lottery money to spend on issues that they decide are local priorities \u2013 it has since funded Community Stuff to put on cookery classes for individuals trying to eat on punishingly low incomes, as well as most recently a Friday lunch club for people who are socially isolated. \u201cIf you\u2019re on minimum wage with a zero-hours contract, or you\u2019re disabled, or have learning difficulties or mental health issues, then providing decent food day in, day out is difficult,\u201d Hackney continues. \u201cIt only takes one emergency \u2013 your cooker or fridge breaking down, for instance \u2013 and then what? You haven\u2019t got any savings as saving isn\u2019t possible, so you\u2019re now in crisis and you\u2019re tempted to take out loans at exorbitant rates to fix the problem. The other option is to not heat your home, not pay the rent or not buy food. Things can very quickly spiral out of control.\u201d Batts recently went on a Community Stuff cookery course. She is now trying out the six-week \u201cempty cupboard plan\u201d chapter from the recipe book Hackney and Morris published called Beyond the Foodbank. The recipes are designed to help people trying to feed themselves in straitened circumstances \u2013 including living in emergency or temporary hostel accommodation \u2013 to make creative use of the often uninspiring dried and tinned goods given out by food banks. The empty cupboard plan assumes \u00a316 for a week\u2019s shop for one person; this has just been revised upwards from an initial sum of \u00a314 to allow for more fresh fruit and veg. It also assumes a kitchen cupboard with not a single ingredient in it at the start, and provides week-by-week, costed shopping lists with accompanying recipes that provide varied, nutritionally balanced meals. These include spaghetti with tomato sauce and fried bacon pieces; potato, onion and carrot bake; fish pie; sausage meatballs; and chicken and broccoli risotto. The dishes focus on simplicity and taste, but you don\u2019t get any culinary thrills on \u00a316 a week. You don\u2019t get puddings either. The nutritionist who was consulted banned the inclusion of a pot of jam because sugar is empty calories. Hackney rolls her eyes. She knows treats matter. I suspect she might sneak some jam into the next edition. While clearly delighted that local food banks are now giving out the recipe book to clients she hopes will benefit, Morris emphasises that the answer to food poverty is not ever niftier budgeting, better meal planning or homilies on cooking from scratch. \u201cLots of people have poor mental health, or they\u2019re living in just one room,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have a car to get to the shops and public transport is expensive. You can\u2019t count on someone having a freezer or even a fridge. Sometimes they\u2019ve only got two rings to cook on, or just a microwave.\u201d The situation for some people in Eastbourne, an elegant seaside town generally known as a desirable retirement destination for affluent pensioners, is becoming increasingly desperate, confirms Howard Wardle, founder and manager of Eastbourne Foodbank. \u201cCounterintuitively, because overall it\u2019s a wealthy town, there are poor services for those in most need,\u201d he says. \u201cI talked to a mum the other day. She\u2019d been found rummaging in a bin for food \u2013 and collapsed. She was taken to hospital and diagnosed with malnutrition.\u201d Hackney grimaces. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably be worried about losing her children [to social services],\u201d she says. Social workers and families have told me that it is standard for a welfare check to include social workers looking through parents\u2019 fridges and kitchen cupboards. The three of us ponder the notion that poverty is making families terrified that local authorities will consider that the threshold of \u201csignificant harm\u201d has been reached, and fear their children could be removed because there\u2019s not enough food in the house. Wardle has just helped to launch a Poverty Commission in Eastbourne. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at fuel poverty, transport poverty, food poverty, education, find out where are the gaps, and how can we plug them, to stop this crazy business of food banks,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we want to close this food bank. I think it\u2019s disgusting in the 21st century, to be banging out 10 tonnes of food a month, in a rich town.\u201d The kitchen at the end of Batts\u2019s living room is almost too small to turn around in. She does have a cooker and a fridge-freezer, but there\u2019s barely any work surface on which to chop an onion let alone assemble ingredients. Undaunted, she\u2019s done her best to follow the recipes. \u201cDoing the three meals a day was the hardest thing, and getting into a routine,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve not eaten breakfast since I was at primary school. It\u2019s made me eat properly.\u201d Nodding at her sleeping daughter whose eyes are starting to flutter open after her nap, she adds: \u201cI only used to feed her.\u201d Scarlette\u2019s favourite recipes, it turns out, have been the bean burgers, the frittata and the blueberry porridge. \u201cShe\u2019s good at trying things,\u201d says Batts. The allocated \u00a316 has been enough to feed them both, but four weeks into the plan, the lack of treats has been impossible to stick to. \u201cNow and then I will add something like a takeaway, maybe once a month, or a tub of ice-cream,\u201d she says, smiling embarrassedly. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit naughty. I do buy her treats.\u201d The toddler is too young to grasp the financial choices her mother is having to navigate, or understand the effort required to feed her seven days a week on less money than some people spend on a top-up shop on the way home from work. And she can\u2019t understand yet how the impossibility of finding a few spare quid for social activities that include eating out may impinge on her social life and friendships as she grows up. It doesn\u2019t take long for those differences to become obvious though. Jacqui, 32, has also taken cookery classes with Community Stuff. Her kids are 11, eight and three, and have only known a life on benefits: Jacqui can\u2019t get a job till her youngest is at school. She allocates \u00a340 a week for food, and the children have started to notice they\u2019re missing out. \u201cMy 11-year-old complains sometimes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s been round her friends and says they\u2019ve had treats and things. I just say there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d Does she think \u00a340 a week is enough to feed a family of four? \u201cNot really, to be honest. Because if I can\u2019t get the reduced stuff, it\u2019s just plain bland food. Pasta on its own.\u201d Her children have learned, Jacqui says, that they can\u2019t have treats. \u201cMeat to them is a treat.\u201d How does having to say \u201cno\u201d all the time make her feel? \u201cI\u2019d like to do a lot better for them but you can only do what you can do,\u201d she says.

The receipt says \u00a314.10. An electrical storm has just broken Kath\u2019s freezer. She can\u2019t afford to get it mended so she won\u2019t be able to freeze leftovers. The strictness of the discipline required to survive on a tiny budget for years is wearing, she explains \u2013 she regularly checks comparison sites for offers and has noticed prices going up. \u201cThere are times I wish I could just go and buy a cake,\u201d she says. Does she ever? \u201cSometimes. But not often. Luxuries don\u2019t often happen these days.\u201d What\u2019s a luxury? She laughs. \u201cA chocolate bar. A packet of crisps. I\u2019ve missed those. Especially if you\u2019ve had a bad month, it\u2019s a mood lifter.\u201d Except for Christmas, she\u2019s not bought alcohol for five years. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in drinking. Not that I wouldn\u2019t enjoy being able to have a glass of wine. I stopped because of the cost.\u201d Then Kath says something that leaves me speechless. \u201cI drink tea, and as a luxury I\u2019ll buy PG Tips or Tetley. Otherwise,\u201d she pulls a face, \u201cit\u2019s shop\u2019s own brand.\u201d On her benefits, Kath says she can only afford \u00a320 a week on food. \u201cI could probably up it but the cats have to be fed.\u201d How many does she have, I ask. \u201cSeven\u201d she says. Involuntarily, my eyebrows jump. Kath looks at me steadily. \u201cThey\u2019re rescues.\u201d She couldn\u2019t let them starve. She spends about a tenner a week feeding her cats. It is, she says, her choice. And the cats are a comfort. \u201cThey\u2019re company. You\u2019re never alone when you\u2019ve got cats,\u201d she says. \u201cThey bring calmness when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d Enduring a chronic illness on a very low income is clearly tough. \u201cI\u2019m basically fine,\u201d she says reassuringly. But there have been times she\u2019s had to use the food bank, when her money\u2019s run out. Emergency food parcels can only address the symptoms, not the causes, of food poverty. The End Hunger UK coalition of charities, faith groups, academics and frontline organisations has just launched a campaign calling on government to halve household food insecurity by 2025, as a benchmark on the way to eradicating it by 2030. This is one of the sustainable development goals, adopted by the UN, that the UK signed up to in 2015. It will not be achieved by doling out emergency food parcels. It will only happen, says Cooper, if government decides to address the underlying causes of poverty and destitution. He means wages not being enough. Benefits not being enough. The money people have to exist on just\u2026 not being enough. \u201cPart of the long-term vision is that people should be able to buy food for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThat has to be core to solving the problem.\u201d At the Eastbourne food-bank depot, a warehouse on an industrial estate, Wardle points me to a graph showing that the number of parcels given out has almost doubled in the last year. But donations from the public have dropped, so he\u2019s had to buy in extra supplies. He\u2019s reliant on what people drop in collection bins and he\u2019s 10 tonnes down on what he needs, so he\u2019s worried. Can he ask the supermarkets for more? \u201cThey have never given us anything apart from their chuck-out stuff, when their shelving plan changes,\u201d he says acidly. Some are \u201cbrilliant at giving us things nobody wants to eat. Anchovies. Duck p\u00e2t\u00e9,\u201d he adds. He points at huge tins of artichokes and olives. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d Hackney says she\u2019ll take some of the catering-sized tins off his hands for her cookery classes. She and Morris have launched a new food skills course which works in tandem with their book, and will be training grassroots organisations around the UK to deliver it to anyone needing help to feed themselves on a limited income. \u201cLiving on a tight budget, in the long term it\u2019s crippling because you feel trapped,\u201d says Hackney. \u201cBut if you have practical cooking skills and some organisation in the way you plan your finances, you gain some limited sense of control. If you have virtually no money, you can\u2019t make mistakes. Otherwise you end up hungry.\u201d Some names have been changed",

Breast of chicken with radicchio, mozzarella &amp; parma ham \u2013 petto di pollo con radicchio, mozzarella e prosciutto di parma Serves 4 For the chicken boneless chicken breasts 4, skin and wing tips removed parma ham 4 slices radicchio 4 leaves mozzarella 1 ball, cut into quarters egg 1, beaten and seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper flour dried breadcrumbs olive oil for deep-frying tomato coulis (see below) For the tomato coulis (makes 900ml) tomatoes 1kg, very ripe onion 2 tbsp, finely chopped garlic 2 tbsp, finely chopped extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp salt and freshly ground black pepper To make the tomato coulis, roughly chop the tomatoes. Gently fry the onion and garlic in the olive oil until soft and golden, add the tomatoes and cook until soft. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Pass the tomato mixture through a vegetable mill. Split the breasts, remove the fillet and flatten out the breast and fillet between 2 sheets of greaseproof paper. Cover each breast with a slice of parma ham, a radicchio leaf and a quarter of mozzarella, and cover with the fillet. Roll the breast up and seal with a little egg wash. Dust the breast with flour, then dip in the egg wash and finally roll in the breadcrumbs. Deep-fry in olive oil for 10-12 minutes. The oil must not be too hot or the breadcrumbs will cook before the meat. This is the time when only personal judgment can be used, according to the equipment one is using. The breadcrumbs should be golden brown. Serve with 2 tbsp of tomato coulis on each plate with the chicken breast cut in half diagonally on top. The mozzarella should ooze out showing the colours of the ham and radicchio. Sicilian cheesecake \u2013 cassata siciliana Serves 6 pan di spagna (plain sponge cake) 1, sliced into 4 slabs (see below) ricotta 450g sugar 30g double cream 2 tbsp mixed candied fruit peel 4 heaped tbsp, chopped plain chocolate 60g, coarsely chopped Strega or maraschino liqueur For the coating plain or bitter chocolate 225g espresso coffee 6 tbsp butter 175g For the pan di spagna eggs 2 large caster sugar 45g plain flour 45g, sifted baking powder \u00bc tsp To make the pan di spagna, preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Grease a swiss roll tin and line it with greased greaseproof paper. Separate the eggs, add the sugar to the yolks and whisk until the mixture is fluffy. With a clean dry whisk, whisk the whites until stiff. Fold the egg whites with a metal spoon into the egg and sugar mixture, alternating with the combined sifted flour and baking powder. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 10 minutes. Leave the cake in the tin for 5 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. When cool, slice into 4 equal pieces. To make the cheesecake, pass the ricotta through a food mill, add the sugar and cream, and beat until smooth. Fold in the candied peel and chopped chocolate. Sprinkle the bottom slab of sponge with liqueur, cover generously with the ricotta mixture, and place another slab of sponge cake on top. Repeat this process with the liqueur and ricotta until all the slabs are used up. End with a plain slice of sponge cake. Gently press the loaf together to make it compact and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. To make the coating, melt the dark chocolate with the espresso coffee in a bain-marie over a low heat. Beat in the butter, a knob at a time. Beat until thickened to a spreading consistency. Spread the chocolate all over the sponge cake. Refrigerate for at least a day before using.

A faraway brown bear and cub, in fact. We watch as the maple-brown carnivores lumber straight for our group, swallowing up the space between us. Their determined pace hints at a head-on meeting. The tone of our guide, Peter Robertson, suggests all we need to do is keep quiet and sit stock-still. I can\u2019t help but fidget.</p> \n<p>A bald eagle takes flight from a bushy pine and the sea grass trembles as two black-tail Sitka deer scamper past at a gallop. To our left runs a river, at our backs is a vast belt of ancient forest and dark mountains that hide the densest concentration of brown bears on earth.

An unfathomable 16.7m acres of old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar, as well as glacial fjords, rivers and valleys, it is North America\u2019s largest forest \u2013 20 times the size of Yosemite National Park and as big as Ireland.</p> \n<p>Some of the trees have been here for 1,000 years; all of them play a hugely important role in absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \u2013 more than any other forest in America. It is also a brown bear-watching hotspot, although glossy black bear, wolf, otter, beaver and salmon swell the rivers and fjords, too. There are also mountain goats, flying squirrels, river otters, humpback whales, orcas and bald eagles.

      "bodyText": "Through the droplets on the binoculars, some distance away, two unidentifiable creatures appear to be wading across the tidal creek. Deer? Wolf? Moose? A faraway brown bear and cub, in fact. We watch as the maple-brown carnivores lumber straight for our group, swallowing up the space between us. Their determined pace hints at a head-on meeting. The tone of our guide, Peter Robertson, suggests all we need to do is keep quiet and sit stock-still. I can\u2019t help but fidget. A bald eagle takes flight from a bushy pine and the sea grass trembles as two black-tail Sitka deer scamper past at a gallop. To our left runs a river, at our backs is a vast belt of ancient forest and dark mountains that hide the densest concentration of brown bears on earth. Knowing this sets my jaw a little tighter. As wildlife-watching locations go, Tongass National Forest in the panhandle of southeast Alaska is hard to beat. An unfathomable 16.7m acres of old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar, as well as glacial fjords, rivers and valleys, it is North America\u2019s largest forest \u2013 20 times the size of Yosemite National Park and as big as Ireland. Some of the trees have been here for 1,000 years; all of them play a hugely important role in absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \u2013 more than any other forest in America. It is also a brown bear-watching hotspot, although glossy black bear, wolf, otter, beaver and salmon swell the rivers and fjords, too. There are also mountain goats, flying squirrels, river otters, humpback whales, orcas and bald eagles. Small wonder it was one of the favourite places of renowned Scottish-American conservationist John Muir. We\u2019ve been dropped by seaplane into the thick of the action at a remote, permit-only beach on Admiralty Island in the Alexander Archipelago \u2014 with no dock, no services and no phone reception.

      "body": "<p>I remember in July 2008 when the news broke of the decision to appoint Keir Starmer as director of public prosecutions (DPP). I was at a meeting of socialist lawyers, people who had spent their lives campaigning for the rights of homeless people and asylum seekers. We couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d taken the role.</p> <p>On standing for the Labour leadership, Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1213536222783688704?fbclid=IwAR2f3b_OI21j-iduTAsQ1vxAQsZRiaabVbW87Z3oblQ52S-xb0XWmdyaUMg\" title=\"\">published</a> a video, setting out his record as a barrister who had represented poll tax protesters and striking miners. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone,\u201d a voiceover says, \u201creally expected someone who dedicated his career to defending workers, trade unions and trade unions to become director of public prosecutions.\u201d They were right about that.</p> <p>As a barrister, Starmer was a principled opponent of state power. He was one of us. But the DPP\u2019s role is all about exercising power: prosecuting defendants so that they are fined or jailed. Starmer\u2019s time as DPP has played a role in the Labour leadership contest, particularly in blogs and on social media \u2013 and will be studied even more closely if he wins. What should we make of it?</p> <p>As DPP, Starmer was the head of the Crown Prosecution Service. This is the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. Where the decision is taken to prosecute, it is the CPS that employs a lawyer to argue in court for a conviction. The CPS is a huge organisation, undertaking more than half a million prosecutions a year, and employing almost 6,000 people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Starmer called for the prosecution of demonstrators with scarves around their faces, he was playing up to press fantasies about their motives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There were a number of decisions that Starmer got right. He was appointed by Labour but spent half his time in office under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. There, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/27/keir-starmer-case-prosecutor-dpp\" title=\"\">defended</a> the Human Rights Act against Conservative proposals to repeal it. Rightwing MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/22/keir-starmer-tories-human-rights\" title=\"\">briefed</a> against him. Starmer deserves recognition for taking that stand.</p> <p>There is a second group of decisions taken by the CPS for which Starmer has been criticised, but it is difficult to say whether the criticisms are justified. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/690b6016-631e-11e2-8497-00144feab49a\" title=\"\">most difficult</a>\u201d decision was, according to Starmer, in relation to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/15/ian-tomlinson-death-g20\" title=\"\">killing of Ian Tomlinson</a>, the newspaper vendor who was struck by police officer Simon Harwood during protests in 2009.</p> <p>Although between 30 and 50 people die each year in police custody or following contact with the police, these deaths almost never lead to prosecution. In that context, the left demanded Harwood\u2019s prosecution.</p> <p>Starmer told the press that the CPS wouldn\u2019t prosecute. He cited the report of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/13/ian-tomlinson-freddy-patel-condemned\" title=\"\">Dr Freddy Patel</a>, the pathologist appointed by the state, who found the death had been caused by natural causes. Although other pathologists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/cps-statement-death-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">disagreed</a> with Patel, the CPS insisted that the fact of his opinion was an insuperable barrier to prosecution. In October 2010, Dr Patel was suspended from practice as a result of allegations concerning the way he undertook autopsies. The CPS again <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11544777\" title=\"\">announced</a> that Harwood would not be prosecuted. Only in May 2011, after an inquest jury had found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, did the CPS agree to charge Harwood with manslaughter.</p> <p>The difficulty in criticising Starmer for his handling of this case \u2013 or others like it \u2013 is that we don\u2019t know what advice he was given. If senior prosecutors were advising him against proceeding, he can\u2019t be faulted for caution. After all, what would be the point of prosecution, if it was highly likely that the officer was going to be acquitted? Which, in 2012, Harwood was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96dab819d0af61f8739c36803fed9366016ba662\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96dab819d0af61f8739c36803fed9366016ba662/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer in 2013, when he was director of public prosecutions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keir Starmer in 2013, when he was director of public prosecutions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where Starmer\u2019s record may be more vulnerable to criticism is in his handling of the press. One of the DPP\u2019s tasks is to issue guidance to prosecutors. The guidance reminds prosecutors of the powers already available to them. Usually, the guidance is not controversial. For example, in November last year, the CPS <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/theft-act-offences\" title=\"\">offered</a> guidance on prosecuting offences under the Theft Act. As far as I can tell, no paper reported on that guidance; its publication was seen as the routine act of a government department.</p> <p>Starmer has been <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4555-the-case-against-keir-starmer\" title=\"\">accused</a> of \u201c[drawing] up rules that gave police officers more power\u201d. It has also been suggested that as DPP he <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/benefit-cheats-face-10-years-in-prison-as-keir-starmer-sets-out-tough-new-crown-prosecution-service-8818201.html\" title=\"\">extended</a> the jail term for benefits crimes. But the CPS does not draw up sentencing guidelines. The DPP\u2019s guidance only binds prosecutors: it determines what they ask, not what the court gives them. As for protests, senior police officers, not the DPP, decide how they are policed.</p> <p>His critics are able to exaggerate his role because of interviews given by Starmer himself in which he presented modest changes to the advice given to prosecutors as matters of real significance and used a tabloid-friendly language to defend them. This was how he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/06/masked-protesters-cps?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">justified</a> the guidance on protests: \u201cThere\u2019s a potential for a number of protests over the coming years that may be quite large \u2026 If someone has brought along a weapon or means of concealing their identity that\u2019s likely to be evidence that they were anticipating trouble or disorder.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, over the past two decades, it has become more common for demonstrators to cover their faces. They do so because of the increasing use of snatch squads, police filming of political protests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/26/met-police-in-700k-payout-to-detained-anti-fascist-protesters\" title=\"\">scandals</a> such as detention without arrest.

      "bodyText": "I remember in July 2008 when the news broke of the decision to appoint Keir Starmer as director of public prosecutions (DPP). I was at a meeting of socialist lawyers, people who had spent their lives campaigning for the rights of homeless people and asylum seekers. We couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d taken the role. On standing for the Labour leadership, Keir Starmer published a video, setting out his record as a barrister who had represented poll tax protesters and striking miners. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone,\u201d a voiceover says, \u201creally expected someone who dedicated his career to defending workers, trade unions and trade unions to become director of public prosecutions.\u201d They were right about that. As a barrister, Starmer was a principled opponent of state power. He was one of us. But the DPP\u2019s role is all about exercising power: prosecuting defendants so that they are fined or jailed. Starmer\u2019s time as DPP has played a role in the Labour leadership contest, particularly in blogs and on social media \u2013 and will be studied even more closely if he wins. What should we make of it? As DPP, Starmer was the head of the Crown Prosecution Service. This is the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. Where the decision is taken to prosecute, it is the CPS that employs a lawyer to argue in court for a conviction. The CPS is a huge organisation, undertaking more than half a million prosecutions a year, and employing almost 6,000 people. There were a number of decisions that Starmer got right. He was appointed by Labour but spent half his time in office under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. There, he defended the Human Rights Act against Conservative proposals to repeal it. Rightwing MPs briefed against him. Starmer deserves recognition for taking that stand. There is a second group of decisions taken by the CPS for which Starmer has been criticised, but it is difficult to say whether the criticisms are justified. The \u201cmost difficult\u201d decision was, according to Starmer, in relation to the killing of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper vendor who was struck by police officer Simon Harwood during protests in 2009. Although between 30 and 50 people die each year in police custody or following contact with the police, these deaths almost never lead to prosecution. In that context, the left demanded Harwood\u2019s prosecution. Starmer told the press that the CPS wouldn\u2019t prosecute. He cited the report of Dr Freddy Patel, the pathologist appointed by the state, who found the death had been caused by natural causes. Although other pathologists disagreed with Patel, the CPS insisted that the fact of his opinion was an insuperable barrier to prosecution. In October 2010, Dr Patel was suspended from practice as a result of allegations concerning the way he undertook autopsies. The CPS again announced that Harwood would not be prosecuted. Only in May 2011, after an inquest jury had found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, did the CPS agree to charge Harwood with manslaughter. The difficulty in criticising Starmer for his handling of this case \u2013 or others like it \u2013 is that we don\u2019t know what advice he was given. If senior prosecutors were advising him against proceeding, he can\u2019t be faulted for caution. After all, what would be the point of prosecution, if it was highly likely that the officer was going to be acquitted? Which, in 2012, Harwood was. Where Starmer\u2019s record may be more vulnerable to criticism is in his handling of the press. One of the DPP\u2019s tasks is to issue guidance to prosecutors. The guidance reminds prosecutors of the powers already available to them. Usually, the guidance is not controversial. For example, in November last year, the CPS offered guidance on prosecuting offences under the Theft Act. As far as I can tell, no paper reported on that guidance; its publication was seen as the routine act of a government department. Starmer has been accused of \u201c[drawing] up rules that gave police officers more power\u201d. It has also been suggested that as DPP he extended the jail term for benefits crimes. But the CPS does not draw up sentencing guidelines. The DPP\u2019s guidance only binds prosecutors: it determines what they ask, not what the court gives them. As for protests, senior police officers, not the DPP, decide how they are policed. His critics are able to exaggerate his role because of interviews given by Starmer himself in which he presented modest changes to the advice given to prosecutors as matters of real significance and used a tabloid-friendly language to defend them. This was how he justified the guidance on protests: \u201cThere\u2019s a potential for a number of protests over the coming years that may be quite large \u2026 If someone has brought along a weapon or means of concealing their identity that\u2019s likely to be evidence that they were anticipating trouble or disorder.\u201d In fact, over the past two decades, it has become more common for demonstrators to cover their faces. They do so because of the increasing use of snatch squads, police filming of political protests and scandals such as detention without arrest. When Starmer called for the vigorous pursuit of protesters who have concealed their identity, he was playing up to press fantasies about their motives. This, meanwhile, is how Starmer explained his guidance to prosecutors in benefits cases: \u201cIt is a myth that \u2018getting one over on the system\u2019 is a victimless crime: the truth is we all pay the price\u201d; and \u201cIt is vital that we take a tough stance on this type of fraud and I am determined to see a clampdown on those who flout the system.\u201d The largest group of benefits prosecutions concern the minor infractions of people who fail to declare a piece of information. For example, when part-time workers on housing benefit fail to tell the authorities that their hours at work have increased. Starmer\u2019s words (\u201cgetting one over on the system\u201d) were wide enough so that it seemed he was referring to such groups of claimants. And, in doing so, he evoked tabloid myths about undeserving individuals deliberately and systematically milking the system. To speak of claimants in this way was to denigrate them. Looking back on Starmer\u2019s management of the media while DPP, the sense is of an individual with a radical past making peace with power. He was at ease there in a way that Jeremy Corbyn, among others, could never have been. His supporters will say that Labour needs a leader capable of winning press support. To which his critics will counter that the rightwing press is already ungenerously studying Starmer\u2019s career. It is a mistake to think that his close proximity to high-profile cases will be anything other than a recurring weak point in relation to the tabloids. Starmer\u2019s enthusiasm while DPP for using mundane news events to feed the press with rightwing talking points is a possible concern for Labour members. If such a leader was faced with news of an injustice in the future \u2013 the consequence of a change to immigration rules, say, or of a strike in public services \u2013 Starmer\u2019s approach to the press as DPP might raise worries that he would not give a principled defence of the victims but would tell the press whatever it wanted to hear. \u2022 David Renton is a political activist and barrister.

It has turned into an African ban.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump administration has claimed that the ban, which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/world/nigeria-travel-ban.html\">blindsided</a> some diplomats, is a national security measure, and that the added countries failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards.</p> <p>But immigrant rights groups said the policy is a political maneuver amid Trump\u2019s re-election campaign \u2013 and one that will have profound consequences. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are in turmoil,\u201d said Audu Kadiri, a 43-year-old community organizer who left Nigeria in 2014. He had planned to bring his mother to the US, but the ban may make that impossible. The activist, who now lives in the Bronx, hasn\u2019t yet told his mother about Trump\u2019s order, because he doesn\u2019t know how to break the news. \u201cThere is so much collateral damage, it\u2019s hard to quantify.\u201d</p> <p>In Nigeria, Kadiri was an LGBTQ+ rights advocate who worked on HIV prevention and other human rights issues. He was forced to flee due to his activism and sought asylum in the US. It\u2019s now unsafe for him to return to Nigeria, which is why he wants his 68-year-old mother to come to the US.</p> <p>He hasn\u2019t seen her since 2014 and, if Trump is re-elected, he fears it will be at least another five years before they reunite.

The US further <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51335011\">suspended</a> visitor visas from Eritrea in 2017.</p> <p>That means families have been fighting for years to use the dwindling avenues available to them to reunite, and for those who have invested significant time and money into the process, the sudden news of an outright ban was particularly brutal.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do, and it makes you feel so helpless,\u201d said Olumide, the veteran. Olumide arrived in the US from Nigeria when he was 10 years old.

But they don\u2019t yet have their visas \u2013 and the ban may make it impossible to get them.</p> <p>Olumide had hoped they would be starting their lives together in the US by now, and said he was pained by feelings of guilt: \u201cI made promises to her.\u201d The couple hasn\u2019t fully processed the news, he added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to think about not being together.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that his daughter has typhoid and his wife has malaria, and he constantly fears for their health and safety.</p> <p>Hana Mohamed, a 20-year-old student in San Diego, who grew up in Sudan, said she was eager for her grandparents to come to the US, especially so her grandmother could get medical care in California: \u201cIt\u2019s just so sad and frustrating. They are getting older, and I want to see them before anything happens.\u201d</p> <p>Mohamed said it was difficult to accept that the US was banning large groups of Muslims in the name of safety while seeming to do little about the ongoing terror threat of American mass shootings: \u201cIt\u2019s just so shocking that we have come to this day where a whole nation of people are getting discriminated against. Isn\u2019t the purpose of the United States to stand up for everyone who is getting hurt and treat them right?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Isn\u2019t the purpose of the United States to stand up for everyone who is getting hurt and treat them right?</p> <footer> <cite>Hana Mohamed</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One Eritrean American who works as an engineer in Silicon Valley, and requested anonymity for fear of hurting his family\u2019s case, has petitioned for his mother to come live with him in the US and was hoping she would soon get an interview date at the embassy.

      "bodyText": "It started out as a joyous day for Olumide. On 31 January, the 32-year-old Nigerian American learned in an email that the US was finally processing the visa applications of his wife and daughter in Nigeria. Hours later, Donald Trump shattered their celebration, announcing that he was adding six countries to the travel ban, including Nigeria. The decision cuts off pathways to permanent US residency for Nigerians, throwing Olumide\u2019s case into limbo at the final stage of the process. It leaves his wife and and 11-year-old girl stuck across an ocean with little hope of making it to the US. \u201cThis is inhuman,\u201d said Olumide, a systems analyst and US military veteran who served in Afghanistan and lives in Washington DC. He asked to use his middle name out of fear he might jeopardize his case. \u201cAs a soldier, I understand the need to protect the country. But to completely shut the doors \u2026 it\u2019s just plain wrong.\u201d Millions of Africans now banned: \u2018We are not criminals\u2019 Trump\u2019s January order builds on the 2017 travel ban that has continued to target five Muslim-majority countries, and significantly restricts permanent residency for nationals from Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria and Myanmar. It also blocks people from Tanzania and Sudan from obtaining green cards through the \u201cdiversity visa\u201d lottery. Just like the 2017 restrictions, it blocks permanent immigration from the targeted countries, making limited exceptions if applicants prove that denials would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d and that granting them visas would support \u201cnational interest\u201d. The original ban already resulted in denied visas for more than 42,000 people, the majority from Iran. The addition of the new countries has doubled the number of Muslims targeted across the globe to roughly 320 million, advocates estimate. Roughly one-quarter of all Africans are now affected. The restrictions now apply to 13 countries, including Nigeria, home to Africa\u2019s largest population and economy. It cuts off countries where some are fleeing violence. Some estimate the new ban, which goes into effect on 21 February, could hinder more than 12,000 immigrants seeking to resettle in the US and reunite with family in the next year. The restrictions are a signature component of Trump\u2019s aggressive anti-immigrant agenda, which has included curbs on legal migration, a destruction of the American asylum system, an all-time low cap on refugees, expanded detention and mass deportations. \u201cTrump started out by scapegoating Muslims in 2017,\u201d said Javeria Jamil, attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice\u2019s Asian Law Caucus, who has been fielding calls from families affected by the new ban. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not just the Muslim ban. It has turned into an African ban.\u201d The Trump administration has claimed that the ban, which blindsided some diplomats, is a national security measure, and that the added countries failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards. But immigrant rights groups said the policy is a political maneuver amid Trump\u2019s re-election campaign \u2013 and one that will have profound consequences. \u201cPeople are in turmoil,\u201d said Audu Kadiri, a 43-year-old community organizer who left Nigeria in 2014. He had planned to bring his mother to the US, but the ban may make that impossible. The activist, who now lives in the Bronx, hasn\u2019t yet told his mother about Trump\u2019s order, because he doesn\u2019t know how to break the news. \u201cThere is so much collateral damage, it\u2019s hard to quantify.\u201d In Nigeria, Kadiri was an LGBTQ+ rights advocate who worked on HIV prevention and other human rights issues. He was forced to flee due to his activism and sought asylum in the US. It\u2019s now unsafe for him to return to Nigeria, which is why he wants his 68-year-old mother to come to the US. He hasn\u2019t seen her since 2014 and, if Trump is re-elected, he fears it will be at least another five years before they reunite. She\u2019ll probably miss the birth of his third child. \u201cNigerians have contributed to the development of this country, like every immigrant community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not criminals.\u201d Torn apart, with dwindling options Before the January announcement, the Trump administration had already clamped down on travel from Africa, including hikes in visa fees, and new obstacles and increased denials for Nigerians seeking approval for short-term visits. The US further suspended visitor visas from Eritrea in 2017. That means families have been fighting for years to use the dwindling avenues available to them to reunite, and for those who have invested significant time and money into the process, the sudden news of an outright ban was particularly brutal. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do, and it makes you feel so helpless,\u201d said Olumide, the veteran. Olumide arrived in the US from Nigeria when he was 10 years old. He met his wife in Nigeria in 2012 after he left the military, and the two got married last year. US Citizenship and Immigration Services approved the petition for his wife and daughter in January, just before the announcement of the ban. But they don\u2019t yet have their visas \u2013 and the ban may make it impossible to get them. Olumide had hoped they would be starting their lives together in the US by now, and said he was pained by feelings of guilt: \u201cI made promises to her.\u201d The couple hasn\u2019t fully processed the news, he added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to think about not being together.\u201d He noted that his daughter has typhoid and his wife has malaria, and he constantly fears for their health and safety. Hana Mohamed, a 20-year-old student in San Diego, who grew up in Sudan, said she was eager for her grandparents to come to the US, especially so her grandmother could get medical care in California: \u201cIt\u2019s just so sad and frustrating. They are getting older, and I want to see them before anything happens.\u201d Mohamed said it was difficult to accept that the US was banning large groups of Muslims in the name of safety while seeming to do little about the ongoing terror threat of American mass shootings: \u201cIt\u2019s just so shocking that we have come to this day where a whole nation of people are getting discriminated against. Isn\u2019t the purpose of the United States to stand up for everyone who is getting hurt and treat them right?\u201d One Eritrean American who works as an engineer in Silicon Valley, and requested anonymity for fear of hurting his family\u2019s case, has petitioned for his mother to come live with him in the US and was hoping she would soon get an interview date at the embassy. Then the new ban was unveiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited our turn. We\u2019ve followed the law. I\u2019m a tax-paying citizen contributing to the economy,\u201d he said, noting that his mother is 69 years old and lives alone in Eritrea. \u201cThis is just pure evil.\u201d He said he felt Trump was implementing the ban as a \u201csoundbite for the campaign\u201d while disregarding that it would leave Eritreans like his mother with no options: \u201cThis was our only hope to get her here.\u201d For Eritreans, the ban comes as as the Trump administration has ramped up deportations of Eritrean asylum seekers, despite the US government\u2019s own acknowledgment of the torture and arbitrary detention Eritreans are currently facing. Abraham Zere, an Eritrean journalist who was granted asylum in the US and now lives in Ohio, said it seemed some Eritreans were reluctant to speak out about the ban and live in fear of potential repercussions from both governments: \u201cPeople are scared to even discuss it.\u201d Zere\u2019s own family is affected: his mother is still in Eritrea, separated from her children. She can\u2019t even video chat with her family because of the poor internet in Eritrea, which means she never gets to see her granddaughter, an eight-year-old she hasn\u2019t yet met, he said. Some warn the ban may have life-or-death consequences. For queer and transgender migrants in the targeted countries, it could lead them to embark on perilous journeys to escape to the US as they run out of options, said Zack Mohamed, who is Somali American and a member of the Black LGBTQIA+ Migrant Project: \u201cThis is a big \u2018not welcome\u2019 sign in front of our faces.\u201d In response to questions about the impact on migrants fleeing violence, a US state department spokesperson said the ban was not meant to \u201climit the ability of an individual to seek asylum\u201d, adding: \u201cOur first priority remains national security. We continue to work with our dedicated consular officers in the field to identify and expedite those individuals with urgent travel needs.\u201d Asked about charges that the ban is discriminatory, the spokesperson said the restrictions are based on \u201cnationality\u201d and \u201cvisa category\u201d and that \u201cconsular officers do not adjudicate based on religion\u201d. The spokesperson said there were specific criteria to determine which countries are restricted and noted that Chad was on the original list but removed in 2018. Fighting to end the ban With the first travel ban upheld by the US supreme court, there are few recourses left to challenge the policy. Advocates are hoping a Democratic president will immediately repeal the ban and have also recently renewed the push for Congress to pass the No Ban Act, which would end the ban and prevent discriminatory immigration policies. Until then, Trump will continue to use his executive power to try to redefine what it means to be a citizen, advocates warned. \u201cThe president of the United States, the US government is explicitly trying to decide who gets to be an American,\u201d said Eric Naing, who is Burmese American and works with Muslim Advocates, a group that has challenged the ban. His family would not have been able to come to the US if the ban on Myanmar had been in place. \u201cHe\u2019s saying I shouldn\u2019t be American. My parents shouldn\u2019t be American. It\u2019s deeply upsetting.\u201d Olumide noted that the ban was punishing countless American citizens like him: \u201cIt\u2019s hurting the exact people you\u2019re trying to protect.\u201d",

The prison budget for 2018/19 was \u00a34.56bn: the cost of reoffending is \u00a315bn a year. Something isn\u2019t working. So what\u2019s the government\u2019s solution? Longer sentences and 10,000 more prison places. Whether this is stupidity or vindictiveness at work, we all pay. \u2022 A Bit of a Stretch by Chris Atkins is published by Atlantic (\u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>Tom Stoppard has said that his new play, the first since <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/01/the-hard-problem-tom-stoppard-review-dodges-big-question\" title=\"\">The Hard Problem</a></em> five years ago, may be his last. Both a summing-up and a surprise, it boxes with the dramatist\u2019s earlier work.</p> <p>As in <em>The Coast of Utopia</em> (2002), Stoppard paints on a large canvas: <strong><a href=\"https://leopoldstadtplay.com/\" title=\"\">Leopoldstadt</a></strong> rolls from 1899 to 1955, following a Jewish family in Vienna from burgeoning stability to persecution and depletion. Yet, as in his earlier, non-history plays, a teasing metaphor ducks and dives through the action. The younger Stoppard would surely have been tempted to call this \u201cCat\u2019s Cradle\u201d. The string-and-finger game recurs throughout the action as a delicate but insistent reminder of the importance of memory, of the web of connections in a family that is continually slipping and being reformed. It is seen on a child\u2019s hand in the opening moments when families, knotted together by marriage, pose for a dynastic portrait. It is used as a vital test of mental agility. It surfaces wonderfully in the closing scene as an unexpected link between two young men, one who has grown up with a history of Jewishness, the other who thinks of himself only as English: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had a rotten war,\u201d he flutes to his companion, many members of whose family have died in the camps.</p> <p>It is in this scene that the surprise \u2013 at least for those who, overlooking his play about passion, <em>The Real Thing</em>, insist on regarding Stoppard only as a cerebral gymnast \u2013 occurs. Flicking into personal revelation, raising the emotional voltage, the dramatist puts a version of himself on stage: Luke Thallon plays a comic writer, cricketer and flannelled English chap who is suddenly confronted with his own Jewishness. Thallon and Sebastian Armesto \u2013 taut, quick and watchful \u2013 are both strong here.</p> <p>Thallon, apparently able infinitely to transform himself, also appears in <em>Leopoldstadt</em>\u2019s most agonising scene. The paterfamilias, arts patron and textile manufacturer (Adrian Scarborough) who has married out \u2013 to a Catholic \u2013 confronts a young lieutenant in the dragoons about a supposed insult, only to realise he is talking to his wife\u2019s lover. As Fritz, Thallon frisks disdainfully, explaining he cannot duel with a Jew, since Jews have no honour to be impugned. Superb Scarborough moves from righteous bristling to shrinking dismay and utter unease: he makes you feel his skin hanging loose and clammy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66651f7a85034608fdfe895f5ad96e4ff1ffbb6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66651f7a85034608fdfe895f5ad96e4ff1ffbb6e/0_0_3985_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Stoppard, Alexis Zegerman, Faye Castelow and Adrian Scarborough in Leopoldstadt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Stoppard, Alexis Zegerman, Faye Castelow and Adrian Scarborough in Leopoldstadt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all scenes are as fully embodied. Some speeches are jammed with wodges of explanation, and there is some jerky-armed acting. This is not as damaging as it might be: the factual details fuel the plot, and these are characters who like to expound. There are squibs \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t mind Christmas because baby Jesus had no idea what was going on \u2013 but I feel funny about Easter eggs.\u201d There is a nice period texture to some acting: Faye Castelow \u2013 knowing, wispy and sensuous \u2013 is easily credible as a subject for Klimt. Most vitally, Patrick Marber\u2019s production strongly suggests the cat\u2019s cradle of these relationships: Richard Hudson\u2019s design encompasses a world and its death in one lofty room; Neil Austin\u2019s lighting at first washes everyone (there is a cast of nearly 40) with a tint of sepia, later drains the few who are left of warmth and colour.</p> <p>What a tremendous week for dramatic writing. Long-reaching, explosive, far-seeing. Forget Storm Ciara: at the Dorfman, Storm Rafe has landed.

      "bodyText": "Tom Stoppard has said that his new play, the first since The Hard Problem five years ago, may be his last. Both a summing-up and a surprise, it boxes with the dramatist\u2019s earlier work. As in The Coast of Utopia (2002), Stoppard paints on a large canvas: Leopoldstadt rolls from 1899 to 1955, following a Jewish family in Vienna from burgeoning stability to persecution and depletion. Yet, as in his earlier, non-history plays, a teasing metaphor ducks and dives through the action. The younger Stoppard would surely have been tempted to call this \u201cCat\u2019s Cradle\u201d. The string-and-finger game recurs throughout the action as a delicate but insistent reminder of the importance of memory, of the web of connections in a family that is continually slipping and being reformed. It is seen on a child\u2019s hand in the opening moments when families, knotted together by marriage, pose for a dynastic portrait. It is used as a vital test of mental agility. It surfaces wonderfully in the closing scene as an unexpected link between two young men, one who has grown up with a history of Jewishness, the other who thinks of himself only as English: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had a rotten war,\u201d he flutes to his companion, many members of whose family have died in the camps. It is in this scene that the surprise \u2013 at least for those who, overlooking his play about passion, The Real Thing, insist on regarding Stoppard only as a cerebral gymnast \u2013 occurs. Flicking into personal revelation, raising the emotional voltage, the dramatist puts a version of himself on stage: Luke Thallon plays a comic writer, cricketer and flannelled English chap who is suddenly confronted with his own Jewishness. Thallon and Sebastian Armesto \u2013 taut, quick and watchful \u2013 are both strong here. Thallon, apparently able infinitely to transform himself, also appears in Leopoldstadt\u2019s most agonising scene. The paterfamilias, arts patron and textile manufacturer (Adrian Scarborough) who has married out \u2013 to a Catholic \u2013 confronts a young lieutenant in the dragoons about a supposed insult, only to realise he is talking to his wife\u2019s lover. As Fritz, Thallon frisks disdainfully, explaining he cannot duel with a Jew, since Jews have no honour to be impugned. Superb Scarborough moves from righteous bristling to shrinking dismay and utter unease: he makes you feel his skin hanging loose and clammy. Not all scenes are as fully embodied. Some speeches are jammed with wodges of explanation, and there is some jerky-armed acting. This is not as damaging as it might be: the factual details fuel the plot, and these are characters who like to expound. There are squibs \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t mind Christmas because baby Jesus had no idea what was going on \u2013 but I feel funny about Easter eggs.\u201d There is a nice period texture to some acting: Faye Castelow \u2013 knowing, wispy and sensuous \u2013 is easily credible as a subject for Klimt. Most vitally, Patrick Marber\u2019s production strongly suggests the cat\u2019s cradle of these relationships: Richard Hudson\u2019s design encompasses a world and its death in one lofty room; Neil Austin\u2019s lighting at first washes everyone (there is a cast of nearly 40) with a tint of sepia, later drains the few who are left of warmth and colour. What a tremendous week for dramatic writing. Long-reaching, explosive, far-seeing. Forget Storm Ciara: at the Dorfman, Storm Rafe has landed. With a grin and a roar and flying arms, Rafe Spall hits the boards as if yanked by a monstrous puppeteer. He almost cartwheels along a stage terrifically reconfigured by designers Sadeysa Greenaway-Bailey and Ultz as a St George\u2019s Cross, torn bleeding from the Union Jack. Around the action, framed like a series of installations in glass boxes, are the trappings of a life: a pair of scarlet boxing gloves, a Meghan Markle-Harry Windsor tray, a Sunday joint of roast lamb. This is, from the start, a career-changing performance \u2013 in a play that takes the temperature of the nation and finds it fevered. It is a significant occasion. Death of England, written by two black British men, Roy Williams and Clint Dyer (who also directs), takes seriously the ire of a white working-class English man, indeed identifies rage as his default position.

Bananas fall on to a football pitch like grenades. Resentment does not need a genuine target: in a world of hostile tribes, it will simply swell up to fill a vacuum.

Bong\u2019s stinging \u2013 and at times hilarious \u2013 commentary on the friction generated by poverty\u2019s proximity to wealth could bring financial benefits to some of Ahyeon-dong\u2019s residents, however, via guided tours planned by the city government. One of the tours takes in five locations around Seoul that have resonated with Parasite audiences, including the Pig Rice supermarket where Ki-woo, the Kims\u2019 20-something son, drinks soju spirit with a friend, a concrete stairway in a nearby alleyway that leads to the Kim family\u2019s semi-basement flat, the Jahamun road tunnel, and the Sky Pizza parlour that employs the family to fold boxes for a pittance. Last week, stray dogs and cats roamed the streets, while young women took selfies, and photographers and TV crews filmed the shop. \u201cMy husband and I thought it was such an honour for our shop to appear in Parasite,\u201d its 72-year-old owner, Kim Kyung-soon, says. \u201cThen we saw the news about the Oscars. The film kept winning and winning. We stayed up celebrating all night, along with everyone else in South Korea.\u201d But not everyone is happy, with one resident concerned that interest in its dilapidated architecture would put a halt to rumoured redevelopment plans. \u201cIf the Parasite tours take off, there will be pressure to preserve these buildings and that will mean the end of the redevelopment plan,\u201d he says. \u201cThat would be a disaster. We\u2019ve been waiting for it for years. The ceiling in my place is leaking water and we are biding our time until the day we can move out. We don\u2019t want our neighbourhood to stay like this because of a movie.\u201d But Um Hang-gi, the owner of Sky Pizza, where sales have soared since the Oscars, is savouring the attention. \u201cJust think of all the upstarts in our society who get rich quick through deceit and scheming,\u201d says Um, who has placed a poster in the window lauding her business\u2019s minor role in Bong\u2019s success. \u201cThey don\u2019t care who gets hurt.\u201d Despite having seen the film three times, Lee Seung-jin, a 28-year-old designer who lives nearby, says he is offended by the idea of \u201cpoverty tourism\u201d. \u201cParasite is a parody about the gap between the rich and the poor, so for city officials to come up with the idea for these tours is ridiculous. Shouldn\u2019t they be working to narrow the wealth gap instead of parading poor people around for tourists to gawp at?\u201d",

Poetry<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqu4ezLQEUA\" title=\"\"><strong>Sabrina Benaim</strong></a></p> <p>I\u2019ve been into performance poetry since I was a teenager (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/18/chapter-and-verse-saul-williams-new-album-martyrloserking\" title=\"\">Saul Williams</a> film <em>Slam</em> had a huge effect on me), but I don\u2019t go to live events these days because I\u2019ve got three kids so I watch online instead. One of my favourite YouTube channels is <a href=\"https://buttonpoetry.com/tag/sabrina-benaim/\" title=\"\">Button Poetry</a>, where you can find a Canadian poet called Sabrina Benaim. Not only is she a brilliant poet, she\u2019s a fantastic performer too \u2013 I find her extremely engaging and watch her poems a lot. She\u2019s a chronicler of love, disappointment, depression and all of the other stuff that makes for great performance poetry.</p> <h2>3.

You can\u2019t believe one person can take so much pain and then become a world-renowned poet, performer and intellectual. It relates how Sissay\u2019s mother came to the UK from Ethiopia to study, got pregnant, and was forced to give him up for adoption. He went through the brutal British care system and was subject to abuse and humiliation, but he was in possession of an extremely fine mind and started writing poetry. Our culture is a deluge of terrible news and pain but there are still these examples of human goodness and resilience, and to me he embodies that.</p> <h2>4.

I don\u2019t want to ruin it, but it features one of the most heartstopping endings I\u2019ve ever experienced in a theatre. The play is about a middle-class black family in America and to begin with it could be an episode of <em>The Cosby Show</em>, with a gaudy set and exaggerated acting style. Then the scene is replayed but with white people commenting over it. Then the white people turn up in the scene and act out stereotypical depictions of black people. It was beautifully performed, wonderfully staged and it has really stuck with me.</p> <h2>5.

I\u2019ve always had a fascination with standup and I\u2019ve watched pretty much every comedian\u2019s TV special in the past three years. The one that really made me piss myself was Amy Schumer\u2019s <em>Growing</em>. She is absolutely at the top of her game. It\u2019s just masterful and so funny my wife was worried about me because I was laughing so much. Schumer was talking about pregnancy, with moments of seriousness and weight amid the laughs. It really is relentlessly, sidesplittingly funny.</p> <h2>6.

But the nearest town to me, Nailsworth, has a fish restaurant and deli which I can hand on heart say is absolutely world class. It\u2019s one of the best restaurants I\u2019ve ever been to but it\u2019s an everyday place \u2013 you\u2019d go there all the time. The food is really fresh and cooked with love \u2013 they do the greatest fish stew known to mankind \u2013 and the staff are amazing. It\u2019s a lifesaver: it\u2019s made my move to the countryside a whole lot easier.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rafe Spall was born in Camberwell, south London, in March 1983. He joined the National Youth Theatre at 15 and despite rejection by Rada threw himself into an acting career, inspired in part by his father, Timothy. He has appeared in more than 50 films and TV shows, notably Edgar Wright\u2019s Cornetto trilogy, Life of Pi, Black Mirror and the BBC\u2019s The War of the Worlds. Spall is married to the actor Elize du Toit, with whom he has three children, and is starring in the one-man show Death of England at the National Theatre until 7 March. 1. Music CASisDEAD I heard a song called Pat Earrings by the London rapper CASisDEAD a couple of years ago and was so struck by it that I got his email address from Instagram and emailed him, saying: \u201cDamn, this is one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Now we\u2019ve struck up this friendship, but only over text message. No one\u2019s ever seen his face \u2013 he raps in a mask. He\u2019s only released a couple of mixtapes so far, but his particular brand of hip-hop fits in the apex of my musical tastes: it\u2019s a bit like London Posse crossed with Kate Bush \u2013 and I just think he\u2019s the best rapper in the UK right now. 2. Poetry Sabrina Benaim I\u2019ve been into performance poetry since I was a teenager (the Saul Williams film Slam had a huge effect on me), but I don\u2019t go to live events these days because I\u2019ve got three kids so I watch online instead. One of my favourite YouTube channels is Button Poetry, where you can find a Canadian poet called Sabrina Benaim. Not only is she a brilliant poet, she\u2019s a fantastic performer too \u2013 I find her extremely engaging and watch her poems a lot. She\u2019s a chronicler of love, disappointment, depression and all of the other stuff that makes for great performance poetry. 3. Book My Name Is Why by Lemn Sissay This is one of the most moving books I\u2019ve ever read. You can\u2019t believe one person can take so much pain and then become a world-renowned poet, performer and intellectual. It relates how Sissay\u2019s mother came to the UK from Ethiopia to study, got pregnant, and was forced to give him up for adoption. He went through the brutal British care system and was subject to abuse and humiliation, but he was in possession of an extremely fine mind and started writing poetry. Our culture is a deluge of terrible news and pain but there are still these examples of human goodness and resilience, and to me he embodies that. 4. Theatre Fairview I saw Fairview at the Young Vic before it finished: it\u2019s about race and the depiction of black people in popular culture. I don\u2019t want to ruin it, but it features one of the most heartstopping endings I\u2019ve ever experienced in a theatre. The play is about a middle-class black family in America and to begin with it could be an episode of The Cosby Show, with a gaudy set and exaggerated acting style. Then the scene is replayed but with white people commenting over it. Then the white people turn up in the scene and act out stereotypical depictions of black people. It was beautifully performed, wonderfully staged and it has really stuck with me. 5. Comedy Growing by Amy Schumer, Netflix I\u2019m doing a one-man play at the moment and to get my head around it I watched a lot of standup. I\u2019ve always had a fascination with standup and I\u2019ve watched pretty much every comedian\u2019s TV special in the past three years. The one that really made me piss myself was Amy Schumer\u2019s Growing. She is absolutely at the top of her game. It\u2019s just masterful and so funny my wife was worried about me because I was laughing so much. Schumer was talking about pregnancy, with moments of seriousness and weight amid the laughs. It really is relentlessly, sidesplittingly funny. 6. Restaurant William\u2019s, Nailsworth I moved to the Cotswolds last year and as a dyed-in-the-wool Londoner and lover of restaurants I was worried \u2013 I thought I was leaving good food behind. But the nearest town to me, Nailsworth, has a fish restaurant and deli which I can hand on heart say is absolutely world class. It\u2019s one of the best restaurants I\u2019ve ever been to but it\u2019s an everyday place \u2013 you\u2019d go there all the time. The food is really fresh and cooked with love \u2013 they do the greatest fish stew known to mankind \u2013 and the staff are amazing. It\u2019s a lifesaver: it\u2019s made my move to the countryside a whole lot easier.",

      "body": "<p>Why must things change, I wonder? Why can\u2019t they just be the same for ever? It is a common grievance, and one of the main factors that drove the pro-Brexit vote. Thankfully, soon \u201cthings\u201d will be able to go back to being \u201clike they were\u201d. A Clarks Commando shoe, with white dog muck in the treads, will moon-stomp on a Remoaner\u2019s face \u2013 for ever.</p> <p>Words, however, have a habit of changing their meanings, and the fact that I am submitting this week\u2019s column from a medical isolation tent at an undisclosed emergency location proves their fluid nature. Bear with me. Imagine, for example, that I were to come into work and say: \u201cHello. I am gay today!\u201d Once, not long ago, everyone would have assumed I meant I was happy. But the word \u201cgay\u201d officially transitioned to meaning \u201chomosexual\u201d on 5 July 1960, its new coinage minted by Benny Hill in the Tommy Steele vehicle <em>Light Up </em><em>the Sky!</em>, a Brechtian comedy about a man trying to get his wedding cake iced by a recidivist Northern Irish baker.</p> <p>The last people to use the word \u201cgay\u201d to mean \u201chappy\u201d were the Flintstones, who were still promising viewers a \u201cgay old time\u201d as recently as 1966. To be fair, <em>The Flintstones</em> was set between 9000 and 2000 BCE, so it is possible they intended to hold up a mirror to the prehistoric attitudes of the era, while not necessarily endorsing them, like how \u201cthe ironic standup comedy of \u2018The Wokefinder General\u2019\u201d (\u00a9 Sarah Vine, <em>The Daily Mail</em>, 2020) Ricky Gervais does.</p> <p>By the 80s, however, the word \u201cgay\u201d was an insult in some circles. Indeed, when asked, by <em>Metal Mania</em> magazine in 1986, if he would ever use keyboards in a song, Anthrax\u2019s drummer, Charlie Benante, said: \u201cNo. That is gay.\u201d In 1990, I found myself in a music shop watching an instruction video in which Benante explained how some drums were in fact gay. Then, in 1992, I accidentally saw Anthrax live. They had a massive clock on stage, but its speeding hands, intended to illustrate humanity\u2019s race to oblivion, got stuck at 4pm, leaving Anthrax thrashing furiously and for ever in an eternal tea-time time-loop. Which was gay.</p> <p>Today, liberal values have been inculcated into society so thoroughly, only the drummer from Anthrax would still use the word \u201cgay\u201d as an insult, and even then only to a musical instrument. The best way to insult homosexuals today is to call them \u201cbumboys\u201d, as we have learned from the sterling work of our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-A-Bob-For-Big-Ben\u2019s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Johnson.</p> <p>Like the word \u201cgay\u201d, the word \u201cCorona\u201d has changed its meaning too. When I thought of \u201cCorona\u201d as a child, I did not think of a planet-ravaging virus. I thought of a colourful range of Welsh carbonated soft drinks, sold in bottles with 10p returnable deposits, and delivered direct to our door by the be-aproned Corona Man himself, And he was a jolly ruddy-faced tradesman, not an embodiment of global viral doom.</p> <p>The Corona Man would park his yellow flatbed truck in the communal car park, and scamper along our row of terraced houses with his basket of joy-inducing psychedelic fizz-milk. But the Corona factory in south Wales closed in 1987, after a eulogy from Tom Jones, who drank an entire bottle of dandelion and burdock and then retched The Last Post in burps into the microphone. It was the Corona Man, incredibly, who taught me how to ride a bike, taking pity on me as I fumbled and fell on the shared grass out front, and perhaps eyeing my obviously single mother, like a tartrazine Robin Askwith. Within a few months of The Corona Man\u2019s brief weekly instruction, I stopped crying and I was stable in the saddle. I was 28 years old. I\u2019m joking, of course.</p> <p>As the 70s shifted into the 80s, Corona\u2019s fortunes wavered, and the humiliating outfits the Corona Man was forced to wear on his Corona round reflected the company\u2019s desperation. In 1979, he delivered dressed as a giant bottle of Corona, his eyes peeping mournfully through tiny slits. By the end, he waddled round in a rubber fat-suit, his face painted bright orange like the anthropomorphised bubbles in the company\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nue8j_52M6Q\" title=\"\">Let\u2019s Get Fizzical</a>\u201d adverts, and The Corona Man was too ashamed to meet my gaze, despite our former intimacy. I got my fizz fix from cider now, and left for university, never to return. Deliveries ceased.</p> <p>Last week, a man came up to me after a standup show in Sheffield. He said he had lived, as a child, in the room I once lived in, in the house where I grew up, after my mum moved to Worcestershire. I suddenly felt humbled. After two-and-a-half hours of pretending to be someone, and something, else, I knew that this stranger would be able to locate me, socially and historically, and that he knew exactly who I really was.</p> <p>\u201cDid the man still deliver Corona when you were there?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe virus?\u201d the stranger said, \u201csomeone delivered a deadly virus to your home?

      "bodyText": "Why must things change, I wonder? Why can\u2019t they just be the same for ever? It is a common grievance, and one of the main factors that drove the pro-Brexit vote. Thankfully, soon \u201cthings\u201d will be able to go back to being \u201clike they were\u201d. A Clarks Commando shoe, with white dog muck in the treads, will moon-stomp on a Remoaner\u2019s face \u2013 for ever. Words, however, have a habit of changing their meanings, and the fact that I am submitting this week\u2019s column from a medical isolation tent at an undisclosed emergency location proves their fluid nature. Bear with me. Imagine, for example, that I were to come into work and say: \u201cHello. I am gay today!\u201d Once, not long ago, everyone would have assumed I meant I was happy. But the word \u201cgay\u201d officially transitioned to meaning \u201chomosexual\u201d on 5 July 1960, its new coinage minted by Benny Hill in the Tommy Steele vehicle Light Up the Sky!, a Brechtian comedy about a man trying to get his wedding cake iced by a recidivist Northern Irish baker. The last people to use the word \u201cgay\u201d to mean \u201chappy\u201d were the Flintstones, who were still promising viewers a \u201cgay old time\u201d as recently as 1966. To be fair, The Flintstones was set between 9000 and 2000 BCE, so it is possible they intended to hold up a mirror to the prehistoric attitudes of the era, while not necessarily endorsing them, like how \u201cthe ironic standup comedy of \u2018The Wokefinder General\u2019\u201d (\u00a9 Sarah Vine, The Daily Mail, 2020) Ricky Gervais does. By the 80s, however, the word \u201cgay\u201d was an insult in some circles. Indeed, when asked, by Metal Mania magazine in 1986, if he would ever use keyboards in a song, Anthrax\u2019s drummer, Charlie Benante, said: \u201cNo. That is gay.\u201d In 1990, I found myself in a music shop watching an instruction video in which Benante explained how some drums were in fact gay. Then, in 1992, I accidentally saw Anthrax live. They had a massive clock on stage, but its speeding hands, intended to illustrate humanity\u2019s race to oblivion, got stuck at 4pm, leaving Anthrax thrashing furiously and for ever in an eternal tea-time time-loop. Which was gay. Today, liberal values have been inculcated into society so thoroughly, only the drummer from Anthrax would still use the word \u201cgay\u201d as an insult, and even then only to a musical instrument. The best way to insult homosexuals today is to call them \u201cbumboys\u201d, as we have learned from the sterling work of our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-A-Bob-For-Big-Ben\u2019s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Johnson. Like the word \u201cgay\u201d, the word \u201cCorona\u201d has changed its meaning too. When I thought of \u201cCorona\u201d as a child, I did not think of a planet-ravaging virus. I thought of a colourful range of Welsh carbonated soft drinks, sold in bottles with 10p returnable deposits, and delivered direct to our door by the be-aproned Corona Man himself, And he was a jolly ruddy-faced tradesman, not an embodiment of global viral doom. The Corona Man would park his yellow flatbed truck in the communal car park, and scamper along our row of terraced houses with his basket of joy-inducing psychedelic fizz-milk. But the Corona factory in south Wales closed in 1987, after a eulogy from Tom Jones, who drank an entire bottle of dandelion and burdock and then retched The Last Post in burps into the microphone. It was the Corona Man, incredibly, who taught me how to ride a bike, taking pity on me as I fumbled and fell on the shared grass out front, and perhaps eyeing my obviously single mother, like a tartrazine Robin Askwith. Within a few months of The Corona Man\u2019s brief weekly instruction, I stopped crying and I was stable in the saddle. I was 28 years old. I\u2019m joking, of course. As the 70s shifted into the 80s, Corona\u2019s fortunes wavered, and the humiliating outfits the Corona Man was forced to wear on his Corona round reflected the company\u2019s desperation. In 1979, he delivered dressed as a giant bottle of Corona, his eyes peeping mournfully through tiny slits. By the end, he waddled round in a rubber fat-suit, his face painted bright orange like the anthropomorphised bubbles in the company\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Get Fizzical\u201d adverts, and The Corona Man was too ashamed to meet my gaze, despite our former intimacy. I got my fizz fix from cider now, and left for university, never to return. Deliveries ceased. Last week, a man came up to me after a standup show in Sheffield. He said he had lived, as a child, in the room I once lived in, in the house where I grew up, after my mum moved to Worcestershire. I suddenly felt humbled. After two-and-a-half hours of pretending to be someone, and something, else, I knew that this stranger would be able to locate me, socially and historically, and that he knew exactly who I really was. \u201cDid the man still deliver Corona when you were there?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe virus?\u201d the stranger said, \u201csomeone delivered a deadly virus to your home? What do you mean?\u201d A mild panic ensued at the merchandise table and people reached for their hand sanitisers before hurrying away. \u201cNo. Corona!\u201d, I shouted, \u201cCorona. A man gave it me every week and I drank loads of it. He\u2019ll be dead by now I expect.\u201d This, to be fair, only added to the confusion, and suddenly I found myself spirited away by insistent health officials in protective clothing. Perhaps when boffins christen the next virus, they could spare a thought for the fond childhood memories they may be trampling under their sock-and-sandalled feet.

      "body": "<p>Picture the archetypal Love Island contestant: beautiful, glamorous, exuding confidence. Then picture them again, when you\u2019ve come to know them after a few days on the screen: vulnerable, temperamental, far more fragile than you might initially have suspected.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not hard to see why viewers took presenter Caroline Flack \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/15/former-love-island-presenter-caroline-flack-dies-aged-40\">who has died aged 40</a> \u2013 to their hearts. She was a key factor in the show\u2019s stratospheric success because she was, in many ways, no different to the show\u2019s stars. It could almost have been Flack strutting into the villa herself, looking for love in the unmistakably rocky way the show liked to depict.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-boyfriend-lewis-burton-heartbroken-by-her-death-love-island\">Caroline Flack's boyfriend Lewis Burton 'heartbroken' by her death</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Love Island is \u2013 and maybe now we should really be saying was \u2013 a ludicrous concept. Many viewers tuned in, at least partly, to laugh at the whole affair. Countless presenters might have viewed themselves as above the whole thing. Yet Flack seemed to relate to the rollercoasting emotions of those in the villa with an earnestness at odds with the show itself. She seemed to be genuinely rooting for these people to find love. She was a fangirl as much as a frontwoman and her presenting gig seemed to be the perfect match.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811eba5dd6e38f7aeadfef668e016e99ce92b2ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/811eba5dd6e38f7aeadfef668e016e99ce92b2ec/0_70_4052_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The perfect match.

Former contestant Amy Hart once revealed how Flack had squeezed her hand to subtly hint that all was not well with her relationship, and that she might want to stop talking so effusively about it. Last night Kady McDermott, who starred in the show\u2019s second series, posted a typical tribute when she wrote: \u201cCaroline was nothing but kind to me and that\u2019s how I will always remember her.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28d315a6-fdf1-4b49-a639-657c45b401e4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1KgHK1VaSlQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As a sparky presenter on other shows such as the X Factor, Flack struck up a similar rapport with viewers and contestants. She wasn\u2019t always the most seamless presenter \u2013 but what made her stand out was, perhaps, the relatable hint of a wilder, less PR-honed side.<strong> </strong>Her brief relationship with One Direction\u2019s Harry Styles, who she met on the set of the X Factor while he was still a teenager, might not have caused as much fuss if the genders were reversed (at least not back in 2011) but she recounted being called a \u201cpervert\u201d in the street over their 14-year age gap, while the press had a field day.</p> \n<p>Many viewers knew Flack had her demons. She had talked in interviews about winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2014 and being hit by depression, making it clear that fame was no antidote to unhappiness: \u201cI felt ridiculous, being so sad when I\u2019d just won the biggest show on telly,\u201d she told an interviewer. On an Instagram post late last year, she wrote about her mental health: \u201cThe last few weeks I\u2019ve been in a really weird place ... I find it hard to talk about it ... I guess it\u2019s anxiety and pressure of life,\u201d she posted alongside a photograph of herself, concluding: \u201cBe nice to people. You never know what\u2019s going on. Ever.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3m_uT1FqP4/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I certainly hate talking about my feelings. And being a burden is my biggest fear.... I\u2019m lucky to be able to pick myself up when things feel shit. But what happens if someone can\u2019t .

      "bodyText": "Picture the archetypal Love Island contestant: beautiful, glamorous, exuding confidence. Then picture them again, when you\u2019ve come to know them after a few days on the screen: vulnerable, temperamental, far more fragile than you might initially have suspected. It\u2019s not hard to see why viewers took presenter Caroline Flack \u2013 who has died aged 40 \u2013 to their hearts. She was a key factor in the show\u2019s stratospheric success because she was, in many ways, no different to the show\u2019s stars. It could almost have been Flack strutting into the villa herself, looking for love in the unmistakably rocky way the show liked to depict. Love Island is \u2013 and maybe now we should really be saying was \u2013 a ludicrous concept. Many viewers tuned in, at least partly, to laugh at the whole affair. Countless presenters might have viewed themselves as above the whole thing. Yet Flack seemed to relate to the rollercoasting emotions of those in the villa with an earnestness at odds with the show itself. She seemed to be genuinely rooting for these people to find love. She was a fangirl as much as a frontwoman and her presenting gig seemed to be the perfect match. Contestants rarely left the villa with a bad word to say about her. Former contestant Amy Hart once revealed how Flack had squeezed her hand to subtly hint that all was not well with her relationship, and that she might want to stop talking so effusively about it. Last night Kady McDermott, who starred in the show\u2019s second series, posted a typical tribute when she wrote: \u201cCaroline was nothing but kind to me and that\u2019s how I will always remember her.\u201d As a sparky presenter on other shows such as the X Factor, Flack struck up a similar rapport with viewers and contestants. She wasn\u2019t always the most seamless presenter \u2013 but what made her stand out was, perhaps, the relatable hint of a wilder, less PR-honed side. Her brief relationship with One Direction\u2019s Harry Styles, who she met on the set of the X Factor while he was still a teenager, might not have caused as much fuss if the genders were reversed (at least not back in 2011) but she recounted being called a \u201cpervert\u201d in the street over their 14-year age gap, while the press had a field day. Many viewers knew Flack had her demons. She had talked in interviews about winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2014 and being hit by depression, making it clear that fame was no antidote to unhappiness: \u201cI felt ridiculous, being so sad when I\u2019d just won the biggest show on telly,\u201d she told an interviewer. On an Instagram post late last year, she wrote about her mental health: \u201cThe last few weeks I\u2019ve been in a really weird place ... I find it hard to talk about it ... I guess it\u2019s anxiety and pressure of life,\u201d she posted alongside a photograph of herself, concluding: \u201cBe nice to people. You never know what\u2019s going on. Ever.\u201d Her forthcoming trial, for which she was accused of attacking her boyfriend Lewis Burton while he slept, was a shock. She was forced to step back from presenting Love Island\u2019s inaugural winter edition and became a tabloid target. Her career looked as if it might have been over. And now, harrowingly, there\u2019s this \u2013 the kind of news that is tragic and stomach-churning but also anger-inducing. A few months ago, Flack had a bright future. Now she joins the list of young women hounded relentlessly by the media during a time of crisis which seems to have become too much for her to cope with.

For those who are in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or educational setting, no restrictions or special control measures are required while laboratory test results for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/what-is-covid-19\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a> are awaited.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need to close the setting or send other learners or staff home. Therefore, until the outcome of test results is known, there is no action that staff members need to take.

      "bodyText": "Schools and nurseries do not need to close or send pupils home in the event of contact with someone suspected of having the coronavirus, according to new guidelines to be issued to schools across the UK this week. In the face of confusion over what the correct response should be, Public Health England and the Department for Education are to issue headteachers and childcare providers with fresh guidance on Monday . Some schools in Brighton and Hove have told parents they can choose to keep their children off school as \u201cauthorised absences\u201d, after five people from the area were diagnosed with the virus, also known as Covid-19. But a department spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are aware that some schools have said that parents can keep their children at home \u2013 this is not the advice. For those who are in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or educational setting, no restrictions or special control measures are required while laboratory test results for Covid-19 are awaited. \u201cThere is no need to close the setting or send other learners or staff home. Therefore, until the outcome of test results is known, there is no action that staff members need to take. People who test negative for Covid-19 will be advised individually about their return to education.\u201d She said it was helpful for schools to approach the virus like any other infectious disease. \u201cTherefore, it is not advised that the whole school is notified that an individual is undergoing testing. Rather, communications to contacts would be circulated if a case is confirmed,\u201d she added. So far, 3,000 people have been tested for the disease in the UK and there have been nine confirmed cases. If a child is suspected of having contracted the disease, it is their parents\u2019 responsibility to inform the school that the child is staying off in order to get tested or because the child needs to self-isolate, the spokeswoman added. The local health protection team would only inform the school directly when a child is confirmed to have the virus. \u201cIf a case is confirmed, then the local health protection team would speak to the headteacher and action would be taken from there,\u201d she said. Schools affected by coronavirus outbreaks in their area have been given bespoke advice by the authorities. At some schools in Brighton and Hove, the majority of parents are choosing to keep their children at home, after receiving letters from headteachers warning that someone connected with their schools had been asked to undergo testing or had self-isolated due to the coronavirus. They are being told that such absences will be authorised by the school, an unusual step that the fresh guidance makes clear is not necessary.

Schools will be particularly mindful to take care of the emotional needs of international students who are unable to travel home during the half-term break.\u201d Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe advice and guidance which has been issued is sensible and proportionate.

      "body": "<p>The male gaze can be harshest when directed at the self. Until puberty, I was blissfully unaware of my own body, aside from the odd graze or bee sting. But then, at the age of 11 or 12, my body became a contested space. In the steaming showers after PE, I compared myself unfavourably to others, both my classmates and what I saw in the wider culture. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t alone in finding that infamous Coca-Cola window-cleaner advert (in which a shirtless man tantalises an office full of women) to be 30 seconds of highly triggering humiliation \u2013 and a (low-calorie) modicum of sweet revenge for all the years of men doing the same to women.</p> <p>Yet watching the video again as I write this essay on how to explore the buffeted nature of modern masculinity against the physicality of the male body itself, I can easily recall that awkward, resentful twinge. For the past quarter-century or so, my life staring at men has been a complicated experience \u2013 a signal to arousal, yes, but also to fright and flight; to self-loathing at my own physical inadequacy.</p> <p>During those years, looking at pictures of men who populate the Barbican\u2019s new exhibition <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/masculinities-liberation-through-photography?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkdOyrL3Y5wIVWODtCh16xAoCEAAYASAAEgJAqfD_BwE\">Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography </a>would, like a highbrow take on that TV ad, have sent me to a terrible and negative place. The artfully posed muscular bodies, the confident eye meeting the camera\u2019s lens, the camaraderie among queers and straights alike, the performance of group ritual \u2013 they might as well have been aliens. How did I connect with these masculine ideals of fashion and sport?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"394348ee59d71f39d5d97d8466bbadf6855ba4fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/394348ee59d71f39d5d97d8466bbadf6855ba4fc/0_0_2250_3000/750.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Opie, Rusty, 2008.

During successive waves of feminism, women have explored different tactical approaches to redefine themselves against an oppression that stretches back beyond recorded history. Men, however, failed. We never had conversations among ourselves about this realignment, and nor did we seek to engage effectively with what was being said around us. Even gay rights activists and feminists struggled to get along. Instead, we doubled down and hoped it might all go away. The cultural thuggery of 90s laddism was business as usual, the same pernicious attitudes allowed to continue, merely disguised with a veneer of irony.</p> <p>After the joy of a childhood full of parental love, my teenage years coincided with that boorish decade, throughout which mainstream TV programmes from <em>Friends</em> to <em>Fantasy Football</em> were drearily conformist in their representations of gender. Struggling to understand my bisexual identity, I came up against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/25/qanda.rostaylor\" title=\"\">Section 28</a>, which the Tories used to legislate loneliness by forbidding the \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality in schools. My all-boys comprehensive was a hormonal soup I despaired at being boiled in, the hierarchy decided by playground football, prowess with girls, expensive sportswear.</p> <p>In the seven years I was there, I never knew of a single out gay or bisexual pupil \u2013 just hateful whispers. The deranged and lonely testosterone flood carried me to the dank caverns of local public toilets, where I was taken advantage of by a succession of grim older men. I told myself that this was just a rite of passage, unable to see myself as a victim of these predators who leered at my 14-year-old self through bulging eyes.</p> <p>Men frequently never seem to leave puberty \u2013 and destructive patterns become ossified into adulthood. I explored this in a memoir, which I began writing, during a period of intense personal turmoil, as a book about a forest near London. I hadn\u2019t thought it was about masculinity, but bisexuality, bullying, recovery from abuse, depression, isolation, sexual compulsion, even how we define ourselves against or within nature, all of which have at their roots the impossible expectations of gender.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ea4fa38b271d627f086aceae0dabe52411d6a5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ea4fa38b271d627f086aceae0dabe52411d6a5f/0_0_5965_6000/994.jpg\" alt=\"Rotimi Fani-Kayode Untitled, 1985 \u00a9 Rotimi Fani-Kayode Courtesy of Autograph, London\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rotimi Fani-Kayode, Untitled, 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rotimi Fani-Kayode/Courtesy of Autograph, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I write this not because I think my situation was unique, but because I suspect it was nearly universal. Even those young men who pretend to fit in frequently don\u2019t, but instead are pushed into denying their true complicated selves for the sake of acceptance in the wider group. When are any young men taught to be in touch with their bodies, to explore them as the sensuous manifestation of their true selves? The male mind and body are frequently in a turmoil of shame and self-denial, resulting in a mental health crisis that means suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK.</p> <p>Just as I don\u2019t believe anybody is entirely straight or gay, there\u2019s an unrecognised fluidity beyond the self-identified gender fluid. Why do we seem to have forgotten that cis-gendered masculinity is in itself a broad and beautiful, diverse spectrum? As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/30/walt-whitman-lost-health-advice-men-beards-sex\" title=\"\">Walt Whitman</a> put it in his heroic, erotic and at the time controversial poetic hymn to masculine and feminine personhood, Song of Myself: \u201cI am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d He wrote those lines in the mid-1850s, yet 170 years later, they can still feel ahead of our time.</p> <p>The contemporary debate around gender has hardly helped. It frequently treats masculinity as a lumpen identity, with the accusation of toxicity applied to all. As someone who has spent my life suffering from the consequences of negative maleness, through predatory abuse, biphobia, bullying, the drunken screams of \u201cfucking poof\u201d and that constant and overpowering sense of threat that paves the nocturnal streets of little England, this has been hard to process.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Toxicity in male identity is not elemental and inevitable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I constantly see men pushed to extremes by the nature of the contemporary conversation. I am as wary of a performative wearer of a \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like\u201d T-shirt as I am the disciples of the \u201ceat steak and tidy your room\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\" title=\"\">Jordan Peterson</a> doctrine. Both have embraced the comfort of simplistic and binary positions, exactly the opposite of what we all so desperately need. </p> <p>There\u2019s a contradiction in a discourse that on the one hand claims that male privilege, entitlement and the patriarchy are the most powerful forces of oppression humanity has ever created, and on the other would (understandably) like men to process this quickly, and without fuss.</p> <p>If having the upper hand for centuries breeds an entitlement that means men find it hard to realise that they\u2019ve benefitted from systems of male privilege \u2013 even if they have frequently been the victims of it \u2013 then to deal with this is going to take time. This isn\u2019t to make excuses, but to say that in a world darkened by binary thinking, collaboration and solidarity between all genders is the only thing that will get us through. \u201cLove\u2019s the only engine of survival,\u201d as Leonard Cohen had it, and Leonard Cohen was usually right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"16664a8c49b2d75fb075e83fbf39c40b7715fe81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16664a8c49b2d75fb075e83fbf39c40b7715fe81/73_1469_5314_5350/993.jpg\" alt=\"Karlheinz Weinberger Sitting boy with Elvis necklace, 1961 \u00a9 Karlheinz Weinberger.

I began to unlearn my own prejudices, to suppress that lingering rush of resentment when I saw teenage lads bantering with play punches on the street, or stag-do boys dressed as bananas yelling on the tube.</p> <p>I started to find solidarity in unexpected places. Since my teens I have been an out bisexual man, but a closet fan of West Ham United. My own binary thinking had led me to believe that my sexuality and revulsion at groups of men in football mode was incompatible with enjoying the frequently depressing fortunes of a team once notorious for the violence of a small group of their fans.</p> <p>Indeed, football hooliganism seems to be one of those masculine identities where the actions of a minority toxify the wider group. Eventually, I realised I wouldn\u2019t be subjecting myself to the endless disappointments of following West Ham if I didn\u2019t genuinely care. I started taking this most painful of relationships more seriously. I discovered West Ham\u2019s LGBT+ supporters organisation <a href=\"https://prideofirons.com/\" title=\"\">Pride of Irons </a>\u2013 a hilarious, passionate, caring and diverse group that encompasses gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual and trans members.</p> <p>At the London Stadium I stand in a communal fug of lager and Dior Sauvage singing I\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles, a glorious anthem of optimism in failure, and feel euphoric as I dissolve into the 50,000 people around me to find a curious self-acceptance that for decades has eluded me.</p> <p>Yet I cannot be complacent in this personal victory. I\u2019m not sure how we try to take nuance and make it universal in the current climate. Photography exhibitions in London galleries are all very well, but they can only ever speak to a minority. Instead, we cry out for the kinds of structural change that eventually will create tectonic shifts.</p> <p>We might look to Sweden, where fathers and mothers are given governmental and employer support to split 480 days of parental leave between them. Let\u2019s stop talking of male role models and hope that boys might find inspiration from their elders in all genders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5794103a1472fad251ce7e539572f624a2bbb23e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5794103a1472fad251ce7e539572f624a2bbb23e/306_307_2081_2338/890.jpg\" alt=\"Hank Willis Thomas, It\u2019s the Real Thing!, 1978/2008.

I was struck by the words of Soma Ghosh, writer and editor of radical feminist magazine <em><a href=\"https://www.thedementedgoddess.com/tag/current-issue/\" title=\"\">The Demented Goddess</a></em>, when she told me of her dislike of the concept of toxic masculinity, and how it might impact her young son: \u201cI don\u2019t want to script, limit or resent his \u2018manhood\u2019,\u201d she writes. \u201cAt his rural primary school, he calls out homophobia and decries Mary not speaking in his Nativity play as sexist. Would he feel so free to fight for fairness if he felt his masculinity was inevitably harmful, toxic, loathsome?\u201d </p> <p>We need to accept that toxicity in male identity is not elemental and inevitable. Instead, we ought to see it as a by-product of change, a waste substance that, like the slag heaps of industrial ruin, might one day vanish.</p> <p>At my most optimistic, I see green shoots when all around me it feels as if men are finally starting to talk. Even in my adolescence, the boorish chuntering of laddism was a form of silence, where those of us who didn\u2019t conform either shut up or played along. Because men struggle to communicate and often do so within strict linguistic rules and codes, they\u2019re easily stereotyped: model railway enthusiasts as anoraks, football fans as thugs, and so on. Yet some of the most nuanced discussion on the importance of discussing mental health I\u2019ve heard in recent months has been on West Ham fan podcasts.</p> <p>We\u2019re even getting better at expressing our vulnerability when it comes to sex. I recently participated in a documentary about the huge rise in young men taking Viagra. In a community centre with a Nigerian church singing songs of praise next door, seven men discussed the expectations, fears and pressures that had led them to pop the little blue pill. There was crude humour and banter, but also a exploration of performance anxiety and the deep insecurity that so many men feel as we try to make sense of our bodies and the essential drive of our sex against the ubiquitous vortex of hardcore pornography. Complexly intertwined with the cruelty of unrealistic body image in advertising and on TV, this garish scroll of grunting is an engine of misogyny that exploits and inflames male insecurity.</p> <p>Only in frank honesty and acceptance will we get beyond these painful orthodoxies and myths that hold us back. If I look in the mirror and then back at those images from the Barbican exhibition, I am struck by John Coplans\u2019s photograph Frieze No 2 \u2013 Four Panels, of a naked male body covered in a rough scrub of hair over curving belly, Martian canals in the loose skin over elbows and below buttocks. It\u2019s an image at once sensual, affirming and familiar.</p> <p>I\u2019ve recently entered middle age, when suddenly my body feels like one of those diagrams on which you mark damage when hiring a car \u2013 two weak knees that crunch when I sit, constantly needing to get up for a piss in the night, humped shoulders, nose hair, terrifying twinges, two-day hangovers. I had often felt I had missed out on being a man, yet looking at my own body, and that photograph, I finally recognise and feel a comfort in my slow ache towards the grave.</p> <p>\u201cLiberation\u201d is an appropriate title for the Barbican\u2019s exhibition. We\u2019ve all heard of women\u2019s lib, but the term has never been applied to men, more in need of liberating than anyone. After all, the structures and webs of codes and expectations that hold men down are the same as manifest in the death grip of patriarchy. Liberate men, and we liberate us all.</p> <p><em>Masculinities: Liberation through Photography is at Barbican Art Gallery from 20 February to 17 May 2020 (<a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/masculinities-liberation-through-photography?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkdOyrL3Y5wIVWODtCh16xAoCEAAYASAAEgJAqfD_BwE\">barbican.org.uk</a>).

But then, at the age of 11 or 12, my body became a contested space. In the steaming showers after PE, I compared myself unfavourably to others, both my classmates and what I saw in the wider culture. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t alone in finding that infamous Coca-Cola window-cleaner advert (in which a shirtless man tantalises an office full of women) to be 30 seconds of highly triggering humiliation \u2013 and a (low-calorie) modicum of sweet revenge for all the years of men doing the same to women. Yet watching the video again as I write this essay on how to explore the buffeted nature of modern masculinity against the physicality of the male body itself, I can easily recall that awkward, resentful twinge. For the past quarter-century or so, my life staring at men has been a complicated experience \u2013 a signal to arousal, yes, but also to fright and flight; to self-loathing at my own physical inadequacy. During those years, looking at pictures of men who populate the Barbican\u2019s new exhibition Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography would, like a highbrow take on that TV ad, have sent me to a terrible and negative place. The artfully posed muscular bodies, the confident eye meeting the camera\u2019s lens, the camaraderie among queers and straights alike, the performance of group ritual \u2013 they might as well have been aliens. How did I connect with these masculine ideals of fashion and sport? The Barbican exhibition largely features images taken in the decades of gender revolution that followed the Second World War. During successive waves of feminism, women have explored different tactical approaches to redefine themselves against an oppression that stretches back beyond recorded history. Men, however, failed. We never had conversations among ourselves about this realignment, and nor did we seek to engage effectively with what was being said around us. Even gay rights activists and feminists struggled to get along. Instead, we doubled down and hoped it might all go away. The cultural thuggery of 90s laddism was business as usual, the same pernicious attitudes allowed to continue, merely disguised with a veneer of irony. After the joy of a childhood full of parental love, my teenage years coincided with that boorish decade, throughout which mainstream TV programmes from Friends to Fantasy Football were drearily conformist in their representations of gender. Struggling to understand my bisexual identity, I came up against Section 28, which the Tories used to legislate loneliness by forbidding the \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality in schools. My all-boys comprehensive was a hormonal soup I despaired at being boiled in, the hierarchy decided by playground football, prowess with girls, expensive sportswear. In the seven years I was there, I never knew of a single out gay or bisexual pupil \u2013 just hateful whispers. The deranged and lonely testosterone flood carried me to the dank caverns of local public toilets, where I was taken advantage of by a succession of grim older men. I told myself that this was just a rite of passage, unable to see myself as a victim of these predators who leered at my 14-year-old self through bulging eyes. Men frequently never seem to leave puberty \u2013 and destructive patterns become ossified into adulthood. I explored this in a memoir, which I began writing, during a period of intense personal turmoil, as a book about a forest near London. I hadn\u2019t thought it was about masculinity, but bisexuality, bullying, recovery from abuse, depression, isolation, sexual compulsion, even how we define ourselves against or within nature, all of which have at their roots the impossible expectations of gender. * * * I write this not because I think my situation was unique, but because I suspect it was nearly universal. Even those young men who pretend to fit in frequently don\u2019t, but instead are pushed into denying their true complicated selves for the sake of acceptance in the wider group. When are any young men taught to be in touch with their bodies, to explore them as the sensuous manifestation of their true selves? The male mind and body are frequently in a turmoil of shame and self-denial, resulting in a mental health crisis that means suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK. Just as I don\u2019t believe anybody is entirely straight or gay, there\u2019s an unrecognised fluidity beyond the self-identified gender fluid. Why do we seem to have forgotten that cis-gendered masculinity is in itself a broad and beautiful, diverse spectrum? As Walt Whitman put it in his heroic, erotic and at the time controversial poetic hymn to masculine and feminine personhood, Song of Myself: \u201cI am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d He wrote those lines in the mid-1850s, yet 170 years later, they can still feel ahead of our time. The contemporary debate around gender has hardly helped. It frequently treats masculinity as a lumpen identity, with the accusation of toxicity applied to all. As someone who has spent my life suffering from the consequences of negative maleness, through predatory abuse, biphobia, bullying, the drunken screams of \u201cfucking poof\u201d and that constant and overpowering sense of threat that paves the nocturnal streets of little England, this has been hard to process. I constantly see men pushed to extremes by the nature of the contemporary conversation. I am as wary of a performative wearer of a \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like\u201d T-shirt as I am the disciples of the \u201ceat steak and tidy your room\u201d Jordan Peterson doctrine. Both have embraced the comfort of simplistic and binary positions, exactly the opposite of what we all so desperately need. There\u2019s a contradiction in a discourse that on the one hand claims that male privilege, entitlement and the patriarchy are the most powerful forces of oppression humanity has ever created, and on the other would (understandably) like men to process this quickly, and without fuss. If having the upper hand for centuries breeds an entitlement that means men find it hard to realise that they\u2019ve benefitted from systems of male privilege \u2013 even if they have frequently been the victims of it \u2013 then to deal with this is going to take time. This isn\u2019t to make excuses, but to say that in a world darkened by binary thinking, collaboration and solidarity between all genders is the only thing that will get us through. \u201cLove\u2019s the only engine of survival,\u201d as Leonard Cohen had it, and Leonard Cohen was usually right. Paradoxically, it was the emergence of terms such as \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d, and suddenly feeling myself lumped in within that unpleasant morass, that led me to explore just what my identity as a man might be. I began to unlearn my own prejudices, to suppress that lingering rush of resentment when I saw teenage lads bantering with play punches on the street, or stag-do boys dressed as bananas yelling on the tube. I started to find solidarity in unexpected places. Since my teens I have been an out bisexual man, but a closet fan of West Ham United. My own binary thinking had led me to believe that my sexuality and revulsion at groups of men in football mode was incompatible with enjoying the frequently depressing fortunes of a team once notorious for the violence of a small group of their fans. Indeed, football hooliganism seems to be one of those masculine identities where the actions of a minority toxify the wider group. Eventually, I realised I wouldn\u2019t be subjecting myself to the endless disappointments of following West Ham if I didn\u2019t genuinely care. I started taking this most painful of relationships more seriously. I discovered West Ham\u2019s LGBT+ supporters organisation Pride of Irons \u2013 a hilarious, passionate, caring and diverse group that encompasses gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual and trans members. At the London Stadium I stand in a communal fug of lager and Dior Sauvage singing I\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles, a glorious anthem of optimism in failure, and feel euphoric as I dissolve into the 50,000 people around me to find a curious self-acceptance that for decades has eluded me. Yet I cannot be complacent in this personal victory. I\u2019m not sure how we try to take nuance and make it universal in the current climate. Photography exhibitions in London galleries are all very well, but they can only ever speak to a minority. Instead, we cry out for the kinds of structural change that eventually will create tectonic shifts. We might look to Sweden, where fathers and mothers are given governmental and employer support to split 480 days of parental leave between them. Let\u2019s stop talking of male role models and hope that boys might find inspiration from their elders in all genders. * * * Perhaps the tallest order is to make the language we use less divisive. I was struck by the words of Soma Ghosh, writer and editor of radical feminist magazine The Demented Goddess, when she told me of her dislike of the concept of toxic masculinity, and how it might impact her young son: \u201cI don\u2019t want to script, limit or resent his \u2018manhood\u2019,\u201d she writes. \u201cAt his rural primary school, he calls out homophobia and decries Mary not speaking in his Nativity play as sexist. Would he feel so free to fight for fairness if he felt his masculinity was inevitably harmful, toxic, loathsome?\u201d We need to accept that toxicity in male identity is not elemental and inevitable. Instead, we ought to see it as a by-product of change, a waste substance that, like the slag heaps of industrial ruin, might one day vanish. At my most optimistic, I see green shoots when all around me it feels as if men are finally starting to talk. Even in my adolescence, the boorish chuntering of laddism was a form of silence, where those of us who didn\u2019t conform either shut up or played along. Because men struggle to communicate and often do so within strict linguistic rules and codes, they\u2019re easily stereotyped: model railway enthusiasts as anoraks, football fans as thugs, and so on. Yet some of the most nuanced discussion on the importance of discussing mental health I\u2019ve heard in recent months has been on West Ham fan podcasts. We\u2019re even getting better at expressing our vulnerability when it comes to sex. I recently participated in a documentary about the huge rise in young men taking Viagra. In a community centre with a Nigerian church singing songs of praise next door, seven men discussed the expectations, fears and pressures that had led them to pop the little blue pill. There was crude humour and banter, but also a exploration of performance anxiety and the deep insecurity that so many men feel as we try to make sense of our bodies and the essential drive of our sex against the ubiquitous vortex of hardcore pornography. Complexly intertwined with the cruelty of unrealistic body image in advertising and on TV, this garish scroll of grunting is an engine of misogyny that exploits and inflames male insecurity. Only in frank honesty and acceptance will we get beyond these painful orthodoxies and myths that hold us back. If I look in the mirror and then back at those images from the Barbican exhibition, I am struck by John Coplans\u2019s photograph Frieze No 2 \u2013 Four Panels, of a naked male body covered in a rough scrub of hair over curving belly, Martian canals in the loose skin over elbows and below buttocks. It\u2019s an image at once sensual, affirming and familiar. I\u2019ve recently entered middle age, when suddenly my body feels like one of those diagrams on which you mark damage when hiring a car \u2013 two weak knees that crunch when I sit, constantly needing to get up for a piss in the night, humped shoulders, nose hair, terrifying twinges, two-day hangovers. I had often felt I had missed out on being a man, yet looking at my own body, and that photograph, I finally recognise and feel a comfort in my slow ache towards the grave. \u201cLiberation\u201d is an appropriate title for the Barbican\u2019s exhibition. We\u2019ve all heard of women\u2019s lib, but the term has never been applied to men, more in need of liberating than anyone. After all, the structures and webs of codes and expectations that hold men down are the same as manifest in the death grip of patriarchy. Liberate men, and we liberate us all. Masculinities: Liberation through Photography is at Barbican Art Gallery from 20 February to 17 May 2020 (barbican.org.uk).

      "bodyText": "The prime minister and his new chancellor may have come to a harmonious agreement over their special advisers but there remains a significant point of friction between them: whose alma mater is superior? The rivalry between Old Wykehamists and Old Etonians played out in the Commons last year when Jacob Rees-Mogg (Eton) jibed at Nick Boles (Winchester) during a Brexit debate. \u201cMy honourable friend makes a characteristically Wykehamist point: highly intelligent, but fundamentally wrong,\u201d Rees-Mogg said \u2013 to the bafflement of most voters, though perhaps not most MPs. But the feud has now moved to the top of government with the appointment of Rishi Sunak as chancellor. He attended Winchester College in the 1990s; his next-door neighbour Boris Johnson enrolled at Eton in 1977. According to Sunak, his parents \u2013 a GP and a pharmacist \u2013 \u201csacrificed a great deal so I could attend good schools \u2026 That experience changed my life and as a result I am passionate about ensuring everybody has access to a great education.\u201d The chancellor is one of four former Winchester College boys in the House of Commons: the others are the Tory MPs Alex Chalk, Marcus Fysh and John Whittingdale. Boles resigned from the Conservative party over Brexit and did not stand in the 2019 election. There are 11 Old Etonians on the Tory benches, according to the Sutton Trust, out of 150 (41%) who went to independent schools. In contrast, only 14% of Labour MPs were privately educated. But Old Wykehamists can count two of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest aides \u2013 Seumas Milne, his strategy and communications chief, and James Schneider, his former director of communications \u2013 among their number. Alumni of Winchester College are known as Old Wykehamists after William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, who founded the school in 1382. The college has produced a large number of archbishops and bishops, along with a strong showing for politicians (including the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell and Tory-turned-fascist Oswald Mosley), writers, actors and cricketers. One notorious Old Wykehamist is Rurik Jutting, who is serving life for raping, torturing and killing two women in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, the school claims to prepare boys \u201cfor a future of compassionate leadership\u201d. \u201cWinchester does not produce a \u2018type\u2019,\u201d its website says. \u201cInstead, we instil a respect for the individual and a keenness to contribute to the community.\u201d The motto is \u201cManners makyth man\u201d; annual fees are \u00a341,709. One former Winchester boy told the Observer that Wykehamists had \u201can inferiority complex, but they also think they\u2019re cleverer and politer and more thoughtful and less entitled\u201d. \u201cThey think that this explains why they might end up as civil servants \u2013 or backroom operators like Milne or Schneider \u2013 rather than on the frontbenches. So I think a lot of them might be taken aback, almost affronted, by Rishi Sunak\u2019s rise and obvious ambition \u2013 it\u2019s a real kick in the teeth for that self-image as the sort of people who could run the country if they wanted to, but simply chose a different path.\u201d He recalled an \u201cenvironment where paranoid homophobia and racism and gross jokes about working-class people \u2013 cleaners referred to as \u2018skivs\u2019, for example \u2013 were commonplace. And all part of a culture where taking offence or calling it out as repellent was seen as a sign that you weren\u2019t sophisticated enough to grasp the levels of irony at work.\u201d Sunak, he said, would \u201cprobably have met girls through a house dance about once a year (to which it is likely he would have smuggled miniature hotel bar bottles of whisky in his underpants) and in school plays.\u201d In 2017, Winchester College was forced to defend its role in an alleged cover-up of serious physical abuse at Christian summer camps attended by its pupils in the 1970s and 1980s. It emerged that the school had known in 1982 about claims of sadomasochistic abuse at the hands of John Smyth, a British QC who ran a series of Christian summer camps attended by its pupils, but did not report the claims to the police.",

The cost of funerals has risen by up to 10% in the last year \u2013 meaning that if the deceased does not have enough money in their estate, their death could be met with a growing bill for their relatives. SunLife\u2019s annual Cost of Dying Report puts the average bill for a death in the UK at just under \u00a310,000 when estate and professional fees and the reception are factored in. Such is the concern about the spiralling price \u2013 up 130% in the last 15 years \u2013 that the Competition and Markets Authority has launched an investigation after years of above-inflation rises.

The government\u2019s Funeral Expenses Payment (Funeral Support Payment in Scotland) is available for people on certain benefits who need help paying, but it is unlikely to cover the full amount. Coffin Club\u2019s flat-pack option Independent funeral celebrant Jane Morgan believes people can spend too much on funerals - sometimes even ending up in debt - because they don\u2019t know about possible options. She runs courses to discuss and plan for death, including ways to spend less \u2013 with people even building and decorating their own coffin. Morgan has been delivering end-of-life ceremonies for eight years and ran London\u2019s first \u201cCoffin Club\u201d in Tottenham, north London, in October with the aim of helping people understand more about the funeral market and dispelling myths. As part of the six-week course, which includes talks from various professionals in the industry, members can buy and decorate their own \u00a3250 \u201cflat-pack\u201d wooden coffin. The Coffin Club concept was started by a palliative care nurse in New Zealand, and set up in the UK in 2017. \u201cSome people might have had bad experiences with family funerals. Just talking through the issues can be a big relief,\u201d says Morgan.",

      "body": "<p>Enter through the film-house gloom and you\u2019re immediately plunged into deeper darkness. The screen before you seethes with obliterating blackness. A blurred face appears for half a second, and occasional glimmers hurtle upwards like sparks up a chimney. But other than the deafening crankshaft thrum, there is almost nothing to confirm that we\u2019re going to hell in a mineshaft.</p> <p>The TauTona mine in South Africa, otherwise known as Western Deep, is the world\u2019s deepest gold mine. The miners have to descend more than three kilometres to reach the broiling depths, working the seams in the erratic light of their puny headlamps. Temperatures can rise to more than 80C.</p> <p>Suddenly there is silence; suddenly a horrifying crash. The screen turns blindingly bright. A miner sits trembling, thermometer in his mouth. He speaks but we can\u2019t hear his words. Then lines of miners are performing strenuous bench jumps in blue trunks, sweating it out in some eerie decompression chamber to the crackling pulse of a scarlet light. There is no day or night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbf75134a98595c17219a75c00d8601b3d4b2724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbf75134a98595c17219a75c00d8601b3d4b2724/47_0_2616_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Western Deep, 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Western Deep, 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Steve McQueen. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery and Marian Goodman Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steve McQueen\u2019s masterpiece, <em><a href=\"https://www.artangel.org.uk/caribs-leap-western-deep/western-deep/\" title=\"\">Western Deep</a></em> operates as a succession of sound and vision shocks. Like the mine, it deprives the eyes of light, then assaults them with inexplicable bursts of colour, just as it veers between silence and shattering drills. This is art put to the service of truth. The camera tries to grasp what is nearly incomprehensible to the rest of us \u2013 the conditions of a penal colony far below the earth.</p> <p>A digital notice outside <em>Western Deep</em> \u2013 counting down the seconds like a little movie in itself \u2013 tells you when the next screening begins. You can\u2019t go in before then. For this is a narrative work. McQueen has organised his <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/steve-mcqueen\" title=\"\">first British retrospective</a> since he won the Turner prize in 1999 with all the fierce attentiveness of the art films themselves.</p> <p>So you can walk round and round the seven-minute loop of <em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mcqueen-static-t13425\" title=\"\">Static</a></em>, his 2009 portrait of the Statue of Liberty filmed in closeup from a circling helicopter. You can enter the double-sided film installation <em><a href=\"https://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/13443/ashes\" title=\"\">Ashes</a></em> from either of two entrances, absorbing its complex story from different directions. <em><a href=\"https://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/50-steve-mcqueen/works/39667/\" title=\"\">Cold Breath</a></em>, a glittering black and white film in which a nub of nipple is teased with gentleness and then unanticipated violence, is projected on a fittingly small screen so you have to come up close to be abruptly disconcerted.</p> <p>Made in 1999, when McQueen was 30, this is the earliest work in the exhibition bar a one-minute fragment of Super 8 from 1992 showing two elderly West Indian men carrying potted palms from east London\u2019s Brick Lane on to the 243 bus to Wood Green, north London. <em><a href=\"https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/45-steve-mcqueen/works/3220/\" title=\"\">Exodus</a></em> is its subtle title. So the show\u2019s timespan misses out a lot for a younger generation. None of the short films that first made his name are here; for instance <em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mcqueen-bear-t07073\" title=\"\">Bear</a></em>, in which two naked black men (one of them McQueen) come together in a brief but mysterious sparring match, with every degree of sexual, political and cinematic ambiguity. Nor will you see <em><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/98724\" title=\"\">Deadpan</a></em>, in which McQueen reprised Buster Keaton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/sep/07/silent-era-film-stars-risked-their-lives-doing-film-stunts\" title=\"\">famous fa</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/sep/07/silent-era-film-stars-risked-their-lives-doing-film-stunts\" title=\"\">cade-falling scene</a>, which led to the Turner prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3105cd3762a3cb58e3b93cf5db272b3c9cba7442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3105cd3762a3cb58e3b93cf5db272b3c9cba7442/0_0_2925_1632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Statue of Liberty, in a still from Steve McQueen\u2019s film Static, 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"558\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Face like thunder, ferocious diadem\u2019: the Statue of Liberty, in a still from Steve McQueen\u2019s film Static, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Steve McQueen. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery and Marian Goodman Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may be that the idea of Steve McQueen as the Hollywood director of <em>Hunger</em>, <em>Shame</em>, <em>Widows</em> and the Oscar-winning <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/04/steve-mcqueen-my-painful-childhood-shame\" title=\"\">12 Years a Slave</a></em> has by now somewhat superseded his renown as a contemporary artist. If so, the inclusion here of a duff sculpture called <em>Weight</em> \u2013 a gilded mosquito net over a prison bed, made for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/04/inside-artists-and-writers-in-reading-prison-artangel-review-oscar-wilde\" title=\"\">otherwise superb </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/04/inside-artists-and-writers-in-reading-prison-artangel-review-oscar-wilde\" title=\"\">Artangel</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/04/inside-artists-and-writers-in-reading-prison-artangel-review-oscar-wilde\" title=\"\"> show</a> commemorating Oscar Wilde\u2019s time at Reading jail \u2013 certainly will not help.</p> <p>But connections are everywhere apparent between the films made for the cinema and those for the gallery. McQueen\u2019s primary emphasis, for instance, on bodies in motion and at rest, stressed and flailing and under duress: this is a defining characteristic. He sets forth the human figure with singular force. You see that particularly in <em>Western Deep</em>, where the dazed and exhausted miners become monuments in the final moments.</p> <p>Sometimes he presses endurance to the limit. It is almost impossible to keep watching particular scenes in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/17/my-favorite-best-picture-oscar-winner-12-years-a-slave\" title=\"\">12 Years a Slave</a></em>, and yet the moral imperative is upon us; witness at the very least an expression of respect. By comparison, a film from 2004 called <em><a href=\"https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/artists/45-steve-mcqueen/works/49/\" title=\"\">Charlotte</a></em> feels like a practice piece. The eye of Charlotte Rampling, immediately recognisable with its hooded lid, is touched and teased and revoltingly probed by McQueen\u2019s own finger, in a variation on the notorious eye-slicing moment in <em>Un Chien Andalou</em>. The optical horror is exaggerated and yet also veiled in blood-red light.</p> <p>Look, don\u2019t look. What can a camera show? In <em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mcqueen-caribs-leap-western-deep-t12019\" title=\"\">Car</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mcqueen-caribs-leap-western-deep-t12019\" title=\"\">ibs\u2019 Leap</a></em>, memorialising the islanders of Grenada who jumped to their deaths rather than surrender to French invaders in the 1650s, McQueen shows a man \u2013 or is it a ghost? \u2013 falling through the sky towards us and then vanishing into thin air. It is not clear if he is real or a figment. The screen is hoisted high: look upwards, and for the longest time he is not there.</p> <p>The other half of that film, showing a day in the life of contemporary Grenada, fishermen mending boats, children playing in the tide, is projected outside on to the front of Tate Modern: a big glowing portrait of free people. Most of the work in this show, whether political or not, has the character of a campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"305cda40e3f64674aac3651ecedd3bb387c71fef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/305cda40e3f64674aac3651ecedd3bb387c71fef/0_0_9973_7158/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McQueen\u2019s film Ashes, 2002-15.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The eponymous young Grenadian man, \u2018buoyantly alive\u2019 in McQueen\u2019s film Ashes, 2002-15.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Steve McQueen. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery and Marian Goodman Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is explicit in <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWgxjpDYE40\" title=\"\">Ashes</a></em>, where a beautiful young islander is shown buoyantly alive on the prow of a boat, riding the waves, his joyful charisma filling the frame.

      "bodyText": "Enter through the film-house gloom and you\u2019re immediately plunged into deeper darkness. The screen before you seethes with obliterating blackness. A blurred face appears for half a second, and occasional glimmers hurtle upwards like sparks up a chimney. But other than the deafening crankshaft thrum, there is almost nothing to confirm that we\u2019re going to hell in a mineshaft. The TauTona mine in South Africa, otherwise known as Western Deep, is the world\u2019s deepest gold mine. The miners have to descend more than three kilometres to reach the broiling depths, working the seams in the erratic light of their puny headlamps. Temperatures can rise to more than 80C. Suddenly there is silence; suddenly a horrifying crash. The screen turns blindingly bright. A miner sits trembling, thermometer in his mouth. He speaks but we can\u2019t hear his words. Then lines of miners are performing strenuous bench jumps in blue trunks, sweating it out in some eerie decompression chamber to the crackling pulse of a scarlet light. There is no day or night. Steve McQueen\u2019s masterpiece, Western Deep operates as a succession of sound and vision shocks. Like the mine, it deprives the eyes of light, then assaults them with inexplicable bursts of colour, just as it veers between silence and shattering drills. This is art put to the service of truth. The camera tries to grasp what is nearly incomprehensible to the rest of us \u2013 the conditions of a penal colony far below the earth. A digital notice outside Western Deep \u2013 counting down the seconds like a little movie in itself \u2013 tells you when the next screening begins. You can\u2019t go in before then. For this is a narrative work. McQueen has organised his first British retrospective since he won the Turner prize in 1999 with all the fierce attentiveness of the art films themselves. So you can walk round and round the seven-minute loop of Static, his 2009 portrait of the Statue of Liberty filmed in closeup from a circling helicopter. You can enter the double-sided film installation Ashes from either of two entrances, absorbing its complex story from different directions. Cold Breath, a glittering black and white film in which a nub of nipple is teased with gentleness and then unanticipated violence, is projected on a fittingly small screen so you have to come up close to be abruptly disconcerted. Made in 1999, when McQueen was 30, this is the earliest work in the exhibition bar a one-minute fragment of Super 8 from 1992 showing two elderly West Indian men carrying potted palms from east London\u2019s Brick Lane on to the 243 bus to Wood Green, north London. Exodus is its subtle title. So the show\u2019s timespan misses out a lot for a younger generation. None of the short films that first made his name are here; for instance Bear, in which two naked black men (one of them McQueen) come together in a brief but mysterious sparring match, with every degree of sexual, political and cinematic ambiguity. Nor will you see Deadpan, in which McQueen reprised Buster Keaton\u2019s famous facade-falling scene, which led to the Turner prize. It may be that the idea of Steve McQueen as the Hollywood director of Hunger, Shame, Widows and the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave has by now somewhat superseded his renown as a contemporary artist. If so, the inclusion here of a duff sculpture called Weight \u2013 a gilded mosquito net over a prison bed, made for the otherwise superb Artangel show commemorating Oscar Wilde\u2019s time at Reading jail \u2013 certainly will not help. But connections are everywhere apparent between the films made for the cinema and those for the gallery. McQueen\u2019s primary emphasis, for instance, on bodies in motion and at rest, stressed and flailing and under duress: this is a defining characteristic. He sets forth the human figure with singular force. You see that particularly in Western Deep, where the dazed and exhausted miners become monuments in the final moments. Sometimes he presses endurance to the limit. It is almost impossible to keep watching particular scenes in 12 Years a Slave, and yet the moral imperative is upon us; witness at the very least an expression of respect. By comparison, a film from 2004 called Charlotte feels like a practice piece. The eye of Charlotte Rampling, immediately recognisable with its hooded lid, is touched and teased and revoltingly probed by McQueen\u2019s own finger, in a variation on the notorious eye-slicing moment in Un Chien Andalou. The optical horror is exaggerated and yet also veiled in blood-red light. Look, don\u2019t look. What can a camera show? In Caribs\u2019 Leap, memorialising the islanders of Grenada who jumped to their deaths rather than surrender to French invaders in the 1650s, McQueen shows a man \u2013 or is it a ghost? \u2013 falling through the sky towards us and then vanishing into thin air. It is not clear if he is real or a figment. The screen is hoisted high: look upwards, and for the longest time he is not there. The other half of that film, showing a day in the life of contemporary Grenada, fishermen mending boats, children playing in the tide, is projected outside on to the front of Tate Modern: a big glowing portrait of free people. Most of the work in this show, whether political or not, has the character of a campaign. That is explicit in Ashes, where a beautiful young islander is shown buoyantly alive on the prow of a boat, riding the waves, his joyful charisma filling the frame. A friend remembers him in the voiceover: \u201cOh, he was great on the ocean, Ashes.\u201d This lithe angel lives for ever in McQueen\u2019s looping film. But on the reverse, quite deliberately, without any attempt to disguise the moral lesson, is the vision of hands slowly gilding his name on a tombstone. Ashes got caught up, found somebody else\u2019s drugs. The most overtly political work here is the least effective: End Credits, concerning the remorseless, 30-year surveillance of the black actor, singer and activist Paul Robeson by the FBI. On screen, page after page of redacted FBI documents appear far too fast to be read. An actor recites others, equally fast and out of sync so that the cognitive dissonance is complete. Running at more than five hours, this is another form of endurance test, tripwired for failure. McQueen has talked in interviews about his frustration at not being able to make feature films as a young man, and the opportunities art gave him instead. In a sense, the clearest fusion between them is Static. A thousand directors have filmed the Statue of Liberty from a helicopter, and McQueen is up there too with his crew. The sight is riveting \u2013 face like thunder, ferocious diadem, the copper rusting, cracking, spattered with birdshit. She stands out, green and grave against the industrial backdrop, the Manhattan skyline, the glowering clouds, as the helicopter sweeps round and round. And eventually there comes a moment where Liberty is no longer static, where she herself appears to move, as if she has an independent spirit all of her own. The idea is very simple, and it would be wrong to overstate the political implications, but this film is beautifully subversive. \u2022 At Tate Modern, London, until 11 May",

Idlib, which has become a refuge of last resort for Turkish-backed rebel forces and jihadists, is the only main Syrian province yet to be recaptured by the regime in Damascus since fighting began in 2011. The Syrian government\u2019s military campaign over recent weeks has included bombing of heavily populated areas, and civilian infrastructure including hospitals and markets.

A lawyer for her family said she had taken her own life. \u201cMy heart is broken, we had something so special,\u201d Burton wrote on Instagram on Sunday morning. \u201cI am so lost for words. I am in so much pain. I miss you so much. I know you felt safe with me. You always said \u2018I don\u2019t think about anything else when I am with you\u2019 and I was not allowed to be there this time. I kept asking and asking. \u201cI will be your voice, baby. I promise I will ask all the questions you wanted and I will get all the answers. Nothing will bring you back, but I will try to make you proud every day. I love you with all my heart.\u201d Flack presented many of UK television\u2019s biggest reality TV shows and their spin-offs, from The X Factor to I\u2019m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here Now!, and won the BBC show Strictly Come Dancing in 2014. Many of Flack\u2019s former colleagues and friends paid tribute to the \u201cwarm and funny\u201d entertainer on social media. The BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker tweeted: \u201cAwful news about Caroline Flack. We really need to be better at taking care of each other.\u201d The This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield added: \u201cIn a world where you can be anything, be kind.\u201d Flack was arrested in December for assault and was charged with attacking Burton, 27, with a lamp at their home in Islington, north London. The court heard that Burton had \u201creceived significant injury to his head\u201d. Flack was released on bail on the condition that she did not contact Burton until the trial. Her death has prompted criticism of her treatment by the media. Tabloids, including the Sun, which broke the news of her death, moved swiftly to delete recent negative stories about her. A statement from her family on Saturday said: \u201cWe can confirm that our Caroline passed away today, 15 February. We would ask that the press respect the privacy of the family at this difficult time and we would ask they make no attempt to contact us and/or photograph us.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

If people don\u2019t see their own \u2018truth\u2019 expressed, then they see it is an untruth. And social media now means that narratives can take hold that are not based in fact.\u201d</p> <p>Unsworth was speaking out after the appointment last week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/13/oliver-dowden-new-culture-secretary-bbc\" title=\"\">Oliver Dowden</a> as secretary of state for culture and the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/15/tv-licence-convictions-hard-to-justify-says-mp-scrutinising-bbc\" title=\"\">Julian Knight</a> as the chair of the parliamentary committee that scrutinises the BBC. Both are promising to question the broadcaster\u2019s reliance on income from the licence fee.</p> <p>Criticism from those on the left who detected a rightwing prejudice in the BBC\u2019s election coverage was a surprise, she admitted. But Unsworth rebutted claims that the attacks had been caused by a deliberate BBC attempt to avoid more conventional accusations of liberal bias inside New Broadcasting House. There had been no over-correction: \u201cWe just carried on doing what we were doing.\u201d</p> <p>Unsworth said she thought renewed hostility from the new Conservative government was unlikely to win back alienated former BBC support on the left.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are quite entrenched in their views on this, I think. We have just got to keep restating our case that we will listen to everybody, serve everybody and host everybody, but not be bullied by either side. We don\u2019t get it right all the time, obviously, and people can be unhappy with what we do, and that is fine.\u201d</p> <p>The former World Service boss, who also has a seat on the BBC board, made her case for the defence following public arguments made last week by Sir David Clementi, her chairman, and Tony Hall, the director general, who both underlined the breadth of service the BBC can offer because of its licence fee income.</p> <p>Unsworth said that in the run-up to the renewal of the terms of the BBC\u2019s charter in seven years\u2019 time, there was always bound to be a national debate, whatever the government.</p> <p>\u201cBut all this talk about the future of the licence fee really should start with discussion about what the BBC is for,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you have answered that, you can go on to how it should be funded.\u201d</p> <p>Switching to a subscription payments would be unfair, Unsworth argued, because those willing to pay would end up funding a service that is still obliged to try to inform and reach the entire British public, according to its charter terms.</p> <p>\u201cThis is where the whole subscription model starts to come adrift. If you have a national civic function, you cannot then choose for only certain sections of the audience to pay for it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Unless the charter is radically altered in 2027, the BBC\u2019s \u201cuniversal mission\u201d in not a consumerist one, but a key duty to keep the people informed, she argued. \u201cUnder our charter, the job is to provide impartial news without fear or favour, and not to be beholden to commercial or political interests.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d929e29f02e77ca003a7664b3b042297abc7d50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d929e29f02e77ca003a7664b3b042297abc7d50/0_0_1504_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gender pay gap scandal, Fran Unsworth says, is a running sore at the BBC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gender pay gap scandal, Fran Unsworth says, is a running sore at the BBC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The BBC\u2019s \u201ccivil contingency\u201d function is also in danger of being forgotten, Unsworth believes. Aside from providing news \u2013 \u201cpublic purpose number one\u201d \u2013 the broadcaster must offer guidance in case of national emergency. She had recently witnessed this working in Australia, she said, when ABC regional radio services were relied upon during the power cuts caused by dangerous bushfires.</p> <p>After two years in the top news job, Unsworth is now meeting criticism from inside her own organisation. High pay levels among senior staff \u2013 her salary is in the \u201cup to \u00a3249,000\u201d bracket \u2013 have prompted censure as 450 job cuts were announced last month across reporting teams. She and her colleagues accept this level of scrutiny, she said. \u201cIt is fair that the BBC gets more attention, because we should be better than others. It is hard, but fair enough.\u201d</p> <p>Her restructured, or slimmed-down, news service will be trialled next month, Unsworth said, explaining that it is designed to stop duplication and to give BBC reporting greater impact across all its channels, websites and radio stations. It will also make required budget savings.</p> <p>She sees the gender pay gap scandal as \u201ca running sore\u201d, she added, describing it as \u201ca legacy of yesteryear\u201d. Journalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/10/samira-ahmed-wins-equal-pay-claim-against-bbc\" title=\"\">Samira Ahmed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/02/carrie-gracie-i-learned-about-equal-pay-the-hard-way\" title=\"\">Carrie Gracie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/sarah-montague-wins-400000-settlement-from-bbc-for-unequal-treatment\" title=\"\">Sarah Montague </a>were among those who found they were paid less than male counterparts. \u201cWe have to work through all this and put structures in place that avoid us getting into this mess again.\u201d</p> <p>Julian Knight said this weekend that criminalising those who do not buy a television licence but use the BBC is out of date: \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at a world of populism, a world in which elites are being challenged an awful lot, the idea of criminal sanctions over the licence fee sticks in a lot of people\u2019s throats.\u201d </p> <p>But Unsworth regards such attacks as a conflation of two separate debates \u2013 one about the decriminalisation of this offence, the other about the fairness of the licence fee. She cited the words of John Bache, national chair of the Magistrates Association, who earlier this month told Today programme listeners that a change \u201cwould make an insignificant difference\u201d to levels of court congestion.</p> <p>Another irritation for Unsworth is the growing assumption that the BBC has lost its youth audience due to technological changes. In fact, she argues, this has not happened yet and a good percentage of young people still watch news broadcasts such as BBC One\u2019s six o\u2019clock bulletin, which has pulled in audiences of more than 5 million since Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cWe do see a slide in linear TV and radio consumption in the under 35s, it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those behaviours will probably be extended to the under 55s eventually, which is why we really have to think hard about ways of reaching them. But it really is not a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>When Hall\u2019s replacement is selected by Clementi this summer, they must champion all these arguments, and more. Yet Unsworth still believes the BBC\u2019s best defence will come from its listeners and viewers: \u201cOur real value lies in audience appreciation of what we do, rather than us simply banging the drum.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC was taken aback by leftwing attacks on its general election coverage, Fran Unsworth, the broadcaster\u2019s head of news and current affairs, has admitted in a frank assessment of the political pressures that are undermining efforts to preserve the licence fee. Unsworth, 62, said attacks on BBC standards of impartiality from sections of the political left, as well as from rightwingers, \u201cwas a Brexit thing\u201d. \u201cWhen you get a binary referendum choice that re-frames politics, people take sides in a way that they don\u2019t in normal times,\u201d Unsworth said. Describing the latest government warnings about future funding of the corporation as \u201ca serious threat\u201d, Unsworth said: \u201cWe tend to get caught up in the maelstrom. If people don\u2019t see their own \u2018truth\u2019 expressed, then they see it is an untruth. And social media now means that narratives can take hold that are not based in fact.\u201d Unsworth was speaking out after the appointment last week of Oliver Dowden as secretary of state for culture and the arrival of Julian Knight as the chair of the parliamentary committee that scrutinises the BBC. Both are promising to question the broadcaster\u2019s reliance on income from the licence fee. Criticism from those on the left who detected a rightwing prejudice in the BBC\u2019s election coverage was a surprise, she admitted. But Unsworth rebutted claims that the attacks had been caused by a deliberate BBC attempt to avoid more conventional accusations of liberal bias inside New Broadcasting House. There had been no over-correction: \u201cWe just carried on doing what we were doing.\u201d Unsworth said she thought renewed hostility from the new Conservative government was unlikely to win back alienated former BBC support on the left. \u201cPeople are quite entrenched in their views on this, I think. We have just got to keep restating our case that we will listen to everybody, serve everybody and host everybody, but not be bullied by either side. We don\u2019t get it right all the time, obviously, and people can be unhappy with what we do, and that is fine.\u201d The former World Service boss, who also has a seat on the BBC board, made her case for the defence following public arguments made last week by Sir David Clementi, her chairman, and Tony Hall, the director general, who both underlined the breadth of service the BBC can offer because of its licence fee income. Unsworth said that in the run-up to the renewal of the terms of the BBC\u2019s charter in seven years\u2019 time, there was always bound to be a national debate, whatever the government. \u201cBut all this talk about the future of the licence fee really should start with discussion about what the BBC is for,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you have answered that, you can go on to how it should be funded.\u201d Switching to a subscription payments would be unfair, Unsworth argued, because those willing to pay would end up funding a service that is still obliged to try to inform and reach the entire British public, according to its charter terms. \u201cThis is where the whole subscription model starts to come adrift. If you have a national civic function, you cannot then choose for only certain sections of the audience to pay for it,\u201d she said. Unless the charter is radically altered in 2027, the BBC\u2019s \u201cuniversal mission\u201d in not a consumerist one, but a key duty to keep the people informed, she argued. \u201cUnder our charter, the job is to provide impartial news without fear or favour, and not to be beholden to commercial or political interests.\u201d The BBC\u2019s \u201ccivil contingency\u201d function is also in danger of being forgotten, Unsworth believes. Aside from providing news \u2013 \u201cpublic purpose number one\u201d \u2013 the broadcaster must offer guidance in case of national emergency. She had recently witnessed this working in Australia, she said, when ABC regional radio services were relied upon during the power cuts caused by dangerous bushfires. After two years in the top news job, Unsworth is now meeting criticism from inside her own organisation. High pay levels among senior staff \u2013 her salary is in the \u201cup to \u00a3249,000\u201d bracket \u2013 have prompted censure as 450 job cuts were announced last month across reporting teams. She and her colleagues accept this level of scrutiny, she said. \u201cIt is fair that the BBC gets more attention, because we should be better than others. It is hard, but fair enough.\u201d Her restructured, or slimmed-down, news service will be trialled next month, Unsworth said, explaining that it is designed to stop duplication and to give BBC reporting greater impact across all its channels, websites and radio stations. It will also make required budget savings. She sees the gender pay gap scandal as \u201ca running sore\u201d, she added, describing it as \u201ca legacy of yesteryear\u201d. Journalists Samira Ahmed, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague were among those who found they were paid less than male counterparts. \u201cWe have to work through all this and put structures in place that avoid us getting into this mess again.\u201d Julian Knight said this weekend that criminalising those who do not buy a television licence but use the BBC is out of date: \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at a world of populism, a world in which elites are being challenged an awful lot, the idea of criminal sanctions over the licence fee sticks in a lot of people\u2019s throats.\u201d But Unsworth regards such attacks as a conflation of two separate debates \u2013 one about the decriminalisation of this offence, the other about the fairness of the licence fee. She cited the words of John Bache, national chair of the Magistrates Association, who earlier this month told Today programme listeners that a change \u201cwould make an insignificant difference\u201d to levels of court congestion. Another irritation for Unsworth is the growing assumption that the BBC has lost its youth audience due to technological changes. In fact, she argues, this has not happened yet and a good percentage of young people still watch news broadcasts such as BBC One\u2019s six o\u2019clock bulletin, which has pulled in audiences of more than 5 million since Christmas. \u201cWe do see a slide in linear TV and radio consumption in the under 35s, it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those behaviours will probably be extended to the under 55s eventually, which is why we really have to think hard about ways of reaching them. But it really is not a crisis.\u201d When Hall\u2019s replacement is selected by Clementi this summer, they must champion all these arguments, and more. Yet Unsworth still believes the BBC\u2019s best defence will come from its listeners and viewers: \u201cOur real value lies in audience appreciation of what we do, rather than us simply banging the drum.\u201d",

In the immediate aftermath of his resignation, Number 10 didn\u2019t much object to suggestions that the prime minister engineered the chancellor\u2019s removal by ambushing him with a demand to sack all his special advisers, a demand that the prime minister knew the other man could never accept.

He might have softened the demand or agreed to present things in such a way that it wouldn\u2019t look like a humiliation for the chancellor. He did none of those things and so Mr Javid felt he had no choice but to quit. He was already being mocked as \u201cchino\u201d \u2013 chancellor in name only. The ridicule would have reached eardrum-busting levels if he had conceded to having his advisers replaced with servants of Mr Cummings. This was not an accident \u2013 it was a coup.

Shortly after he moved over from Number 11 to Number 10, I recall Gordon Brown expressing frustration at how few resources he had at his disposal as prime minister compared with his previous office. The chancellor commands more than 1,100 staff at the Treasury\u2019s Horse Guards headquarters. Less than a fifth of that number work in the rabbit warren of offices in Downing Street that serve the prime minister. The Treasury has substantial units of civil servants to monitor the performance and spending of each Whitehall department. The prime minister usually has just one adviser in each subject area. Prime ministers habitually, and not always wrongly, become angered with the Treasury\u2019s often conservative institutional mindset and its control of the chequebook, especially when it wields that power to veto pet desires of the PM. Harold Wilson set up a rival Department of Economic Affairs. That gambit failed, not least because the drunken George Brown was in charge of the DEA. Theresa May almost instantly fell out with Philip Hammond. After two terms of arm-wrestling with Gordon Brown, Tony Blair asked John Birt, the one-time director general of the BBC, to draw up a secret blueprint to drain power from the imperial Treasury.

For those in the room with doubts about Javid\u2019s future, his cameo reassured them that he would survive the imminent ministerial cull.</p> <p>Despite the smile, however, Javid himself had become less confident in his position in the days leading up to Thursday\u2019s reshuffle. He confided in friends that he feared his special advisers were being targeted by Downing St. A week of damaging media briefings about the forthcoming budget and relations between the Treasury and No 10 had raised fresh doubts. Those doubts were well founded: by late morning, he had gone.</p> <p>Last night, Javid\u2019s allies remained furious about Boris Johnson\u2019s demand that Javid sack his advisers as part of a plan to combine the No 10 and No 11 team of special advisers, or \u201cspads\u201d \u2013 an inflammatory order that Javid felt compelled to refuse. However, they were clear on what was behind the surprise demand, which was presented as an afterthought by the prime minister at the end of a long and otherwise good-natured meeting with his now former chancellor.</p> <p>\u201cThe hierarchy of the move would be: 1, power and process, 2, policy and 3, personality,\u201d said one Javid ally. \u201cIt was predominantly about a frustration about the sheer power of the Treasury. It\u2019s very difficult to do something about that, short of massive Whitehall reorganisation. The one lever they had was the spad universe. It was a change of institutional power via the backdoor. It wasn\u2019t so much a joint team as a No 10 team.\u201d</p> <p>Both Javid\u2019s friends and senior figures across Whitehall are now trying to decipher a bigger question posed by the No 10 power grab, which dominated the reshuffle: would it come to be seen as the high watermark of the influence of Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave mastermind and senior adviser to Johnson? Or was it just an early skirmish in a much more ambitious attempt to sideline officials and departments, and centralise power inside Downing St?</p> <p>To some Cummings allies, rearranging and controlling the spads across Whitehall is the easy part of what they hope is a more ambitious plan to shake up Whitehall. As one put it: \u201c[Cummings] seems to focus on spads. For sure they are the most likely to leak, but not the biggest blocker \u2013 that\u2019s civil servants. And he\u2019s done nothing on that.

The relationship between Javid and Johnson was strong. Javid invited just three MPs to his recent 50th birthday party. One was the prime minister, who sat on the top table. The attempt inside Downing St to talk Javid round was prolonged and genuine. First, members of Johnson\u2019s staff attempted to change his mind, before a final one-on-one talk between prime minister and chancellor. Johnson is already said to have told senior Tories that he wants Javid back.</p> <p>However, in the week before the reshuffle, Javid\u2019s team became concerned. Briefings emerged in the media, which they believe were designed to unsettle the No10 and No11 relationship \u2013 some believe stories about a possible mansion tax were planted, to be used as evidence against Javid and his team. The emergence of the idea on the front page of a newspaper last weekend baffled those working on the budget. The story didn\u2019t seem to serve any purpose, other than to poison the well between No10 and No11, and foment distrust. In reality, insiders say that there were figures inside Downing St interested in a mansion tax, but that there were also sympathisers in the Treasury. However, Javid was already against the idea.</p> <p>There was also a briefing about a fallout between the prime minister\u2019s partner Carrie Symonds and Cummings, suggesting that she was critical of his aggressive approach and argued against sacking Javid. The story cited \u201cwell-placed Treasury sources\u201d, but Javid\u2019s allies insist it did not come from them and they detect foul play. \u201cIt was dark arts,\u201d said one friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"238fb66375d3d43cad4ca8c3a0ba7316c4f59305\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/238fb66375d3d43cad4ca8c3a0ba7316c4f59305/789_5_1391_1739/800.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson \u2013 demanded that Javid sack his advisers.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson \u2013 demanded that Javid sack his advisers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Treasury sources admit that a mistake was made in its handling of HS2, in which Javid\u2019s backing for the project was announced before No10 had made an official decision to go ahead with the project.

Indeed, when Javid asked the prime minister why his team should be dismissed, Johnson was unable to offer an argument.</p> <p>So what\u2019s next for Javid\u2019s replacement? Rishi Sunak, the highly-rated but untested new chancellor, is said to be spending the next week thinking things through, though it is still expected that the Budget will go ahead around 11 March. One consequence of the fallout, however, is that Sunak has been placed in the position of taking a role seen as too subservient for his predecessor. \u201cHe\u2019s in an exceptionally difficult position,\u201d said one senior MP. \u201cHe needs to have some distance [around the budget]. Otherwise, it\u2019ll look like a farce.\u201d</p> <p>The big question is whether Sunak sticks to Javid\u2019s fiscal rule, which promises to balance the books on day-to-day spending by the middle of the parliament.

The gaudy amusement arcades of penny-pushers and flashing gambling machines are almost completely deserted. The bored-looking staff in the ice-cream parlours and takeaways gaze into their phones, waiting for customers.</p> <p>Dawlish on the south Devon coast is everything you might expect of a seaside resort in February. Yet this ostensibly sleepy West Country town was the nerve-centre of a violent gang from the north-east who over a decade built a brutal drug empire worth at least \u00a31m while also preying on vulnerable young women who fell under their spell.</p> <p>Earlier this month, 13 gang members \u2013 who were known locally as the Geordies, even though the core of the group originated from Sunderland \u2013 were sentenced collectively to 105 years after a four-month trial at Bristol crown court. They were found guilty of flooding Dawlish and the adjacent seaside town of Teignmouth with cocaine and heroin brought in by drug couriers from larger gangs in Liverpool and Sunderland. Five members were also convicted of multiple rapes of three women.</p> <p>The gang was led by self-proclaimed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51355785\" title=\"\">\u201cKing of Dawlish\u201d, James Lee Brooks, 41,</a> who boasted that it \u201cran the town\u201d.

Typically, gangs seeking to expand into smaller towns use so-called \u201ccounty lines\u201d, where runners bring in drugs and then return with the cash. But the Geordies actually moved to Dawlish, taking over the drug trade and terrorising much of the town\u2019s population with violence and threats to anyone who displeased them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in the job for 30 years and I cannot think of a case like it,\u201d says Nick Wilden, head of the organised crime branch, in the canteen of Exeter\u2019s police HQ. \u201cThey gained a stranglehold on the community.\u201d</p> <p>Wilden first encountered Brooks in 2009 while investigating crimes linked to the vast caravan and mobile-home parks that carpet Dawlish Warren, a popular resort near the town that welcomes up to 15,000 holidaymakers in the summer.</p> <p>\u201cI was the detective inspector for Teignbridge 10 years ago.

One split up from his wife and came down to get away from it,\u201d explains Glanville. \u201cThey knew Dawlish was a Sunderland stronghold, which they could join.\u201d</p> <p>The crimes escalated as more of them arrived. In 2011, police broke up a gang including Brooks and Dave Rowntree, also from Sunderland, bringing crack cocaine and heroin into Exeter. Brooks and Rowntree were each given five-year sentences.</p> <p>On their release from prison in 2014, they resumed their life in Dawlish. Meanwhile, the crimes linked to the Geordies continued to grow more serious. In 2017, a Dawlish shopkeeper carrying his takings to the post office had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-41614278\" title=\"\">ammonia squirted in his face during a robbery</a> by two men including Rowntree\u2019s brother, Paul Rowntree, with a key member of Brooks\u2019s gang, Ross Morton, driving the getaway car. Later that year, another member of the gang, Nazrul Islam, was arrested after he arranged for a debtor to be viciously beaten up. Officers discovered large amounts of cocaine and MDMA hidden in a safe in his car outside his house Teignmouth.</p> <p>Islam, who was not from the north-east, got involved with the gang after Brooks helped him deal with a local bully. Wilden says this is typical of the way gangs find recruits and root themselves in communities. \u201cYou find that organised criminals like to style themselves as some of kind of Don Corleone. I\u2019m not suggesting Brooks was the Godfather but he cultivated that sort of persona where he gets things sorted for people,\u201d says Wilden. \u201cThen they are in debt to him.\u201d</p> <p>These incidents alongside a lengthening list of assaults and increasingly brazen drug-dealing, attracted the interest of the force\u2019s organised crime branch. \u201cThere were areas of Dawlish where people were taking loads of drugs,\u201d says Glanville. \u201cWe arrested street dealers selling heroin, and all of them had Brooks\u2019s number in their phones.\u201d</p> <p>Raids on houses used by the gang revealed more of their inner workings. Police discovered lists of debts scrawled on notepads and saved on mobile phones, with some of the gang\u2019s customers owing up to \u00a350,000. On Brooks\u2019s phone, the police found footage of an assault on a dealer as well as messages threatening to \u201copen up\u201d a supplier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"699b54a73d270c99ef881224c434cadbbfb68abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/699b54a73d270c99ef881224c434cadbbfb68abb/10_8_782_978/400.jpg\" alt=\"John White and Ross Morton dish out an assault over a drugs debt.

I know people who were beaten up. One young lad was beaten up outside this pub,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m happy they are off the streets but we need to be careful because they still have people here.\u201d</p> <p>He claims he was threatened when he turned up late to fix a boiler for Brooks, and on a different occasion when he stepped in to protect an 80-year-old man who had let a room to a gang member. \u201cI\u2019m in the van, and he is trying to get me out of the van. Then Geordie Lee turns up in his Range Rover but I managed to drive off.\u201d</p> <p>A few locals seem to have a strange admiration for the Geordies. One tradesman remembers that Brooks didn\u2019t charge him for the hire of a bouncy castle \u2013 which was one of the gang\u2019s cover businesses \u2013 and also recalls watching the town\u2019s carnival with Brooks and his girlfriend. \u201cI\u2019ve met him 30 times in my life and 30 times a gentleman,\u201d he says. \u201cYou hear stories but he was no trouble to me.\u201d</p> <p>Another landlord, who gave evidence against the Geordies, recalls the group\u2019s enforcers bursting into the pub, searching for people who owed them money. \u201cYou could say that Geordie Lee was the king of Dawlish because he ran the drugs in the town and had lots of people working for him. But obviously there are loads of people who don\u2019t live in the centre who had no idea.\u201d</p> <p>The area feels safer now, he says. \u201cThe atmosphere has changed.

      "bodyText": "Retired couples and a smattering of teenagers bunking off school watch the grey swell of the Channel under a pale winter sky. The gaudy amusement arcades of penny-pushers and flashing gambling machines are almost completely deserted. The bored-looking staff in the ice-cream parlours and takeaways gaze into their phones, waiting for customers. Dawlish on the south Devon coast is everything you might expect of a seaside resort in February. Yet this ostensibly sleepy West Country town was the nerve-centre of a violent gang from the north-east who over a decade built a brutal drug empire worth at least \u00a31m while also preying on vulnerable young women who fell under their spell. Earlier this month, 13 gang members \u2013 who were known locally as the Geordies, even though the core of the group originated from Sunderland \u2013 were sentenced collectively to 105 years after a four-month trial at Bristol crown court. They were found guilty of flooding Dawlish and the adjacent seaside town of Teignmouth with cocaine and heroin brought in by drug couriers from larger gangs in Liverpool and Sunderland. Five members were also convicted of multiple rapes of three women. The gang was led by self-proclaimed \u201cKing of Dawlish\u201d, James Lee Brooks, 41, who boasted that it \u201cran the town\u201d. Brooks, known as \u201cGeordie Lee\u201d, was sentenced to 25 years for 20 offences, including conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis, as well as 13 counts of aiding and abetting rape. The dominant figures in the group have been in custody since the police swooped on addresses across the country last March, but many locals are still struggling to come to terms with the fact that a drug gang was able to take hold of their community for so long. \u201cMy friends had heard of them \u2026 some knew them,\u201d says Hannah Perry, 20, working in an ice-cream kiosk on the seafront. \u201cIt\u2019s scary what can go on under your nose, especially in such a small town.\u201d The detectives from Devon and Cornwall police\u2019s organised crime branch \u2013 which spent three years investigating Brooks\u2019s network of couriers, enforcers and dealers \u2013 had never encountered a criminal outfit like the Geordies. Typically, gangs seeking to expand into smaller towns use so-called \u201ccounty lines\u201d, where runners bring in drugs and then return with the cash. But the Geordies actually moved to Dawlish, taking over the drug trade and terrorising much of the town\u2019s population with violence and threats to anyone who displeased them. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the job for 30 years and I cannot think of a case like it,\u201d says Nick Wilden, head of the organised crime branch, in the canteen of Exeter\u2019s police HQ. \u201cThey gained a stranglehold on the community.\u201d Wilden first encountered Brooks in 2009 while investigating crimes linked to the vast caravan and mobile-home parks that carpet Dawlish Warren, a popular resort near the town that welcomes up to 15,000 holidaymakers in the summer. \u201cI was the detective inspector for Teignbridge 10 years ago. I remember him causing me problems then,\u201d he says, sipping from a cup of coffee. \u201cIt was general criminality: burglaries, car thefts and assaults. It was low-level, but it built and built and he brought people down with him.\u201d Although Brooks doesn\u2019t look like a gangland boss, he has an air of menace about him. \u201cHe is actually quite a small, strange looking character,\u201d says Wilden. \u201cBut he has a nasty edge to him \u2013 people were frightened of him and what he would do.\u201d Brooks had much more powerful masters in the north but he behaved as if he owned Dawlish. \u201cOrganised crime is very hierarchical,\u201d explains Wilden. \u201cSomeone like Brooks is like a local branch manager but he has got his loyal lieutenants and enforcers around him.\u201d The police suspect Brooks and his family may have been chased out of Sunderland by rival gangs but admit they are still not certain what prompted him to pick on Dawlish. \u201cThey were possibly forced out and they probably chose Dawlish because they had come down here on holiday,\u201d says Andy Glanville, the detective in charge in the investigation. \u201cThere was also a gap in the market because no one was running the drugs scene in Dawlish and Teignmouth.\u201d The other members of the gang from Sunderland came in dribs and drabs over the following years. \u201cSome of them came down for holidays and didn\u2019t go back. One split up from his wife and came down to get away from it,\u201d explains Glanville. \u201cThey knew Dawlish was a Sunderland stronghold, which they could join.\u201d The crimes escalated as more of them arrived. In 2011, police broke up a gang including Brooks and Dave Rowntree, also from Sunderland, bringing crack cocaine and heroin into Exeter. Brooks and Rowntree were each given five-year sentences. On their release from prison in 2014, they resumed their life in Dawlish. Meanwhile, the crimes linked to the Geordies continued to grow more serious. In 2017, a Dawlish shopkeeper carrying his takings to the post office had ammonia squirted in his face during a robbery by two men including Rowntree\u2019s brother, Paul Rowntree, with a key member of Brooks\u2019s gang, Ross Morton, driving the getaway car.

Officers discovered large amounts of cocaine and MDMA hidden in a safe in his car outside his house Teignmouth. Islam, who was not from the north-east, got involved with the gang after Brooks helped him deal with a local bully. Wilden says this is typical of the way gangs find recruits and root themselves in communities. \u201cYou find that organised criminals like to style themselves as some of kind of Don Corleone. I\u2019m not suggesting Brooks was the Godfather but he cultivated that sort of persona where he gets things sorted for people,\u201d says Wilden. \u201cThen they are in debt to him.\u201d These incidents alongside a lengthening list of assaults and increasingly brazen drug-dealing, attracted the interest of the force\u2019s organised crime branch. \u201cThere were areas of Dawlish where people were taking loads of drugs,\u201d says Glanville. \u201cWe arrested street dealers selling heroin, and all of them had Brooks\u2019s number in their phones.\u201d Raids on houses used by the gang revealed more of their inner workings.

On Brooks\u2019s phone, the police found footage of an assault on a dealer as well as messages threatening to \u201copen up\u201d a supplier. This was not an error on the gang\u2019s part: they often record beatings in order to intimidate customers and maintain control of the market. Yet the Geordies\u2019 violence was not restricted to those who owed them money. Police showed a video in court of gang member John Jackson, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm, punching a man in a pub. \u201cThere is an altercation, and he goes over and knocks him halfway across the pool table and breaks his jaw. It was nothing to do with drugs,\u201d says Glanville.

      "bodyText": "My, what a frenetic few hours that was. And only a taster of what\u2019s going on around the country, including various forms of cricket. A clear result in the Sheffield Shield where Queensland have rolled Tasmania by 10 wickets, while New South Wales head into a final day nicely poised against Victoria - 1/41 down, chasing 291 despite Nic Maddison\u2019s superb century. Elsewhere, South Australian lead by 314 against Western Australia. A massive day in the W-League with Canberra United\u2019s win setting up a mouth-watering three-way contest for the final top four spot after Perth Glory\u2019s six-goal thriller in the West sunk the Roar, and Victory\u2019s four-goal derby capitulation. A fast finish from the reigning premiers Adelaide sent fans home delighted after their comeback to sink the Saints in the AFLW, while Collingwood turned its record around against the Blues. Brisbane Roar kept their resurgence firing in the A-League against a hugely disappointing Western United, but the story of the day unfolded in South Australia, where the great Korean, Inbee Park overcame blustery final day conditions to hold on and win the LPGA Australian Open by three shots. Thanks for your company - that\u2019s Sportwatch! And that\u2019s why they call them the championship minutes - what an incredible late surge from the reigning premiers! They led 27-20 about 13 minutes into the final quarter before the Crows took to wing. They\u2019ve had their injury concerns and they had to blood a bunch of youngsters this season already, but they\u2019re on the board now. No dice for the Saints in their debut year. They\u2019ll have learned a stack from this defeat though. Finally - a grandstand AFLW finish this weekend! AFLW - final quarter - 5\u2019 to play: and we\u2019re tied! It\u2019s a terrific feed into the goalsquare to find the debutant Caitlin Gould - and the former volleyballer marks well, and then smacks home her set shot! And we are level with under five minutes to play! And with their tails up, it\u2019s the Crows in full flight, all of a sudden. They string the handpasses around the edge of the circle, and then find Madison Newman inside the 50 - and she fires them ahead! For the first time all game, can you believe this! What were you doing at 36? And after three children? Is the answer: making a professional comeback - seven years after your last official match? Because that\u2019s the equation for \u201cAussie\u201d Kim Clijsters - who takes to the court once again at the Dubai Open this week. No doubt there will be plenty of fans cheering on the former World No 1. What a dead-set legend. AFLW - 3/4 time: Adelaide 3.2 (20) trail St Kilda 4.2 (26) Well, we\u2019ve been crying out for a tight one this round - so far 11 points is the closest final margin we\u2019ve had, but this one, ladies and gentleman is poised nicely as our nail-biter. The Crows making plenty of the running, but shooting themselves in the foot with a series of inexplicable 50-metre penalties. St Kilda led by seven at the first turn, seven at the major break, and now just six at three-quarter-time. Can the premiers pull off a final quarter turnaround though? It was nervy near the death, but in the championship moments the seven-time major winner showed her incredible pedigree. It was ice in the veins on the 17th - here\u2019s the write up from our eyes at the ground courtesy Australian Associated Press: South Korean great Inbee Park has won the Women\u2019s Australian Open to add to her golfing legend. The seven-time major winner claimed a three-shot victory, capturing her 20th LPGA Tour title despite a final round of one-over 74 at Royal Adelaide on Sunday. Park finished at 14-under to win from American Amy Olson (70) while Hannah Green (74) was the best-placed Australian, tied 13th at six-under. Green stumbled with three early bogeys cruelling her quest to bridge the gap on overnight leader Park. Former world No 1 Park started Sunday\u2019s final round with a three-shot cushion from her 19-year-old compatriot Ayean Cho. But Cho\u2019s hopes of catching her esteemed countrywoman were quickly dashed: a birdie at the second hole was followed by three bogeys in the next four holes as she slid from contention. American Olson tried to put some pressure on Park, firing a three-under round in blustery winds. \u201cIt was a battle out there,\u201d Olson said. \u201cBut I was really pleased with how I struck it. In the wind you\u2019re going to miss greens and I had some really good up-and-downs.\u201d Only one golfer shot a lower round than Olson on Sunday - American Cristie Kerr carded a four-under 69 and finished eight-under and tied for sixth. France\u2019s Perrine Delacour (10-under) took outright third with China\u2019s Yu Liu and American Marina Alex the next-best at nine-under. Australia\u2019s Green headed the locals with world No 8 Minjee Lee finishing four-under and 21-year-old Robyn Choi three-under. Australia\u2019s Katherine Kirk finished at three over and Karis Davidson endured a torrid five-over final round to end at 11 over. And then there were three. W-League aficionados would have looked at this weekend\u2019s fixtures and said it was Roar\u2019s finals spot to lose; Victory with a good shout too. But the green machine from the capital have hung in there, despite a late first-half scare from the Lady Reds. Almost two-thirds possession and fashioning plenty of chances. Canberra grab a vital three points as both Victory and Roar slip up. It was a pressure fixture for the two seasons of these respective sides - Brisbane on the ascendent, Western United on a slow slide over recent weeks. With top six spots on the line it was the visitors who got the points - a costly mistake by debutant Imai and a fine finish by the youngster Muratovic today. \u201cWe played really bad. We cannot win games like this, and we definitely did not deserve to win the way we played today.\u201d A pretty rugged appraisal from skipper for the day, Besart Berisha - they were second best all over the park. It\u2019s a bad day at the office for Tash Dowie and her vastly experience Victory colleagues - they\u2019ve been hit by a light-blue coloured cyclone today! The Scotswoman Emslie firing a brace, with Matildas\u2019 Simon and Van Egmond adding salt to the wounds. The only silver lining for Victory fans is Brisbane\u2019s loss that sees their nearest rivals fail to make ground. But it could make for some nervy weeks to come. Golf - Australian Open - Yu implodes as Park eyes title Oh my. It was Inbee Park feeling the heat as Yu and Olson came home hard, but its the Chinese who has choked spectacularly late on. Two shots dropped while the South Korean navigates the par-5 17th nicely, getting onto the green after two near-perfect approach shots. It\u2019s the Frenchwoman Perrine Delacour now looming late at -10, in third behind Olson at -11, but Park remains -13, two shots clear. W-League - Goal! Canberra United 2-1 Adelaide (Khamis) 68 min: Hello. Here\u2019s an update, and how important could this news be in the scale of the season? It\u2019s the veteran Leena Khamis - a name almost synonymous with the entire W-League era - who pops up when her club needs her most. Canberra are back in front - and if it stays like this they\u2019ll make huge inroads on their rivals Roar and Victory. Update: And the points look safe now! Simone Charley with her fifth of the season with a towering far-post header off Thorsnes\u2019 delivery. And the home fans are ecstatic. 3-1! A-League - Goal! Western United 0-1 Brisbane (Muratovic) 61 min: Call this one a \u201cLatergram\u201d update - while I had eyes on the golf there\u2019s finally been an end to the stalemate in Ballarat. Robbie Fowler went to the bench after 50 minutes, calling time on the Dylan Wenzel-Halls experiment, replacing him with fellow youngster Mirza Muratovic - with near instantaneous effect. It was a good pinch from Brad Inman who stole the ball off debutant Tomoki Imai and fed the replacement who finished calmly with a well-struck effort. Game on! Golf - Australian Open - Inbee Park wobbles late on Plenty of divergent fortunes on the final round of the LPGA in South Australia. Park\u2019s Korean compatriot Ayean Cho has gone +4 so far with American Marina Alex also posting +3. In contrast it was the aforementioned Yu Liu and Amy Olson coming home with appropriately-moistured sails: -2 and -3 rounds respectively, and they\u2019re the two putting the heat on as Park bogeys the 15th to drop a shot. The gap\u2019s back to two - could we have a grandstand finish in store? Well, there was a late, late goal in the west - but alas for Roar fans it wasn\u2019t their team pulling it back to 3-3. Ayesha Norrie with the final word in what is just Perth\u2019s second win of the these. A terrific result for the team that has seemed a shadow of itself post-Sam Kerr. But they\u2019ve caused a major upset here, which could have huge ramifications for the finals run-in. And we have our finals teams decided in the NBL, where Melbourne United have won the local derby to claim fourth spot ahead of Brisbane, setting up a semi-final stoush with fierce rivals Sydney. Here\u2019s our eyes at the ground from the Australian Associated Press: It took until the final game of the regular season but Melbourne United have finally booked their place in the NBL semi-finals with a 109-90 victory over South East Melbourne Phoenix. United led from start to finish in Sunday\u2019s local derby at Melbourne Arena to record their 15th win of the season, earning fourth spot on percentage ahead of the Brisbane Bullets and New Zealand Breakers. The result also locks United into a mouth-watering best-of-three semi-final series with the league-leading Sydney Kings, opening on February 29 at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney. After struggling for consistency for most of the season, United roared home by winning four of the last five games to qualify for their third successive finals campaign. Brisbane\u2019s play-off hopes rested on the Phoenix upsetting Melbourne after Saturday\u2019s 36-point demolition of Cairns saw them overtake New Zealand in fourth spot. But United took control of the do-or-die contest from the outset, captain Chris Goulding piling on 15 points in the first quarter, then answering every challenge from the Phoenix to claim the season series 3-1 against the first-year franchise. W-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 0-3 Melbourne City (Emslie) 50 min: Oh my. The biggest ever derby margin is four goals; could we be on track for something more here today? There\u2019s just so much firepower in this City squad - they may have faltered last season, but Rado Vidosic\u2019s chargers are champing at the bit this year. It\u2019s a near faultless season thus far, and Emslie grabs he second of the match to put an exclamation point on it. Update: and can you believe it - it is four! And who else, Kyah Simon. They boast nine Matildas in their squad (as well Scottish and Kiwi internationals). Just too strong. A-League - 50 min: Oh my - that\u2019s a fair miss from Jay O\u2019Shea - after Brad Inman fires in a terrific cross! The Irish playmaker hasn\u2019t scored a goal in Australia, yet - and he hooks that effort just high and wide of Filip Kurto\u2019s goal. We\u2019re still goalless. Golf - Australian Open - Inbee Park closes in on win A lively end to the LPGA Australian Open from Seaton in South Australia, where the Korean Inbee Park was sitting very handsomely, four shots clear with her eye on a very tasty $1.3m purse at -15. It\u2019s tightened up a little since then though, with China\u2019s Yu Liu edging back a shot at -12, and American Amy Olsen grabbing clear third in -11 as all three come home on the back nine. Hannah Green the best of the Australians at -6, with Minjee Lee a touch further back at -4. W-League - half-time: Canberra 1-1 Adelaide And we did get a response in the capital, in blustery conditions. Isabel Hodgson with the equaliser right on the stroke of half-time and suddenly that finals race has got very lively again. The home side still in the box-seat, with the veteran 100+ cap Norwegian Elise Thorsnes looking prominent. In the Melbourne derby it has remained 2-0 to City at the break as well. Well, they huffed and they puffed, the Blues, but its the old rivals, Collingwood, that emerge with the four points. They\u2019re looking a different prospect to the side the languished in the much-maligned conference system last season. Great to see for Pies fans. Jordan Membrey with a double, and goals to Sarah D\u2019Arcy, Jordyn Allen, Sophie Casey and Aishling Sheridan. Brooke Walker, Lauren Brazzale and she of the golden kick, Tayla Harris, grabbing majors for Carlton. W-League - Goal! Perth Glory 3-2 Brisbane Roar (Yallop) 57 min: Here we go! It\u2019s another experienced head - the vastly experienced Tameka Yallop - that\u2019s decided enough is enough for those in orange. Do we have a seven-goal thriller on our hands? There\u2019s still plenty of time to come. 3-0 up 25 minutes in; you hope for Perth fans sake they don\u2019t squander this one. W-League - Goal! Canberra United 1-0 Adelaide (Hughes) 35 min: And there\u2019s the opener in the capital! With Brisbane struggling and Victory looking on the ropes, could the team from the territory keep their outside finals\u2019 chances alive? They\u2019re on there way now, thanks to Laura Hughes. A nice strike off the left peg has delighted the home fans. Can the Reds fight back? A-League - 30 min: So still tightly poised in Ballarat, where with half an hour gone we\u2019re still 0-0. The home side Western United enjoying the lion\u2019s share of the possession, but not too many clear cut opportunities, despite a bright first five minutes. W-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 0-2 Melbourne City (Emslie) 31 min: With a third of the game gone, is it entirely gone for the hosts? A good little patch for the visitors, whose Matildas have been prominent. Emily van Egmond - the hero for the national team against China - has got another goal, and just minutes later it\u2019s the Scot Claire Emslie who doubles the advantage. They\u2019re chasing shadows at the moment, Victory. They need their old heads to shake things up and get a foothold here. AFLW - 3/4 time: Carlton 2.4 (16) trails Collingwood 4.3 (27) We\u2019ve seen some relatively uneven contests this weekend across the AFLW, but could this one offer some last quarter fireworks? Both sides have been buzzing with intent, but it\u2019s the Magpies who have really dominated the marks inside 50, 9-2. Carlton notching almost 2-1 in the tackle count though, so they\u2019re working hard, the Blues. W-League - half-time: Perth Glory 3-1 Brisbane Roar Given what\u2019s at stake in this match - specifically Roar\u2019s finals hopes - especially seen in contrast to Perth\u2019s season, which has been a tough one so far, then you\u2019ll be as surprised as I am to know there have been FOUR first-half goals scored by Glory. Unfortunately one of those has been in the wrong net, with Morgan Aquino the unlucky party to register an own-goal, but they have flown out of the blocks courtesy a thumping 3rd minute header from Morgan Andrews, a clever lob from Crystal Thomas, before the American Andrews made it three from the spot. The og gives a small sliver of hope though. Massive half for Roar to come, you\u2019d have to say. They cannot afford to drop points here if they\u2019re to play finals. There\u2019s an all-Melbourne grudge match ticking over in the AFLW as well: Carlton v Collingwood - these legendary clubs of AFLM. And we\u2019re not far away from the late fixture where the Crows take on the Saints. We\u2019ve got a feast of football happening in the W-League today - as around the country there are currently three games underway. A shock result trickling in from the West - more on Perth v Brisbane, shortly - while we\u2019ve just kicked off in Canberra where the green machine host the Reds of Adelaide, and in Melbourne: a very tasty Melbourne derby. Yes please. A-League - Western United v Brisbane Roar - kick-off! 1 min: We\u2019re in Ballarat, where it\u2019s picture perfect conditions for football - what a great stadium this looks. A very public display of cordiality pre-game between Mark Rudan and Robbie Fowler, who you may recall were not best pals on first impressions. No Scott McDonald today though - the player who Brisbane whisked to freedom after an SOS send from Western United - he has a contract provision precluding him from facing his initial club. It\u2019s a heaped plate on Sunday Sportwatch, with a veritable feast of AFLW and W-League to choose from, as well as a very tasty A-League grudge match between two clubs that have developed quite an animosity despite their tender age (on the part of Western United at least). There\u2019s women\u2019s golf - maybe some cricket? Who knows! If it\u2019s sport, if it moves, we\u2019ll hunt it.",

Its manifesto referred to a \u201cwealth grab by the privileged few\u201d without unpacking <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Real-Change-Labour-Manifesto-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">what that meant</a> and did not explain why people with more should contribute more in taxes \u2013 it just assumed this was self-evident.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The biggest challenge facing the left is how to win in the face of the toxic populism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labour seemed to assume that bringing voters onside was just a case of arguing the case more forcefully, rather than framing the arguments in terms that chime with people\u2019s own values and beliefs. And so its campaign felt more like turning out the morally pure rather than persuading swing voters.</p> <p>The left has had more success when it makes the case in terms designed to appeal to the persuadable. For example, the campaign for equal marriage in the US achieved such a big impact because it framed the argument using conservative values of family and responsibility, rather than leftwing values of equality and human rights. When it comes to higher taxes, there is evidence to suggest that the public can be won over; six in 10 think the government should be <a href=\"http://natcen.ac.uk/news-media/press-releases/2018/september/support-for-more-tax-spend-at-fifteen-year-high/\" title=\"\">taxing and spending</a> more. But, according to Nicky Hawkins, a communications strategist at the FrameWorks Institute, Labour needs to do more explaining, rather than relying on shorthands such as \u201cthe top 1%\u201d and \u201ccorporate greed\u201d, which might resonate in a constituency meeting but not in a party political broadcast. \u201cThere are clear lessons from attempts to reform harmful tobacco and food industry practices,\u201d Hawkins says. \u201cCampaigners need to succinctly define the \u2018baddie\u2019 and explain their wrongdoing. Too often, they assume people automatically see things the way they do.\u201d</p> <p>This is consistent with new research about to be published by<a href=\"https://www.taxjustice.uk/\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.taxjustice.uk/\" title=\"\">Tax Justice UK</a><a href=\"https://www.taxjustice.uk/\" title=\"\"> </a>that found that, when making the case for a more progressive tax system, bashing the wealthy resonated far less well with voters than specific arguments about closing loopholes and increasing particular taxes. It might be less sexy than talk of predatory wealth extractors, but it is more effective. The left might also do well to focus on the instrumental rather than the moral case: tax as a building block for a better society rather than as a way to punish the undeserving rich.</p> <p>Hawkins warns that the left must be wary of broadbrush \u201cthem v us\u201d narratives: not only are they not very effective, they can create a harmful spillover. Research by the New Economics Foundation found <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/Framing-the-Economy-NEON-NEF-FrameWorks-PIRC.pdf\" title=\"\">public thinking</a> about the economy is deeply fatalistic: there is considerable scepticism about the power of politicians to make it fairer. Talking about how rigged the system is, as Corbyn has done, risks further embedding that sense of fatalism.</p> <p>It may be tempting to see the rewards reaped by the right from whipping up anger and feeding off resentment and to hope that progressive politicians could emulate that success by changing the target for something more legitimate. But the left should exercise caution before embracing populist tactics: they should be used sparingly, if at all.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist</p>",

Its manifesto referred to a \u201cwealth grab by the privileged few\u201d without unpacking what that meant and did not explain why people with more should contribute more in taxes \u2013 it just assumed this was self-evident. Labour seemed to assume that bringing voters onside was just a case of arguing the case more forcefully, rather than framing the arguments in terms that chime with people\u2019s own values and beliefs. And so its campaign felt more like turning out the morally pure rather than persuading swing voters. The left has had more success when it makes the case in terms designed to appeal to the persuadable. For example, the campaign for equal marriage in the US achieved such a big impact because it framed the argument using conservative values of family and responsibility, rather than leftwing values of equality and human rights. When it comes to higher taxes, there is evidence to suggest that the public can be won over; six in 10 think the government should be taxing and spending more. But, according to Nicky Hawkins, a communications strategist at the FrameWorks Institute, Labour needs to do more explaining, rather than relying on shorthands such as \u201cthe top 1%\u201d and \u201ccorporate greed\u201d, which might resonate in a constituency meeting but not in a party political broadcast. \u201cThere are clear lessons from attempts to reform harmful tobacco and food industry practices,\u201d Hawkins says. \u201cCampaigners need to succinctly define the \u2018baddie\u2019 and explain their wrongdoing. Too often, they assume people automatically see things the way they do.\u201d This is consistent with new research about to be published by Tax Justice UK that found that, when making the case for a more progressive tax system, bashing the wealthy resonated far less well with voters than specific arguments about closing loopholes and increasing particular taxes. It might be less sexy than talk of predatory wealth extractors, but it is more effective. The left might also do well to focus on the instrumental rather than the moral case: tax as a building block for a better society rather than as a way to punish the undeserving rich. Hawkins warns that the left must be wary of broadbrush \u201cthem v us\u201d narratives: not only are they not very effective, they can create a harmful spillover. Research by the New Economics Foundation found public thinking about the economy is deeply fatalistic: there is considerable scepticism about the power of politicians to make it fairer. Talking about how rigged the system is, as Corbyn has done, risks further embedding that sense of fatalism. It may be tempting to see the rewards reaped by the right from whipping up anger and feeding off resentment and to hope that progressive politicians could emulate that success by changing the target for something more legitimate. But the left should exercise caution before embracing populist tactics: they should be used sparingly, if at all. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "O land of password, handgrip, wink and nod, Of open minds as open as a trap, Where tongues lie coiled, as under flames lie wicks, Where half of us, as in a wooden horse, Were cabin\u2019d and confined like wily Greeks, Besieged within the siege, whispering morse. In the poem Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, Seamus Heaney immortalised the code of discretion, of the silences, winks and nods that defined the Troubles. The family of Jean McConville, a Belfast mother of 10 who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1972, has spent almost five decades trying to crack the omert\u00e0. It is an ongoing struggle \u2013 and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s triumph in Ireland\u2019s general election last weekend suggests time is not on the family\u2019s side. McConville\u2019s name did not feature in the campaign. And Gerry Adams, the Sinn F\u00e9in figure most associated with the case, stood down as a TD (MP), distancing the party from awkward questions. \u201cIgnore the problem and it\u2019ll go away, that\u2019s the strategy,\u201d said Seamus McKendry, who is married to McConville\u2019s daughter Helen and is an outspoken campaigner on the case. Adams resigning as party leader in 2018, and now exiting the Irish parliament, helped pave the electoral breakthrough, said McKendry. \u201cThe best thing the Sinners ever did,\u201d he said, using a nickname for Sinn F\u00e9in. \u201cWith him out of the road it was easier to vote for Mary Lou McDonald and other candidates.\u201d Outside Ireland, Sinn F\u00e9in is best known for having been the IRA\u2019s political wing during the Troubles, but at home it has reinvented itself as an Irish version of the Spanish party Podemos or the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic party. On the promise of cheaper housing, better healthcare and more public spending, it won a quarter of the popular vote \u2013 almost double its tally in the 2016 general election \u2013 and 37 seats in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, making it a contender for power for the first time. No party gained a majority in the D\u00e1il, so talks are under way to form a coalition. Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, Ireland\u2019s two big centrist parties, have ruled out governing with Sinn F\u00e9in, raising the spectre of stalemate and another election. When it comes to her party\u2019s fraught legacy, McDonald, 50, a Dubliner who succeeded Adams as leader, has not been able to say nothing. During the campaign the murder of Paul Quinn, a young man beaten to death by alleged IRA members in 2007, returned to haunt the party and tripped up McDonald in a televised debate. David Cullinane, a newly elected TD, caused a row last week by shouting \u201cUp the \u2019Ra\u201d. McDonald responded by saying that she had urged party members not to make \u201cthrowaway comments\u201d. She added: \u201cI\u2019m not their mammy. I don\u2019t censor them either. We\u2019re all adults and I do expect them to behave in an adult way.\u201d The Troubles, in other words, are still politically troublesome. Many Sinn F\u00e9in members believe the media stirs up old ghosts to discredit the party\u2019s redistributive economic policies. Last week Enda Fanning, a senior party official, said an RTE radio show had \u201cdenigrated\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in representatives. \u201cIt really needs to be addressed by a new government and a proper monitoring authority with powers introduced to prevent such political bias,\u201d he tweeted. In Northern Ireland, in contrast, Sinn F\u00e9in revisits the Troubles by backing legacy investigations into Bloody Sunday and other killings of Catholics and nationalists. Unionists accuse the party of \u201cweaponising\u201d the past for political gain. Supporters south of the border, meanwhile, especially young supporters, focus on the party\u2019s solutions to homelessness, soaring rents and hospital waiting lists. They shrug off the Troubles. \u201cWhen we went knocking on the doors it didn\u2019t come up,\u201d said Mark Ward, who was elected in the Dublin Mid-West constituency. \u201cPeople have moved on. What concerned them was infrastructure, housing, health, having less money in your pocket at the end of the week.\u201d A new generation had come of age since the 1998 Good Friday agreement, said Deagl\u00e1n de Br\u00e9ad\u00fan, author of Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn F\u00e9in. \u201cThe past is always present \u2026 but officially the IRA hasn\u2019t been active since 1997. That\u2019s 23 years \u2013 a lot of voters wouldn\u2019t have been born then, or were too young at the time to remember it now.\u201d When recalling IRA activities, Sinn F\u00e9in tended to focus on hunger strikers rather than, for instance, the bombers who tried to blow up Margaret Thatcher, said De Br\u00e9ad\u00fan. As leader, McDonald has to play down the paramilitary legacy without irking the republican base, he said. \u201cThe problem is that, if she goes too far and puts too much distance between herself and the \u2018struggle\u2019, she might alienate veterans of that era. So a little bit of republican rhetoric is probably no harm at times.\u201d He reckons she is unlikely to repeat the old IRA slogan tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1 (\u201cour day will come\u201d), which she used to close a party conference in 2018. The family of McConville, meanwhile, wonder if or when their day will come. A former Belfast IRA commander, Brendan Hughes, claimed before his death that Adams gave the order that McConville be killed and \u201cdisappeared\u201d over suspicion, since discredited, that she was an informer. An IRA team dragged the widow from her screaming children, shot her and buried her at a beach in county Louth, south of the border. Not wanting blame for creating 10 orphans, republicans spread a rumour McConville had abandoned her children and moved to England with a British soldier. Pressed by campaigners, the IRA admitted the murder in 1999. A dog walker stumbled across her remains in 2003. Adams has consistently denied any knowledge of the murder or being in the IRA. An attempt to link him to the murder based on the trial of Ivor Bell, an IRA commander, failed when the case collapsed last year. McKendry, McConville\u2019s son-in-law, said he glimpsed Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s ascent in 2011 when he lobbied voters in Louth \u2013 in vain \u2013 to reject Adams, who was standing in the constituency. They told him they didn\u2019t care about Adams\u2019s past. \u201cI found it incredibly hurtful.\u201d McKendry shared voters\u2019 sentiment to shake up Irish politics, but wished they had chosen another agent of change. \u201cI can understand the younger ones, they didn\u2019t live through the war, but people of my age coming out and voting for Sinn F\u00e9in, I despair.\u201d The irony of Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s rise as the party of the future is its vexed relationship to its own past, said Patrick Radden Keefe, author of Say Nothing, a 2018 investigative book about McConville\u2019s murder. \u201cThey\u2019ve never been able to rebut, in a remotely credible way, testimony that the party\u2019s long-time leader ordered one of the most notorious war crimes of the Troubles.

When the Rockets beat the Clippers 102-93 in Los Angeles last November, Doc blew up at the referees, and Austin started putting his arms together into a \u201cT\u201d and calling for them to hit his dad with a technical foul. They ended up sending Doc off to the stands, Austin burst out laughing, then put his hand to his ear and promised to call him later. \u201cI knew it was coming,\u201d Austin said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that look before many times. Once he starts blinking his eyes fast, that\u2019s when I know he\u2019s about to level up.\u201d It sounds as though they are one of the few families around who really understand what the Farrells are going through.",

      "body": "<p>Oh good, there goes another lifelong ambition. To spend my old age upon a cruise ship. Unlike the others (living in a hotel by the age of 30, declining a British honour, taking full control of my personal grooming), this is an ambition I\u2019ve chosen to back out of with dignity, rather than having it cruelly removed by age and cash.</p> <p>Here is what I used to imagine cruises were like \u2013 and please picture the following as if they are medium-format prints hand-tinted by a nostalgic raver. A series of ballrooms, connected by mirrored corridors. Buffets as long as the M1, with a separate room for puddings. Swimming pools heated to a rich chlorinated blood, monogrammed towelling robes, and the very gentlest scent of Poirot. Cabins that feel like luxury live-work spaces, where the gentle rock of the ocean soothes passengers to sleep in a hushing lullaby. Very good karaoke. Everything dense and velvet, and radiating contradictory glamour \u2013 old Hollywood cut through with the louche punkiness of a Divine gif. Then, at every stop, a new type of holiday: safari on Monday, ruins on Tuesday, the beach on Friday. The idea that one could simply lie there in a turban and let experiences come to you, thrills me.</p> <p>But then, of course, I learned the truth. As I type, the 2,666 passengers onboard the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-60-more-cases-on-cruise-ship-as-depression-sets-in\" title=\"\">Diamond Princess </a>cruise ship off the coast of Yokohama are still confined to their cabins, as 130 have tested positive for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. Those in windowless cabins are being allowed out in shifts to take air once a day, the rest of the time presumably lying quite still on their bunks and wondering if this is death, or this. Another cruise ship \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/05/cruise-ships-quarantined-over-coronavirus-in-pictures\" title=\"\">World Dream</a> \u2013 has been quarantined in Hong Kong after three former passengers caught the virus. A third, the Royal Caribbean\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-royal-caribbean-cruise-bans-chinese-nationals\" title=\"\">Anthem of the Seas</a>, has docked in New Jersey while people are tested, and a British-American owned liner, the Westerdam, has been turned away by Japan, just in case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These liners seem to take on the illness of their passengers, lurching tearfully across the sea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cruise ships are notoriously effective disease incubators, with vast floating norovirus outbreaks common. Vomit sloshes across the polished decks, passengers groan their bodies from lounge to toilet, stopping only to finger a Danish. Like mythological ghost ships, adrift and occasionally alight, these cruise liners seem to take on the illness of their passengers, lurching tearfully across the sea, sickness rippling behind them.</p> <p>And bad things happen on boats. In HBO\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/10/breath-of-fresh-heir-how-succession-became-the-must-watch-tv-of-the-year\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em>, the Waystar Royco empire\u2019s cruise ship division spent years covering up onboard deaths and sexual assaults. While the Roy family dance around their canap\u00e9s to try and make the scandal disappear, the scale of the ships, the distance from shore, the abstracted nature of such crimes is part of what allows them to elegantly ignore the lives destroyed. It\u2019s no coincidence that their fictional awfulness happened at sea \u2013 there\u2019s been a host of mysterious deaths and disappearances on cruise ships.</p> <p>A website called <a href=\"http://cruisejunkie.com/\" title=\"\">cruisejunkie.com</a> charts passengers and crew overboard \u2013 the current figure since 1995 is 361. In a piece investigating the 2011 disappearance of crew member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/11/rebecca-coriam-lost-at-sea\" title=\"\">Rebecca Coriam</a>, the journalist and documentary filmmaker Jon Ronson talked to the founder of the lobby group <a href=\"http://www.internationalcruisevictims.org/\" title=\"\">International Cruise Victims</a> about his theories of \u201cmurder, negligence and cover-ups\u201d and his claims that the sexual crime rate is 50% higher than in the average American city. \u201cYou\u2019re on a ship,\u201d Kendall Carver told Ronson. \u201cThere\u2019s no police. Once you leave the port, you\u2019re in international waters.\u201d</p> <p>On the one hand, yes. The picture painted is one of a floating hellmouth, a ticking bomb pushed out to sea. The infections are a stark reminder that you are stuck breathing the same air as strangers who want to tell you all their opinions again \u2013 on a good day, you could simply avoid them by taking an early breakfast, but on a bad day you will be joint hosts of a germ that makes you defecate in sync. To climb aboard a cruise ship is to lower yourself, lobster-like, into a soon boiling pan.</p> <p>Fossil fuels burn behind them, they destroy the fragile habitats they visit, nobody appears accountable for crimes onboard. Like riverboat barmitzvah parties, where guests aren\u2019t allowed to leave until the last slow dance has died, cruises carry the same ominous threat as any thriller \u2013 the genre necessitates an element of horror. Passengers are giving up the autonomy they have worked years to secure \u2013 another stranger will decide what they eat, who they drink with, and whether they ever return home.</p> <p>And on the other hand\u2026 it still appeals. The giving up control, the forced fun, the nice towels. I am even fond of the idea that artificial towns are being thrown together simply for cruising tourists, who alight after lunch, grateful for the simulacrum of culture provided, back to the cabin in time for a nap before tea. What peace. And swimming pools on a boat! Water upon water! Such balls-out decadence! But sighingly, I must cross these dreams from my list. We will call it exercising cruise control, and move on to the next disappointment, gracefully.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Oh good, there goes another lifelong ambition. To spend my old age upon a cruise ship. Unlike the others (living in a hotel by the age of 30, declining a British honour, taking full control of my personal grooming), this is an ambition I\u2019ve chosen to back out of with dignity, rather than having it cruelly removed by age and cash. Here is what I used to imagine cruises were like \u2013 and please picture the following as if they are medium-format prints hand-tinted by a nostalgic raver. A series of ballrooms, connected by mirrored corridors. Buffets as long as the M1, with a separate room for puddings. Swimming pools heated to a rich chlorinated blood, monogrammed towelling robes, and the very gentlest scent of Poirot. Cabins that feel like luxury live-work spaces, where the gentle rock of the ocean soothes passengers to sleep in a hushing lullaby. Very good karaoke. Everything dense and velvet, and radiating contradictory glamour \u2013 old Hollywood cut through with the louche punkiness of a Divine gif. Then, at every stop, a new type of holiday: safari on Monday, ruins on Tuesday, the beach on Friday. The idea that one could simply lie there in a turban and let experiences come to you, thrills me. But then, of course, I learned the truth. As I type, the 2,666 passengers onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Yokohama are still confined to their cabins, as 130 have tested positive for coronavirus. Those in windowless cabins are being allowed out in shifts to take air once a day, the rest of the time presumably lying quite still on their bunks and wondering if this is death, or this. Another cruise ship \u2013 the World Dream \u2013 has been quarantined in Hong Kong after three former passengers caught the virus. A third, the Royal Caribbean\u2019s Anthem of the Seas, has docked in New Jersey while people are tested, and a British-American owned liner, the Westerdam, has been turned away by Japan, just in case. Cruise ships are notoriously effective disease incubators, with vast floating norovirus outbreaks common. Vomit sloshes across the polished decks, passengers groan their bodies from lounge to toilet, stopping only to finger a Danish. Like mythological ghost ships, adrift and occasionally alight, these cruise liners seem to take on the illness of their passengers, lurching tearfully across the sea, sickness rippling behind them. And bad things happen on boats. In HBO\u2019s Succession, the Waystar Royco empire\u2019s cruise ship division spent years covering up onboard deaths and sexual assaults. While the Roy family dance around their canap\u00e9s to try and make the scandal disappear, the scale of the ships, the distance from shore, the abstracted nature of such crimes is part of what allows them to elegantly ignore the lives destroyed. It\u2019s no coincidence that their fictional awfulness happened at sea \u2013 there\u2019s been a host of mysterious deaths and disappearances on cruise ships. A website called cruisejunkie.com charts passengers and crew overboard \u2013 the current figure since 1995 is 361. In a piece investigating the 2011 disappearance of crew member Rebecca Coriam, the journalist and documentary filmmaker Jon Ronson talked to the founder of the lobby group International Cruise Victims about his theories of \u201cmurder, negligence and cover-ups\u201d and his claims that the sexual crime rate is 50% higher than in the average American city. \u201cYou\u2019re on a ship,\u201d Kendall Carver told Ronson. \u201cThere\u2019s no police. Once you leave the port, you\u2019re in international waters.\u201d On the one hand, yes. The picture painted is one of a floating hellmouth, a ticking bomb pushed out to sea. The infections are a stark reminder that you are stuck breathing the same air as strangers who want to tell you all their opinions again \u2013 on a good day, you could simply avoid them by taking an early breakfast, but on a bad day you will be joint hosts of a germ that makes you defecate in sync. To climb aboard a cruise ship is to lower yourself, lobster-like, into a soon boiling pan. Fossil fuels burn behind them, they destroy the fragile habitats they visit, nobody appears accountable for crimes onboard. Like riverboat barmitzvah parties, where guests aren\u2019t allowed to leave until the last slow dance has died, cruises carry the same ominous threat as any thriller \u2013 the genre necessitates an element of horror. Passengers are giving up the autonomy they have worked years to secure \u2013 another stranger will decide what they eat, who they drink with, and whether they ever return home. And on the other hand\u2026 it still appeals. The giving up control, the forced fun, the nice towels. I am even fond of the idea that artificial towns are being thrown together simply for cruising tourists, who alight after lunch, grateful for the simulacrum of culture provided, back to the cabin in time for a nap before tea. What peace. And swimming pools on a boat! Water upon water! Such balls-out decadence! But sighingly, I must cross these dreams from my list. We will call it exercising cruise control, and move on to the next disappointment, gracefully. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman",

When the action starts, he\u2019s surrounded by four Belgian riders in national-team uniform, making it a pleasing echo of the famous Diego Maradona photograph from the 1982 World Cup. But suddenly Pidcock accelerates, weaving in and out of the Aertses and Van Aertses, skimming over the grass and claggy mud like a four-wheel drive set against underpowered automatics. The clip is 11 seconds long, but when it cuts, Pidcock is no longer even in shot. It was filmed on 2 February, and underneath the cycling writer Simon Warren noted: \u201cBritain leaving the EU\u201d.</p> <p>The video reminded me of a Fabian Cancellara attack at Paris-Roubaix in 2010. It\u2019s hard to talk about that sandwich-dropping footage now, because it has been overtaken by claims \u2013 in a video watched five million times \u2013 that the Swiss rider could only have achieved it with mechanical doping: that he had a motor inside his bike. Suffice to say that cycling has so brutalised its fans, for so long, that no form of cheating would be entirely surprising. But also, there are clearly brilliant, mercurial (and clean) individuals in the sport who are capable of feats on their bike that make you jump from your sofa.

Pidcock did, however, finish second. He could have been competing in the under-23s race in Switzerland, which he won last year, but that\u2019s not his style. Instead, he became the first British man to win a medal at the cyclo-cross world championships, an event that\u2019s been held since 1950. \u201cWell I\u2019m no longer u23 world champ,\u201d Pidcock wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut I\u2019m now second best in the world. Today feels pretty special.\u201d</p> <p>In an age when, on track and road, British riders have become accustomed to lining up as favourites, cyclo-cross has not really figured. In fact, it might need some introduction. The sport has been called \u201cTough Mudder for cyclists\u201d and typically has competitors race laps of short courses across grass, sand, mud and gravel. Riders will, at points, have to hoick their bikes \u2013 which look similar to road bicycles, but sturdier \u2013 over staircases and barriers. It\u2019s all-action (races usually last about an hour) and there is rarely a dull moment for spectators; not comments you\u2019d always make about road cycling.</p> <p>Cyclo-cross dates back to the early 20th century and originates from racing cyclists in France wanting to stay fit in the winter (the season runs from September to February). The sport received early validation from Octave Lapize, who gave credit to his cyclo-cross conditioning after he triumphed in the god-awful 1910 Tour de France: \u201cYou are murderers,\u201d he screamed at organisers during a seven-summit, 202-mile stage on his single-gear bicycle. \u201cOui, des assassins.\u201d</p> <p>Since Lapize, though, excelling at cyclo-cross and road cycling has been less than guaranteed, at least among the men. (The Dutch rider Marianne Vos is a multiple world champion in cyclo-cross, on the road and on the track and probably on jelly and basically anywhere you can ride a bicycle.) The diminutive Jean Robic, who won the 1947 Tour de France, also claimed the inaugural cyclo-cross world championships in 1950, but since then there has never been another man who has achieved that double.</p> <p>Today\u2019s road champions, it seems, prefer winter training in sunny Majorca to trudging through the Flanders mud. Meanwhile, cycling has become slick, expensive and data-driven. Could a fearless young tyro like Pidcock be about to shake that up?</p> <p>Pidcock is certainly not short of confidence. He begins a recent promotional video listing his career goals: \u201cI want to win the Tour de France, Roubaix, road worlds, cross worlds, mountain bike worlds, downhill world champs.\u201d From behind the camera, a voice asks if that\u2019s really possible. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d Pidcock concedes.</p> <p>There\u2019s a little bit of the early-career Mark Cavendish in Pidcock: not in the way he rides, but more in his attitude. The words \u201ccocky\u201d and \u201carrogant\u201d tend to come up in profiles of Pidcock, but everyone who knows him well insists that\u2019s a misread of what he\u2019s like. That was true of Cavendish, too, certainly when he was starting out. Another similarity is their size. Cavendish was told that he had the wrong body shape to be a professional cyclist; Pidcock, whose stats put him at 5ft 2in and 50kg, would probably be the smallest rider in the pro peloton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf2f373ebb2fb93c55ac1d207231f38dca379d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdf2f373ebb2fb93c55ac1d207231f38dca379d2/0_102_2635_1581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There\u2019s a little bit of Mark Cavendish in Pidcock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There\u2019s a little bit of Mark Cavendish in Pidcock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pidcock says that he has already had offers from WorldTour teams \u2013 the level that Team Ineos races at \u2013 but he is not ready to commit yet.

      "bodyText": "Cyclo-cross videos do not really go viral \u2013 at least not outside of Dutch-speaking Belgium \u2013 but there\u2019s one that been doing modest traffic recently. It features the 20-year-old British rider Tom Pidcock at this month\u2019s world championships in Switzerland. When the action starts, he\u2019s surrounded by four Belgian riders in national-team uniform, making it a pleasing echo of the famous Diego Maradona photograph from the 1982 World Cup. But suddenly Pidcock accelerates, weaving in and out of the Aertses and Van Aertses, skimming over the grass and claggy mud like a four-wheel drive set against underpowered automatics. The clip is 11 seconds long, but when it cuts, Pidcock is no longer even in shot. It was filmed on 2 February, and underneath the cycling writer Simon Warren noted: \u201cBritain leaving the EU\u201d. The video reminded me of a Fabian Cancellara attack at Paris-Roubaix in 2010. It\u2019s hard to talk about that sandwich-dropping footage now, because it has been overtaken by claims \u2013 in a video watched five million times \u2013 that the Swiss rider could only have achieved it with mechanical doping: that he had a motor inside his bike. Suffice to say that cycling has so brutalised its fans, for so long, that no form of cheating would be entirely surprising. But also, there are clearly brilliant, mercurial (and clean) individuals in the sport who are capable of feats on their bike that make you jump from your sofa. Which, I guess, is why so many of us keep watching the sport. Pidcock, who is from Leeds and whose parents are enthusiastic cyclists, is clearly a young man of outrageous talents. He didn\u2019t go on to win the world championship. First place went to the 25-year-old Dutch polymath Mathieu van der Poel, who has enthralled and confused the cycling world by competing with equal swagger simultaneously in cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing and professional road cycling.

The principal threat to the safety of women, trans and not, is arguably identical. Somehow, as the Fawcett Society\u2019s Sam Smethers said, we need to \u201cmove this agenda forward\u201d. But Rebecca Long-Bailey seemed to find more common ground with the activists outside against gender critical meetings. \u201cWe need to end the discussion [on self-ID],\u201d she told <em>Newsnight</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The identification of transphobic behaviour requires no laboriously agreed or court-won description</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with antisemitism, the identification of transphobic behaviour, at its insulting or threatening worst, requires no laboriously agreed or court-won description. For further clarity, the Crown Prosecution Service offers <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/homophobic-biphobic-and-transphobic-hate-crime-prosecution-guidance\" title=\"\">guidance</a> on the kind of behaviour that might make an incident or crime transphobic. Such as: \u201cWas there any use of derogatory language that referred to sexual orientation or transgender identity?\u201d</p> <p>The Labour Campaign for Trans Rights was plainly referring to a different order of offences in the statement and pledges now endorsed by Lisa Nandy, Emily Thornberry, Dawn Butler, Angela Rayner and Long-Bailey. \u201cThere are still transphobes in our ranks,\u201d it states, \u201cand we have often failed to act as transphobia has gained ground within our party.\u201d Transphobic views and policies are cited, without examples, along with allegedly transphobic activists, who are, however, identified.</p> <p>Pledgers demand a \u201cfight against transphobic organisations such as Woman\u2019s Place UK, LGB Alliance and other trans-exclusionist hate groups\u201d. Both groups have supporters \u2013 possibly news to people who may not previously have been gripped by the gender-critical debate \u2013 who are themselves trans, as well as many well-known and veteran campaigners for gay rights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"604c3a395f33c833dca34a879f5a9aadf78fc31b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/604c3a395f33c833dca34a879f5a9aadf78fc31b/0_159_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Nandy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Nandy has observed that organisations are \u2018wilfully ... causing offence\u2019 in the trans debate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A legal response by a maligned group could yet yield, again in court, some embryonic definition of transphobia that, as with antisemitism and Islamophobia, could at least provoke dialogue, rather than shutting it down, and more Twitter wars. Given the lack of either examples or argument to justify the threat of mass expulsions, last week\u2019s Labour pledges read \u2013 phobia-hunting aside \u2013 as disturbingly undemocratic. Without dialogue, opposed groups can only polarise further, with one result being, as Scott Aikin and Robert Talisse argue in their forthcoming book, <em>Political Argument in a Polarized Age</em>, that people become unwilling to regard their opponents as political equals. \u201cBye\u201d, as unconcerned purists last week taunted the thousands tweeting #expelme in response to Labour\u2019s pledges.</p> <p>Leadership pledgers appeared similarly uncompromising on what level of disagreement, if they won, might be allowed. Nandy, observing that the debate \u201chas descended into pitting people against each other\u201d, offered, by way of improving it, that one organisation has been \u201cwilfully trying to go after trans people\u201d \u2013 evidence pending \u2013 also, \u201ccausing offence\u201d.</p> <p>In a Nandy-led world, then, the Islamophobia definition might need some more work. Its authors made clear, as does the Miller case, that human rights do not include the right not to be offended or to have your spiritual, or other non-negotiable private convictions, affirmed by fellow citizens. Perhaps a large body of opinion does expect public figures, such as Nandy and Long-Bailey, to denounce public conversation about self-ID and women\u2019s sex-based rights, to prohibit mention of biology, and condemn as a \u201chate group\u201d \u2013 categorised, then, with far-right terrorists \u2013 any disobedient voices. But the case for such unique protection must surely begin with something more reasoned \u2013 and democratic \u2013 than the 12 pledges.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",

But Rebecca Long-Bailey seemed to find more common ground with the activists outside against gender critical meetings. \u201cWe need to end the discussion [on self-ID],\u201d she told Newsnight. As with antisemitism, the identification of transphobic behaviour, at its insulting or threatening worst, requires no laboriously agreed or court-won description. For further clarity, the Crown Prosecution Service offers guidance on the kind of behaviour that might make an incident or crime transphobic. Such as: \u201cWas there any use of derogatory language that referred to sexual orientation or transgender identity?\u201d The Labour Campaign for Trans Rights was plainly referring to a different order of offences in the statement and pledges now endorsed by Lisa Nandy, Emily Thornberry, Dawn Butler, Angela Rayner and Long-Bailey. \u201cThere are still transphobes in our ranks,\u201d it states, \u201cand we have often failed to act as transphobia has gained ground within our party.\u201d Transphobic views and policies are cited, without examples, along with allegedly transphobic activists, who are, however, identified. Pledgers demand a \u201cfight against transphobic organisations such as Woman\u2019s Place UK, LGB Alliance and other trans-exclusionist hate groups\u201d. Both groups have supporters \u2013 possibly news to people who may not previously have been gripped by the gender-critical debate \u2013 who are themselves trans, as well as many well-known and veteran campaigners for gay rights. A legal response by a maligned group could yet yield, again in court, some embryonic definition of transphobia that, as with antisemitism and Islamophobia, could at least provoke dialogue, rather than shutting it down, and more Twitter wars. Given the lack of either examples or argument to justify the threat of mass expulsions, last week\u2019s Labour pledges read \u2013 phobia-hunting aside \u2013 as disturbingly undemocratic. Without dialogue, opposed groups can only polarise further, with one result being, as Scott Aikin and Robert Talisse argue in their forthcoming book, Political Argument in a Polarized Age, that people become unwilling to regard their opponents as political equals. \u201cBye\u201d, as unconcerned purists last week taunted the thousands tweeting #expelme in response to Labour\u2019s pledges. Leadership pledgers appeared similarly uncompromising on what level of disagreement, if they won, might be allowed. Nandy, observing that the debate \u201chas descended into pitting people against each other\u201d, offered, by way of improving it, that one organisation has been \u201cwilfully trying to go after trans people\u201d \u2013 evidence pending \u2013 also, \u201ccausing offence\u201d. In a Nandy-led world, then, the Islamophobia definition might need some more work. Its authors made clear, as does the Miller case, that human rights do not include the right not to be offended or to have your spiritual, or other non-negotiable private convictions, affirmed by fellow citizens. Perhaps a large body of opinion does expect public figures, such as Nandy and Long-Bailey, to denounce public conversation about self-ID and women\u2019s sex-based rights, to prohibit mention of biology, and condemn as a \u201chate group\u201d \u2013 categorised, then, with far-right terrorists \u2013 any disobedient voices. But the case for such unique protection must surely begin with something more reasoned \u2013 and democratic \u2013 than the 12 pledges. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Afew years ago, the World Health Organisation published a list of pathogens which it said needed urgent scientific attention. All were viruses, none had known treatments or vaccines, and all had the potential to trigger pandemics that could kill thousands \u2013 just as Ebola and swine flu did earlier this century. The viral dangers outlined in WHO\u2019s list included Nipah disease, as well as Lassa and Rift Valley fevers. Crucially, after much discussion, WHO experts later decided to add a new condition to this menu of maladies: Disease X. Disease X referred to \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d, said WHO. Humanity should now be working to seek out and tackle such mystery ailments, it added \u2013 though it was assumed they would remain remote threats for some time. This hope now looks forlorn with the sudden emergence of the respiratory disease Covid-19, which has rapidly acquired most of the characteristic of a Disease X. It is caused by a virus for which there is no vaccine or treatment and has already spread to 25 countries since first appearing in China two months ago. Very soon it may be officially labelled a pandemic, an epidemic gone global. The question is: was enough done to prepare the world for the emergence of Disease X, given that such a prospect had already been earmarked as a realistic risk? And what lessons do we now need to learn in a world that will certainly see further appearances of others? These points have been stressed by Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d he warned some time ago. A sufficiently deadly one will have the impact of a nuclear war, added Gates, who has urged authorities to stockpile antiviral drugs and therapies in preparation. Such approaches are backed by other experts who argue that, while the US, UK and EU may have strong, well-funded health services, poorer nations in Africa and Asia \u2013 where new disease outbreaks are most likely to occur \u2013 have health services that are often poorly funded and close to breaking point. \u201cThis is not going to be the last outbreak of a previously unknown disease,\u201d said Professor Trudie Lang, of Oxford University. \u201cWe have to strengthen the research capabilities of nations where new diseases emerge but which currently have the poorest ability to respond to the emergence caused by these viruses.\u201d Many WHO initiatives are aimed at providing improved health networks in these countries, said Lang, but more still needs to be done. \u201cWe have to seize the moment.\u201d This point was backed by Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. \u201cWorld health authorities have spent a lot of time and money making plans for dealing with the next major outbreak, which was assumed would be an influenza pandemic.

Consequently, whenever the NHS shares health data, even if it is anonymised, we need to have confidence in who it goes to and what they can do with it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/08/fears-over-sale-anonymous-nhs-patient-data\" title=\"\">Recent <em>Observer</em> coverage</a> raises big questions over the transparency and claims of anonymity in NHS data transfers through the research scheme used by the health service. It appears that individual-level UK medical data ends up being sold to American drug companies and there appears to be little transparency or accountability around the process.</p> <p>Society has largely lost control over how our personal data is collected and shared. The effects of this may feel creepy when they lead to an unexpectedly appropriate online recommendation, for example when I received ads for dog grooming, apparently as a consequence of posting pictures of dogs. But when data about us influences a credit rating, a hiring decision or a reoffending risk assessment in a probation case, we are unlikely ever to find out a breach has occurred.

Most people will feel that this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy\" title=\"\">\u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d</a> is unethical, crossing the boundaries of their rights and expectations, but financial profit remains the determining driver.</p> <p>This story is not new. We have heard it in terms of our online buying behaviour and the internet advertising market. In recent years, the <em>Observer</em> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica\" title=\"\">covered extensively</a> how the surveillance of online behaviour and profiling can be used to influence our political position, for example through social media.</p> <p>It is clear that the black box society does not only feed on internet surveillance information. Databases collected by public bodies are becoming more and more part of the dark data economy. Last month, it emerged that a data broker in receipt of the UK\u2019s national pupil database had <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/gambling-companies-used-schools-data-on-28m-children/\" title=\"\">shared its access</a> with gambling companies. This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg; even where initial recipients of shared data might be checked and vetted, it is much harder to oversee who the data is passed on to from there.</p> <p>Health data, the rich population-wide information held within the NHS, is another such example. Pharmaceutical companies and internet giants have been eyeing the NHS\u2019s extensive databases for commercial exploitation for many years. Google infamously claimed it could save 100,000 lives if only it had free rein with all our <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/googles-larry-page-wants-to-save-100-000-lives-but-big-data-isnt-a-cure-all-28529\" title=\"\">health data.</a> If there really is such value hidden in NHS data, do we really want Google to extract it to sell it to us? Google still holds health data that its subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/google-betrays-patient-trust-deepmind-healthcare-move\" title=\"\">DeepMind Health</a> obtained illegally from the NHS in 2016. </p> <p>Although many health data-sharing schemes, such as in the NHS\u2019s <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars/register-of-approved-data-releases\" title=\"\">register of approved data releases</a>], are said to be <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars/register-of-approved-data-releases\" title=\"\">\u201canonymised\u201d</a>, this offers a limited guarantee against abuse.</p> <p>There is just too much information included in health data that points to other aspects of patients\u2019 lives and existence. If recipients of anonymised health data want to use it to re-identify individuals, they will often be able to do so by combining it, for example, with publicly available information. That this would be illegal under UK <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/offences-relating-to-personal-data/enacted\" title=\"\">data protection law</a> is a small consolation as it would be extremely hard to detect.</p> <p>It is clear that providing access to public organisations\u2019 data for research purposes can serve the greater good and it is unrealistic to expect bodies such as the NHS to keep this all in-house.</p> <p>However, there are other methods by which to do this, beyond the sharing of anonymised databases. <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/epidemiology-and-public-health/research/celsius/using-ons-longitudinal-study\" title=\"\">CeLSIUS</a>, for example, a physical facility where researchers can interrogate data under tightly controlled conditions for specific registered purposes, holds UK census information over many years.</p> <p>These arrangements prevent abuse, such as through deanonymisation, do not have the problem of shared data being passed on to third parties and ensure complete transparency of the use of the data. Online analogues of such set-ups do not yet exist, but that is where the future of safe and transparent access to sensitive data lies.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/academic-staff/technology/eerke-boiten/eerke-boiten.aspx\" title=\"\">Prof Eerke Boiten</a> is director of the Cyber Technology Institute at De Montfort University, Leicester, which is recognised by the National Cyber Security Centre and EPSRC as an academic centre of excellence in cyber security research</p>",

      "bodyText": "Health data paints a rich picture of our lives. Even if you remove your name, date of birth and NHS number to \u201canonymise\u201d yourself, a full health history will reveal your age, gender, the places where you have lived, your family relationships and aspects of your lifestyle. Used in combination with other available information, this may be enough to verify that this medical history relates to you personally and to target you online. Consequently, whenever the NHS shares health data, even if it is anonymised, we need to have confidence in who it goes to and what they can do with it. Recent Observer coverage raises big questions over the transparency and claims of anonymity in NHS data transfers through the research scheme used by the health service. It appears that individual-level UK medical data ends up being sold to American drug companies and there appears to be little transparency or accountability around the process. Society has largely lost control over how our personal data is collected and shared. The effects of this may feel creepy when they lead to an unexpectedly appropriate online recommendation, for example when I received ads for dog grooming, apparently as a consequence of posting pictures of dogs. But when data about us influences a credit rating, a hiring decision or a reoffending risk assessment in a probation case, we are unlikely ever to find out a breach has occurred. The University of Maryland law professor, Frank Pasquale, calls this the \u201cblack box society\u201d. Much of what happens is likely to be illegal, but the volume of internet data collection and sharing is such that existing wide-ranging data protection laws, such as the GDPR, are impossible to enforce at scale and across jurisdictions. For the internet giants, we have little information to go on beyond what they wish to tell us, which historically has not always been accurate and never complete. Most people will feel that this \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d is unethical, crossing the boundaries of their rights and expectations, but financial profit remains the determining driver. This story is not new. We have heard it in terms of our online buying behaviour and the internet advertising market. In recent years, the Observer has covered extensively how the surveillance of online behaviour and profiling can be used to influence our political position, for example through social media. It is clear that the black box society does not only feed on internet surveillance information. Databases collected by public bodies are becoming more and more part of the dark data economy. Last month, it emerged that a data broker in receipt of the UK\u2019s national pupil database had shared its access with gambling companies. This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg; even where initial recipients of shared data might be checked and vetted, it is much harder to oversee who the data is passed on to from there. Health data, the rich population-wide information held within the NHS, is another such example. Pharmaceutical companies and internet giants have been eyeing the NHS\u2019s extensive databases for commercial exploitation for many years. Google infamously claimed it could save 100,000 lives if only it had free rein with all our health data. If there really is such value hidden in NHS data, do we really want Google to extract it to sell it to us? Google still holds health data that its subsidiary DeepMind Health obtained illegally from the NHS in 2016. Although many health data-sharing schemes, such as in the NHS\u2019s register of approved data releases], are said to be \u201canonymised\u201d, this offers a limited guarantee against abuse. There is just too much information included in health data that points to other aspects of patients\u2019 lives and existence. If recipients of anonymised health data want to use it to re-identify individuals, they will often be able to do so by combining it, for example, with publicly available information. That this would be illegal under UK data protection law is a small consolation as it would be extremely hard to detect. It is clear that providing access to public organisations\u2019 data for research purposes can serve the greater good and it is unrealistic to expect bodies such as the NHS to keep this all in-house. However, there are other methods by which to do this, beyond the sharing of anonymised databases. CeLSIUS, for example, a physical facility where researchers can interrogate data under tightly controlled conditions for specific registered purposes, holds UK census information over many years. These arrangements prevent abuse, such as through deanonymisation, do not have the problem of shared data being passed on to third parties and ensure complete transparency of the use of the data. Online analogues of such set-ups do not yet exist, but that is where the future of safe and transparent access to sensitive data lies. \u2022 Prof Eerke Boiten is director of the Cyber Technology Institute at De Montfort University, Leicester, which is recognised by the National Cyber Security Centre and EPSRC as an academic centre of excellence in cyber security research",

      "body": "<p>Le\u00efla Slimani is running late. She texts to say she\u2019s waiting for her children\u2019s nanny to arrive. Can this be true? Does the writer whose bestselling novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/10/lullaby-leila-slimani-review\" title=\"\">Lullaby</a></em> features a killer childminder and begins: \u201cThe baby is dead\u201d, really have a nanny with whom she is perfectly happy to leave her two young children?</p> <p>Slimani shrugs off the irony when she arrives, a delicate bird-like figure with huge brown eyes and a perfect mop of caramel corkscrew hair. \u201cI can\u2019t honestly say I think about it. Our nanny\u2019s been with us for years and she\u2019s extraordinary. Besides, there are too many other things to worry about,\u201d she says. \u201cNormally they are at school, but now there are the strikes, which means no school. I\u2019m doing my best but it\u2019s only 10am and already I\u2019m exhausted.<em> Je ne peux plus </em>(I can\u2019t carry on).\u201d</p> <p>Thank goodness for the nanny. We are in a hotel not far from Slimani\u2019s reportedly vast apartment in what is now called SoPi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/28/paris-city-guide-day-in-south-pigalle\" title=\"\">South Pigalle</a>, once a semi-sleazy district, now a hub for young Parisian \u2018BoBos\u2019 \u2013 bourgeois bohemians \u2013 and hipsters. The French-Moroccan author is promoting her book <em>Sexe et Mensonges: La Vie Sexuelle au Maroc</em> (<em>Sex and Lies</em>), published in French in 2017 but only now in English.</p> <p>It is a curious sequel to her two novels: a slim nonfiction work about women\u2019s sexual rights in Morocco, a country in which abortion and non-marital sex are banned, and even kissing in the street can lead to arrest for being a \u201cdanger to social order\u201d. Slimani collected the confidences of dozens of women of all ages in order to write it and presents their stories in their own words.</p> <p>The subject is timely but geographically narrow, since the book highlights the plight of Moroccan women in particular, not north African women in general. For whom is it written?</p> <p>\u201cFor all Moroccans, not just the women, but the men, and especially young people, and those I detest, like the elected people, the elite, the bourgeoisie who refuse to see things as they are, who see a mirror and don\u2019t look at the reflection but want to smash it. This book is a mirror they cannot break, that makes them look reality in the face,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cAfter I started writing novels, I understood the power of words, the power one could have telling the truth, and this gave me the courage to describe how things really are for women in Morocco. I wanted to give these women a voice and show that the situation has terrible and sometimes tragic consequences when you consider the backstreet abortions, the abandoned children, the rapes and the traumas.\u201d</p> <p>In September, Slimani led a public call for the decriminalisation of abortion and non-conjugal sexual relations in Morocco, following the jailing of a journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/moroccan-journalist-hajar-raissouni-jailed-abortion\" title=\"\">accused of having an illegal abortion</a>. Moroccan campaign groups estimate there are up to 800 illegal abortions every day, a situation Slimani describes as \u201cunbearable and unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p><em>Lullaby</em>, published in 2016, and called <em>Chanson Douce</em> in France, turned Slimani into a literary star overnight. It has sold an estimated 1m copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. If abroad it was regarded as just a chilling parental horror story, in France the novel sparked cleverer debates on its themes of motherhood, racism and social inequality. When Slimani won the prestigious Goncourt prize, only the 12th female author to win since the prize started in 1903, French <em>Elle</em> put her on the cover of its January 2017 edition with the headline: \u201cLe\u00efla Slimani Superstar\u201d.</p> <p>She was hailed as the modern embodiment of Marianne, the iconic female symbol of the French Republic; a young, beautiful, clever multilingual and multicultural poster girl for a new, more youthful France led by President Emmanuel Macron, the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.</p> <p>Fast forward to the autumn of that year and Slimani was at home breastfeeding her baby daughter when the telephone rang. It was Macron, calling to offer her the job of culture minister. Slimani hung up. \u201cIt was so completely out of the blue, I thought my husband had put someone up to it, that it was a joke, so I ended the call,\u201d she says, laughing. The Elys\u00e9e Palace rang back, but Slimani turned the job down. \u201cI wasn\u2019t tempted; I\u2019m a writer,\u201d she adds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Slimani was four, she told her parents: 'It\u2019s my mouth and I\u2019ll say what I want,' earning her the nickname C\u00e9mabouche</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, a few weeks later Macron invited Slimani to meet him at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, where she received a presidential offer she did not refuse: the job of francophone affairs minister. Her remit? To promote the French language and culture around the world. The post has always gone to a career politician in the past, so her appointment was a break with tradition. But Macron said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/06/emmanuel-macron-appoints-author-leila-slimani-to-champion-french-language-and-culture\" title=\"\">chose Slimani for the role</a> because she \u201crepresents the open face of <em>francophonie</em> to a multicultural world\u201d and belongs to \u201ca new generation\u201d he wants to highlight.</p> <p>Slimani is ill at ease on the subject of her relationship with Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s private,\u201d she says when pressed. But her official role does not make her shy away from writing about certain aspects of government policy. A frequent contributor to the opinion pages of French newspapers \u2013 after the November 2015 bombings and shootings across Paris that left 130 dead she wrote a piece headlined \u201cExtremists, I hate you\u201d \u2013 she certainly felt able to take Macron to task for not defending migrants with \u201cmore vigour\u201d in <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2018/11/10/leila-slimani-m-macron-ce-veteran-cette-voix-amere-ce-ton-aigre-je-les-reconnais_5381635_3232.html\" title=\"\">a 2018 </a><em><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2018/11/10/leila-slimani-m-macron-ce-veteran-cette-voix-amere-ce-ton-aigre-je-les-reconnais_5381635_3232.html\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></em><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2018/11/10/leila-slimani-m-macron-ce-veteran-cette-voix-amere-ce-ton-aigre-je-les-reconnais_5381635_3232.html\" title=\"\"> article</a>. Today, all she will say is: \u201cAs a writer, sometimes I express my anger or indignation when I think it might move things forward. And I\u2019m critical of the immigration policies in Europe in general, not just in France. But my work is writing and I\u2019ve no intention of trying to be a politician or an on-the-ground militant.\u201d</p> <p>She grew up in Rabat, the middle daughter of Othman Slimani, who was economy minister in the Moroccan government and later a banker, and B\u00e9atrice-Najat Dhobb-Slimani, a head and neck surgeon. Life in her liberal French-speaking household was comfortable and privileged. The three girls went to French schools. When Slimani was four, she told her parents: \u201cIt\u2019s my mouth and I\u2019ll say what I want,\u201d earning her the family nickname C\u00e9mabouche (\u201cC\u2019est ma bouche\u201d \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s my mouth\u201d). It was a charmed life, shattered when her father was convicted and jailed over a financial scandal; he was eventually exonerated after his death, which came shortly after his release from prison, when Slimani was 22.</p> <p>As a child, she liked to be alone. Today, dealing with a family and the demands of presidents, editors, and journalists, she still seeks solitude where she can find it. \u201cI\u2019m very close to my sisters and mother and we call ourselves \u2018clan Slimani\u2019. This strong family solidarity makes me happy, but I like solitude. There are moments in my life when I have felt profound physical loneliness, like when I arrived in France and found myself completely alone, but it\u2019s also a question of character.\u201d</p> <p>Slimani was 17 when she moved to Paris, to study political science at the elite Sciences Po and later media studies. After graduating she did some acting, married Antoine, a Parisian banker in 2008, and took a job as a reporter for the weekly magazine <em>Jeune Afrique</em>. In 2013, after her first novel was rejected by \u201cevery editor in Paris\u201d, she took a creative writing course. The result was <em>Dans le Jardin de l\u2019Ogre</em> \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/14/adele-leila-slimani-review\" title=\"\">Ad\u00e8le</a></em> in its English translation \u2013 the story of a sex-obsessed and emotionally cold journalist, whose character was inspired by the scandal surrounding the disgraced presidential candidate Dominique Strauss-Kahn.</p> <p><em>Lullaby</em> was based partly on an early, less happy experience with a childminder than her current one. \u201cThe first nanny we took on to look after my son and my niece, who are the same age, came to me one day and said: \u2018I have lied to you from the beginning. The name I gave you isn\u2019t my real name, the identity card I showed you isn\u2019t my real identity card.\u2019\u201d My sister and I were both young, not even 30, and we realised we\u2019d taken on this woman to look after our children who we knew absolutely nothing about. Sometimes she would be out with the children and we would call and call and not be able to get hold of her, or she would come back really late and we didn\u2019t know where she was\u2026 we didn\u2019t really dare say anything because we felt so naive and stupid.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfb716a7401e3776862cecb0bade0084f2a5c074\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfb716a7401e3776862cecb0bade0084f2a5c074/0_131_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le\u00efla Slimani with Emmanuel Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris in November 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le\u00efla Slimani with Emmanuel Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris in November 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slimani had been struggling to turn this episode into a story for some time when she read about the case of Louise Woodward, a British au-pair convicted of the involuntary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/29/4\" title=\"\">manslaughter</a> of a baby in her care in Newton, Massachusetts in 1997. At last, she saw how to make it work.</p> <p>Her next book will, she says, be something \u201cvery different\u201d but once again rooted in real events. <em>Le Pays des Autres</em> (<em>The Country of Others</em>), to be published in France next month, is the first part of a trilogy drawn from her own personal history. In 1944, her grandmother Anne Ruetsch, a tall, blond, blue-eyed woman from a well-heeled family in Alsace in eastern France, met Lakhdar Dhobb, a small, handsome colonel in the French colonial army. The pair fell in love and Ruetsch moved to Morocco. The first book will be loosely based on her story, the second her mother\u2019s and the third Slimani\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandmother, who was from a bourgeois family, moved to Morocco and thought she\u2019d be living like Karen Blixen in <em>Out of Africa</em>, all adventure and cocktails. Instead she found herself on a remote farm in an austere country with a husband who thought women shouldn\u2019t mix with men, and who didn\u2019t have time for parties or anything but work. They were a mixed-race couple who were rejected by both communities. But it was a wonderful love story.</p> <p>\u201cShe partly brought me up and was a great woman; very independent, very authoritarian. She spoke perfect Arabic and Berber, walked barefoot in the countryside and, when she was buried, hundreds of ordinary people turned out to wave goodbye.\u201d</p> <p>Perched on the edge of a leather chair, Slimani, wearing an elegant rust brown trouser suit and thick-soled brogues, appears fragile and breakable but effortlessly poised. She talks fast and freely and smiles a lot, but there is a glint of steel behind her perfect comportment. She says learning to say \u201cno\u201d to questions and demands on her time is one of the best pieces of advice she was ever given. Slimani comes across as driven, determined, and not easily intimidated.</p> <p>So it is, as we have already seen, \u201cnon\u201d to questions about the state of French politics (\u201cI\u2019m a writer, politics is not my thing\u201d) and \u201cnon\u201d to talking about the public unrest in France, including the strikes that made her late for our interview (\u201cI honestly have nothing interesting to say\u201d). Asked about religion \u2013 she was brought up Muslim \u2013 she says, politely: \u201cIt\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t be asked because it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. Religion is a private matter.\u201d</p> <p>Scratch the polished surface, however, and she insists she is a big scaredy cat. \u201cI really am afraid of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a fearful child. Now when I\u2019m alone in my room writing, I feel safe, but when I\u2019m out I feel there are dangers everywhere. The other day there was a protest near the flat and I had to walk through it with the teargas and everything. Ten years ago I would have completely panicked, but when you become a mother you realise it\u2019s best to sublimate your fears because you are there to show your children you can protect them, not to leave them terrified. That\u2019s one reason I decided to be a writer, to try to control the fears, to transform them into something good, interesting and moving.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a04be96fbd38b7c9ebefeea298a455960e299fc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a04be96fbd38b7c9ebefeea298a455960e299fc3/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le\u00efla Slimani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le\u00efla Slimani: \u2018I\u2019ve suffered racism here in France\u2026 I try to ignore it, or sometimes I laugh.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The #MeToo movement has also helped, she says, sparking a new spirit of female solidarity previously absent in France. \u201cIt\u2019s happened several times to me in the past few months. You find yourself in the street with a guy who\u2019s a bit heavy, and suddenly there are three or four women around you supporting you and making you feel stronger. Before #MeToo it really wasn\u2019t like that, but now I see women looking out for each other. The other day a guy parked on the pavement and I had the pushchair and couldn\u2019t get past, so I waited and, when he came back and I complained, he began to insult me. Before I would have been afraid, but within a couple of minutes there were two or three women standing by my side and he left. It\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m watching out for you, you\u2019re watching out for me; I have your back.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her response to the religious extremists, racists and xenophobes who rant about her online is to ignore them, an approach made easier as she is not on social media. \u201cI\u2019ve suffered racism here in France and in the beginning I was completely paralysed. I didn\u2019t know how to shut it down. Nowadays, I know how to put up an instant barrier. I try to ignore it, or sometimes I laugh. I\u2019m very proud of who I am: Moroccan and French. If someone doesn\u2019t like foreigners, that\u2019s their problem. I\u2019m here and I\u2019m staying here; if they\u2019re not happy about that\u2026 too bad.</p> <p>\u201cBut in fact, I think it\u2019s more difficult being a woman than an Arab.\u201d Specifically, she says, more difficult being a woman who has children and a job. Her role as Macron\u2019s language tsar involves a lot of travel, leaving the children, aged eight and two, behind. Slimani says she refuses to beat herself up about it because \u201ca man wouldn\u2019t\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/01/leila-slimani-i-used-to-think-everyone-wanted-to-be-free-\">Le\u00efla Slimani: \u2018I used to think every human being wanted to be free\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI am a mother who doesn\u2019t feel guilty to say to my children: \u2018I have to work\u2019 or: \u2018I want to be alone.\u2019 It\u2019s difficult, because as a mother you think your children will be unhappy without you and that you have to be entirely at their service and sacrifice everything for them,\u201d she says. \u201cI have chosen not to be that kind of mother. I adore my children, I try to be with them as often as I can, but I also give lots of importance to my professional life, my interior life. But then, I don\u2019t have the most complicated life in the world. It\u2019s much more difficult for single mothers who have three jobs and have to look after their children to have access to solitude.

      "bodyText": "Le\u00efla Slimani is running late. She texts to say she\u2019s waiting for her children\u2019s nanny to arrive. Can this be true? Does the writer whose bestselling novel Lullaby features a killer childminder and begins: \u201cThe baby is dead\u201d, really have a nanny with whom she is perfectly happy to leave her two young children? Slimani shrugs off the irony when she arrives, a delicate bird-like figure with huge brown eyes and a perfect mop of caramel corkscrew hair. \u201cI can\u2019t honestly say I think about it. Our nanny\u2019s been with us for years and she\u2019s extraordinary. Besides, there are too many other things to worry about,\u201d she says. \u201cNormally they are at school, but now there are the strikes, which means no school. I\u2019m doing my best but it\u2019s only 10am and already I\u2019m exhausted. Je ne peux plus (I can\u2019t carry on).\u201d Thank goodness for the nanny. We are in a hotel not far from Slimani\u2019s reportedly vast apartment in what is now called SoPi, South Pigalle, once a semi-sleazy district, now a hub for young Parisian \u2018BoBos\u2019 \u2013 bourgeois bohemians \u2013 and hipsters. The French-Moroccan author is promoting her book Sexe et Mensonges: La Vie Sexuelle au Maroc (Sex and Lies), published in French in 2017 but only now in English. It is a curious sequel to her two novels: a slim nonfiction work about women\u2019s sexual rights in Morocco, a country in which abortion and non-marital sex are banned, and even kissing in the street can lead to arrest for being a \u201cdanger to social order\u201d. Slimani collected the confidences of dozens of women of all ages in order to write it and presents their stories in their own words. The subject is timely but geographically narrow, since the book highlights the plight of Moroccan women in particular, not north African women in general. For whom is it written? \u201cFor all Moroccans, not just the women, but the men, and especially young people, and those I detest, like the elected people, the elite, the bourgeoisie who refuse to see things as they are, who see a mirror and don\u2019t look at the reflection but want to smash it. This book is a mirror they cannot break, that makes them look reality in the face,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter I started writing novels, I understood the power of words, the power one could have telling the truth, and this gave me the courage to describe how things really are for women in Morocco. I wanted to give these women a voice and show that the situation has terrible and sometimes tragic consequences when you consider the backstreet abortions, the abandoned children, the rapes and the traumas.\u201d In September, Slimani led a public call for the decriminalisation of abortion and non-conjugal sexual relations in Morocco, following the jailing of a journalist accused of having an illegal abortion. Moroccan campaign groups estimate there are up to 800 illegal abortions every day, a situation Slimani describes as \u201cunbearable and unacceptable\u201d. Lullaby, published in 2016, and called Chanson Douce in France, turned Slimani into a literary star overnight. It has sold an estimated 1m copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. If abroad it was regarded as just a chilling parental horror story, in France the novel sparked cleverer debates on its themes of motherhood, racism and social inequality. When Slimani won the prestigious Goncourt prize, only the 12th female author to win since the prize started in 1903, French Elle put her on the cover of its January 2017 edition with the headline: \u201cLe\u00efla Slimani Superstar\u201d. She was hailed as the modern embodiment of Marianne, the iconic female symbol of the French Republic; a young, beautiful, clever multilingual and multicultural poster girl for a new, more youthful France led by President Emmanuel Macron, the youngest French head of state since Napoleon. Fast forward to the autumn of that year and Slimani was at home breastfeeding her baby daughter when the telephone rang. It was Macron, calling to offer her the job of culture minister. Slimani hung up. \u201cIt was so completely out of the blue, I thought my husband had put someone up to it, that it was a joke, so I ended the call,\u201d she says, laughing. The Elys\u00e9e Palace rang back, but Slimani turned the job down. \u201cI wasn\u2019t tempted; I\u2019m a writer,\u201d she adds. However, a few weeks later Macron invited Slimani to meet him at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, where she received a presidential offer she did not refuse: the job of francophone affairs minister. Her remit? To promote the French language and culture around the world. The post has always gone to a career politician in the past, so her appointment was a break with tradition. But Macron said he chose Slimani for the role because she \u201crepresents the open face of francophonie to a multicultural world\u201d and belongs to \u201ca new generation\u201d he wants to highlight. Slimani is ill at ease on the subject of her relationship with Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s private,\u201d she says when pressed. But her official role does not make her shy away from writing about certain aspects of government policy. A frequent contributor to the opinion pages of French newspapers \u2013 after the November 2015 bombings and shootings across Paris that left 130 dead she wrote a piece headlined \u201cExtremists, I hate you\u201d \u2013 she certainly felt able to take Macron to task for not defending migrants with \u201cmore vigour\u201d in a 2018 Le Monde article. Today, all she will say is: \u201cAs a writer, sometimes I express my anger or indignation when I think it might move things forward. And I\u2019m critical of the immigration policies in Europe in general, not just in France. But my work is writing and I\u2019ve no intention of trying to be a politician or an on-the-ground militant.\u201d She grew up in Rabat, the middle daughter of Othman Slimani, who was economy minister in the Moroccan government and later a banker, and B\u00e9atrice-Najat Dhobb-Slimani, a head and neck surgeon. Life in her liberal French-speaking household was comfortable and privileged. The three girls went to French schools. When Slimani was four, she told her parents: \u201cIt\u2019s my mouth and I\u2019ll say what I want,\u201d earning her the family nickname C\u00e9mabouche (\u201cC\u2019est ma bouche\u201d \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s my mouth\u201d). It was a charmed life, shattered when her father was convicted and jailed over a financial scandal; he was eventually exonerated after his death, which came shortly after his release from prison, when Slimani was 22. As a child, she liked to be alone. Today, dealing with a family and the demands of presidents, editors, and journalists, she still seeks solitude where she can find it. \u201cI\u2019m very close to my sisters and mother and we call ourselves \u2018clan Slimani\u2019. This strong family solidarity makes me happy, but I like solitude. There are moments in my life when I have felt profound physical loneliness, like when I arrived in France and found myself completely alone, but it\u2019s also a question of character.\u201d Slimani was 17 when she moved to Paris, to study political science at the elite Sciences Po and later media studies. After graduating she did some acting, married Antoine, a Parisian banker in 2008, and took a job as a reporter for the weekly magazine Jeune Afrique. In 2013, after her first novel was rejected by \u201cevery editor in Paris\u201d, she took a creative writing course. The result was Dans le Jardin de l\u2019Ogre \u2013 Ad\u00e8le in its English translation \u2013 the story of a sex-obsessed and emotionally cold journalist, whose character was inspired by the scandal surrounding the disgraced presidential candidate Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Lullaby was based partly on an early, less happy experience with a childminder than her current one. \u201cThe first nanny we took on to look after my son and my niece, who are the same age, came to me one day and said: \u2018I have lied to you from the beginning. The name I gave you isn\u2019t my real name, the identity card I showed you isn\u2019t my real identity card.\u2019\u201d My sister and I were both young, not even 30, and we realised we\u2019d taken on this woman to look after our children who we knew absolutely nothing about. Sometimes she would be out with the children and we would call and call and not be able to get hold of her, or she would come back really late and we didn\u2019t know where she was\u2026 we didn\u2019t really dare say anything because we felt so naive and stupid.\u201d Slimani had been struggling to turn this episode into a story for some time when she read about the case of Louise Woodward, a British au-pair convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of a baby in her care in Newton, Massachusetts in 1997. At last, she saw how to make it work. Her next book will, she says, be something \u201cvery different\u201d but once again rooted in real events. Le Pays des Autres (The Country of Others), to be published in France next month, is the first part of a trilogy drawn from her own personal history. In 1944, her grandmother Anne Ruetsch, a tall, blond, blue-eyed woman from a well-heeled family in Alsace in eastern France, met Lakhdar Dhobb, a small, handsome colonel in the French colonial army. The pair fell in love and Ruetsch moved to Morocco. The first book will be loosely based on her story, the second her mother\u2019s and the third Slimani\u2019s. \u201cMy grandmother, who was from a bourgeois family, moved to Morocco and thought she\u2019d be living like Karen Blixen in Out of Africa, all adventure and cocktails. Instead she found herself on a remote farm in an austere country with a husband who thought women shouldn\u2019t mix with men, and who didn\u2019t have time for parties or anything but work. They were a mixed-race couple who were rejected by both communities. But it was a wonderful love story. \u201cShe partly brought me up and was a great woman; very independent, very authoritarian. She spoke perfect Arabic and Berber, walked barefoot in the countryside and, when she was buried, hundreds of ordinary people turned out to wave goodbye.\u201d Perched on the edge of a leather chair, Slimani, wearing an elegant rust brown trouser suit and thick-soled brogues, appears fragile and breakable but effortlessly poised. She talks fast and freely and smiles a lot, but there is a glint of steel behind her perfect comportment. She says learning to say \u201cno\u201d to questions and demands on her time is one of the best pieces of advice she was ever given. Slimani comes across as driven, determined, and not easily intimidated. So it is, as we have already seen, \u201cnon\u201d to questions about the state of French politics (\u201cI\u2019m a writer, politics is not my thing\u201d) and \u201cnon\u201d to talking about the public unrest in France, including the strikes that made her late for our interview (\u201cI honestly have nothing interesting to say\u201d). Asked about religion \u2013 she was brought up Muslim \u2013 she says, politely: \u201cIt\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t be asked because it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. Religion is a private matter.\u201d Scratch the polished surface, however, and she insists she is a big scaredy cat. \u201cI really am afraid of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a fearful child. Now when I\u2019m alone in my room writing, I feel safe, but when I\u2019m out I feel there are dangers everywhere. The other day there was a protest near the flat and I had to walk through it with the teargas and everything. Ten years ago I would have completely panicked, but when you become a mother you realise it\u2019s best to sublimate your fears because you are there to show your children you can protect them, not to leave them terrified. That\u2019s one reason I decided to be a writer, to try to control the fears, to transform them into something good, interesting and moving.\u201d The #MeToo movement has also helped, she says, sparking a new spirit of female solidarity previously absent in France. \u201cIt\u2019s happened several times to me in the past few months. You find yourself in the street with a guy who\u2019s a bit heavy, and suddenly there are three or four women around you supporting you and making you feel stronger. Before #MeToo it really wasn\u2019t like that, but now I see women looking out for each other. The other day a guy parked on the pavement and I had the pushchair and couldn\u2019t get past, so I waited and, when he came back and I complained, he began to insult me. Before I would have been afraid, but within a couple of minutes there were two or three women standing by my side and he left. It\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m watching out for you, you\u2019re watching out for me; I have your back.\u2019\u201d Her response to the religious extremists, racists and xenophobes who rant about her online is to ignore them, an approach made easier as she is not on social media. \u201cI\u2019ve suffered racism here in France and in the beginning I was completely paralysed. I didn\u2019t know how to shut it down. Nowadays, I know how to put up an instant barrier. I try to ignore it, or sometimes I laugh. I\u2019m very proud of who I am: Moroccan and French. If someone doesn\u2019t like foreigners, that\u2019s their problem. I\u2019m here and I\u2019m staying here; if they\u2019re not happy about that\u2026 too bad. \u201cBut in fact, I think it\u2019s more difficult being a woman than an Arab.\u201d Specifically, she says, more difficult being a woman who has children and a job. Her role as Macron\u2019s language tsar involves a lot of travel, leaving the children, aged eight and two, behind. Slimani says she refuses to beat herself up about it because \u201ca man wouldn\u2019t\u201d. \u201cI am a mother who doesn\u2019t feel guilty to say to my children: \u2018I have to work\u2019 or: \u2018I want to be alone.\u2019 It\u2019s difficult, because as a mother you think your children will be unhappy without you and that you have to be entirely at their service and sacrifice everything for them,\u201d she says. \u201cI have chosen not to be that kind of mother. I adore my children, I try to be with them as often as I can, but I also give lots of importance to my professional life, my interior life. But then, I don\u2019t have the most complicated life in the world. It\u2019s much more difficult for single mothers who have three jobs and have to look after their children to have access to solitude. I think I\u2019m very privileged, very lucky, and I\u2019m very happy. I have the life I dreamed of having.\u201d Slimani has to get back to her children, who are \u201csick with the gastro\u201d, but before she leaves we chat about the recent film adaptation of Lullaby, directed by Lucie Borleteau, which she loved. Writing the story was a way of distancing herself from her worst fears about parenthood, she says. \u201cWhen you have children you\u2019re always afraid something will happen to them, that they\u2019ll fall ill, that they\u2019ll have an accident or be taken. Parents have lots of nightmares, so I said to myself: \u2018Don\u2019t spend life worrying \u2013 better to put those nightmares in a book.\u2019\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February 2020.

And strictly speaking, they\u2019d be right: many of the worst excesses of the industry are, technically, optional. The world isn\u2019t actually a binary choice between living in a surveillance state and opting out of all technological development since the turn of the millennium. You can opt out \u2013 you just have to know how.</p> <p>Of course, that knowledge is not always easily acquired, nor is it necessarily easy to apply. So a new breed of services has arrived to try to help normal users take control of their digital lives. Companies including <a href=\"https://disconnect.me/\" title=\"\">Disconnect.Me</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.jumboprivacy.com/\" title=\"\">Jumbo</a> act as something like a digital concierge for their users, tweaking privacy settings, deleting sensitive data and throwing a spanner into the inner workings of surveillance capitalism.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a Faustian pact involved: to use the privacy apps to their fullest requires handing them a level of control over your digital life that would be all too easy to abuse \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to be certain that any company can be trusted with information that sensitive.</p> <p>The primary justification for the rise of privacy apps is the proliferation of settings screens in our lives and the powerful options buried within them. Web platforms are complex beasts, with sprawling networks of linked services, spin-offs and acquisitions, each of which treats users differently, has a separate place to change privacy settings and any one of which could theoretically expose some information you would rather was kept private.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most of the companies that track you aren\u2019t open enough for you to even know they\u2019re snooping on you in the first place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adding to the confusion is the fact that what your settings are at any given moment probably depends on when you made your account, when you last logged in and how good you are at reading pop-ups that flash in front of you when you just want to find out the address of the party you\u2019re going to. Notoriously, Facebook has even actively changed privacy settings in the past, a practice for which it was hit with a \u201cconsent decree\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/092-3184/facebook-inc\" title=\"\">by the US Federal Trade Commission</a><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/092-3184/facebook-inc\" title=\"\"> in 2011</a>. (Which it then broke in the course of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, leading to a $5bn fine.)</p> <p>But even if a company hasn\u2019t been so creepy as to actively change privacy settings to maximise the amount of information you publish, it can still be hard to find out exactly what you are sharing. For instance, whether or not Google is tracking your physical location 24/7 through your Android phone depends entirely on when you first used Google Maps and whether you have changed any settings since. Once, the company turned location history on by default; now, it does not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"417fef547087815daabf1ce78e22bd5266fcd556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/417fef547087815daabf1ce78e22bd5266fcd556/0_144_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pierre valade sitting on a sofa in an office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumbo founder Pierre Valade: \u2018Companies write privacy policies with lawyers.

The offer was simple: download the app, check a few boxes and it would automatically lock down your privacy settings on platforms including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Amazon. Rather than having to hunt down every individual preferences screen and decipher which settings were innocuous and which were merely deliberately phrased to sound innocuous, the app would do it for you.</p> <p>Pierre Valade, the company\u2019s Brooklyn-based founder, describes its role as an advocate for users everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfair game between users at one end and companies at the other. Companies write privacy policies with lawyers and they make it harder for you to figure out how to opt out, how to delete your data, but as a user you\u2019re supposed to figure out all of that yourself.</p> <p>\u201cIt would take you a whole year to read your privacy policies, but if you go to a doctor, they don\u2019t tell you to go and spend a year learning medical science; you go to a lawyer, you don\u2019t need to read the whole IRS code. In fact, they have a whole ethical code about how to represent their clients. That\u2019s the idea here: it\u2019s about representing people and working for them, to simplify a complex system.\u201d</p> <p>Jumbo\u2019s offering is possible, basically because the largest technology companies can be guilt-tripped into offering users the ability to opt out of the most egregious violations. Google doesn\u2019t want you to turn off all of its ad personalisation, but, the company rationalises, most people probably won\u2019t even know about the setting and it satisfies the privacy warriors to have the option to remove themselves from the tracking apparatus, even if most of the world leaves the options exactly as they are.</p> <p>But for the rest of the internet, shame doesn\u2019t work. Most of the companies that track you across the net aren\u2019t polite enough to give you the ability to opt out, nor open enough for you to even know they\u2019re snooping on you in the first place. You might remember to go into the cookie settings \u200cfor some websites, if you\u2019re diligent, but eventually you\u2019ll forget \u2013 or just visit a shady site that views GDPR as nothing more than a reason to ask for a vowel on <em>Countdown</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/i-read-all-the-small-print-on-the-internet\">I read all the small print on the internet and it made me want to die</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those sites, you need a rather pushier sort of advocate \u2013 something like <a href=\"https://disconnect.me/\" title=\"\">Disconnect</a><a href=\"https://disconnect.me/\" title=\"\">.Me</a>.

And strictly speaking, they\u2019d be right: many of the worst excesses of the industry are, technically, optional. The world isn\u2019t actually a binary choice between living in a surveillance state and opting out of all technological development since the turn of the millennium. You can opt out \u2013 you just have to know how. Of course, that knowledge is not always easily acquired, nor is it necessarily easy to apply. So a new breed of services has arrived to try to help normal users take control of their digital lives. Companies including Disconnect.Me and Jumbo act as something like a digital concierge for their users, tweaking privacy settings, deleting sensitive data and throwing a spanner into the inner workings of surveillance capitalism. But there\u2019s a Faustian pact involved: to use the privacy apps to their fullest requires handing them a level of control over your digital life that would be all too easy to abuse \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to be certain that any company can be trusted with information that sensitive. The primary justification for the rise of privacy apps is the proliferation of settings screens in our lives and the powerful options buried within them. Web platforms are complex beasts, with sprawling networks of linked services, spin-offs and acquisitions, each of which treats users differently, has a separate place to change privacy settings and any one of which could theoretically expose some information you would rather was kept private. Adding to the confusion is the fact that what your settings are at any given moment probably depends on when you made your account, when you last logged in and how good you are at reading pop-ups that flash in front of you when you just want to find out the address of the party you\u2019re going to. Notoriously, Facebook has even actively changed privacy settings in the past, a practice for which it was hit with a \u201cconsent decree\u201d by the US Federal Trade Commission in 2011. (Which it then broke in the course of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, leading to a $5bn fine.) But even if a company hasn\u2019t been so creepy as to actively change privacy settings to maximise the amount of information you publish, it can still be hard to find out exactly what you are sharing. For instance, whether or not Google is tracking your physical location 24/7 through your Android phone depends entirely on when you first used Google Maps and whether you have changed any settings since. Once, the company turned location history on by default; now, it does not. Jumbo, an app for iOS and Android, launched in 2019 with the promise that it would cut through some of that confusion. The offer was simple: download the app, check a few boxes and it would automatically lock down your privacy settings on platforms including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Amazon. Rather than having to hunt down every individual preferences screen and decipher which settings were innocuous and which were merely deliberately phrased to sound innocuous, the app would do it for you. Pierre Valade, the company\u2019s Brooklyn-based founder, describes its role as an advocate for users everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfair game between users at one end and companies at the other. Companies write privacy policies with lawyers and they make it harder for you to figure out how to opt out, how to delete your data, but as a user you\u2019re supposed to figure out all of that yourself. \u201cIt would take you a whole year to read your privacy policies, but if you go to a doctor, they don\u2019t tell you to go and spend a year learning medical science; you go to a lawyer, you don\u2019t need to read the whole IRS code. In fact, they have a whole ethical code about how to represent their clients. That\u2019s the idea here: it\u2019s about representing people and working for them, to simplify a complex system.\u201d Jumbo\u2019s offering is possible, basically because the largest technology companies can be guilt-tripped into offering users the ability to opt out of the most egregious violations. Google doesn\u2019t want you to turn off all of its ad personalisation, but, the company rationalises, most people probably won\u2019t even know about the setting and it satisfies the privacy warriors to have the option to remove themselves from the tracking apparatus, even if most of the world leaves the options exactly as they are. But for the rest of the internet, shame doesn\u2019t work. Most of the companies that track you across the net aren\u2019t polite enough to give you the ability to opt out, nor open enough for you to even know they\u2019re snooping on you in the first place. You might remember to go into the cookie settings for some websites, if you\u2019re diligent, but eventually you\u2019ll forget \u2013 or just visit a shady site that views GDPR as nothing more than a reason to ask for a vowel on Countdown. For those sites, you need a rather pushier sort of advocate \u2013 something like Disconnect.Me. The company offers a service that mixes features of adblockers, firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) to sit between you and the snoopers, only letting through the information you intend to release into the world. \u201cWithout protection like ours, thousands of trackers collect information about our online activity when we simply use our phones or computers,\u201d says Casey Oppenheim, the company\u2019s co-founder. \u201cMost of these trackers are companies we\u2019ve never interacted with directly, yet they collect detailed profiles including our location data, browsing history and more.\u201d For trackers across the net, that means the app maintains a blacklist, preventing the worst offenders from loading on to protected devices at all.

Anyone, that is, other than Disconnect.Me. Because the difficult problem with the new wave of privacy apps is that, to use them to keep your data safe, you have to really trust them with the most sensitive information of all. Any VPN service, for instance, is in a position to monitor all of your internet use, with access only equivalent to an internet service provider in terms of what they see. (Better, in fact, since the VPN moves with you from network to network.) Services such as Jumbo make an even bigger demand: for that app to work, it must ask you to enter your username and password for every service you want it to work with, probably the most sensitive passwords you have, given the importance of accounts on Facebook, Google and Amazon.

Growing up in north-east London, I\u2019d never even heard of the Three Peaks Challenge \u2013 entailing people climbing the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales within a 24-hour window. But a friend was doing it for charity and asked if I wanted to join him. Without hesitating, I said yes. I\u2019d recently had a gun pulled on me which misfired \u2013 twice. That event helped me make a life-changing decision: to stop trying to fit in and do something that made me happy and was an adventure.</p> <p>I needed to raise \u00a3200, but I knew no one in my area would sponsor me \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have heard of it or understood it (I didn\u2019t either), so I waited until I got paid and covered it myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a0fef4e3d327b304191727c8cd13aa5f7b07bff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a0fef4e3d327b304191727c8cd13aa5f7b07bff/0_100_614_614/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dwayne Fields\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dwayne Fields</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I found myself on the way to Scotland in a minibus with six others, having done no training, no preparation \u2013 my friend had given me a leaflet and told me to check out a website, but I hadn\u2019t had time.</p> <p>We started with Ben Nevis \u2013 in clear weather. Going up was hard, but coming down that was really tough. I felt muscles I didn\u2019t even know I had. Scafell Pike, in Cumbria, we did in the dark under thick cloud and mist. By the time we reached Snowdon, it was clear that only two of us would make it \u2013 we made a decision that me and another teammate would try to get to the top before our 24 hours was up.</p> <p>At 23 hours and 50 minutes, we made it. It was beautifully clear, with incredible views all over Wales. That was a lightbulb moment and it opened up a whole new world for me \u2013 I realised I could do anything I put my mind to.</p> <p>Three years later, after taking part in several marathons, I ended up signing up to trek to the North Pole \u2013 becoming the first black Briton to do so. Fast forward another 10 years, and I\u2019ve trekked across the Sinai peninsula, kayaked Jamaica and walked the length of Britain from Dunnet Head to Lizard Point (828 miles) with my teammate Phoebe Smith (see below) to raise money for our own <a href=\"http://www.teamwetwo.com/wetwo-foundation/\" title=\"\">#WeTwo Foundation</a>.

Britain\u2019s most eccentric and ruinously tough race was created 40 years ago in the town of Llanwrtyd Wells (20 miles north of Brecon), following an argument in the <a href=\"http://www.neuaddarmshotel.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Neuadd Arms Hotel </a>about whether a human could beat a horse over a long distance if the terrain was tilted (quite literally) in favour of bipeds.</p> <p>I began mountain running immediately, plodding up and over Belfast\u2019s Cave Hill and around the surrounding plateau every chance I had. Training programmes are hard to keep up, but is there anything more inspiring than running through the mountains to race against horses?</p> <p>For me, getting into the hills almost daily was a transformative experience. I loved the solitude, the tangible hilltop targets, the fume-free air and the elevation of mood and outlook that comes from, well, elevation.</p> <p>I was fortunate to be living just a 10-minute jog from <a href=\"http://walkni.com/walks/cave-hill-country-park/\" title=\"\">Cave Hill country park</a> at the time, which helped, but I was also regularly driving to the Mourne mountains for a wilder, longer session.</p> <p>So even before I arrived in mid-Wales, I felt my life was much the richer as a result of the event. That gratitude, however, faded about three-quarters of the way through.</p> <p>The Man versus Horse is a remarkable race in a stunning Cambrian mountain setting in which competitors run up hill and down dale, through forests and along rivers. The exhilaration of being pursued by horses along bridle paths (runners get a 15-minute head start for safety reasons) is worth the trip alone. But it is also thigh-shreddingly tough, covering 22 miles with more than 1,200 metres of climbing in the (occasional) heat of midsummer. It is not to be taken lightly, and the compulsory veterinary checks at the halfway point are only for the horses.</p> <p>By the end, I was utterly destroyed. But I did manage to beat 36 of the 41 horses that started, and I boast about that to this day. Even more enduring than my boasting, however, is my continued passion for fell running and time spent in the hills. It\u2019s life-enhancing, I promise you, even on two legs.<br><strong>Graham Little, writer</strong><strong> and broadcaster from Northern Ireland.

Pause anywhere in the national park and you can hear or see it. As an avid mountain runner intent on chasing the trail, I initially ignored its babbling call. Then I strained my achilles tendon and triggered my metaphorical achilles heel, too.</p> <p>Confined to the sofa, my mood suffered. Ever the nosy journalist, I rested by researching natural highs. The more intensely you exercise, I learned, the more feel-good rewards your brain releases. But quizzing outdoor enthusiasts revealed something interesting in the subjective shadows. Intensity didn\u2019t necessarily mean working harder. British wild swimmers, for example, raved about the \u201cafterglow\u201d. Did the dramatic temperature drop dial up the perceived intensity? I hobbled to a <em>llyn </em>(pool), leapt in and scrambled out, gasping; wrong. Then a delicious rosy glow crept over me. I jumped in again.</p> <p>Long runs retriggered my injury, so I began combining short jogs with lake swims for a blast of both worlds. I also read Roger Deakin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/02/waterlog-roger-deakin\" title=\"\">Waterlog</a>, revered as the British wild swimmer\u2019s bible. Inspired by his insight that mountain water courses are some of Britain\u2019s last unwritten places, I began hunting boggy valleys for their mirrors. For motivation, I set myself the goal of swimming in 100 lakes and rivers.</p> <p>At first the water felt shockingly cold but, as winter crept up the mountains, I realised I had acclimatised. My body now felt thirsty for the pure invigoration of cold water.</p> <p>I had regained a lost human sense. Learning to breathe out and accept the cold helped in everyday life, too. We often can\u2019t change a situation, but can change our reactions to it. Increasingly, I left my cares at the water\u2019s edge.</p> <p>Water led me away from paths, as well as from my day-to-day stresses, so I had to tune into the landscape\u2019s contours, boulders and bogs. Running mindfully, I began to notice more: to see wildflowers and hear bird calls.</p> <p>Cupped in mountain bowls, tucked in patches of forgotten Celtic rainforest, Snowdonia\u2019s bodies of water often remain hidden until the last moment, then spring into view as if you\u2019ve been granted the keys to another dimension.

But trying to carry a kayak or canoe overland is back-breaking. I had looked longingly at the intertwined land and water of north-west Scotland for years before I found the boat to make amphibious adventures possible. A good inflatable packraft can weigh as little as 1.4kg, and roll up smaller than my favourite jumper. It\u2019s possible to walk all day, a paddle strapped to the rucksack, and forget the boat on your back. These tiny inflatables make you selkie-like. You don\u2019t sit on them, but slip into them like clothes: an adventure you can wear.</p> <p>The best use of a packraft is to brush a dramatic landscape against the grain. My first long journey was from Ullapool south to Shieldaig. Between these towns are many peaks separated by long, narrow lochs. The region was once traversed west-to-east by Hebridean cattle drovers and fish traders who provided the protein for Britain\u2019s industrialisation. But to travel north-south is to disobey the laws of geohistory, and doing so by packraft feels like finding a secret passage between the towns.</p> <p>After a night at the glorious <a href=\"https://www.theceilidhplace.com/\" title=\"\">Ceilidh Place</a> hotel and bunkhouse, you leave <a href=\"https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ullapool/ullapool.shtml\" title=\"\">Ullapool</a> by sea.

Think of the family who once lived here, cut off from roads all winter.

Consider the classic fairytales in which all the bad things happen to those who go off alone into the woods \u2013 coming face-to-face with devious wolves and unfriendly bears, or being offered apples laced with poison by strangers. We are conditioned to fear all that lurks \u201cout there\u201d. So it felt like a momentous decision 13 years ago when I chose to take my tent and sleeping bag and head into Snowdonia, alone, to wild camp (illegally, it must be said) by a small lake.</p> <p>My friends thought I was insane \u2013 why on earth give up the comforts of the indoors to rough it in the hills and \u2026 why alone? But I longed to really experience a place away from the distractions of small talk and to prove \u2013 above all \u2013 that I really could have an adventure close to home relying on no one but myself.</p> <p>I headed off to the <a href=\"http://www.walk-snowdonia.co.uk/rridge.php\" title=\"\">Nantlle Ridge</a>, the range opposite Snowdon, feeling nervous and doubtful of my ability. Suddenly the reassurance that comes from going with a friend \u2013 to double-check your navigation, be your safety net if things go wrong and provide a calming voice when you think you hear footsteps outside your tent \u2013 was gone. That\u2019s why, after I had located a beautiful camping spot surrounded by jagged peaks and settled down for night alone, only to hear what sounded like an approaching person, I froze. Despite my pre-trip protests, all of the worst possible things people had warned me about \u2013 from axe murderers to escaped bears \u2013 were now clearly gathering outside my tent.</p> <p>I lay there for several minutes, summoning the courage to look outside. When I finally did, holding my breath, I saw a harmless rabbit, twitching its nose. I exhaled hard, feeling relieved and slightly silly. After that I slept well, and woke the next morning feeling like a new person. I had survived the night and strode out across the hills feeling like I could take on the world. When I got back to my car and caught sight of my sunburned, midge-bitten face in the mirror, I realised there had been a cataclysmic shift in me. The outdoors was now not a place to fear, but the key to all my future adventures \u2013 big and small.

A dry-stone wall stretched out beside me, rising and falling over green fields until it disappeared into the hazy horizon. It looked like the spine of a sleeping dragon, and was stunning. This is Cawfields, mid-point of the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/hadrians-wall-path\" title=\"\">Hadrian\u2019s Wall Path</a> \u2013 an 84-mile trail that spans northern England from Bowness-on-Solway in the west to the aptly named Wallsend in the east.</p> <p>Having spent the past few years exploring far-flung lands by bike and on foot, I\u2019d made a resolution to do some adventuring closer to home. Armed with the promise of fresh air and fine chat (provided by yours truly), I convinced a friend to run the wall with me, spreading the miles as evenly as we could over four days. And, as a logical next step, we decided to run it dressed as Roman soldiers.</p> <p>Preparation for our journey was less than ideal. Thanks to the chaos of life, we both arrived at the start hideously unfit and recovering from an assortment of minor body niggles. But then again, you never truly feel ready to go on an adventure. You just go anyway.</p> <p>Those miles along the wall gifted us the time and space to appreciate Cumbria and Northumberland\u2019s otherworldly landscapes. Together, we got muddy, sweaty and fell over far more than adults should. We laughed and we learned. (Although mostly I learned that a Roman cape really does chafe after a while, and it\u2019s cumbersome to run with a toy sword slapping at your thighs.) Over the four days, I fell back in love with the beauty of Britain. I fell back in love with a place that I had once thought so familiar, because I\u2019d been able to see it through fresh eyes.<br><strong>Anna McNuff, adventurer and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pants-Perspective-kilometre-running-adventure-ebook/dp/B072N9H3LN\" title=\"\">The </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pants-Perspective-kilometre-running-adventure-ebook/dp/B072N9H3LN\" title=\"\">Pants </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pants-Perspective-kilometre-running-adventure-ebook/dp/B072N9H3LN\" title=\"\">of Perspective</a>: One </strong><strong>Woman\u2019s 3,000km </strong><strong>Running </strong><strong>Adventure </strong><strong>Through the</strong><strong>Wilds of New Zealand (Rocket 88, \u00a39.99)</strong></p> <h2><strong>Riding the Ridgeway</strong>,<strong> </strong>Oxfordshire-Wiltshire </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3282c0631c30736f3e7048c21b23122403a1a269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3282c0631c30736f3e7048c21b23122403a1a269/0_273_5023_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain Bikers, The Ridgeway, Wiltshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a long, hot London summer, many years ago. We had mountain bikes, but these were the days before suspension, and we were looking for a small, accessible adventure. Someone mentioned that a long section of the Ridgeway \u2013 the ancient track from the Thames valley into Wiltshire \u2013 was rideable, so we cycled to Paddington station with a map, water and sandwiches, heading for Goring in south Oxfordshire with the idea that we could cycle the 35 miles of the Ridgeway to Overton Hill, close to the Avebury stone circle, and get home for tea.</p> <p>It was my first foray into longer off-road rides and bikepacking. I\u2019ve since fine-tuned things a bit, including an off-road trip through the Negev desert, but I\u2019ve returned several times to that first ride on England\u2019s oldest road, dotted with neolithic sites. Easily accessible by train, the ride proper starts near the golf course in Streatley, and is easily doable in a day with a stop at the <a href=\"https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pubs/wiltshire/red-lion/?utm_source=g_places&amp;utm_medium=locations&amp;utm_campaign=\" title=\"\">Red Lion</a> in Avebury before heading over to Swindon for the train back.</p> <p>The ride itself is mainly on good bridle paths shared with walkers and long-distance horse riders, best done on a dry spring day when the hedges are flowering and the bluebells are out. Later in the summer is a good time for wild flowers in the chalk grasslands that mark the western half of the route. The path can be quite rutted, which may require either care or dismounting for some sections. It\u2019s best done on a mountain or gravel bike with chunky tyres to avoid punctures from the flints that dot the path.</p> <p>This route is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/02/old-ways-robert-macfarlane-review\" title=\"\">\u201cold ways\u201d \u2013 as Robert Macfarlane</a> might put it \u2013 a journey through a landscape made witchy by its evidence of ancient habitation, not least Avebury circle, White Horse Hill and the nearby long barrow at Wayland\u2019s Smithy.</p> <p>There is some water along the way \u2013 taps, and troughs for horses \u2013 but unless you want to divert from the route for lunch, it is probably better to bring your own along.<br><strong>Peter Beaumont</strong><strong>, senior reporter for the Guardian</strong></p> <h2><strong>Cliff scrambling</strong>,<strong> </strong>Aberdeenshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"59e0faa1893587af7804e8b6f28197ba810c16ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59e0faa1893587af7804e8b6f28197ba810c16ab/0_354_3803_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Group of Atlantic puffins, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a set of sea cliffs near my childhood home in Aberdeenshire named the <a href=\"https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/aberdeenshire/bullers-of-buchan.shtml\" title=\"\">Bullers of Buchan</a>. Scrambling there for the first time in my 20s made me realise I didn\u2019t have to travel across oceans to feel amazed.</p> <p>I still love it. I can just go to a dicey promontory at dawn, crawl through tufts of grass, along a cliff that appears, by its end, little wider than a horse\u2019s back. Straddling a long rock in the sky, clutching campions, I then wait for clouds of rainbow beaks to emerge all about me.</p> <p>Puffins are shy around people. Perhaps in our shadows they see our ancestors who dashed along high strips of rock like this, seeking out birds\u2019 eggs for sustenance. But I\u2019ve found that if I keep my legs still, I can flap the rest of my body about \u2013 unscrewing Thermos lids, munching on biscuits \u2013 and the puffins won\u2019t mind. I wait and listen to the waves, the guillemots, the kittiwakes who cry like babies as they drift over the water like sea spray.</p> <p>The first puffin pops out by one of the burrows at my feet. Then there are dozens. They stand and watch the water. They float in the sky like helicopters. Seeing them hover in after a successful fishing trip, beaks gleaming with silver fish, I want to cheer.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been scrambling here for more than a decade now. And when I think of home, I think of Bullers. How it\u2019s changed me. How it was up there that I realised I love birds. And rocks. It was there that I realised home is not boring.

A city-based, office-centric existence had left me feeling depressed \u2013 and in desperate need of deliverance from the mental mire I\u2019d sunk into. So I set myself a physical challenge in the hope that exercise, fresh air and mountain scenery would bring me solace. My self-imposed mission was to climb the Wainwrights, a list of 214 Lake District peaks featured in the seven pictorial guides by Alfred Wainwright. For a novice adventurer, it seemed challenging yet achievable.</p> <p>Wainwright wrote that in Lakeland he discovered \u201ca spiritual and physical satisfaction in climbing mountains \u2013 and a tranquil mind upon reaching their summits, as though I had escaped from the disappointments and unkindnesses of life and emerged above them into a new world, a better world\u201d. I was after similar healing and, high in the fells, I found it.</p> <p>It took me more than three years to complete all 214 summits, travelling from my Birmingham home to the Lake District at weekends and during holidays. I loved every minute. Out walking I was happy and free. I found the process of putting one foot in front of the other therapeutic. It cleared my head and put life\u2019s little problems into perspective.</p> <p>From iconic giants like Scafell Pike, Blencathra and Helvellyn, to dinky humps like Cat Bells, Latrigg and Castle Crag, walking the Wainwrights gave me an intimate interaction with the Lake District national park. I ambled sun-drenched valleys, followed dancing becks, glided over sweeping ridges and posed triumphantly on craggy summits. It was a memory-forging, happiness-inducing journey \u2013 and one that sparked a lifelong dedication to experiencing more of that \u201cbetter world\u201d. <br><strong>James Forrest, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mountain-man-9781844865635.html\" title=\"\">Mountain Man: 446 Mountains, Six months, One </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mountain-man-9781844865635.html\" title=\"\">Record-</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mountain-man-9781844865635.html\" title=\"\">Breaking </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mountain-man-9781844865635.html\" title=\"\">Adventure</a> (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99, or \u00a314.27 at Guardian Bookshop)</strong></p> <h2><strong>Rock climbing</strong>,<strong> </strong>Peak District </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"01721c5202f2fa9c187352fd8b41fab8b44dccbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01721c5202f2fa9c187352fd8b41fab8b44dccbd/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rock climber on the Stretcher route at Stanage Edge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rock climber on the Stretcher route at Stanage Edge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My first outdoor rock climb was on Stanage Edge, the long, curled lip of gritstone that overlooks the Hope valley, high above the fringes of Sheffield. It was a route called Flying Buttress, less than 20 metres long, but every move felt precarious, thrilling. I remember the smooth slab at the beginning, how it seemed as if I was trusting my feet on nothing.</p> <p>Climbing teaches you to have faith in your own body and in the surface of the earth. It grounds you, even as you move into the air. Growing up on the edge of the Peak District, I\u2019d always been in awe of climbers, but couldn\u2019t see myself as one. I used to devour books from my bedroom, tales of Alpine daring and Himalayan adventure. Most of them were written by men. All the time, Stanage Edge sat quiet and inviting, a short drive from my house.</p> <p>I made baby steps: teaching myself to climb at the indoor walls in the old foundries of Sheffield, learning to drive, persuading my mum to let me borrow her car. One day, two friends offered to give me my first taste of gritstone. The afternoon we chose was hot, stifling, with a cobalt blue sky that made anything feel possible.</p> <p>The route was an easy grade, ideal for a beginner, but it was so much harder than I thought: the angles forbidding, the rock chafing my hands, the trees and bracken below shelving away from me. I struggled and swore, sweated and grumbled. But when I finally hauled myself over the top, the whole of my childhood landscape was spread out before me. I was breathless and giddy, buffeted by the wind. This was an adventure you could have any Sunday, testing yourself against steepness.

I learned to surf at an early age, and I have warm memories of time spent on the beach with the sound of crashing waves and the laughter of my family all around me. I caught my first wave at the age of 12 and I vividly remember the exhilarating sensation of walking on water, surrounded by the natural beauty of never-ending strands and the cliffs of <a href=\"https://www.visitcausewaycoastandglens.com/todo/downhill-beach/\">Downhill</a> towering over everything. For the first time, I really felt alive.</p> <p>My surfing journey was an extremely happy one, an escape from the world of human pressures, expectations and demands which gave me the ultimate feeling of peace. It only became troublesome when my teachers kept insisting that surfing was merely a hobby and not a career option. But I was determined not to sacrifice my passion for the sea, and I put all my energy into building a business around my lifestyle. I opened my own surf school at the age of 21 with the aim of offering anyone the opportunity to experience the sense of tranquillity and momentary happiness that I had become addicted to.</p> <p>Now I have a team of surf instructors who teach people with visual and hearing impairments, autism, Down\u2019s syndrome as well as a number of wheelchair users.

Growing up in north-east London, I\u2019d never even heard of the Three Peaks Challenge \u2013 entailing people climbing the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales within a 24-hour window. But a friend was doing it for charity and asked if I wanted to join him. Without hesitating, I said yes. I\u2019d recently had a gun pulled on me which misfired \u2013 twice. That event helped me make a life-changing decision: to stop trying to fit in and do something that made me happy and was an adventure. I needed to raise \u00a3200, but I knew no one in my area would sponsor me \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have heard of it or understood it (I didn\u2019t either), so I waited until I got paid and covered it myself. I found myself on the way to Scotland in a minibus with six others, having done no training, no preparation \u2013 my friend had given me a leaflet and told me to check out a website, but I hadn\u2019t had time. We started with Ben Nevis \u2013 in clear weather. Going up was hard, but coming down that was really tough. I felt muscles I didn\u2019t even know I had. Scafell Pike, in Cumbria, we did in the dark under thick cloud and mist. By the time we reached Snowdon, it was clear that only two of us would make it \u2013 we made a decision that me and another teammate would try to get to the top before our 24 hours was up. At 23 hours and 50 minutes, we made it. It was beautifully clear, with incredible views all over Wales. That was a lightbulb moment and it opened up a whole new world for me \u2013 I realised I could do anything I put my mind to. Three years later, after taking part in several marathons, I ended up signing up to trek to the North Pole \u2013 becoming the first black Briton to do so. Fast forward another 10 years, and I\u2019ve trekked across the Sinai peninsula, kayaked Jamaica and walked the length of Britain from Dunnet Head to Lizard Point (828 miles) with my teammate Phoebe Smith (see below) to raise money for our own #WeTwo Foundation. It goes to show that once you open your mind to adventure, the possibilities are endless. Dwayne Fields, adventurer, explorer, speaker Marathon with horses, Powys The romance of the Man versus Horse marathon grabbed me as soon as I heard about it. Britain\u2019s most eccentric and ruinously tough race was created 40 years ago in the town of Llanwrtyd Wells (20 miles north of Brecon), following an argument in the Neuadd Arms Hotel about whether a human could beat a horse over a long distance if the terrain was tilted (quite literally) in favour of bipeds. I began mountain running immediately, plodding up and over Belfast\u2019s Cave Hill and around the surrounding plateau every chance I had. Training programmes are hard to keep up, but is there anything more inspiring than running through the mountains to race against horses? For me, getting into the hills almost daily was a transformative experience. I loved the solitude, the tangible hilltop targets, the fume-free air and the elevation of mood and outlook that comes from, well, elevation. I was fortunate to be living just a 10-minute jog from Cave Hill country park at the time, which helped, but I was also regularly driving to the Mourne mountains for a wilder, longer session. So even before I arrived in mid-Wales, I felt my life was much the richer as a result of the event. That gratitude, however, faded about three-quarters of the way through. The Man versus Horse is a remarkable race in a stunning Cambrian mountain setting in which competitors run up hill and down dale, through forests and along rivers. The exhilaration of being pursued by horses along bridle paths (runners get a 15-minute head start for safety reasons) is worth the trip alone. But it is also thigh-shreddingly tough, covering 22 miles with more than 1,200 metres of climbing in the (occasional) heat of midsummer. It is not to be taken lightly, and the compulsory veterinary checks at the halfway point are only for the horses. By the end, I was utterly destroyed. But I did manage to beat 36 of the 41 horses that started, and I boast about that to this day. Even more enduring than my boasting, however, is my continued passion for fell running and time spent in the hills. It\u2019s life-enhancing, I promise you, even on two legs. Graham Little, writer and broadcaster from Northern Ireland. The next Man versus Horse marathon is on 13 June Cold water swimming, Snowdonia Water is Snowdonia\u2019s soundtrack. Pause anywhere in the national park and you can hear or see it. As an avid mountain runner intent on chasing the trail, I initially ignored its babbling call. Then I strained my achilles tendon and triggered my metaphorical achilles heel, too. Confined to the sofa, my mood suffered. Ever the nosy journalist, I rested by researching natural highs. The more intensely you exercise, I learned, the more feel-good rewards your brain releases. But quizzing outdoor enthusiasts revealed something interesting in the subjective shadows. Intensity didn\u2019t necessarily mean working harder. British wild swimmers, for example, raved about the \u201cafterglow\u201d. Did the dramatic temperature drop dial up the perceived intensity? I hobbled to a llyn (pool), leapt in and scrambled out, gasping; wrong. Then a delicious rosy glow crept over me. I jumped in again. Long runs retriggered my injury, so I began combining short jogs with lake swims for a blast of both worlds. I also read Roger Deakin\u2019s Waterlog, revered as the British wild swimmer\u2019s bible. Inspired by his insight that mountain water courses are some of Britain\u2019s last unwritten places, I began hunting boggy valleys for their mirrors. For motivation, I set myself the goal of swimming in 100 lakes and rivers. At first the water felt shockingly cold but, as winter crept up the mountains, I realised I had acclimatised. My body now felt thirsty for the pure invigoration of cold water. I had regained a lost human sense. Learning to breathe out and accept the cold helped in everyday life, too. We often can\u2019t change a situation, but can change our reactions to it. Increasingly, I left my cares at the water\u2019s edge. Water led me away from paths, as well as from my day-to-day stresses, so I had to tune into the landscape\u2019s contours, boulders and bogs. Running mindfully, I began to notice more: to see wildflowers and hear bird calls. Cupped in mountain bowls, tucked in patches of forgotten Celtic rainforest, Snowdonia\u2019s bodies of water often remain hidden until the last moment, then spring into view as if you\u2019ve been granted the keys to another dimension. A hidden world has opened up to me. Sarah Stirling, a writer who has now logged 90 of Snowdonia\u2019s lakes and rivers on Instagram: @sarah_stirling Packrafting adventure, Highlands Getting in a boat is always an adventure. But trying to carry a kayak or canoe overland is back-breaking. I had looked longingly at the intertwined land and water of north-west Scotland for years before I found the boat to make amphibious adventures possible. A good inflatable packraft can weigh as little as 1.4kg, and roll up smaller than my favourite jumper. It\u2019s possible to walk all day, a paddle strapped to the rucksack, and forget the boat on your back. These tiny inflatables make you selkie-like. You don\u2019t sit on them, but slip into them like clothes: an adventure you can wear. The best use of a packraft is to brush a dramatic landscape against the grain. My first long journey was from Ullapool south to Shieldaig. Between these towns are many peaks separated by long, narrow lochs. The region was once traversed west-to-east by Hebridean cattle drovers and fish traders who provided the protein for Britain\u2019s industrialisation. But to travel north-south is to disobey the laws of geohistory, and doing so by packraft feels like finding a secret passage between the towns. After a night at the glorious Ceilidh Place hotel and bunkhouse, you leave Ullapool by sea. Scramble the rough flanks of Beinn Ghobhlach, then cross the Scoraig peninsula and the \u201cdestitution road\u201d on to ridges so prickly it\u2019s a struggle to believe they\u2019re real. Next comes the descent of stupendous 1,062-metre-tall An Teallach, after which you shelter in the shadow of the mountain at the remote bothy of Shenavall. Think of the family who once lived here, cut off from roads all winter. But expect the evening to involve conversation and songs (my last was passed with a couple from Estonia and the retired proprietor of a nearby hotel). Next morning, wade the Strath na Sealga river into ever grander mountain zones. The wonder of this route is that even spectacular Fisherfield (\u201cthe great wilderness\u201d) and Loch Maree (\u201cqueen of lochs\u201d) are only appetisers. Leave the last peak, the 1,055-metre Liathach, to paddle Lochs Torridon and Shieldaig. Wear the boat suit well and you could glimpse otters, eagles or even a pod of dolphins. End with excellent food at Gille Brighde (Diabaig) or a night at Tigh an Eilean in Shieldaig. You\u2019ll have earned it. David Gange, author of The Frayed Atlantic Edge: A Historian\u2019s Journey from Shetland to the Channel (HarperCollins, \u00a318.99, or \u00a315.95 at Guardian Bookshop) Wild camping, Snowdonia As kids we\u2019re warned of the dangers of wild places. Consider the classic fairytales in which all the bad things happen to those who go off alone into the woods \u2013 coming face-to-face with devious wolves and unfriendly bears, or being offered apples laced with poison by strangers. We are conditioned to fear all that lurks \u201cout there\u201d. So it felt like a momentous decision 13 years ago when I chose to take my tent and sleeping bag and head into Snowdonia, alone, to wild camp (illegally, it must be said) by a small lake. My friends thought I was insane \u2013 why on earth give up the comforts of the indoors to rough it in the hills and \u2026 why alone? But I longed to really experience a place away from the distractions of small talk and to prove \u2013 above all \u2013 that I really could have an adventure close to home relying on no one but myself. I headed off to the Nantlle Ridge, the range opposite Snowdon, feeling nervous and doubtful of my ability. Suddenly the reassurance that comes from going with a friend \u2013 to double-check your navigation, be your safety net if things go wrong and provide a calming voice when you think you hear footsteps outside your tent \u2013 was gone. That\u2019s why, after I had located a beautiful camping spot surrounded by jagged peaks and settled down for night alone, only to hear what sounded like an approaching person, I froze. Despite my pre-trip protests, all of the worst possible things people had warned me about \u2013 from axe murderers to escaped bears \u2013 were now clearly gathering outside my tent. I lay there for several minutes, summoning the courage to look outside. When I finally did, holding my breath, I saw a harmless rabbit, twitching its nose. I exhaled hard, feeling relieved and slightly silly. After that I slept well, and woke the next morning feeling like a new person. I had survived the night and strode out across the hills feeling like I could take on the world. When I got back to my car and caught sight of my sunburned, midge-bitten face in the mirror, I realised there had been a cataclysmic shift in me. The outdoors was now not a place to fear, but the key to all my future adventures \u2013 big and small. A door to a world of endless possibilities had opened. Phoebe Smith, broadcaster and author of Extreme Sleeps: Adventures of a Wild Camper (Summersdale, \u00a38.39 at Guardian Bookshop) Run like a Roman, Northumberland I was standing on a grass-covered hilltop in Northumberland national park. A dry-stone wall stretched out beside me, rising and falling over green fields until it disappeared into the hazy horizon. It looked like the spine of a sleeping dragon, and was stunning. This is Cawfields, mid-point of the Hadrian\u2019s Wall Path \u2013 an 84-mile trail that spans northern England from Bowness-on-Solway in the west to the aptly named Wallsend in the east. Having spent the past few years exploring far-flung lands by bike and on foot, I\u2019d made a resolution to do some adventuring closer to home. Armed with the promise of fresh air and fine chat (provided by yours truly), I convinced a friend to run the wall with me, spreading the miles as evenly as we could over four days. And, as a logical next step, we decided to run it dressed as Roman soldiers. Preparation for our journey was less than ideal. Thanks to the chaos of life, we both arrived at the start hideously unfit and recovering from an assortment of minor body niggles. But then again, you never truly feel ready to go on an adventure. You just go anyway. Those miles along the wall gifted us the time and space to appreciate Cumbria and Northumberland\u2019s otherworldly landscapes. Together, we got muddy, sweaty and fell over far more than adults should. We laughed and we learned. (Although mostly I learned that a Roman cape really does chafe after a while, and it\u2019s cumbersome to run with a toy sword slapping at your thighs.) Over the four days, I fell back in love with the beauty of Britain. I fell back in love with a place that I had once thought so familiar, because I\u2019d been able to see it through fresh eyes. Anna McNuff, adventurer and author of The Pants of Perspective: One Woman\u2019s 3,000km Running Adventure Through theWilds of New Zealand (Rocket 88, \u00a39.99) Riding the Ridgeway, Oxfordshire-Wiltshire It was a long, hot London summer, many years ago. We had mountain bikes, but these were the days before suspension, and we were looking for a small, accessible adventure. Someone mentioned that a long section of the Ridgeway \u2013 the ancient track from the Thames valley into Wiltshire \u2013 was rideable, so we cycled to Paddington station with a map, water and sandwiches, heading for Goring in south Oxfordshire with the idea that we could cycle the 35 miles of the Ridgeway to Overton Hill, close to the Avebury stone circle, and get home for tea. It was my first foray into longer off-road rides and bikepacking. I\u2019ve since fine-tuned things a bit, including an off-road trip through the Negev desert, but I\u2019ve returned several times to that first ride on England\u2019s oldest road, dotted with neolithic sites. Easily accessible by train, the ride proper starts near the golf course in Streatley, and is easily doable in a day with a stop at the Red Lion in Avebury before heading over to Swindon for the train back. The ride itself is mainly on good bridle paths shared with walkers and long-distance horse riders, best done on a dry spring day when the hedges are flowering and the bluebells are out. Later in the summer is a good time for wild flowers in the chalk grasslands that mark the western half of the route. The path can be quite rutted, which may require either care or dismounting for some sections. It\u2019s best done on a mountain or gravel bike with chunky tyres to avoid punctures from the flints that dot the path. This route is one of the \u201cold ways\u201d \u2013 as Robert Macfarlane might put it \u2013 a journey through a landscape made witchy by its evidence of ancient habitation, not least Avebury circle, White Horse Hill and the nearby long barrow at Wayland\u2019s Smithy. There is some water along the way \u2013 taps, and troughs for horses \u2013 but unless you want to divert from the route for lunch, it is probably better to bring your own along. Peter Beaumont, senior reporter for the Guardian Cliff scrambling, Aberdeenshire There\u2019s a set of sea cliffs near my childhood home in Aberdeenshire named the Bullers of Buchan. Scrambling there for the first time in my 20s made me realise I didn\u2019t have to travel across oceans to feel amazed. I still love it. I can just go to a dicey promontory at dawn, crawl through tufts of grass, along a cliff that appears, by its end, little wider than a horse\u2019s back. Straddling a long rock in the sky, clutching campions, I then wait for clouds of rainbow beaks to emerge all about me. Puffins are shy around people. Perhaps in our shadows they see our ancestors who dashed along high strips of rock like this, seeking out birds\u2019 eggs for sustenance. But I\u2019ve found that if I keep my legs still, I can flap the rest of my body about \u2013 unscrewing Thermos lids, munching on biscuits \u2013 and the puffins won\u2019t mind. I wait and listen to the waves, the guillemots, the kittiwakes who cry like babies as they drift over the water like sea spray. The first puffin pops out by one of the burrows at my feet. Then there are dozens. They stand and watch the water. They float in the sky like helicopters. Seeing them hover in after a successful fishing trip, beaks gleaming with silver fish, I want to cheer. I\u2019ve been scrambling here for more than a decade now. And when I think of home, I think of Bullers. How it\u2019s changed me. How it was up there that I realised I love birds. And rocks. It was there that I realised home is not boring. There are no boring places at all. Ailsa Ross, author of The Woman Who Rode a Shark (AA Publishing, \u00a314.99, or \u00a312.59 at Guardian Bookshop) Bagging the Wainwrights, Lake District I was fed up with my life back in 2011. A city-based, office-centric existence had left me feeling depressed \u2013 and in desperate need of deliverance from the mental mire I\u2019d sunk into. So I set myself a physical challenge in the hope that exercise, fresh air and mountain scenery would bring me solace. My self-imposed mission was to climb the Wainwrights, a list of 214 Lake District peaks featured in the seven pictorial guides by Alfred Wainwright. For a novice adventurer, it seemed challenging yet achievable. Wainwright wrote that in Lakeland he discovered \u201ca spiritual and physical satisfaction in climbing mountains \u2013 and a tranquil mind upon reaching their summits, as though I had escaped from the disappointments and unkindnesses of life and emerged above them into a new world, a better world\u201d. I was after similar healing and, high in the fells, I found it. It took me more than three years to complete all 214 summits, travelling from my Birmingham home to the Lake District at weekends and during holidays. I loved every minute. Out walking I was happy and free. I found the process of putting one foot in front of the other therapeutic. It cleared my head and put life\u2019s little problems into perspective. From iconic giants like Scafell Pike, Blencathra and Helvellyn, to dinky humps like Cat Bells, Latrigg and Castle Crag, walking the Wainwrights gave me an intimate interaction with the Lake District national park. I ambled sun-drenched valleys, followed dancing becks, glided over sweeping ridges and posed triumphantly on craggy summits. It was a memory-forging, happiness-inducing journey \u2013 and one that sparked a lifelong dedication to experiencing more of that \u201cbetter world\u201d. James Forrest, author of Mountain Man: 446 Mountains, Six months, One Record-Breaking Adventure (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99, or \u00a314.27 at Guardian Bookshop) Rock climbing, Peak District My first outdoor rock climb was on Stanage Edge, the long, curled lip of gritstone that overlooks the Hope valley, high above the fringes of Sheffield. It was a route called Flying Buttress, less than 20 metres long, but every move felt precarious, thrilling. I remember the smooth slab at the beginning, how it seemed as if I was trusting my feet on nothing. Climbing teaches you to have faith in your own body and in the surface of the earth. It grounds you, even as you move into the air. Growing up on the edge of the Peak District, I\u2019d always been in awe of climbers, but couldn\u2019t see myself as one. I used to devour books from my bedroom, tales of Alpine daring and Himalayan adventure. Most of them were written by men. All the time, Stanage Edge sat quiet and inviting, a short drive from my house. I made baby steps: teaching myself to climb at the indoor walls in the old foundries of Sheffield, learning to drive, persuading my mum to let me borrow her car. One day, two friends offered to give me my first taste of gritstone. The afternoon we chose was hot, stifling, with a cobalt blue sky that made anything feel possible. The route was an easy grade, ideal for a beginner, but it was so much harder than I thought: the angles forbidding, the rock chafing my hands, the trees and bracken below shelving away from me. I struggled and swore, sweated and grumbled. But when I finally hauled myself over the top, the whole of my childhood landscape was spread out before me. I was breathless and giddy, buffeted by the wind. This was an adventure you could have any Sunday, testing yourself against steepness. In short, I was hooked. Helen Mort, author, adventurer and editor of Waymaking: An Anthology of Women\u2019s Adventure Writing, Poetry and Art (Vertebrate Publishing, \u00a317.99) Surfing, County Derry Growing up in Limavady, close to the coast of Northern Ireland, gave me easy access to the Atlantic Ocean that generations of my family had explored before me. I learned to surf at an early age, and I have warm memories of time spent on the beach with the sound of crashing waves and the laughter of my family all around me. I caught my first wave at the age of 12 and I vividly remember the exhilarating sensation of walking on water, surrounded by the natural beauty of never-ending strands and the cliffs of Downhill towering over everything. For the first time, I really felt alive. My surfing journey was an extremely happy one, an escape from the world of human pressures, expectations and demands which gave me the ultimate feeling of peace. It only became troublesome when my teachers kept insisting that surfing was merely a hobby and not a career option. But I was determined not to sacrifice my passion for the sea, and I put all my energy into building a business around my lifestyle. I opened my own surf school at the age of 21 with the aim of offering anyone the opportunity to experience the sense of tranquillity and momentary happiness that I had become addicted to. Now I have a team of surf instructors who teach people with visual and hearing impairments, autism, Down\u2019s syndrome as well as a number of wheelchair users. I feel very strongly that nobody should be denied the incredible experience that surfing offers. Dan Lavery runs the Long Line Surf School in Limavady Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Afterwards, he moved to Cumbria, where he found himself living in the shadow of Sellafield and became fascinated with nuclear power. He went on to photograph Chernobyl, Nagasaki, Hiroshima and Three Mile Island. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to do it now,\u201d he says. \u201cSecurity would be on you so quickly.

Journalist and author Afua Hirsch talks to six different people about their family history, and in doing so makes one of the most riveting and revelatory podcasts I\u2019ve heard in a long time. As Hirsch points out in the first episode, those of us who went through the UK education system have a ridiculously limited idea of British empire and colonialism. Essentially, we\u2019re taught that the clever Brits arrived in chaotic foreign places, and bestowed them with great roads, plus democracy, class structure and a sprinkle of Christianity where needed. And when the British left those countries \u2013 as of course they had to \u2013 everyone went a bit mad without them.</p> <p>Of course, this is far from the true story, but such attitudes are surprisingly resilient (see: Brexit). Hirsch\u2019s podcast goes some way to correct them. The histories in these shows are astonishing. From novelist Nadifa Mohamed, we hear about her father, a street kid who walked thousands of miles from Somaliland to join the British merchant navy and make his home in the UK \u2013 and this after serving with the Italian army in the second world war. TV presenter Anita Rani speaks about her grandfather and how his family were affected by the British 1947 partition that created India, Pakistan and what became Bangladesh. Partition created the largest recorded mass migration in history: about 15 million people became refugees overnight as they tried to move to the country that was deemed to be theirs. It was also a time when, as Rani explains, women had three choices: be killed by the enemy, be killed by their family so as to avoid being killed by the enemy, or kill themselves. Her grandfather\u2019s first wife and children did not survive.</p> <p>The people Hirsch talks to are clever and well informed, as is she. They speak of anger without becoming angry: \u201cSomething in your belly starts to burn,\u201d says Rani. Their control is astonishing. \u201cWe rarely hear the stories of the colonised,\u201d says Hirsch. \u201cIt\u2019s the voices of the colonisers that have shaped our ideas of British empire.\u201d This podcast lets us hear from the colonised, but it\u2019s brave enough to also listen to the colonists, and what empire did to them. Hirsch interviews Diana Rigg, whose early childhood was spent in Rajasthan, and she speaks of being very happy, though her mother was less so and found it hard to find friends.

      "body": "<p>Britain faces the most challenging period of its recent history. It has simultaneously to reshape its place in the international order, wholly remake its trading relationships, recast its economy and forge a new settlement between north and south, all within a few years. Yet the government that purports to be ready to meet these challenges is populated by some of the weakest political and governing talent for generations. When the dust had settled on Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/boris-johnson-reshuffle-whos-in-whos-out-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">cabinet reshuffle </a>, the overriding impression was that conformity to Number 10\u2019s Brexit-framed diktat, in particular to the prejudices of his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is more prized than ability, however much Downing Street may protest that its ambition is delivery of \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d. The country and the Conservative party will be fatally ill-served.</p> <p>Brexit is the alpha and omega of this government, even if it wishes to expunge the word from the political vocabulary. The tensions surrounding Brexit had become crystallised in the dysfunctional, poisonous relationship that had developed between Sajid Javid and Number 10 and which manifested itself in the one-hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/javid-resigned-after-johnson-pushed-him-to-sack-advisers\" title=\"\">showdown</a> between prime minister and chancellor last Thursday that led to the latter\u2019s resignation after only seven months in office. No <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-any-self-respecting-minister-would-reject-pms-demands-video\" title=\"\">self-respecting minister</a>, said Javid afterwards, could accept the demand that he sack five advisers for them to be replaced by Number 10\u2019s nominees \u2013 answering to Dominic Cummings and not to the chancellor. His replacement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/14/new-chancellor-rishi-sunak-challenged-over-hedge-fund-past\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, has had to accept the office on the terms Javid refused and is thus surrounded by a team who report to a stronger power centre. This arrangement would be impossible in a charity shop, let alone the second most important office in the land.</p> <p>The reason for the coup is that Downing Street cannot accept the economic and political realities and policy consequences as relayed to them by the Treasury, which is keenly aware of two profoundly troubling economic facts. The first is that, despite the prime minister\u2019s upbeat language, the immediate economic prospects are dire and demand extreme circumspection in how the economy is managed. Stagnating tax revenues do not provide the platform for the kind of public expenditure increases sought by Johnson and Cummings as they aim to level up north and south, unless the aim to limit borrowing only for capital expenditure is abandoned. Javid had aimed to balance current day-to-day spending and revenues by 2023, with even that pledge demanding tax increases, given poor growth prospects. It was not a message Number 10 could accept, with Johnson wanting to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jul/23/boris-johnsons-victory-speech-what-he-said-and-what-he-meant\" title=\"\">ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity\u201d</a>. The Treasury\u2019s world view was that of recalcitrant Remoaners.</p> <p>The second is that the Treasury knows dire economic forecasts are intertwined with the reluctance of overseas and domestic companies to commit major investment in the UK with the spectre of an ultra-hard or even no-deal Brexit. If this year\u2019s negotiations with the EU \u2013 crammed into a mere 10 months \u2013 end with Britain in effect having to trade with its overwhelmingly biggest trading partner on or close to unprivileged WTO terms, which senior ministers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/10/checks-on-eu-bound-goods-inevitable-gove-tells-business-leaders\" title=\"\">Michael Gove </a>have floated as a real possibility about which the government is allegedly unconcerned, the economic implications are serious. There can only be a slowdown in exports to the EU, mirrored by an acceleration of imports, as well as a weakening in our vital surplus in financial services, because access to Europe\u2019s markets in services on current terms will be denied. This is why the overwhelming bulk of economic forecasters predict lower growth as a result of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The Treasury wants to ameliorate this prospect by pressing for a framework trade agreement with the EU that preserves as much market access as possible, especially for the crucial financial services industry. Javid had been photographed going into Number 10 last Monday with a document making the case that Britain should push for \u201cpermanent equivalence\u201d in the regulatory financial regime between Britain and Europe. The Treasury seeks to protect a \u00a369bn trade surplus in financial services, fundamental to sustaining overseas investors\u2019 confidence in sterling, especially as after Brexit Britain\u2019s trade deficit is bound to widen. But this implies Britain being a rule-taker and not \u201ctaking back control\u201d.</p> <p>To make this case to Johnson and Cummings is to betray Brexit. The Treasury\u2019s entire perspective \u2013 pushing for a comprehensive trade agreement, trying to safeguard the City and business while managing the economy cautiously given extreme economic weakness \u2013 is the antithesis of what Cummings and Johnson believe. The City is more than capable of looking after itself in a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, while the way through any short-term economic weakness is to spend, cut taxes and borrow \u2013 straight out of Donald Trump\u2019s economic playbook. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/29/sajid-javid-expected-to-back-hs2-despite-spiralling-costs\" title=\"\">Javid may have been willing to borrow </a>for capital investment such as HS2, but that was not good enough. He had to be made to bend to Downing Street\u2019s will \u2013 or go.</p> <p>The necessity to follow through on all that a hard Brexit entails was at the heart of the reshuffle, and betrayed the motives behind the moves. The foreign and home secretaries \u2013 B team politicians but ultra-loyal to the government\u2019s direction of travel \u2013 kept their jobs while those replacing sacked ministers could be relied upon to do Number 10\u2019s bidding or help further centralise power. Thus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/new-attorney-general-wanted-to-take-back-control-from-courts\" title=\"\">Suella Braverman\u2019s </a>job as attorney general will be to weaken the courts\u2019 capacity to constrain government via judicial review, a process to be fundamentally reassessed, while new Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, will be required to make none of the independent moves initiated by his predecessor, Julian Smith, which secured the power-sharing government.</p> <p>The new cabinet is charged with taking the country through its greatest postwar challenge. The collective bet is that concerns about a hard or no-deal Brexit can be ignored as Remoaner gloom-mongering. Yet those concerns are very real and about to manifest themselves. Careless of all precautionary action, Number 10 is centralising power to ensure its will is met. The danger is inevitably that the government is set to founder on the rocks of Brexit. All of us are set to founder with it.</p>",

If this year\u2019s negotiations with the EU \u2013 crammed into a mere 10 months \u2013 end with Britain in effect having to trade with its overwhelmingly biggest trading partner on or close to unprivileged WTO terms, which senior ministers such as Michael Gove have floated as a real possibility about which the government is allegedly unconcerned, the economic implications are serious. There can only be a slowdown in exports to the EU, mirrored by an acceleration of imports, as well as a weakening in our vital surplus in financial services, because access to Europe\u2019s markets in services on current terms will be denied. This is why the overwhelming bulk of economic forecasters predict lower growth as a result of a hard Brexit. The Treasury wants to ameliorate this prospect by pressing for a framework trade agreement with the EU that preserves as much market access as possible, especially for the crucial financial services industry. Javid had been photographed going into Number 10 last Monday with a document making the case that Britain should push for \u201cpermanent equivalence\u201d in the regulatory financial regime between Britain and Europe. The Treasury seeks to protect a \u00a369bn trade surplus in financial services, fundamental to sustaining overseas investors\u2019 confidence in sterling, especially as after Brexit Britain\u2019s trade deficit is bound to widen. But this implies Britain being a rule-taker and not \u201ctaking back control\u201d. To make this case to Johnson and Cummings is to betray Brexit. The Treasury\u2019s entire perspective \u2013 pushing for a comprehensive trade agreement, trying to safeguard the City and business while managing the economy cautiously given extreme economic weakness \u2013 is the antithesis of what Cummings and Johnson believe. The City is more than capable of looking after itself in a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, while the way through any short-term economic weakness is to spend, cut taxes and borrow \u2013 straight out of Donald Trump\u2019s economic playbook. Javid may have been willing to borrow for capital investment such as HS2, but that was not good enough. He had to be made to bend to Downing Street\u2019s will \u2013 or go. The necessity to follow through on all that a hard Brexit entails was at the heart of the reshuffle, and betrayed the motives behind the moves. The foreign and home secretaries \u2013 B team politicians but ultra-loyal to the government\u2019s direction of travel \u2013 kept their jobs while those replacing sacked ministers could be relied upon to do Number 10\u2019s bidding or help further centralise power. Thus, Suella Braverman\u2019s job as attorney general will be to weaken the courts\u2019 capacity to constrain government via judicial review, a process to be fundamentally reassessed, while new Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, will be required to make none of the independent moves initiated by his predecessor, Julian Smith, which secured the power-sharing government. The new cabinet is charged with taking the country through its greatest postwar challenge. The collective bet is that concerns about a hard or no-deal Brexit can be ignored as Remoaner gloom-mongering. Yet those concerns are very real and about to manifest themselves. Careless of all precautionary action, Number 10 is centralising power to ensure its will is met. The danger is inevitably that the government is set to founder on the rocks of Brexit. All of us are set to founder with it.",

      "body": "<p>Helen Lewis begins her book, subtitled \u201ca history of feminism in 11 fights\u201d, with a question. What, she asks, does it mean to be a \u201cdifficult woman\u201d? You may not be entirely surprised to hear that I didn\u2019t really need to read on to know the answer to this. Like many, if not most, of my closest friends, I\u2019ve been a difficult woman for more than three decades now. Naturally, then, I find it strange and slightly alarming for a writer to feel she has to plead, as Lewis goes on to do, for understanding in the matter of the \u201ccomplicated\u201d woman. Surely this should go unsaid. If it\u2019s entirely human to be multifaceted \u2013 for some aspects of your personality to be trickier and darker than others \u2013 isn\u2019t it also beholden upon you to be sympathetic to such quirks and flaws in other people?</p> <p>But this is where we are. Twenty-first-century culture has, as Lewis notes, a tendency \u2013 you might call it a mania \u2013 for disapproving of both contemporary and historical figures on the grounds that aspects of their lives or work are distasteful. Those considered to be too unpalatable are quickly written out of the story (AKA cancelled); others are carefully repackaged, their sharper corners having been, as she puts it, carefully sandblasted. More insidious still is the question of likability. Why do women have to be nice? When I was publicising <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/her-brilliant-career-9781844087419.html\" title=\"\">my book</a> about some female pioneers of the 1950s, I grew used to the moment at literary festivals when someone in a nubbly sweater and unlikely earrings would announce to me in a tight, little voice that, for all their achievements, she simply didn\u2019t <em>like</em> any of the women whose lives I\u2019d spent so long researching. I grew to despise this. I don\u2019t even like the people I <em>love</em> all the time.</p> <p>The women in Lewis\u2019s book are all \u201cdifficult\u201d. But this is their superpower. It makes them brave and bullish; it provides them with the kind of tunnel vision that changes the law and the landscape. They\u2019re wild and interesting and singular, and because of this, there were times when I wanted much more of them (I also wanted to see what they looked like, and I hope her publisher will include photos in the paperback edition).</p> <p><em>Difficult Women</em> is a good book \u2013 inspiriting and energetic \u2013 but it is a diffuse one. Lewis has set herself a huge task, galloping not only through several centuries of women\u2019s history, but through some pretty thorny territory: the vote, divorce, education, sex, abortion. There are times when she can only scoot along the surface. For me, too, there was a problem of familiarity. Younger women, and those less inclined to wear worsted knickers, may not know some of the stories she tells. But if you\u2019ve already read biographies of, say, the birth control pioneer Marie Stopes, or any of the excellent books about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/09/rise-up-women-by-diane-atkinson-review-the-remarkable-lives-of-the-suffragettes-\" title=\"\">suffragettes</a> that have been published recently, you may feel impatient at times.</p> <p>I enjoyed <em>Difficult Women</em> most when I could feel Lewis\u2019s deep engagement \u2013 and when she was telling me something I didn\u2019t know (or only half knew). The essay entitled Safety, about the refuge movement, is very good: searching, and bracing. Lewis wants to know why Erin Pizzey, who in 1971 founded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/28/domestic-violence-first-womens-refuge-saved-my-life\" title=\"\">first women\u2019s shelter</a> in Chiswick, west London, has been all but erased from the record of the long struggle to raise consciousness around domestic violence; her account of the various schisms in the women\u2019s movement of the 1970s \u2013 Pizzey, it turns out, fell foul of the thought police \u2013 and the way she connects such spats to our present purity politics is clever and compelling. It\u2019s also poignant, Pizzey having been through hard times. Lewis is rightly disturbed by Pizzey\u2019s ongoing support for the men\u2019s movement, but she also has the pluck to ask: what are we going to do to change the behaviour of violent males? Are we making excuses for them if we show concern over feminism\u2019s lack of interest in perpetrator programmes? (Answer: no, we aren\u2019t.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bad2486a0ad4d3989567e518a599b8bac92535d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bad2486a0ad4d3989567e518a599b8bac92535d7/0_0_2719_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour MP Maureen Colquhoun with the Gay Defence Committee, London, 1977\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour MP Maureen Colquhoun with the Gay Defence Committee, London, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wesley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even better is the chapter called Love, in which Lewis tells the story of Maureen Colquhoun, Britain\u2019s first out lesbian MP; of Jackie Forster, the editor of the 70s lesbian journal <em>Sappho</em>; and of Forster\u2019s lover, Barbara Todd, who would leave her for Colquhoun, with whom she still lives. If you want bravery, you will find it here, whether in Colquhoun\u2019s work in the Commons (she wouldn\u2019t settle for sex discrimination becoming illegal; she wanted all bodies who received public money to give half of their places to women), or in Forster\u2019s campaigning journalism (under the auspices of <em>Sappho</em>, she raised money for women dismissed from the army for being lesbians, and ran a club for closeted wives), or in the simple fact of their determined openness at a time when most gay public figures remained closeted and homophobia was standard (Colquhoun described Todd as her \u201cpartner\u201d in her 1975 <em>Who\u2019s Who</em> entry). It is to the Labour party\u2019s eternal shame that in 1977 it voted to remove Colquhoun as a candidate on grounds so spurious they would be unimaginable had we not just been through the Jeremy Corbyn years (she criticised the party\u2019s record on race).</p> <p>This is a capacious book. Among its pages are some pretty cherishable facts and figures (in the 1880s, women\u2019s undergarments weighed the same as a newborn); quite a lot of sex and, er, non-sex (from Stopes\u2019s masturbation diary to Anne Koedt\u2019s radical 1970 paper, The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm); and some useful provocations (a lot of current feminism, Lewis suggests, is simply \u201cself-help under a thin, sugary glaze of activism\u201d).</p> <p>I liked this roominess: it speaks of open-mindedness and warmth. But what I loved most of all is her clear respect for those who went before us, particularly the second wave. Not for her the dismissiveness of some younger feminists for older women.

Enough cudgels are wielded at feminism without us going after those who were, and are, basically on our side.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Difficult Women: A History of Feminism in 11 Fights </em>by Helen Lewis is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>The news that coronavirus Covid-19, which has spread across much of China over the past two months, has now claimed its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/chinese-tourist-in-france-becomes-europes-first-coronavirus-fatality\" title=\"\">first life </a>in Europe might be seen as an alarming development.</p> <p>Until now, deaths from respiratory illnesses that have been triggered by the virus have been confined to the Far East; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/coronavirus-cases-pass-66000-as-beijing-orders-14-day-quarantine-for-returnees\" title=\"\">more than 1,500 deaths</a> have occurred in China plus three others in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan. Now the virus has killed someone much nearer to home, in France, suggesting that a new centre for the disease might be establishing itself in Europe.</p> <p>We should take care in making such an interpretation, however. The European victim turns out to be an 80-year-old tourist from China\u2019s Hubei province, the disease\u2019s centre, who arrived in France on 16 January and has been kept in quarantine in a Paris hospital since 25 January. He presumably carried the virus on his journey to Europe and as an octogenarian was particularly vulnerable.</p> <p>This does not mean we should be complacent about the likely impact of Covid-19, however. There are no treatments or vaccines for this virus and, crucially, no pre-existing immunity in the population. During the 2009-10 flu pandemic, many older people were protected because they had already been exposed to the virus strain involved. This will not occur if Covid-19 spreads across Europe and the UK. The elderly are likely to be particularly at risk.</p> <p>In fact, there are so many huge unknowns about this outbreak that it is still impossible to work out how it will progress. For example, we don\u2019t know just how infectious people are before they show symptoms of the disease. A low infection rate suggests death tolls will be modest. A higher one will mean that fatalities could be significant. Careful monitoring of the disease is therefore going to be crucial over the next few months. To date, the National Health Service has responded well. However, it remains to be seen how it will perform when tens of thousands of people gather at hospitals seeking tests for the condition and wards fill up with those found to be infected.</p> <p>Such uncertainty should not be seen as an excuse for inaction, however. As we make clear in our Focus investigation of the coronavirus crisis, urgent measures now need to be taken to head off future pandemics that could catch us off-guard in future, a point that has been highlighted by the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens\u2026 and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal modern-day pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d he warned some time ago.</p> <p>Certainly, it is no accident that the most worrying recent pandemics to afflict the planet have emerged from Asia and Africa, in poor countries that have inadequate health services and which are limited in their ability to monitor and isolate cases of newly emerging diseases. Hospitals, medical laboratories and research centres there need bolstering, rapidly, and should now be the focus of major investment by the west. The World Health Organization has done much in this area but it is clear more needs to be achieved, for it appears that the world still does not fully appreciate that outbreaks of deadly new diseases \u2013 wherever they emerge \u2013 are not someone else\u2019s problem. They will inevitably impinge on lives across the planet.</p> <p>As Professor Trudie Lang, of Oxford University, has put it: \u201cThis is not going to be the last outbreak of a previously unknown disease. We have to seize the moment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The news that coronavirus Covid-19, which has spread across much of China over the past two months, has now claimed its first life in Europe might be seen as an alarming development. Until now, deaths from respiratory illnesses that have been triggered by the virus have been confined to the Far East; more than 1,500 deaths have occurred in China plus three others in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan. Now the virus has killed someone much nearer to home, in France, suggesting that a new centre for the disease might be establishing itself in Europe. We should take care in making such an interpretation, however. The European victim turns out to be an 80-year-old tourist from China\u2019s Hubei province, the disease\u2019s centre, who arrived in France on 16 January and has been kept in quarantine in a Paris hospital since 25 January. He presumably carried the virus on his journey to Europe and as an octogenarian was particularly vulnerable. This does not mean we should be complacent about the likely impact of Covid-19, however. There are no treatments or vaccines for this virus and, crucially, no pre-existing immunity in the population. During the 2009-10 flu pandemic, many older people were protected because they had already been exposed to the virus strain involved. This will not occur if Covid-19 spreads across Europe and the UK. The elderly are likely to be particularly at risk. In fact, there are so many huge unknowns about this outbreak that it is still impossible to work out how it will progress. For example, we don\u2019t know just how infectious people are before they show symptoms of the disease. A low infection rate suggests death tolls will be modest. A higher one will mean that fatalities could be significant. Careful monitoring of the disease is therefore going to be crucial over the next few months. To date, the National Health Service has responded well. However, it remains to be seen how it will perform when tens of thousands of people gather at hospitals seeking tests for the condition and wards fill up with those found to be infected. Such uncertainty should not be seen as an excuse for inaction, however. As we make clear in our Focus investigation of the coronavirus crisis, urgent measures now need to be taken to head off future pandemics that could catch us off-guard in future, a point that has been highlighted by the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens\u2026 and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal modern-day pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d he warned some time ago. Certainly, it is no accident that the most worrying recent pandemics to afflict the planet have emerged from Asia and Africa, in poor countries that have inadequate health services and which are limited in their ability to monitor and isolate cases of newly emerging diseases. Hospitals, medical laboratories and research centres there need bolstering, rapidly, and should now be the focus of major investment by the west. The World Health Organization has done much in this area but it is clear more needs to be achieved, for it appears that the world still does not fully appreciate that outbreaks of deadly new diseases \u2013 wherever they emerge \u2013 are not someone else\u2019s problem. They will inevitably impinge on lives across the planet. As Professor Trudie Lang, of Oxford University, has put it: \u201cThis is not going to be the last outbreak of a previously unknown disease. We have to seize the moment.\u201d",

It would seem not. Andrew Harrison, who chairs the remuneration committee, brazened it out in the annual report, urging shareholders to look at a different number \u2013 the 265% increase in the company\u2019s share price over the past two years (and certainly not the \u00a3214m loss it delivered in 2019).</p> <p>Tim Steiner, the chief executive, got \u00a354m of the pot, receiving a tidy \u00a358.7m once his salary and other bonuses are taken into account.

Today Ocado has successfully reinvented itself as a tech stock selling armies of grocery-picking robots to supermarkets \u2013 and says it should have Silicon Valley-style pay deals to keep its indispensable executives \u201cmotivated\u201d.</p> <p>But for many people Ocado is still the company that pulls up at their front door with bags full of Waitrose groceries. That will end this autumn when the company will attempt to switch horses to Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 which is paying \u00a3750m for half its UK grocery business \u2013 without falling from the saddle. So you would think the company would be more concerned about its image.</p> <p>Once beloved of the middle classes, Ocado is facing incoming fire from parents and teachers opposed to its plan to open a distribution hub \u2013 complete with diesel fuel pumps \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/ocado-protest-yerbury-primary-school-archway-a4317436.html\" title=\"\">yards from their north London primary school</a>. The company, which has been trialling electric vans in high-density areas, has said it will replace all the diesel vans if it can get a power upgrade at the site.

As part of the preamble, the company highlights that executive pay is \u201cmore at risk than wider employee pay due to the use of variable pay\u201d and without the mega bonus the multiple would only have been about 200 times. The icing on the cake was the decision to raise the basic salaries of the four executives who shared the \u00a388m jackpot; this year Steiner will have to drag himself out of bed for a guaranteed \u00a3720,000 salary.</p> <p>Which brings us back to Waitrose, part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, where staff in good years are paid the same rate of bonus as top executives.

      "bodyText": "The jury at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial in New York will begin deliberations on Tuesday, with the world\u2019s media and the expectations of the #MeToo movement bearing heavily upon them. The five women and seven men who form the jury hold in their hands the fate of the disgraced movie mogul. If they find him guilty of two of the five counts against him, of \u201cpredatory sexual assault\u201d, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Since the trial began last month, the jurors have constantly been reminded of intense media interest in the case. Prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have frequently directed jurors\u2019 vision to the overflowing press benches in courtroom No 99 at the New York supreme court, and alluded to the sound of keyboards rattling as one way of highlighting the high-profile nature of the case. The process of reaching a verdict will not be easy or brief. The first trial of Bill Cosby, the comedian whose prosecution is often compared to that of Weinstein, ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to agree after six gruelling days of deliberations. Cosby was found guilty at a second trial and sentenced in 2018 to three to 10 years in prison. There are two main accusers in the Weinstein case. Miriam Haley was working as a production assistant in 2006 when she alleges Weinstein lured her to his SoHo apartment in New York and forced oral sex on her. A woman who the Guardian is not identifying, as she has not indicated that she wishes to be publicly named, alleges she was raped in a New York hotel in 2013. Weinstein, 67, has also been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 100 women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. In the New York trial, four women who accuse the producer of rape and sexual assault \u2013 Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young \u2013 were called by the prosecution to give supporting evidence. In closing arguments, Weinstein\u2019s lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, and lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon presented the jury with starkly contrasting summaries of the case. Though #MeToo, the social reckoning galvanised by the accusations of sexual abuse levelled against the Pulp Fiction producer since 2017, has rarely been mentioned in court, it has clearly influenced the lawyers\u2019 diametrically opposing interpretations of the case in hand. Rotunno has portrayed the six women as money-grabbing, manipulative individuals who exploited Weinstein in order to advance their careers. According to that view, they were prepared to do anything \u2013 including consensual sex \u2013 in order to get on. On Friday, Illuzzi-Orbon gave a very different analysis. Weinstein, she said, treated women who he tricked into entering his lair like \u201cants he could step on without consequences\u201d.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Larry Sabato</a> is an analyst, author and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. His students are currently embedded in various presidential campaigns. Two were working for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/15/joe-biden-democrats-trump-2020-president\">Joe Biden</a> in Iowa. Before caucus day, they texted Sabato to say they expected to lose badly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/donald-trump-richard-nixon-department-justice-william-barr-roger-stone\">In his assault on justice, Trump has out-Nixoned Nixon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sabato asked why. The answer: \u201cNo energy at all.\u201d</p> <p>And so it proved. Biden, who was Barack Obama\u2019s righthand man for eight years and long the Democrats\u2019 national frontrunner to take on Donald Trump, trailed in fourth. A week later, he fled New Hampshire before the votes were even counted, to escape the <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/bidens-campaign-was-a-disaster-for-liberalism-and-his-party.html\">public humiliation of finishing fifth.</a></p> <p>Now, in the words of one commentator, Biden \u201cneeds a miracle\u201d to stay in the race. A man whose candidacy a year ago seemed to be predicated on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/13/joe-biden-trump-2020-election\">his appeal to the white working class</a> is depending on African American voters to rescue him from the oft-quoted maxim that <a href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00008596\">all political lives end in failure.</a> What went wrong?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched Joe Biden since he was first elected [to the Senate] in 1972,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cHe was full of energy and joking around and had a big personality but I don\u2019t think anyone has associated the word \u2018vision\u2019 with Joe Biden. Democrats are looking for a vision; Biden\u2019s vision is to go back to Obama\u2019s policies. I understand it, but it doesn\u2019t get you standing up and cheering.\u201d</p> <p>The 77-year-old\u2019s debate performances have failed to inspire and his rallies have drawn small crowds. His rally in Des Moines on the eve of the Iowa caucuses was in a more compact venue than Pete Buttigieg\u2019s across the city and, while delivering a heartfelt critique of Trump, offered fewer policy specifics and generated less electricity.</p> <p>Sabato added: \u201cPeople are charged up and incensed about Trump. But if you\u2019re standing there talking and they go to sleep, it doesn\u2019t suggest you\u2019re the best one to beat Trump. People keep saying he\u2019s lost a step or two but this is the same Joe Biden I remember from the 1970s. He\u2019s a meanderer. Some speakers get you fired up but Joe\u2019s not that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Iowa I saw one of the most inferior ground games in politics. I have never seen anything so inept</p> <footer> <cite>Moe Vela</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a distinct whiff of d\u00e9ja vu. Biden\u2019s first run for president fell apart in 1987 when he quoted British politician Neil Kinnock but forgot to credit him, prompting charges of plagiarism. His second attempt went off the rails <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/31/biden.obama/\">in 2007 when he described Obama</a> as \u201cthe first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\u201d. (His third-place finish in his home state, Delaware, remains <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/11/joe-bidens-track-record-lousy-primary-finishes-just-got-bit-longer/\">his best performance in a primary</a>.)</p> <p>The 2020 effort was meant to be different story with Biden, who served with distinction as Obama\u2019s vice-president, cast as the antidote to Trump and restorer of normalcy. But he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/28/democratic-debate-kamala-harris-leads-changing-of-guard\">poleaxed by Senator Kamala Harris</a> of California in the first Democratic debate in June, when she challenged his past views on desegregated school busing.</p> <p>He fared little better in a debate in September when, asked about what responsibility Americans have to repair the legacy of slavery, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/us/politics/biden-record-player.html\">he gave a rambling answer that included</a> \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night, make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school, a very poor background, will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.\u201d</p> <p>Debates came and went. Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, over his business dealings in Ukraine generated media scrutiny, both fair and unfair, that in some minds may have planted seeds of doubt. In Iowa it was clear the Obama magic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/04/uselections2008.usa4\">which swept the caucuses in 2008,</a> had not rubbed off on his running mate. The blame seemed to lie with both an underwhelming candidate and a poorly organised campaign.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thevelagroup.com/\">Moe Vela,</a> who was director of administration and senior adviser to Biden at the White House, said: \u201cIn Iowa I saw one of the most inferior ground games in politics. I have never seen anything so inept. He\u2019s not being served properly by his campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Vela, now an LGBTQ and Latino activist and board director at TransparentBusiness, added: \u201cHe had been the front runner for so long that I think the campaign staff became complacent. You got a sense they were so busy talking about electability and pitting him against Trump they forgot they have to deal with these 15 people first. You could see this rude awakening in Iowa as the night was slipping away.\u201d</p> <p>In New Hampshire, where Biden called a student a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/feb/11/joe-biden-calls-student-lying-dog-faced-pony-soldier-at-rally-video\">\u201clying dog faced pony soldier\u201d,</a> he fared even worse. A comeback win in Nevada looks unlikely, setting up a potential last stand in South Carolina, the first contest in a state with a significant African American population \u2013 a constituency where <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/us/politics/biden-black-voters-south-carolina.html\">he has consistently polled strongly</a>. (Biden has been at pains to point out that 99% of the African American population have not yet had a say.)</p> <p>But even this advantage appears to have been eroded by Senator Bernie Sanders and billionaire Tom Steyer. Then comes Super Tuesday, where another billionaire, Michael Bloomberg, has spent nearly $350m on ads focused on the 16 states and territories that vote, eating into Biden\u2019s support among moderates and African Americans. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-bloomberg/us-presidential-candidate-bloomberg-endorsed-by-three-black-lawmakers-idUSKBN20623M\">Several black members of Congress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/bowser-bloomberg-endorsement/2020/01/29/f18e31fc-42b9-11ea-aa6a-083d01b3ed18_story.html\">city mayors</a> have endorsed Bloomberg despite the discriminatory \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policy he supported as mayor of New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6b81a03889184b8a4c10c7fc79dad83d51dfeeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6b81a03889184b8a4c10c7fc79dad83d51dfeeb/0_78_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden speaks at a rally in Columbia, South Carolina, on the night of the New Hampshire primary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biden speaks at a rally in Columbia, South Carolina, on the night of the New Hampshire primary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randall Hill/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), said: \u201cBiden has lost half the black support that he had. It\u2019s bled off and is now largely with Mike Bloomberg. Some of it has gone to Bernie Sanders, a little bit maybe to Elizabeth Warren, none of it to Pete Buttigieg. So he\u2019s sitting there holding 22, 23% of the black vote now. Mike Bloomberg is behind them at what, 21?</p> <p>\u201cClearly whatever the decision-making process was that led them to run the first leg of this race the way they have has cost him dearly. They have to make up a lot of ground in a very short period of time.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible but it\u2019s unlikely and would fly in the face of all our knowledge of political history.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s main pitch had been that in this moment of national emergency, he was the steady hand best placed to prevent Trump winning a second term. To centrists, he would be less of a gamble than progressives Sanders or Warren. But after the heavy losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, he is caught in his own electability trap.</p> <p>Shrum, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cThe centrepiece of the campaign was, \u2018I\u2019m going to beat Trump like a drum\u2019. The public said, \u2018If you\u2019re saying you\u2019re a winner, you\u2019d better win\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAl Gore had this line: elections are not a reward for past performance. I think they are always about the future, not just the past. In Democratic primaries, you\u2019ve got to have a future offer to people, no matter how dissatisfied they are with the Republican incumbent. Joe Biden has a lot of policies on his website but that\u2019s not what comes over on the debate stage.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s still to recover but if he\u2019s not willing to restructure his campaign, I don\u2019t think he can bounce back</p> <footer> <cite>Coby Owens</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a small but telling measure of a campaign in a downward spiral, Biden\u2019s press team did not respond to multiple phone and email requests from the Guardian seeking comment. The Trump, Bloomberg and other campaigns are generally far more responsive.</p> <p>Shrum added: \u201cI suspect they have many pressures and I have nothing but sympathy for the candidate and the people around him. It\u2019s hard to start at the top of the mountain and end up in the valley.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s struggles have dismayed supporters in his home state, where he remains immensely popular. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CobyJOwens?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Coby Owens,</a> a local civil rights activist whose family has known Biden for years, and who is still trying to decide between Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, said: \u201cThere are a lot of people who are shocked and concerned about it and want to know what\u2019s going on.</p> <p>\u201cThey have been hearing the message that he\u2019s the most electable so they thought he was going to cruise through the first two states, which are predominantly white.

Why would you do that with your vice-president already in the game?\u201d</p> <p>While cautious about writing Biden off just yet, Steele added: \u201cFor me, just watching the Biden campaign, I get the sense that he\u2019s kind of walked through it. I think he\u2019s going through the paces of it. I\u2019m not convinced at this stage that he really wants it any more. I don\u2019t think you take the front runner status that he\u2019s held for over a year, anchored by 50% of the black vote in a party where that is a very important and huge demographic edge, and just leave it on the table.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a candidate do that the way it\u2019s been done. Maybe there\u2019s a little bit of hubris and you assume that you\u2019ve got the weight to throw around to win this thing. But then again, at the same time, I think at a certain point the gas is out of the tank and you just sleepwalk your way through it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Larry Sabato is an analyst, author and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. His students are currently embedded in various presidential campaigns. Two were working for Joe Biden in Iowa. Before caucus day, they texted Sabato to say they expected to lose badly. Sabato asked why. The answer: \u201cNo energy at all.\u201d And so it proved. Biden, who was Barack Obama\u2019s righthand man for eight years and long the Democrats\u2019 national frontrunner to take on Donald Trump, trailed in fourth. A week later, he fled New Hampshire before the votes were even counted, to escape the public humiliation of finishing fifth. Now, in the words of one commentator, Biden \u201cneeds a miracle\u201d to stay in the race. A man whose candidacy a year ago seemed to be predicated on his appeal to the white working class is depending on African American voters to rescue him from the oft-quoted maxim that all political lives end in failure. What went wrong? \u201cI\u2019ve watched Joe Biden since he was first elected [to the Senate] in 1972,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cHe was full of energy and joking around and had a big personality but I don\u2019t think anyone has associated the word \u2018vision\u2019 with Joe Biden. Democrats are looking for a vision; Biden\u2019s vision is to go back to Obama\u2019s policies. I understand it, but it doesn\u2019t get you standing up and cheering.\u201d The 77-year-old\u2019s debate performances have failed to inspire and his rallies have drawn small crowds. His rally in Des Moines on the eve of the Iowa caucuses was in a more compact venue than Pete Buttigieg\u2019s across the city and, while delivering a heartfelt critique of Trump, offered fewer policy specifics and generated less electricity. Sabato added: \u201cPeople are charged up and incensed about Trump. But if you\u2019re standing there talking and they go to sleep, it doesn\u2019t suggest you\u2019re the best one to beat Trump. People keep saying he\u2019s lost a step or two but this is the same Joe Biden I remember from the 1970s. He\u2019s a meanderer. Some speakers get you fired up but Joe\u2019s not that.\u201d There is a distinct whiff of d\u00e9ja vu. Biden\u2019s first run for president fell apart in 1987 when he quoted British politician Neil Kinnock but forgot to credit him, prompting charges of plagiarism. His second attempt went off the rails in 2007 when he described Obama as \u201cthe first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\u201d. (His third-place finish in his home state, Delaware, remains his best performance in a primary.) The 2020 effort was meant to be different story with Biden, who served with distinction as Obama\u2019s vice-president, cast as the antidote to Trump and restorer of normalcy. But he was poleaxed by Senator Kamala Harris of California in the first Democratic debate in June, when she challenged his past views on desegregated school busing. He fared little better in a debate in September when, asked about what responsibility Americans have to repair the legacy of slavery, he gave a rambling answer that included \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night, make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school, a very poor background, will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.\u201d Debates came and went. Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, over his business dealings in Ukraine generated media scrutiny, both fair and unfair, that in some minds may have planted seeds of doubt. In Iowa it was clear the Obama magic, which swept the caucuses in 2008, had not rubbed off on his running mate. The blame seemed to lie with both an underwhelming candidate and a poorly organised campaign. Moe Vela, who was director of administration and senior adviser to Biden at the White House, said: \u201cIn Iowa I saw one of the most inferior ground games in politics. I have never seen anything so inept. He\u2019s not being served properly by his campaign.\u201d Vela, now an LGBTQ and Latino activist and board director at TransparentBusiness, added: \u201cHe had been the front runner for so long that I think the campaign staff became complacent. You got a sense they were so busy talking about electability and pitting him against Trump they forgot they have to deal with these 15 people first. You could see this rude awakening in Iowa as the night was slipping away.\u201d In New Hampshire, where Biden called a student a \u201clying dog faced pony soldier\u201d, he fared even worse. A comeback win in Nevada looks unlikely, setting up a potential last stand in South Carolina, the first contest in a state with a significant African American population \u2013 a constituency where he has consistently polled strongly. (Biden has been at pains to point out that 99% of the African American population have not yet had a say.) But even this advantage appears to have been eroded by Senator Bernie Sanders and billionaire Tom Steyer. Then comes Super Tuesday, where another billionaire, Michael Bloomberg, has spent nearly $350m on ads focused on the 16 states and territories that vote, eating into Biden\u2019s support among moderates and African Americans. Several black members of Congress and city mayors have endorsed Bloomberg despite the discriminatory \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policy he supported as mayor of New York. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), said: \u201cBiden has lost half the black support that he had. It\u2019s bled off and is now largely with Mike Bloomberg. Some of it has gone to Bernie Sanders, a little bit maybe to Elizabeth Warren, none of it to Pete Buttigieg. So he\u2019s sitting there holding 22, 23% of the black vote now. Mike Bloomberg is behind them at what, 21? \u201cClearly whatever the decision-making process was that led them to run the first leg of this race the way they have has cost him dearly. They have to make up a lot of ground in a very short period of time. When you swing into Super Tuesday, you\u2019ve got to have bankroll.\u201d \u2018If you\u2019re saying you\u2019re a winner, you\u2019d better win\u2019 Is there still time to turn it around? Yes, but it will be an uphill struggle. Since 1972, no candidate from either party has finished below second in both Iowa and New Hampshire and won the nomination. Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who was an adviser to the Al Gore and John Kerry presidential campaigns, said: \u201cFor him to recover from this would be a political miracle unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in modern presidential politics. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible but it\u2019s unlikely and would fly in the face of all our knowledge of political history.\u201d Biden\u2019s main pitch had been that in this moment of national emergency, he was the steady hand best placed to prevent Trump winning a second term. To centrists, he would be less of a gamble than progressives Sanders or Warren. But after the heavy losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, he is caught in his own electability trap. Shrum, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cThe centrepiece of the campaign was, \u2018I\u2019m going to beat Trump like a drum\u2019. The public said, \u2018If you\u2019re saying you\u2019re a winner, you\u2019d better win\u2019.\u201d \u201cAl Gore had this line: elections are not a reward for past performance. I think they are always about the future, not just the past. In Democratic primaries, you\u2019ve got to have a future offer to people, no matter how dissatisfied they are with the Republican incumbent. Joe Biden has a lot of policies on his website but that\u2019s not what comes over on the debate stage.\u201d In a small but telling measure of a campaign in a downward spiral, Biden\u2019s press team did not respond to multiple phone and email requests from the Guardian seeking comment. The Trump, Bloomberg and other campaigns are generally far more responsive. Shrum added: \u201cI suspect they have many pressures and I have nothing but sympathy for the candidate and the people around him. It\u2019s hard to start at the top of the mountain and end up in the valley.\u201d Biden\u2019s struggles have dismayed supporters in his home state, where he remains immensely popular. Coby Owens, a local civil rights activist whose family has known Biden for years, and who is still trying to decide between Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, said: \u201cThere are a lot of people who are shocked and concerned about it and want to know what\u2019s going on. \u201cThey have been hearing the message that he\u2019s the most electable so they thought he was going to cruise through the first two states, which are predominantly white. There\u2019s still a lot of room left for him to recover but if he\u2019s not willing to restructure his campaign, I don\u2019t think he can bounce back.\u201d \u2018Telltale signs\u2019 Biden has frequently referenced his partnership with Obama but America\u2019s first black president has remained notably silent. Obama reportedly discouraged Biden from running in 2016 because he believed Hillary Clinton had a better chance of winning. This time, rumour has it that he nudged Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, to make a late bid because again he was dubious about Biden\u2019s viability (Patrick dropped out after a poor showing in New Hampshire). Steele, the ex-RNC chairman and former lieutenant-governor of Maryland, commented: \u201cThe telltale signs were there: the lack of interest that Barack had in the Biden campaign, the fact that the word on the street was that Deval Patrick was in the race was because Obama encouraged him to get in the race. Why would you do that with your vice-president already in the game?\u201d While cautious about writing Biden off just yet, Steele added: \u201cFor me, just watching the Biden campaign, I get the sense that he\u2019s kind of walked through it. I think he\u2019s going through the paces of it. I\u2019m not convinced at this stage that he really wants it any more. I don\u2019t think you take the front runner status that he\u2019s held for over a year, anchored by 50% of the black vote in a party where that is a very important and huge demographic edge, and just leave it on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a candidate do that the way it\u2019s been done. Maybe there\u2019s a little bit of hubris and you assume that you\u2019ve got the weight to throw around to win this thing. But then again, at the same time, I think at a certain point the gas is out of the tank and you just sleepwalk your way through it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In 2011, in what seemed like a laying to rest of the mad ghosts of Anglo-Irish history, the Queen was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/19/queen-ireland-visit-respect-adams\" title=\"\">cheered</a> to the rafters in Dublin.</p> <p>But the building in which this celebration of amity took place had its own rather haunting presence. It was the spanking new Convention Centre, a glamorous, ultra-modern monument to the optimism of the Celtic Tiger years. By the time of the Queen\u2019s visit, it looked out on a landscape of shattered dreams. From the top floor, you had a panoramic view of abandoned building sites on the other side of the Liffey, testaments to the folly that created a spectacular banking crisis, vicious austerity and deep disillusion with the political system that had brought such pain.</p> <p>If you stand there now, what is most striking is not what you see but what you don\u2019t see: those jagged gaps that less than a decade ago made Dublin\u2019s docklands look like a mouthful of broken teeth. Nearly all the holes have been filled in by headquarters of multinational companies and the lawyers and bankers who serve them.</p> <p>The Irish economy is overflowing again, this time on a wave of outside investment. In 2018 alone, foreign direct investment into Ireland <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/fdi-into-ireland-rose-by-52-last-year-ey-1.3914260\" title=\"\">rose by 52%</a>. (It <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f220bea4-860e-11e9-97ea-05ac2431f453\" title=\"\">fell by 13%</a> in the UK and these two figures are probably not unrelated either to each other or to Brexit.)</p> <p>One can question how much of this is sustainable and about how much of it is just vast multinationals moving money around to take advantage of Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporation tax rate. But right now a lot of it is real and visible and not just in Dublin. <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/employment-passes-2-3m-people-for-first-time-1.4088132\" title=\"\">Employment has risen</a> for 29 consecutive quarters since 2013 and is now higher than it was before the crash. Ireland again looks like a big winner in the game of economic globalisation. Which prompts the obvious question: how come an angry electorate has just thrown out the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/sinn-fein-declares-victory-irish-general-election\" title=\"\">given the largest single share</a> of a very fragmented popular vote to a party that was once a pariah, Sinn F\u00e9in?

      "bodyText": "In 2011, in what seemed like a laying to rest of the mad ghosts of Anglo-Irish history, the Queen was cheered to the rafters in Dublin. But the building in which this celebration of amity took place had its own rather haunting presence. It was the spanking new Convention Centre, a glamorous, ultra-modern monument to the optimism of the Celtic Tiger years. By the time of the Queen\u2019s visit, it looked out on a landscape of shattered dreams. From the top floor, you had a panoramic view of abandoned building sites on the other side of the Liffey, testaments to the folly that created a spectacular banking crisis, vicious austerity and deep disillusion with the political system that had brought such pain. If you stand there now, what is most striking is not what you see but what you don\u2019t see: those jagged gaps that less than a decade ago made Dublin\u2019s docklands look like a mouthful of broken teeth. Nearly all the holes have been filled in by headquarters of multinational companies and the lawyers and bankers who serve them. The Irish economy is overflowing again, this time on a wave of outside investment. In 2018 alone, foreign direct investment into Ireland rose by 52%. (It fell by 13% in the UK and these two figures are probably not unrelated either to each other or to Brexit.) One can question how much of this is sustainable and about how much of it is just vast multinationals moving money around to take advantage of Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporation tax rate. But right now a lot of it is real and visible and not just in Dublin. Employment has risen for 29 consecutive quarters since 2013 and is now higher than it was before the crash. Ireland again looks like a big winner in the game of economic globalisation. Which prompts the obvious question: how come an angry electorate has just thrown out the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and given the largest single share of a very fragmented popular vote to a party that was once a pariah, Sinn F\u00e9in? To get to grips with this seeming contradiction is not just to comprehend contemporary Ireland, it is to grasp something important about globalisation itself. When we think about the rise of nationalism and populism from the US and Britain to Brazil and India, we usually talk about the people who are losing out: the rage of those \u201cleft behind\u201d by the globalising forces. And if you were looking from the outside at what has just happened, you would quite reasonably assume that Ireland, which has seemed relatively immune, has just succumbed to the same virus. Sinn F\u00e9in, after all, is rooted in the extreme, violent nationalism of the IRA and one of its jubilant election winners even celebrated by shouting \u201cUp the \u2019Ra\u201d. But this perception is wrong, for two big reasons. First, nationalism had relatively little to do with the Sinn F\u00e9in surge. Second, and more intriguingly, the anti-establishment rage that drove voters towards Sinn F\u00e9in, the Greens, the Social Democrats and almost anyone except the parties that have run the state for almost a century, is not a reaction against the failure of globalisation.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese professor Xu Zhangrun, who published a rare public critique of President Xi Jinping over China\u2019s coronavirus crisis, was placed under house arrest for days, barred from social media and is now cut off from the internet, his friends have told the Guardian. Xu\u2019s passionate attack on the government\u2019s system of controls and censorship, Viral Alarm: When Fury Overcomes Fear, was published this month \u2013 a rare, bold expression of dissent from the liberal camp under Xi\u2019s rule. A friend of Xu\u2019s who spoke on Sunday on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals said police placed Xu under house arrest soon after he returned to Beijing from his lunar new year break at his home town in Anhui province. \u201cThey confined him at home under the pretext that he had to be quarantined after the trip,\u201d the friend said. \u201cHe was in fact under de facto house arrest and his movements were restricted.\u201d During those days, at least two people stood guard in front of his house around the clock and a car with a signal box was parked in front of his residence. Security agents also went into his house to issue warnings to him, the friend said. Those restrictions were lifted late last week, but his internet connection has been cut off since Friday, the friend added. \u201cHe tried to get it mended but found out that his IP [internet protocol address] has been blocked. He lives on the outskirts of Beijing and is far away from shops and other services. Under the current [coronavirus] situation, things are very difficult for him.\u201d Friends say that since publication, Xu\u2019s account has been suspended on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, and many have been unable to get in touch with him for days. His name has been scrubbed from Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog, with only articles from official websites several years ago showing up on the country\u2019s biggest search engine, Baidu. Calls to his mobile phone went unanswered on Sunday. Phone calls to the Ministry of Public Security also went unanswered on Sunday. The staff member who answered the phone at Changping branch of Beijing Public Security Bureau said she had no knowledge of Xu. Another friend who also spoke on the condition of anonymity had managed to correspond with him through text messages but said his situation was worrying. \u201cI fear he might be under surveillance,\u201d said this friend. \u201cHe has not directly responded (to my queries) but just told me not to worry.\u201d When Xu published his essay, he warned that he was likely to be punished. He said he had already been suspended from teaching and had \u201cfreedoms curtailed\u201d over critiques published nearly a year earlier. \u201cI can now all too easily predict that I will be subjected to new punishments; indeed, this may well even be the last piece I write,\u201d he wrote at the end of his latest essay. Xu\u2019s criticism of the country\u2019s leadership came shortly before a widespread debate on freedom of speech convulsed the country. The death on 7 February of whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who had tried to warn colleagues about the virus but was reprimanded and silenced by security forces, triggered an outpouring of grief and anger and an unusual public discussion about censorship. \u201cLi\u2019s death has thoroughly exposed the ills of the party\u2019s governance and control; this has a huge impact on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Hong Zhenkuai, an independent historian who is currently working outside China, as a visiting scholar at Tokyo University. The mechanisms that normally constrain Chinese journalists have also eased slightly, with some of the most powerful stories about life in quarantined Wuhan and the latest news about the evolution of the outbreak coming from mainland newsrooms like that of magazine Caixin. But public anger over censorship, and the particular circumstances of a national emergency, should not be mistaken for any fundamental change within the Chinese Communist party, which has been honing its ability to control the national conversation for decades, activists and intellectuals say. In a further reminder of the government\u2019s strict controls, two citizen journalists who were reporting from the epicentre of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak have vanished this week, apparently detained. The Chinese military surgeon who exposed the government\u2019s cover-up of the Sars outbreak in 2002-2003 has been under de facto house arrest since last year, the Guardian revealed this month. Detention came after he wrote to the top leadership asking for a reassessment of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. \u201cThere is no space for speech freedom in China now,\u201d said Hong. \u201cThe impacts on the individuals are multi-faceted. Economically, they would cut off your livelihood [academics get fired, writers can\u2019t publish and no one dares hire you]. You would get sidelined by mainstream society, you\u2019d lose friends and, worse than that, you might lose your personal freedoms, so a number of intellectual elites have chosen to leave China.\u201d Since he took power in late 2012, Xi has tightened ideological control and suppressed civil freedoms across the nation, reversing a trend under his predecessor to give Chinese media some limited scope to expose and report regional corruption and lower-level officials\u2019 misdeeds. Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership. Under Xi\u2019s crackdown on speech and academic freedoms, a number of prominent liberal intellectuals, journalists, rights lawyers and NGO workers have either been silenced, jailed or escaped abroad.",

Drugs sold as MDMA or ecstasy turned out to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/26/woman-18-dies-suspected-drug-overdose-leeds\" title=\"\">n-ethylpentylone</a>, which has been linked to overdose deaths, while a substance purporting to be ketamine was found to be a new psychoactive substance with the chemical name 2-FDCK, a synthetic drug that is about one-and-a-half times more powerful and whose effects lasts for up to three times as long as ketamine.</p> <p>A small number of submitted samples were associated with \u201cproblem drug-use\u201d, including heroin containing paracetemol and caffeine, and a synthetic version of cannabis.</p> <p>\u201cThe core problem is supply and demand,\u201d said Prof Fiona Measham, chair in criminology at the University of Liverpool, and director of harm reduction charity The Loop, which <a href=\"https://wearetheloop.org\" title=\"\">conducted the tests</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAs demand for drugs is as buoyant as ever, we see increasingly innovative attempts to meet that demand, with drug users vulnerable to the sophisticated operations of organised crime. Testing bypasses the central problem here, which is that users cannot be sure what they\u2019ve bought in terms of content or strength.\u201d</p> <p>As a result of the testing, which took place in several venues, including a church, The Loop was able to warn users about problem drugs in circulation via social media.</p> <p>\u201cIdentifying a ketamine analogue for the first time in a small city like Durham, with several of the dealers having missold it as ketamine, illustrates both the extent to which new psychoactive substances are being missold as established drugs on the streets of Britain and also how street dealers themselves can be vulnerable to misselling by suppliers higher up the chain,\u201d Measham said.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the users had already tried the substance and knew something wasn\u2019t quite right with it but didn\u2019t know what. None of us \u2013 the students, the dealers or the testing team \u2013 expected it to be this new ketamine analogue though. It makes me wonder what else is in circulation that could be causing harm to people all across the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Drug-related deaths in Britain<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49357077\"> are at record levels</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoninginenglandandwales/2018registrations#things-you-need-to-know-about-this-release\">the most recent official figures </a>showing that 2,917 deaths from illicit drugs were recorded in England and Wales in 2018, an annual rise of 17% .</p> <p>Drug-safety testing originated in California in the 1960s and spread across Europe in the late 1980s. Both the Swiss and New Zealand governments are funding national evaluations, with a Europe-wide evaluation also planned.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the distinct values of drug-safety testing is that we ask people what they think they have bought then test it and find out what they have actually bought,\u201d Measham said. \u201cIn this way we are gradually building a much better understanding of how illegal drug markets operate in the UK, including the extent of misselling and adulteration in markets. For example, we now know that festival dealers are twice as likely to missell substances as neighbourhood dealers, through our festival testing. Community-based testing like these pilots allows us to get a better understanding of that misselling within different city centre drug-markets too. This can then alert drug-users and emergency services in the short term and also inform healthcare services in the long term.\u201dThree in 10 drug users intend to take smaller doses in future after receiving the results of the drug testing and speaking to a healthcare professional; a third will be more careful about polydrug use; and one in 10 will dispose of further substances in their possession.</p> <p>Steve Rolles, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said: \u201cAs drug-related deaths reach new records, it\u2019s clear that putting our heads in the sand and wishing the problem would go away isn\u2019t good enough. We know that drug-safety testing works. It\u2019s time the government showed some long-absent leadership and got fully behind it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 February 2020 to clarify that the 17% figure for illicit drug deaths was an annual increase.</p>",

Testing bypasses the central problem here, which is that users cannot be sure what they\u2019ve bought in terms of content or strength.\u201d As a result of the testing, which took place in several venues, including a church, The Loop was able to warn users about problem drugs in circulation via social media. \u201cIdentifying a ketamine analogue for the first time in a small city like Durham, with several of the dealers having missold it as ketamine, illustrates both the extent to which new psychoactive substances are being missold as established drugs on the streets of Britain and also how street dealers themselves can be vulnerable to misselling by suppliers higher up the chain,\u201d Measham said. \u201cSome of the users had already tried the substance and knew something wasn\u2019t quite right with it but didn\u2019t know what. None of us \u2013 the students, the dealers or the testing team \u2013 expected it to be this new ketamine analogue though. It makes me wonder what else is in circulation that could be causing harm to people all across the UK.\u201d Drug-related deaths in Britain are at record levels, with the most recent official figures showing that 2,917 deaths from illicit drugs were recorded in England and Wales in 2018, an annual rise of 17% . Drug-safety testing originated in California in the 1960s and spread across Europe in the late 1980s. Both the Swiss and New Zealand governments are funding national evaluations, with a Europe-wide evaluation also planned. \u201cOne of the distinct values of drug-safety testing is that we ask people what they think they have bought then test it and find out what they have actually bought,\u201d Measham said. \u201cIn this way we are gradually building a much better understanding of how illegal drug markets operate in the UK, including the extent of misselling and adulteration in markets. For example, we now know that festival dealers are twice as likely to missell substances as neighbourhood dealers, through our festival testing. Community-based testing like these pilots allows us to get a better understanding of that misselling within different city centre drug-markets too. This can then alert drug-users and emergency services in the short term and also inform healthcare services in the long term.\u201dThree in 10 drug users intend to take smaller doses in future after receiving the results of the drug testing and speaking to a healthcare professional; a third will be more careful about polydrug use; and one in 10 will dispose of further substances in their possession. Steve Rolles, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said: \u201cAs drug-related deaths reach new records, it\u2019s clear that putting our heads in the sand and wishing the problem would go away isn\u2019t good enough. We know that drug-safety testing works. It\u2019s time the government showed some long-absent leadership and got fully behind it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 February 2020 to clarify that the 17% figure for illicit drug deaths was an annual increase.",

That\u2019s what stays in the memory after lunch at <a href=\"https://thegallivant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Gallivant</a>, a small hotel and restaurant by Camber Sands in Rye. Lots of sunshine. It\u2019s not simply that the sun is literally shining when the taxi drops us there, although it is \u2013 a pale, milky sunlight of the sort you find close to the sea in winter. It is the whitewashed dining room itself, with its slat-board panelling and, framed under glass, myriad swimsuits attesting to the glorious variety of the human form. There are rubber plants and blond wood floorboards.</p> <p>Last week, at the Seabird, high above London\u2019s Blackfriars Road, a similar design felt like an affectation, one seemingly conceived by someone who had only ever seen a child\u2019s drawing of a beach house, perhaps while coming round from an anaesthetic. Obviously, the Gallivant is no less thought out. The current dining room is a new addition from 2018. A mood board was probably involved. It may have come complete with shots of tousle-haired blond children in sand dunes, of the sort Boden likes to use to flog its wrap dresses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9674fb8a8105563c16dffc1fcc7f44df6ab20040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9674fb8a8105563c16dffc1fcc7f44df6ab20040/0_166_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lamb chops on a plate with crisped fat, slightly pink meat pink and bright green sauce dotted across\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Curled up on themselves like edible commas, the fat is crisped, the meat pink\u2019: lamb chops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its low-key way it\u2019s all gloriously aspirational. A yoga class is finishing up in the space behind the dining room as we arrive. I feel virtuous merely for walking past it. Later, I leave the Gallivant certain I want to be the me in that dining room all the time. I think it works because here there really is an embarrassment of beach. It\u2019s one we never see because we are far too interested in our lunch \u2013 a succession of rugged, big-thighed dishes, the appeal of which often disguises the care that has gone into them.</p> <p>On my computer I have a file listing restaurants I should consider for review; places I think will both show me a good time and give me something to write about. Some go on the list and come off again within weeks, because I\u2019ve dived in at the first opportunity. Others are there so long they\u2019ve closed before I\u2019ve got anywhere near them. And then there are places like the Gallivant that have been staring at me literally for years. New chefs have come and gone and I\u2019ve never quite made it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28038de46a1a5fc22f6e3878fc91f0a8ac72dd2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28038de46a1a5fc22f6e3878fc91f0a8ac72dd2b/660_565_4122_2473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A round white plate with a blue rim with an oval of hispi cabbage on it and a herby butter sauce on top\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Grilled and drenched with a mussel butter\u2019: hispi cabbage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Late last year they announced the appointment of another chef, Jamie Guy, formerly group head chef for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/mark-hix\" title=\"\">Mark Hix</a>. At last, with cause to be in Rye, I had a good reason to visit. I\u2019m glad I did. Guy\u2019s cooking carries the fat thumb print of his time with Hix. It\u2019s unfussy and extremely satisfying. Behold: whelk fritters. Whelks have an image problem. They sound less like food than something you need to get lasered off an intimate area. As in, sotto voce: \u201cI\u2019ve just had my whelks removed.\u201d They often have a chewability problem, too, courtesy of over-cooking. It\u2019s why we send most of ours to Korea. They know how to treat them well. Here, the umami-tastic molluscs are chopped up, mixed in with a batter and deep fried. Alongside is a coarse-chopped tartare sauce. It\u2019s a very good start.</p> <p>Guy has a smart way of using seafood as a flavouring. Half a hispi cabbage is grilled and drenched with a mussel butter, which sounds like a cheery thing to do to almost any ingredient. There\u2019s a crumb of crisped bacon across the top. It\u2019s a humble hispi in a bespoke suit.

      "bodyText": "The Gallivant, Camber, East Sussex TN31 7RB (01797 225 057). Small plates \u00a36-\u00a38, mains \u00a314-\u00a332.50, desserts \u00a37-\u00a38, and wines from \u00a324 Sunshine. That\u2019s what stays in the memory after lunch at the Gallivant, a small hotel and restaurant by Camber Sands in Rye. Lots of sunshine. It\u2019s not simply that the sun is literally shining when the taxi drops us there, although it is \u2013 a pale, milky sunlight of the sort you find close to the sea in winter. It is the whitewashed dining room itself, with its slat-board panelling and, framed under glass, myriad swimsuits attesting to the glorious variety of the human form. There are rubber plants and blond wood floorboards. Last week, at the Seabird, high above London\u2019s Blackfriars Road, a similar design felt like an affectation, one seemingly conceived by someone who had only ever seen a child\u2019s drawing of a beach house, perhaps while coming round from an anaesthetic. Obviously, the Gallivant is no less thought out. The current dining room is a new addition from 2018. A mood board was probably involved. It may have come complete with shots of tousle-haired blond children in sand dunes, of the sort Boden likes to use to flog its wrap dresses. In its low-key way it\u2019s all gloriously aspirational. A yoga class is finishing up in the space behind the dining room as we arrive. I feel virtuous merely for walking past it. Later, I leave the Gallivant certain I want to be the me in that dining room all the time. I think it works because here there really is an embarrassment of beach. It\u2019s one we never see because we are far too interested in our lunch \u2013 a succession of rugged, big-thighed dishes, the appeal of which often disguises the care that has gone into them. On my computer I have a file listing restaurants I should consider for review; places I think will both show me a good time and give me something to write about. Some go on the list and come off again within weeks, because I\u2019ve dived in at the first opportunity. Others are there so long they\u2019ve closed before I\u2019ve got anywhere near them. And then there are places like the Gallivant that have been staring at me literally for years. New chefs have come and gone and I\u2019ve never quite made it. Late last year they announced the appointment of another chef, Jamie Guy, formerly group head chef for Mark Hix. At last, with cause to be in Rye, I had a good reason to visit. I\u2019m glad I did. Guy\u2019s cooking carries the fat thumb print of his time with Hix. It\u2019s unfussy and extremely satisfying. Behold: whelk fritters. Whelks have an image problem. They sound less like food than something you need to get lasered off an intimate area. As in, sotto voce: \u201cI\u2019ve just had my whelks removed.\u201d They often have a chewability problem, too, courtesy of over-cooking. It\u2019s why we send most of ours to Korea. They know how to treat them well. Here, the umami-tastic molluscs are chopped up, mixed in with a batter and deep fried. Alongside is a coarse-chopped tartare sauce. It\u2019s a very good start. Guy has a smart way of using seafood as a flavouring. Half a hispi cabbage is grilled and drenched with a mussel butter, which sounds like a cheery thing to do to almost any ingredient. There\u2019s a crumb of crisped bacon across the top. It\u2019s a humble hispi in a bespoke suit. Jerusalem artichokes are roasted until almost toffee-like and laid across a thick surf of whipped goat\u2019s cheese with the funky farmyard whiff that only goaty things can deliver. Both plates are \u00a37. The main course menu is dominated by choices cooked on an open wood fire. The eye-rolling cynic in me wants to whine about how the industrial revolution was actually a great idea when it comes to the drudgery of cookery; how I love electric ovens and gas rings because they\u2019re so easy to control, and do we all really want to retreat into playing fantasy caveman by burning twigs?

The New York Times\u2019 financial editor follows the money, plows through paper and talks to dozens of people in the bank\u2019s ecosystem. There are names, places and computer files. This is a first-rate read.</p> <p>Dark Towers traces the bank\u2019s arc from founding through the second world war to the present, excavates and analyzes Trump\u2019s relationship with his lender of last resort, and lays out the ties that bind Justin Kennedy, son of retired supreme court justice Anthony Kennedy, to the Trump family.

Broeksmit witnessed the bank\u2019s growth, decline and brushes with the law. His death imparts to Enrich\u2019s book an air of mystery, crystalizing Deutsche\u2019s descent and woes. The bank weighed on Broeksmit to the end.</p> <p>He left an electronic paper trail. Val Broeksmit, his troubled son, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/business/val-broeksmit-deutsche-bank-trump-whistle-blower.html\">found</a> \u201cdetailed information about what was going on deep inside the bank\u201d.</p> <p>According to Enrich, there \u201cwere minutes of board meetings. Financial plans. Indecipherable spreadsheets. Password-protected presentations.

Also in 2014, Charlie Gambino, an in-house bank lawyer, hanged himself at his home in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. At the time, Gambino was attempting to navigate Deutsche through its Libor rate-fixing nightmare.</p> <p>This past November, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/magazine/deutsche-bank-trump.html\">Tom Bowers</a>, a banker who worked on Trump\u2019s account, killed himself. Bowers was an Enrich source with firsthand knowledge of the bank\u2019s $640m loan on Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, Chicago.</p> <p>Deutsche and its subsidiaries have faced an <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/deutsche-banks-5-biggest-scandals/a-46510219\">array</a> of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/case/dbgroupservices-n-deutschebankag/update\">criminal</a> and civil charges in the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-95-million-recovery-deutsche-bank-fraudulent-conveyance\">US</a> and UK. <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/deutsche-bank-fined-425-million-over-suspicious-russia-trades/a-37343153\">Money laundering</a>, Russia and rate-fixing played outsized roles. After the Guardian reported on Dark Towers, Deutsche issued a semi-oblique confession: \u201cWhile elements of the narrative seem to be exaggerated to fit into a storyline, we have long acknowledged and sought to learn from our historical shortcomings.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After learning that the special counsel had subpoenaed Deutsche\u2019s records, Trump reportedly wanted Robert Mueller fired</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Going back in time, Deutsche was formed in 1870. It financed German industry. Think regional, not global.

Among other things, the nexus between Deutsche, Trump and VTB, a Kremlin-favored bank, left House Democrats and Enrich puzzled.

Executives denied such ties, Trump Moscow was not built and the redacted Mueller report lacks any mention of Deutsche even as it contains multiple references to VTB.

      "bodyText": "Steve Bannon, the brains behind Donald Trump\u2019s upset election victory, saw the danger posed by the cash cravings of the First Family. In Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff chronicled Bannon drawing a direct line between purported dark doings at Deutsche Bank and Jared Kushner\u2019s brushes with the Mueller investigation: \u201cThis is all about money laundering \u2026 It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit.\u201d But that\u2019s only half the story. Late last year, a federal appeals court sustained subpoenas issued by congressional committees to the German bank for Trump\u2019s financial records. Come June, the supreme court will probably rule on the enforceability of those demands together with other cases concerning Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2013 just in time for political convention season. In other words, Deutsche remains relevant to the 2020 elections. In Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction, David Enrich delivers a master class in financial sleuthing. The New York Times\u2019 financial editor follows the money, plows through paper and talks to dozens of people in the bank\u2019s ecosystem. There are names, places and computer files. This is a first-rate read. Dark Towers traces the bank\u2019s arc from founding through the second world war to the present, excavates and analyzes Trump\u2019s relationship with his lender of last resort, and lays out the ties that bind Justin Kennedy, son of retired supreme court justice Anthony Kennedy, to the Trump family. In case anyone forgot, Brett Kavanaugh clerked for Kennedy p\u00e8re, who interceded with Trump on Kavanaugh\u2019s behalf. Like a discordant melody that haunts disturbing lyrics, Dark Towers is woven with the life and the 2014 suicide of Bill Broeksmit, a former Deutsche executive. Broeksmit witnessed the bank\u2019s growth, decline and brushes with the law. His death imparts to Enrich\u2019s book an air of mystery, crystalizing Deutsche\u2019s descent and woes. The bank weighed on Broeksmit to the end. He left an electronic paper trail. Val Broeksmit, his troubled son, found \u201cdetailed information about what was going on deep inside the bank\u201d. According to Enrich, there \u201cwere minutes of board meetings. Financial plans. Indecipherable spreadsheets. Password-protected presentations. And evidence of his father\u2019s misery.\u201d In one email, the elder Broeksmit wrote: \u201cHard to know how banks keep track of the hundreds of billions of dollars flowing through their pipes every day.\u201d Sadly, Broeksmit\u2019s death is not the only notable Deutsche suicide. Also in 2014, Charlie Gambino, an in-house bank lawyer, hanged himself at his home in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. At the time, Gambino was attempting to navigate Deutsche through its Libor rate-fixing nightmare. This past November, Tom Bowers, a banker who worked on Trump\u2019s account, killed himself. Bowers was an Enrich source with firsthand knowledge of the bank\u2019s $640m loan on Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, Chicago. Deutsche and its subsidiaries have faced an array of criminal and civil charges in the US and UK. Money laundering, Russia and rate-fixing played outsized roles. After the Guardian reported on Dark Towers, Deutsche issued a semi-oblique confession: \u201cWhile elements of the narrative seem to be exaggerated to fit into a storyline, we have long acknowledged and sought to learn from our historical shortcomings.\u201d Going back in time, Deutsche was formed in 1870. It financed German industry. Think regional, not global. Along the way, it found the time to bankroll the Nazis and provide construction finance for Auschwitz. With the fall of the Soviet Union it looked east \u2013 as would the 45th president \u2013 for new markets and opportunities. Among other things, the nexus between Deutsche, Trump and VTB, a Kremlin-favored bank, left House Democrats and Enrich puzzled. The author posits: \u201cPerhaps this was more than a coincidence.\u201d According to the Mueller report, in the midst of Trump\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination Felix Sater, a Trump crony and former convict, repeatedly attempted to arrange for Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s now-imprisoned personal lawyer, and \u201ccandidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump Organization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing partners\u201d. In a 19 December 2015 email, Sater wrote: \u201cInvitations &amp; Visas will be issued this week by VTB Bank to discuss financing for Trump Tower Moscow. Politically neither Putin\u2019s office nor Ministry of Foreign Affairs [can] issue invite, so they are inviting commercially/business.\u201d Dark Towers provides no conclusive evidence that Trump\u2019s funding originated in Russia. Executives denied such ties, Trump Moscow was not built and the redacted Mueller report lacks any mention of Deutsche even as it contains multiple references to VTB. Then again, in December 2017, after learning that the special counsel had subpoenaed Deutsche\u2019s records, Trump reportedly wanted Mueller fired. It would be generous to say that when it comes to Trump, where the truth lies is a mystery. Throughout the impeachment proceedings, Trump denied he had dispatched Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to dig for dirt on the Biden family. After acquittal by the Senate, the president admitted it to Geraldo Rivera. As for Trump\u2019s bet on Kennedy and Kavanaugh, it appears to have paid off. In last summer\u2019s much-awaited census case, Kavanaugh voted that the commerce department decision to add a \u201ccitizenship\u201d question was subject to only minimal judicial review. The fact that the government had been less than forthcoming failed to sway either of Trump\u2019s appointees to the highest court.

      "bodyText": "Labor is accusing the government of shortchanging rural areas through a $150m sports fund that was overwhelmingly spent in marginal seats during the election campaign. The $150m female facilities and water safety stream program, announced by the Coalition less than two months before the election, was funded in the 2019 budget for the purpose of female change rooms and swimming pool upgrades, but was all allocated in the election campaign. An incoming government brief obtained by the Labor party through freedom of information laws shows that the fund was supposed to be targeted at regional and remote communities. It was included in the budget under the regional development funding stream, but less than $10m of the $150m fund was allocated to projects in rural electorates, with just four electorates held by Nationals MPs successfully securing funds. Projects in Liberal-held, non-rural seats got nearly $110m of the total four-year fund, with the key marginal seats of Pearce and Corangamite securing almost 40% of the total funding pool. On Sunday, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the Nationals had been \u201cdudded\u201d by the fund, which the opposition has called \u201csports rorts on steroids\u201d. \u201cYou have a $150m fund that was just siphoned off, siphoned off at 40% of it in two electorates \u2026 for essentially electioneering based upon marginal seats,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe problem with this government isn\u2019t just that it is obsessed with fighting each other, fights between the Liberal and National parties, fights within the Liberal party, fights within the National party. The real problem is that it\u2019s distracting them from actually governing the country, being concerned about the issues that are the everyday concerns of the Australian people.\u201d When asked why more of the money meant for regional Australia was not spent in regional Australia, Nationals leader and deputy prime minister Michael McCormack defended the government. \u201cWell, regional Australia doesn\u2019t miss out under the Nationals being in government,\u201d McCormack told ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cOver a spread, you will see that regional Australia and metropolitan Australia all received fair and equitable funding when it comes to providing it,\u201d he said. He said that \u201cin future rounds\u201d regional Australia would get more than just 10%, despite the full $150m fund already being allocated. Labor is continuing to pressure the government over its handling of grant funding in the lead-up to the election after former Nationals deputy, Bridget McKenzie, was forced to resign after a scathing auditor general report found a $100m sports fund was used to target marginal seats. Last week, officials from the Australian National Audit Office gave evidence that some 43% of projects funded under the controversial program \u2013 290 in total \u2013 were ineligible when agreements were signed. The evidence from the ANAO to the Senate inquiry on Thursday contradicted a key defence of the program employed by Scott Morrison and the former sports minister, who had claimed that \u201cno ineligible projects\u201d were funded under the scheme.",

Creator Russell Lewis, ably assisted by Shaun Evans \u2013 who also directs now \u2013 as the star, and of course Roger Allam, has given us an entire new world. This three-parter \u2013 boo at only three \u2013 is, no matter that it\u2019s still gripping and evocative, faintly depressing, in that Fred Thursday (Allam) is essentially losing it. He\u2019s just worn down, his poisoned cup of the witnessing of man\u2019s toxicity having runneth over. And making lazy misthoughts, and is hardly an unending fountain of joy to stoic forgotten Win, who might just, in 1970, prove less stoic or forgotten than had been previously, fondly, imagined. It\u2019s all gone a little wrong on Walton\u2019s Mountain, Toto; mildewed even, as the decades segue. I unashamedly love Endeavour, to an inordinate extent. This is what it must feel like to \u201cbond\u201d with fictional characters on Coronation Street or, less explicably, Love Island. And even though just a three-parter \u2013 all parts self-contained; yet there\u2019s an unresolved thread throughout \u2013 this is still glorious, if gently dour. (A brief word to next year\u2019s Baftas: when might it be time to honour Anton Lesser with a half-lifetime achievement, not least for his radio work?) Harriet Walter, a \u201cnot bad\u201d actor in the same way Judy Garland could half carry a tune, excels, of course, in The End, a winning and subtle 10-part Aussie miniseries about suicide, euthanasia, depression, ennui and gender dysphoria, which manages, despite itself, to be life-affirming, revelatory, joyous even. Transported unwillingly by her daughter to Australia\u2019s Gold Coast after a laughably unsuccessful suicide attempt \u2013 bag over the head after drink taken, house catches fire accidentally, Edie wakes and vomits and sighs resignedly and hurtles out of a window \u2013 she\u2019s a snob among vulgars and finds herself in the hell of an Aussie retirement home. Here, the young and beautiful and toned patronise the old and broken and clever and having-lived. Edie adapts. As folk like Edie do. Daughter Frances O\u2019Connor, coping \u2013 just \u2013 with a transitioning child, a jailed husband and her profession as a doctor, is violently opposed to any idea of euthanasia or suicide. She has to say things such as \u201cI\u2019ve seen people, they often grow at the end, it can be a special time\u2026\u201d Hence the stage is set for a staunch war of wills between daughter and suicidal mother: yet it\u2019s so much more than that. Little less than an exploration of life\u2019s vicissitudes, and what children can teach us, and also what the broken old can teach us, and also of the narcissism of diaries. Also, if you allow it, quietly and deeply funny. There are some savage jokes, and some gentle ones, and many savagely gentle. A beaut. A welcome return for Abi Morgan\u2019s The Split, even though the first episode of series two might fall foul of those too willing to decry it as too huggily privileged middle-class. As it boulders on, apace, at least two things become crystal clear. The fact that Nicola Walker is one of those astonishing actors who can act without seeming, ever, to act. And the fact that all their problems, despite taking place within the surround of a relatively high-flying family law firm, are problems just of love, of longing, of loneliness-with-money, of perennial dissatisfaction. There\u2019s also a great series-long turn from Donna Air as a beautiful and successful TV presenter, controlled and besmirched for long years by hubby. You will learn to twitch, too, at those ring-tones: as you will learn, it is to be hoped, at every social-media \u201cinnovation\u201d. I said it 15 years past, I will say it again: just because you can do it doesn\u2019t mean you should. In fact, you probably shouldn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "The first cohort of Australian evacuees are set to leave quarantine on Christmas Island on Monday, with no reported cases of the new coronavirus among the 277 Australian citizens and permanent residents held on the island. A government-chartered evacuation flight brought 241 Australians from Wuhan on 3 February, with another 36 arriving two days later, via a New Zealand government charter through Auckland, that left China on 5 February. All of those evacuated from Wuhan, where the Covid-19 disease first emerged, have been required to stay in quarantine, in the almost empty Christmas Island detention centre, for 14 days from the date of leaving mainland China. Inside the centre, evacuees have been kept isolated in small family or social groups, to limit the spread of any potential outbreak. Three possible cases of coronavirus have been tested among the cohort inside the detention centre. All have come back negative for the disease. Possible cases were isolated from all other evacuees inside the centre while tests were undertaken, but have since rejoined other evacuees. On Monday, three chartered flights were set to leave the remote island, returning all those from the first group home. Contrary to the federal government\u2019s earlier statements, Australians will not have to make their own way home from Perth \u2013 but will be flown to Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and other capital cities. Earlier this month, the government also backtracked on plans that evacuees would have to pay $1,000. The first flight from Christmas Island is scheduled to leave at 8am local time, with others following in two-hour increments, but all are subject to weather and delays. The first flight will take passengers to Port Hedland, then to Sydney and Canberra, arriving in Sydney and Canberra in the evening. The second flight will go to Adelaide and Melbourne, touching down in Victoria just before midnight, local time. The third will fly to Perth and then Brisbane. Australians who arrived in the second cohort to Christmas Island are also on track to leave on Wednesday morning. Prof Yan Zhang, an academic at Western Sydney University who was on the first evacuation flight from Wuhan, said he was \u201cvery excited\u201d to return home and see his wife and daughters. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to all staff from Ausmat [Australian Medical Assistance Teams], the Australian army and other departments for their kindness, caring and unconditional support during our 14-day quarantine period. \u201cI thank my wife and daughters \u2013 they talked to me every day to make sure I was OK here. I also thank my university colleagues and friends for their caring and support.\u201d Australian company AusDiagnostics, which is providing the testing equipment and kits for the medical teams inside the Christmas Island detention centre, said that the testing process has been \u201crelatively straightforward\u201d. After a phone call on the Friday before evacuees arrived, AusDiagnostics rapidly had equipment and testing kits shipped to Darwin, where it was flown to the island on a Hercules C-130 military aircraft. \u201cAs well, one of our staff members volunteered to travel with the equipment, and to go into quarantine, to help train the medical staff and assist with testing,\u201d managing director Prof Keith Stanley said. \u201cThat was a great act of service to the community.\u201d AusDiagnostics, based in Sydney but with offices around the world, developed a test for Covid-19 as soon as the virus was sequenced. The advantage of having testing equipment and kits on the island means that the results of a test for a suspected case can be returned within \u201cthree or four hours\u201d, Stanley told Guardian Australia, rather than samples having to be sent to a mainland hospital, where the turnaround might be two days. Faster results mean that isolation of suspected cases \u2013 within the quarantine facility \u2013 can be managed much more effectively. He said the test for the Covid-19 is \u201crelatively straightforward\u201d and \u201cmuch the same as a doctor would do for influenza in the winter\u201d. A swab is taken from a patient\u2019s nose or throat and then the nucleic acid from that sample is tested for the coronavirus, as well as other illnesses. \u201cOur process looks for specific sequences which are characteristic of a particular virus. We developed a test for this specific coronavirus, but our process also tests for the standard winter coronavirus, Mers, the Middle East coronavirus, and Sars.\u201d Stanley said the two key assessments of any new viral outbreak were infectivity and mortality. Covid-19 appeared to be \u201cquite infectious\u201d, Stanley said, meaning early triaging and quarantining of suspected patients was vital, but that the mortality rate was still not clear, though it has been posited at being about 2%, \u201cnothing like as bad as Sars and Mers\u201d. \u201cYes we need to have precautions such as quarantining, but most people who have this infection would only experience symptoms something like a common cold.\u201d",

It comes as China\u2019s National Health Commission announced the death toll inside the country had risen to 1,665, with 68,500 infections. The US embassy in Japan announced on Saturday that more than 400 US nationals would be flown home from the quarantined Diamond Princess, currently docked in the port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. The US embassy said in a letter to passengers that, based on the high number of confirmed coronavirus cases, passengers and crew members were considered to be \u201cat high risk of exposure\u201d. US charter flights are expected to arrive on Sunday. Hong Kong, which has 330 citizens on board, said it will offer nationals an evacuation flight. The Canadian government also confirmed late on Saturday that it had chartered a plane to bring it citizens who are passengers on the ship home. Canadian passengers who exhibit symptoms of the coronavirus infection will not be permitted to board the flight and will instead be transferred to the Japanese health care system to receive appropriate care, the government said. After arriving in Canada, the passengers will undergo a 14-day period of quarantine, the statement added. The Diamond Princess has been stuck in Japan after a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus. The Australian embassy in Tokyo emailed citizens aboard the cruise ship to say the federal government was also examining options to assist Australians. The embassy told citizens it understood it was a \u201cvery stressful\u201d situation for them and that Australian medical officers were working closely with Japanese authorities to support them. The British government has faced mounting pressure to evacuate its citizens, with one passenger, David Abel, who had been livestreaming from the ship, saying on Saturday that he had \u201cgiven up on anybody in the UK\u201d. Seventy new cases were confirmed on the cruise liner on Sunday according to Japan\u2019s minister of health, labor and welfare, Katsunobu Kato, taking the number of cases on the ship over 350. \u201cSo far, we have conducted tests for 1,219 individuals.

Passengers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, after measures were introduced to try to stop the spread of the disease onboard. The quarantine is due to end on Wednesday, though it is not clear if the emergence of new cases will prompt such restrictions to be extended. There is also growing concern over possible infections among people who disembarked from the MS Westerdam in Cambodia on Friday, after it was confirmed that one passenger, who later flew to Malaysia, tested positive for the virus. The 83-year-old woman flew from Cambodia to Malaysia with 144 others from the ship on Friday. The woman\u2019s husband tested negative for the disease, Malaysia\u2019s health ministry said. The ship\u2019s owner, Holland America, said: \u201cWhile the first results have been reported, they are preliminary at this point and we are awaiting secondary testing for confirmation.\u201d Cambodian authorities called on Malaysia to review its test results. The ship had been turned away by five countries, despite having no reported sickness on board at the time. Around 68,500 people in mainland China are now confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, and 1,665 people have died from Covid-19, China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Sunday. The figures included a further 142, in the 24-hours to midnight on Saturday, and a further 2,000 new confirmed cases. The daily total of new cases represented a drop for the third day in a row, but researchers have advised caution.

Most reports of the disease remain concentrated in Hubei, where the outbreak began, but cases have been confirmed across Asia, Australia, the US, Europe and, mostly recently, Africa. Four deaths have occurred outside mainland China \u2013 in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and France. France\u2019s health minister, Anges Buzyn, said: \u201cWe have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across France.\u201d Her comments followed the death of a 80-year-old Chinese man at a Paris hospital.

      "bodyText": "The Nationals leader Michael McCormack has declared he will lead the party to the next election, dismissing suggestions he will stand down within the next two years to ensure stability within the Coalition. McCormack, who has faced an uprising within the Nationals over his leadership style, said he maintained the full support of the prime minister and had been endorsed by a party room vote three times in the past two years. A report in the Weekend Australian suggested McCormack would stand aside before the next election to make way for his new deputy, David Littleproud, but McCormack said he had no intention of stepping down from the role. \u201cThe fact is, I\u2019m the leader and I\u2019m going to lead the Nationals to the next election,\u201d McCormack told ABC\u2019s Insiders program. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought it, I haven\u2019t said it, [stepping down] and I\u2019m not quite sure why it was written in that way. \u201cI have the prime minister\u2019s full support [and] I\u2019ve now put myself to the party room as a leader three times in less than two years, and three times in less than two years I\u2019ve been endorsed as the party\u2019s leader. That should be enough to draw a line under that discussion.\u201d He said that he was prepared to take the \u201cfree, frank and sometimes unfiltered\u201d advice of his colleagues, and would attempt to be a more \u201cinclusive\u201d leader. \u201cWhether that\u2019s me changing my leadership style a little bit, I think we all, every one of us in the national party room, needs to stop concentrating on ... self-indulgence,\u201d he said. McCormack also spoke stridently against the prospect of the government agreeing to a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 something prime minister Scott Morrison has told Australia\u2019s Pacific Island neighbours that the government would consider. \u201cI think if you go down that path, what you\u2019re going to do is send factories and industries offshore, send manufacturing jobs offshore,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the Australian way. Regional Australia is more than doing its fair share, its fair share as far as making sure that we have lower emissions.\u201d When asked if he accepted warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the emissions target was needed to limit global warming, McCormack said the \u201cIPCC is not governing Australia\u201d. \u201cThe Liberals and Nationals are \u2013 we took our climate policies, we took our emissions reduction policies to the election last May and we were re-elected. \u201cThe Australian people have spoken \u2013 we\u2019re not run by international organisations, we\u2019re run by Australians, we\u2019re run by Scott Morrison and we\u2019re run by myself. And we\u2019re run by the Liberals and Nationals. \u201cOf course you\u2019ve got to listen to the scientists but what you\u2019ve also got to do is listen to the workers. Listen to those workers who put on a high-vis vest and go and work, and work hard in a coalmine every day, those people in central and northern Queensland who rely on the resources sector for a job, for a future.\u201d He dismissed a call from Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman to adopt the target, after the MP for the seat of North Sydney told Guardian Australia that the government should work towards adopting a target of net zero emissions by 2050, joining other moderate MPs who are agitating internally for a more ambitious climate change policy. Higgins MP Katie Allen has also advocated for the net-zero carbon target as the ultimate ambition for the government. McCormack said: \u201cI\u2019m not the member for North Sydney and good luck to Trent Zimmerman.

O\u2019Brien, one of Barnaby Joyce\u2019s closest allies, was the MP who moved the spill motion against McCormack in the first week of the parliamentary year after months of internal rumblings over the leader\u2019s performance.

Ahead of a budget that is still scheduled for 11 March, economists at the finance ministry will want to assess the impact this will have on the public finances. The verdict is unlikely to be music to the ears of Rishi Sunak, now in place as chancellor after Sajid Javid, who balked at Boris Johnson\u2019s insistence he prefer No 10\u2019s advisers to his own, resigned. Sunak, a Yorkshire MP, is a keen supporter of \u201clevelling up\u201d the regions and needs to direct as much spare funds to the north and west as he can to boost growth.

This might seem like a bountiful turnaround, but it only pitches the high street back to a situation analysts describe as weak rather than calamitous. Last week the monthly British Retail Consortium/KPMG health check of the retail sector found that total sales rose by 0.4% in January, but a deeper look found sales were unchanged once increases in floor space were taken into account. The fall in wages and rise in inflation will put an unwelcome squeeze on real wages and consumer spending. The Treasury is only too well aware that consumer spending has propped up the economy for the last three years while business investment, hit badly by Brexit uncertainty, has all but evaporated. The chancellor will see from official figures and his own staff\u2019s forecasts that some areas of the economy are standing up well. Business confidence and consumer confidence have started to bounce back while exports, though they struggled last year to match a high point in 2018, are still strong.

But a slip in wages and an increase in inflation could hit VAT receipts, leaving the chancellor short of the firepower he wants to begin levelling up the regions. He needs extra cash for this project and a lacklustre economy might not provide it. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, says the need to increase spending, and faltering revenues, mean Sunak is expected to announce less restrictive borrowing rules \u201cand that government policy boosts the economy by more over the next few years than we had previously thought\u201d. She says the rule that forces the chancellor to balance day-to-day spending over a three-year cycle could be extended to five years. \u201cHe would have more leeway to splash the cash in the next few years and put off any fiscal tightening until after the next election in 2024,\u201d she says. A more radical option would be to drop the balanced-budget objective altogether and replace it with a rule that puts a cap on total public sector net borrowing, including investment. If he opted for a 4% or 5% cap \u2013 more than the 3% that EU countries must adopt \u2013 the government could borrow not just to finance investment spending but also to finance tax cuts. \u201cAs long as the government could stomach a rising debt ratio, then it could opt for a 4% or 5% limit,\u201d she says. Whatever fudge Sunak comes up with, Gregory says the budget will probably mark the start of the biggest fiscal boost seen since the financial crisis. \u201cWe had already anticipated a loosening worth 0.5% of GDP in the budget on top of the 0.5% already announced in the 2019 [Whitehall] spending round.
